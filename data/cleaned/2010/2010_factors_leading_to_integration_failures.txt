introduction a product feature is an important concept in software develo pment because it conveys attributes of a product relevant to all the stakeholders involved in the development process.
for example a customer might communi cate his her requirements for a particular product a s a c o l l e c t i o n o f c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o r f e a t u r e s t h e p r o d u c t ought to have or a software architect might make design decision s based on the collection of features that will be part of a product.
over the yea rs researchers and practitioners alike have articulated a number of benefits that could be garnered from adopting a feature driven development approach.
for instance f rom a technical point of view past work has argued that feature driven development enh ances development flexibility e.g.
facilitates fo rmal modeling of systems e.g.
and even leads to higher levels of quality e.g.
.
from a process perspective the concept of features is an integral part of the software product lines approach .
finally from an organizational perspective researc hers have ar gued that features represent very valuable entities that can facilitate coordination collaboration and overall governance of software projects .
despite the growing popularit y and adoption of feature driven software development we have very limited understanding as to how the technical attributes o f f e a t u r e s i m p a c t t r a d i t i o n a l d e v e lopment outcomes such as productivity and quality.
furthermore there are also a number of o rganizational parameters that are i nvolve d i n t h e u s a g e o f a f e a t u r e driven develop ment approach such as configuring feature teams and selecting feature owners.
the current state of the art on how those organizational aspects of feature oriented development impact outcomes such as development productivity or software quality consists mostly of anecdotal evidence .
in this paper we examine the impact that technical attributes o f product features attributes of the feature teams and cross feature interactions hav e on integration failures.
we collected data from a large scale global software development project that implemented features over a period of month s of activity.
our results show that t e c h n i c a l a n d o r g a n i z a t i o n a l f a c t o r s h a v e c o m p l e m e ntary impact suggesting their independent and important role in terms of software quality.
in particular we found that the level of technical coupling within features the concentration of that coupling across architectural components the geographic distribution of feature teams as well as the group membership of feature owners were important factors leading to integration failures.
furthermore our analyses revealed that cross feature interactions measured as the number of architectural dependencies between two prod uct features are a major driver of integration failures.
the rest of the document is organized as follows.
we first discuss past work and the research questions examined in this paper.
then we describe our research setting research des ign and r esults.
we conclude with a discussion of the contributions limit ations and future research directions.

integration failures in fe ature oriented development software quality has been the subject of a large bod y of past r esearch work a n d n u m e r o u s f a c t o r s that negatively impact software quality have been identified e.g.
.
a distinctive characteristic of that w o r k i s t h e f o c u s o n particular units of a software system such as files classes modules components or binaries a n d h o w t heir technical attributes and patterns of change impact their quality.
those s oftware ent ities represent tangible boundaries that support critical design pr inciples such as abstraction information hiding and in general modular design .
feature driven dev elopment introduces a distin ctive n e w e l e m e n t t h e p r o d u c t f e a t u r e w h i c h h a s c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s that differ from what we traditionally consider as a software e ntity e.g.
a file class module or component .
first product feature s like aspects tend to cut across those traditional software ent ities.
in so they define n e w t e c h n i c a l b o u n d a r i e s which might include for instance entire component s o r portion s o f them.
second those new boundaries tend to create a challenging tension between adequatel y designing and implementing the ne cessary functionality of the product features and the integ rity of the architectural components or modules involved or impacted by the various product features.
given the se differences between features and the traditional s o f t ware entities it is important to consider how the specific technical attributes of features such as the cha racteristics of architectural dependencies embedded in the feature impact software quality.
i n particular we are interested in sof tware qualit y o u t c o m e s in the context o f i n t e g r a ting the various parts that constitute a feature which is a critical process step in feature driven development.
this leads to the following research question rq1a what is the impact of technical attributes of a product feature on failures during the integration of that feature?
it is well established that software development invo lves not just a technical dimension but also a socio organizational one.
for e xample i ndividual level experience either technical or domain specific has been found to be an important factor leading to errors and failures in the development of software systems e.g.
.
configuration aspects of the development teams are also another important set of factors t h a t i m p a c t i m p o r t a n t s oftware development outcomes such as quality .
for instance the ge ographic dispersion of the team members e.g.
the chara cteristics of the leaders and manager as well as their leadersh ip styles the pattern s o f i n t e r a c t i o n on t a s k t r a c k i n g s ystems as well as the number of individuals involved in the development of a piece of software e.g.
impact software quality.
a key aspect of feature driven development is the establishment of feature teams to develop t h e n e c e s s a r y f e a t u r e s .
those teams tend to be short lived just for the duration of developing a feature and individuals tend to be members of multiple feature teams.
socio organizational factors s e e m l i k e l y t o play a major role in the quality outcomes of feature teams but given the su bstantial differences in development organized around feature teams as opposed to traditional teams it is difficult to know what attributes will have important effects.
this leads to the following research question rq1b what is the impact of organizational attributes of the feature team on failures during the integration of a product feature?
the previous paragraphs have considered technical an d organiz ational factors in the context of a single product feature.
howev er product features do no t exist in isolation.
they depend or interact with other product features.
a growing body of work has shown that cross feature s interaction s are a major challenge .
calder and colleagues a r g u e d t h a t c u r r e n t r e s e a r c h c h a l l e n g e s i n c l u d e understanding wher e potential interaction s arise how to determine that an interaction did in fact occur and how to resolve it .
those gaps in the literature lead us to the following research question rq2 how can we assess c r o s s feature interactions and what is their impac t on failures during the int egration of product features?
.
research setting we collected data from a development organization responsible for producing a navigation system for automobiles .
our data co vered months of development activity between and corresponding to the last version of the product.
one hundred and seventy nine engineers located in development sites distributed across north america europe and india participated in the pr oject.
those developers were organized in development t eams.
most of the teams involved engineers from at least development sites.
telephone conference calls and e m a i l w e r e t h e p r i m a r y mechanisms of communication among distributed teams and e ngineers .
the use of lightweight collaboration technologies such as instant messaging and wikis was not allowed.
the project also had daily status meetings organized like scrum meetings.
the system was composed of about .
million lines of code di stributed in source code files and architectural comp onents.
the development responsibilities of each component were assigned to a single development team.
the source code files were written mostly in c but contained a significant amount of code written in c and assembly language.
all developers ha d full a ccess t o the version control system the task tracking system and a document repository that contained requirements architectural and design specifications .
the project involved the development of product featur es.
the organization utilized a featur e oriented development approach and it started using that approach years prior to the time covered by our data.
in th is project the software architects and the software architecture of the sy stem pla yed an important role in the feature oriented development process .
software a rchitects were respons ible for an alyzing the descriptions of each product feature and determining the set of architectural comp onents that would have to be altered or e nhanced in order to i mplemen t the r equested feature.
the sof tware architects then produce a feature develo pment specification that contained a d escription of the work to be done in each arch itectural component.
the feature t e a m s used those specifications to do the detailed design a nd implementation o f t h e f e a t u r e .
o n c e a feature deve lopment specification was wri tten the ma nagement of the project defined a feature team that would be assigned to that particular product feature .
the fe ature teams were c omposed of engineers for the tea ms responsible from the architectural comp onents that were impacted by the fe ature as i ndi cat ed i n t he feat ur e speci fi c ation document .
manag ement also assigned a feature owner to each product feature .
that individual was a senior eng ineer a group leader or a manager from one of the teams involved in the feature team.
the organiz ation did not have any specific process for s electing feature ow ners.
however project executives tended to base their selection on 162experience with the type of pro duct feature and they also tried to balance the feature ownership load across all feature owners.
once completed e ach product feature was delivered to an integration and testing i t team who was responsible for two activ ities.
first they merg ed the source code of the f eature into a prerelease branch in the version control system.
following that step they ran a collection of integration testing suites that evaluated t he feature just integrated as well as all the previously in tegrated fe atures.
the test suite consisted of a collection of tests defined by architects and engineers to evaluate the requirements of each feature.
the i t team implemented the test suites in two compl ementary parts.
one part consisted of simple tests similar in nature to a smoke test that we re run on the software system using a simulator for the real hardware .
a second part of the testing included the full implementation of the test s a n d i t w a s e x e c u t e d against the software system running on the actual hardware of the embedded system.
the out comes of the integration tests were recorded a n d k e p t a s p a r t o f t h e p r o j e c t s r e p o s i t o r i es.
t he i t team recorded for each integration test whether the tests assoc iated with the recently integrated feature passed or not.
they also recorded whether the tes ts associated with features integrated in the past passed or not.
our empirical analyses are organized in two parts.
in section we examine research questions 1a and 1b related to technical and organizational attributes of features that lead to integrat ion failures.
in section we examine the role of cross feature intera ctions on integration failures rq2 .
.
what factors drive failures when integrating features?
the first step in our investigation was to examine how technical attributes o f a p r o d u c t f e a ture as well as c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f t h e feature teams responsible for developing that product feature i mpact the occurrence of software failures at the time of integra ting the product feature.
the literature on software failures is vas t and over the years numerous aspects of a software systems as well as aspects of the development process have been linked to failures e.g.
.
that work guided us in the selection of independent variables as well as control factors that might impact failures during the integration of features .
the rest of this section describes in detail the m e a s u r e s a n d s t a t i s t i cal models used in our analyses followed by our results.
.
description of the measures in order to address research question s 1a and 1b we collected a number of measures from various data sources including the pr oject s software repositories and document ation as well as human resource records .
.
.
measuring integration failures as discussed earlier the i t t e a m i n t e g r a t e d each feature ind ividually.
that p r o c e s s a l l o w e d t h e t e a m t o r u n a c o l l e c t i o n o f integration tests to evaluate the feature just integrated as well as all the previously integrated features.
the i t team recorded for each integration test whether the tests associated with the recently integrated feature passed or not.
they also recorded whethe r the tests associated with previously integrated features passed or not.
our outcome measure is a dichotomous variable where a ind icates that at least one of the tests performed by the i t team at the time of integrating a feature failed.
o therwise the variable is set to .
.
.
independent variables our independent measures are organized in two groups.
we first describe a c o l l e c t i o n o f technical attributes o f t h e f e a t u r e s t h a t were assessed .
the development of each product feature consisted of o n e o r m o r e t r a n s a c t i o n s i n t h e v e r s i o n c o n t r o l s y s t e m t h a t impacted one or more architectural c o m p o n e n t s. from those transactions we collected the changed locs which accounts for the number of non comment non empty lines of code that were added deleted and modified as part of developing a feature .
i n addition to the amount of change the locality of those changes might be relevant to integration failures.
for example if the m ajority of the changes a re collocated in the single component i nvolved in a feature it might be easier to test them and assess their potential impact and implications.
on the other hand if the changes are dispersed across all the components involved in the feature testing the changes or understanding their potential impl ication might be more challenging.
in order to reach a better u nderstanding of how tho se different patterns of code change within a feature might impact integration failures we computed the concentration of cha nged locs measure .
building o n past work that examined the notion of dispersion of software engineers across development locations e.g.
and we evaluated two approaches for constructing the measure .
one approach based on uses the standard deviation of the changes made to each co mponent involved in a feature.
smaller values indicate that the changes are relatively evenly distributed among the changed co mponents.
a second approach builds on entropy based measures e.g.
to assess the degree of concentration of changes in one particular architectural component.
both measures had equivalent impact of the results from the regression models.
we chose to include the measure based on the first approach because th e fit of the regression models w as higher than the fit obtained when using the entropy based approach .
technical coupling among constituent parts of a soft ware system has consistently been shown to impact software failures e.g.
.
a measure of the extent of the technical c oupling within each feature was collected from the architectural description of the s ystem .
the number of dependencies variable r e f e r s t o t h e number of interfaces that the architectural components involved within a feature had with each other .
in other wor ds number of dependencies measures the int er component coupling within the boundaries of a product feature.
as in the case of changes in the source code the locality of the technical dependencies within a feature might impact failures.
past work in the a rea of coupling and cohesion e.g.
would suggest that if the inter component dependencies within a feature are concentrated in one or few components their high levels of coupling could lead t o failures.
how ever a product feature aggregates t hose different patterns of technical coupling therefore it is unclear how they might impact failures when considering features as the unit of analyses rather than architectural components.
in order to shed light on the relationship between technical coupling and product features we computed the concentration o f d e p e n d e n c i e s variable a s t h e s t a n d a r d deviation of the number of dependencies among all possible pairs of components involved in a feature.
smaller values indicate that the dependencies are re latively evenly distributed among the components involved in a product feature .
as indicated in the previous paragraph this approac h of construc ting the measure prove d to be a better measure than other a pproaches e.g.
an entropy based measure for the statis tical models used in our analyses .
163in a second set of measures we assessed organizational properties of the feature teams involved in the development of a feature.
gsd is a dichotomous variable where indicates that the feature team members were located i n different development sites othe rwise it is set to .
it is worth pointing out that all the project me mbers that were collocated work in a single open space in individual cubicles.
we also measure d the number of developers that were part of the feature teams.
as discussed earlier feature team me mbers were selected from formal groups responsible for the various architectural compone nts.
therefore we also measured the number of groups i n v o l v e d i n t h e d e v e l o p m e n t o f each feature .
finally we constructed two measures that assess t h e r e l a t i o n s h i p between the organizational and the technical dimensions of deve loping a product feature.
the feature owner has an important role within the development effort associated with a featur e because it is the individual r esponsible for making sure the feature team is able to accomplish its goal of developing the feature.
in our research setting feature owners were selected from among the members of the g r o u p s r e s p o n s i b l e f o r t h e c o m p o n e n t s b e i n g affected by a product feat ure suggesting that feature owners might have particular sets of skills experiences and relationships that might benefit certain members of a feature team and hin der ot hers.
therefore we computed the feature owner belongs to highly coupled component m easure as a dichotomous variable which is set to if the feature o w n e r b e l o n g e d t o t h e g r o u p r esponsible for the component with the h ighest number of technical dependencies within the assigned feature.
similarly we computed the measure feature owner belong s to highly changed comp onent which is set to if the fea ture owner belonged to the group responsible for the component that was changed the mo st as part of the development of the focal feature .
.
.
additional control factors we collected a number of additio nal measures that past research has shown to be relate d t o softwa re quality and consequently relevant to modeling i n t e g r a t i o n f a i l u r e s .
for each p r o d u c t f e a t u r e we collected the number of modification requests a s r e p o r t e d i n t h e m o d i f ication request mr tracking system associated with each feature .
we also collected the total size in loc s of the components that were involved in a feature.
it is well established that over time development organizations learn and mature their processes and practices and consequently tend to reduce mistakes and errors.
therefore we computed the va riable time t h a t r e p r e s e n t s t h e w e e k w i t h i n t h e p r o j e c t o n w h i c h t h e feature was integrated.
finally we collected measures of experience based o n t h e a pproach es used by boh and col l eagues and espinosa and co lleague s which utilize the data in software repositories as the basis for assessing experience.
we measured prior experience on the product in two different ways.
average mr experience assessed the average number of mr that the feature team member worked on prior to the focal feature .
average component exper ience measured the average number of times that the feature team members modified the architectural components associated with the focal feature prior to the beginning of the development of the feature .
.
description of the model our dependent measure is a dichotomous variable.
conse quently we used logistic regression models to examine research questions 1a and 1b .
we followed a traditional hierar chical approach where we start our analyses w i t h a b a s e l i n e m o d e l t h a t c o n t a i n s o n l y control factors .
in subsequent models we added the various independent measures associated with the different research questions.
this modeling approach allows us to unde rstand the independent and relative impact on integration failures of each set of factors .
in order to assess the fit of each model we report the deviance of each model as well as the percentage of deviance explained by the model .
the deviance of a m odel is defined as log likelihood of the model and lower values are associated with better fit of the model to the data .
the percentage of the deviance explained is a ratio of the deviance of the null model contains only the inte rcept and the deviance of the final model.
in order to simplify the interpretation of the results we report the odds ratios associate d with each measure instead of reporting the regression coefficients.
odds ratios larger than indicate a positive relati onship between the ind ependent and dependent variables whereas an odds ratio less than indicates a negative relationship.
.

.
preliminary analyses the first step in our analysis consisted in examinin g various d escriptive statistics of the measures described earlier.
seve ral var iables had skewed distributions so they were log transformed.
in the next step we performed various collinearity diagnostics.
a variance inflation factors vif analysis revealed that several of the measures were highly collinear.
in accordance wit h well established recommendations we removed from our analyses all the variables with vif values above .
a pair wise correl ation analysis among those remaining measures showed levels o f correlation that were not problematic with the highest values being .

as expected time and higher levels of average component experiences are assoc iated with lower probability of failures.
for instance an additi onal week in the development pro ject corresponding to a unit increase in the variable time reduces the likelihood of failure odds ratio equal to .
lower than by .
considering all other fa ctors constant.
.
.
the impact of technical attributes of features we examined research ques tion 1a with model ii in table .
the model includes the technical attributes of the feature to study their impact on integration failures.
our results do not provide evidence that either the amount of source code changed changed locs during the developm ent of the feature or t h e concentration o f those changes across the various architectural components a ffected by those changes concentration o f c h a n g e d l o c s impacted t h e l i k e l i h o o d o f i n t e g r a t i o n f a i l u r e s .
o n t h e o t h e r h a n d the level of technical coupli ng number of dependencies among the components involved in the feature and the degree of conce ntration of that coupling concentration of number of depende ncies do have a statistically significant effect on inte gration fai lures.
we observe that the high er the number of architectural dependencies among the components that are impact ed by a feature the higher the likelihood of failures odds ratio .
moreover the higher the concentration of the coupling in a smaller number of components is the higher is the likelihood of integration failures.

the impact of organizational attributes of feature teams in model iii we examined the role that org anizational attributes of the feature teams have on integration failures rq1b .
we observe that several organizational factors have a statistically si gnificant impact on integration failures.
as the number of deve lopment groups that work on a feature incr eases so does the probability of occurrence of integration failures.
in addition ge ographic di spersion of the feature team has a major impact of int egration failures.
when the engineers that worked on the feature were geographically distributed the like lihood of integration failures is almost times higher than when all engineers are in the same location odds ratio .
.
we also examine d how the group membership of the feature owner impacted the outcome of the feature teams.
we found that selecti ng the feature owner from the group that is responsible for the architectural component w ith the highest level of technical coupling within the product feature helps reduce the probability of integration failures to occur.
sp ecifically having the feature owner belong to the group responsible for the highest coupled component decreases the likelih ood of failures by about odds ratio .
compared to n ot having the feature owner belong to that development group.
models ii and iii provide insight on the relative impact on failures of the technical attributes o f p r o d u c t f e a t u r e s a n d o r g a n i z a t i o n a l characteristics of feature teams.
organizational attributes explain .
of the deviance in the data the difference in the deviance explained between model ii and iii whereas technical attributes of feature explained .
of the deviance .
those results hig hlight the significant impact that the characteristics of feature teams have on the outcomes of feature driven development endeavors .
.
additional analyses we performed additional analyses to examine the potential cond itional impact of particular factors such as which group the fe ature owner belonged to and the geographic dispersion of the feature team.
the conditional impact of the variables can be studied with interaction terms in a regression model.
an interaction between two factors for instance gsd and feature owner belongs to highly coupled component allows us to examine how the impact of one factor e.g.
feature owner belongs to highly coupled comp o nent on the dependent variable changes for different values of the second factor e.g.
feature team is collocated or not .
in model iii we found that the group to which the feature owner belongs is an important organizational factor in the context of integration failures.
however the impact of such factor might differ depending whether the feature team members are geographically distributed or not.
in addition the level of concentration i n t h e changes to the code or in the technical coupling among component s might moderate the impact of having the feature owner b elonging to a particular group.
for example it might be only beneficial to have the feature owner belong to the group that is responsible for the component with the highest amount of changes or depe ndencies only when the concentration l evel s are relatively hi gh .
in order to explore tho se potential conditional effects model iv of table includes several interaction terms that were selected based on the results reported in models ii and iii .
all inde pendent variables were mean centered an approach traditionally used to address the colli nearity issues introduced by the interaction terms.
figure the interplay between the concentration of techn ical coupling within a feature and the feature owner belon ging to the highly coupled component.
the results reported in model iv show only o n e i n t e r a c t i o n t e r m concentration o f n u m b e r o f d e p e n d e n c i e s x f e a t u r e o w n e r belongs to highly coupled component is statistically significant 165suggesting that the impact of the concentration of the technical co upling within a feature is moderated by whether the feature owner belong s to the group responsible for the highly coupled components or not .
an odds ratio below indicates that when the feature owner belongs to the group responsible for the highest coupled component the negative impact of higher levels of concentration of the tec hnical coupling is reduced.
figure illustrates this point by depicting how the probabilities of integration failure estimated by our logi stic regression models change as the number of dependencies changes .
as the concentration o f t h e n u m b e r o f d e p e n d e n c i e s i n c r e a s e s x axis we observe that the estimated probability of failure y axis increases faster when the feature owner does not belon g to the group responsible for the component with the highest level of coupling solid line in figure than when the feature owner belongs to the group responsible for the component with the highest level of coupling dashed line in figure .
in fact t he probability of failure reduces by half in the latter case where the number of dependencies is higher than .
furthermore we see that this relationship inverts for lower values of concentration i n t h e n u m b e r o f d e p e n d e n c i e s values .
.
cross feature interactions and integration failures we now turn our attention to cross feature interactions and their implication for integration of features.
in particular we examine how architectural dependencies that represent relationships b etween product features impact the occurrence of integration fai lures in a feature driven development setting.
the rest of the se ction describes in detail the measures and statistical models used in our analyses as well as the results of our investigations.
.
description of the measures in order to address research question we collected a number of measures from various data sources including the project s sof tware repositories documentation and human resource records.
.
.
measuring integration failures in this case our unit of an alysis is the pair of product features.
as described in section product features were integrated into a pre release development stream individually .
then the i t team ran a collection of integration tests every time a feature was integrated.
using such i n f o r m a t i o n w e c o n s t r u c t e d o u r d a t a s e t o f pairs of features in the following way.
when a feature f n w a s integrated we created n pairs f fn ... f n fn .
considering all features developed in the project and integ rated we had a total of possible pairs of features.
our dependent mea sures is a dichotomous variable where a associated with a pair of features f x fy indicates that the integration tests associated wit h either features f x or f y failed at the time of integrating feature fy assuming that feature fy was integrated after feature fx .
.
.
measuring cross features interactions we measured the number of cross features dependencies for a pair of features f x fy as t he number of architectural dependencies that the components invol ved in feature fx had with the co mponents involved in feature fy.
the data a b o u t a r c h i t e c t u r a l d ependencies were extracted from the project s software architecture documentation that contained detailed descriptions of all a rchitectural components and t heir relationships.
.
.
additional control factors we collected a number of additional measures f o r e a c h p a i r o f features .
since our unit of analysis is the pair of features integr a tion failures could be impacted by a buggy feature that was in tegrated in the past rather than by the feature being integrated.
in order to control for this effect we constructed dichotomous var iables past failures in the past x weeks .
these variables mea sured t he i mpact of past failures associated with the features that were inte grated in the past feature fx in a given pair f x fy when integrating a new feature f y. we considered to weeks time periods.
for example the variable past failures in the past weeks would be set to for the pair of features f x fy if ther e has been an integration testing failure associated with f x i n t h e past weeks prior to integrating feature f y. we measured t h e changed locs a s t h e nu mb e r of no n comment non empty lines of code that were added deleted and modified as part of develo ping both features in each pair .
the measure number of modific ation requests captured the number of mrs associa ted with each pair of features as reported in the mr tracking system.
it is well established that over time development organizations learn and mature t h e i r p r o c e s s e s a n d p r a c t i c e s a n d c o n s e q u e n t l y t e n d t o reduce mistakes and errors.
therefore we computed the va riable time f o r e a c h p a i r o f f e a t u r e s fx fy that represents the week within the project on which the feature fy was integrated.
we also assessed a set of organizational properties of the feature teams involved in the development of each pair of features .
gsd is a dichotomous variable where indicates that the members of either feature teams involved in the development of the features in a given pair f x fy were located in different development sites otherwise it is set to .
as indicated earlier all the project me mbers that were collocated work in a single open space in individual cubicles.
we also measure the number of groups involved in the development of each pair of features a s w e l l a s t h e number of developers t h a t w e r e p a r t o f t h o s e f e a t u r e t e a m s .
t h e engineers involved in the development of a pair of features that belong to the same formal groups responsible for certain architectural components might have more opportunities to interact communicate and coordinate than if they belong to different formal teams.
then we computed the overlap among groups as the proportion of feature team members from f x that belong to the same set of formal groups that the members of the feature team associa ted with f y. we also computed the same feature owner measure as a dichotomous variable set to if the same individual was the fe ature owner for the pair of features otherwise the measure was set to .
finally we collected measures of experience based o n the approaches used by boh and colleagues and espinosa and colleagues .
we measured prior experience on the product in two different ways.
average mr experience measures the average number of mr that the feature team s members associated with a pair of features w o r k e d o n p r i o r t o t h e f o c a l f e a t u r e .
average component e x p e r i e n c e represents t h e a v e r a g e n u m b e r o f t i m e s that the feature team s members modified the components assoc iated with each pai r of features .

description of the model as in the case of the analyses reported in the previ ous section our dependent measure is also dichotomous variable.

model i presents the odds ratios associated with the control fa ctors included in our analyses.
as expected the later in the pr oject s lifecycle a feature is integrated the time variable the lower the probability of integration failures a result consistent with learning and development maturity arguments .
i n a d d i t i o n higher number of groups involved in the development each pair of features and having those groups geographic ally d i s t r i b u t e d increased significantly the likelihood of integration failures to occur.
on the other hand two organiz ational factors the propo rtion of members of the feature teams that developed a pair o f features overlapped or belonged to the same formal groups i ncreased the overlap among groups v a r i a b l e and h a v i n g t h e s a m e f e ature owner for both features in the pair the same feature owner variable h a d a p o s i t i v e i m p a c t o f i n t egration failures reducing their probability of occurrence .
finally in each pair of featu res f x fy past f ailures associated with a feature f x prior to the integr ation of feature f y was also an impo rtant factor leading to integr ation failures.
as discussed earlier we computed different v ersions of the variables covering a period of we ek prior to integration of a feature to weeks prior.
we found that the variab le corresponding to the week period worked best in our models.
we think this particular result is r elated to characteristics of the project.
an analysis of the d efects report s stored in the defect tracking system revealed that the ave rage time to resolve a defect was days and the standard devi ation was days suggesting that in most defects were r esolved within a week period.

the impact of cross feature interactions model ii introduces the number of cross feature dependencies into the analysis and we observe that its impact is statistically significant.
the higher the number of cross feature depende ncies a pair of features have the higher the likelihood of integration failures to occur.
it is also important to highlight that this factor has a major impact in the explanatory power of the model repr esenting .
of the deviance explained by the model .
this result suggests that our metric could be a valuable tool for prac titioner to identify where potential coordination problems might occur .
.
.
additional analyses we performed additional analyses to examine whether the strong impact of cross feature interactions on integration failures was co nditional on other factors.
as dis cussed in section .
.
conditional or moderating effects can be analyzed with interaction terms in a regression mode.
model iii we introduced two interaction terms of particular interest number of groups x number of cross feature dependencies a n d gsd x n u m b e r o f c r o s s feature depende ncies.
g e o g r a p h i c d i s p e r s i o n a n d h i g h e r n u m b e r o f i n d i v i d u a l s i nvolved in the development are two well established factors that increase the coordination complexity of software development e ndeavors.
since model ii showed su ch a strong negative impact on failures from the number of cross feature dependencies it is important two understand if such impact changes as the numbe r of groups involved in the development of a pair of features changes or whether those groups are geogr aphically distributed or not.
the results reported in model iii show only o n e i n t e r a c t i o n t e r m gsd x n u m b e r o f c r o s s feature dependencies is statistically significant .
the odds ratio associated with the in teraction term is below .
suggesting that the impact of cross feature depen dencies is lower when developers of the feature teams are geograph ically distributed than when they are collocated.
these are une xpected results.
figure illustrates the gsd x n u m b e r o f c r o s s feature dependencies i n t e r a c t ion effect b y d e p i c t i n g t h e c h a n g e s in the estimated probabilities of having integration failures as the number of cross feature dependencies changes .
as the number of cross feature dependencies increases x axis we observe that there is a point values in the log transformed measure on the x axis at which the probability of integration failures y axi s increases significantly faster when the features teams that worked o n a pair of features are collocated solid line in figure than w hen feature teams are geographically distributed dashed line in figure .
i t is important to point out that for levels of the cross feature depende ncies measure below .
in the log transformed values of the mea sure the probability of having integration failure s is more than do uble for the gsd case than for the collocated case.
such a result is consistent with the growing body of work showing the det rimental effects of distribution on quality e.g.
.
however when fe atures are very highly interrelated value s our results show that the impact of cross feature dependencies is lower when feature teams are geographically distributed.
one possible explanation fo r 167this result is that the work practices developed by collocated tea ms might allow them to handle certain levels of interdependence between features very well.
for example dependencies might be handled more informally because the interdependent engineers are physically collocated.
however beyond a certain point e.g.
in our analysis values those work practices failed to adequately id entify and manage the interdependencies between features.
on th e other hand distributed teams are always at a disadvantage and re cognizing such condition they might develop different work practices to manage depende ncies that help them cope better with high levels of interdependence.

assessing the robustness of the results we performed one final analysi s t o a s s e s s t h e r o b u s t n e s s o f t h e results reported in table .
our large dataset is characterized by having a low proportion of 1s in the outcome variable an integr ation failure associated with a pair of features which is known as rare events data .
a traditional logistic regression run against a rare events dataset tends to underestimate the probability of the outcome .
given that potential problem we used a strategy to overcome it as suggested by hahn and colleagues and in the process ev aluate the robustness of our results.
the approach is known as c h o i c e based sampling and consists in s t r a t e g i c a l l y constructing samples from the original dataset based on the values of the outcome variable.
we followed this procedure.
first w e constructed two dataset with a random sample of of the pairs of features that had integration failures.
we then match those pair s with pairs in one dataset and pairs in the othe r that had the outcome variable .
the se pairs were created using features int egrated within a week of the matched pair and involved one of the features in the match pair .
we ran the same analyses reported on table on these two additional datasets.
the results were all co nsistent with the ones reported in table providing additional co nfidence in our results.

discussion feature driven development is a promising approach.
in this p aper we set out to empirically study how technical and organiz ational factors impact outcomes in projects that use a feature driven development approach in order to further our understanding of its potential.
specifically we examined the impact that technical attributes of product features and attributes of the feature teams that developed such feature have on one particular dimen sion of software quality integration failures.
our results showed the amount of architectural dependencies contained within a fe ature as well as how those dependencies are distributed acros s components have an important effect on f a i l u r e s .
s p e c i f i c a l l y higher levels of technical coupling and higher concentration of such coupling in a small set of architectural components signif icantly increase the probability of failures at the time of integrati ng a product feature.
most importantly our analyses revealed that cross feature intera ctions measured as the number of architectural dependencies between two product features are a major driver of integration failures.
we also found that several attributes of the feature teams impacted quality.
the number of engineer s involved in the development of a feature and their geographic dispers ion were detrimental to quality.
however our analyses showe d also that selecting a feature owner that is involved with a highly co upled architectural component that is part of a product feature helps overco me the detrimental effects that other technical and o rganizational factors have on the likelihood of integration failures to occur.
the work r eported in this paper has four important contributions to the software engineering literature in particular to t he work on feature oriented development.
first our results provide one of the very first empirical evaluations of a feature oriented development setting and its implications for software quality.
second our analyses explored how the technical and the organizational d imensions of feature oriented development i m p a c t e d integration failures as well as how the interplay between both dimensions impacted such failures .
third we evaluated an a pproach to assess the impact of cross feature inte ractions and the res ults showed that our measure based on architectural dependency i nformation was a major driver of integration failures a ccounting for almost of the deviance i n o u r m o d e l .
f i n a l l y o u r r e s u l t s p r o v i d e concrete guidance to the practice of feature oriented development.
we discuss in detail the pragmatic implic ations in section .
.
.
limitations our study has several limitations worth highlighting.
first our work examined a single development organization a n d a s i n g l e s y s t e m developed by that organization which raises concerns regarding external validity.
however the characteristics of the system e.g.
embedded system developed in a combination of c c and a ssembly programming languages as well as the processes and work practices used by the studied organization are similar to those found in the telecommunication healthcare infotainment and automotive industries.
therefore we think that our findings are applicable across a wide spectrum of corporate settings that develop embedded systems using feature oriented development approaches .
as discussed in the literature e.g.
cross feature interactions could stem from multiple sources including architectural depen dencies logical or semantic dependencies not adequately repr esented in architectural descr iptions or even from unknown d ependencies among different parts of a software system.
our mea sure of cross feature interaction is based on architectural depen dency information and captures only a fraction of the possible cross feature interactions that mig ht exist in a system representing a limitation of our analysis.
however the strong impact that ou r measure had on the probability of integration failur es raises a pair of interesting questions how much additional impact might other types of cross feature interactions have on failures?
and how can we measure such interactions?
we elaborate on these i ssues fu rther in the implications for future research section.
168third the organization we studied did not allow the use of ligh tweight collaboration t e c hnol ogi es such as in stant messaging and wikis.
past research have found that such technologi es help sof tware engineers be more aware of the activities that ar e taking place in the project and coordinate and collaborate better e.g.
.
it is possible t hat the impact of some of the factors considered in our analyses were exacerbated by this particular limit ation in our research setting.
future research should examine the impact those collaborative technologies in the context of ge ographically distributed feature driven development .
finally the development locations differed in the maturity of the development practices.
all the development locations but the one in india started to use a feature oriented development approach at the same time.
the indian site on the other hand was constra ined by their h i g h l e v e l s o f m a t u r i t y i n t h e i r d e v e l o p m e n t p r o c e s s e s cmm level .
hence their adoption of the more fluid develo pment practices associated with fe ature oriented development was limited.
ho wever we do no t think that such disparity has a major impact in our results for two re asons.
first the amount of work done in the i ndian site was about of the total development effort of the project and second most of the work was ass ociated with parts of a featu re.
only product features out of the were co mpletely developed by teams in india.
.
implications for future research the results of our study have important implications for research.
first our analyses revealed that the measure of cross feature interaction based on architectural dependency information was a major predictor of integration failures.
however as discussed earlier such a measure represents a subset of all potential interactions between product features that might exist in a system.
p ast research has shown that version control data can be used to identify logical d ependencies between part s of a software system.
those dependencies have been found to drive relevant coordination needs among deve lopers that when satisfied development produ ctivity improves and probability of software failures to occur is reduced .
then a potentially valuable future research path is to explore combining those t w o a p p r o a c h e s to measure cross feature interactions assess their impact on software quality as well as examine their implic ations for evolving software system either by adding more fea tures or modifying existing ones.
second our findings showed an important detrimental impact of geographic distribution on integration failures.
recent work in the areas o f s o f t w a r e q u a l i t y a n d d i s t r i b u t e d d e v e l o p m e n t h a s s h o w n mixed results.
for example ramasubbu a n d b a l a n f o u n d n o evidence that geographic dispersion impacted quality outcomes of software development projects.
bird and colleagues found that collocated and distributed teams developed binaries with very sim ilar levels of quality.
in contrast cataldo and nambiar found that different dimensions of geographic dispersion impacted ne gatively the quality of architectural components as well a s the quality outcomes of projects.
such disparity in results might be indicative that the relationship between distributed development and software quality could be moderated by different technical and organizational factors that future research should ex amine.
the relative role of tec hnical and organizational factors associated with product features suggested by our results point out that future research in the area of collaborative technologies to support the development organization could benefit from consider ing product features as first order entities .
recently researchers have argued that the concept of a product feature could represent the g lue to facilitate coordination collaboration and overall governance of software development endeavors .
our results provide guidance on the set of factors and metrics that collaborative technologies can focus on in order to enhance the coordinative and collaborative capabilities of software development organizations particularly those that are geograph ically distributed.
for exa mple considering product features as a first order entity a collab orative tool could collect cross feature dependency information and automatically suggests potential interdependent engineers based on the individuals current work activities and the degree of cross feature interaction that between the features those ind ividuals are working on.
finally the results of our analyses also call for a more systematic evaluation of the range of organizational and governance princ iples and practices that apply in the context of feature driven d evelopment.
our analyses focused on only three aspects ge ographic dispersion selection of the feature owner and overlap in feature team membership.
certainly there are several o ther aspects that deserve further investigation such as different configura tional properties of geographic dispersion and the integration of feature oriented development with agile practices to name a few.
.
practical implications our results also have important practical implications.
as software architecture has become a central element in the development process of many software projects it is quite common to have in early stages of projects sufficient information of the software arc hitecture its constituent elements and their relationships.
the strong impact on integration failures that cross feature dependencies exhi bited in our analyses suggest that software architects software manager or other stakeholders are now in a position to assess the level of cross feature i n t e r a c t i o n s d e t e r m i n e t h e i r r e l a t i v e i m p o r t a n c e a n d plan appropriate organizational mechanisms to support the feature teams involved in developing highly interrelated features.
second and in relation to the previous point the detrimental impact of te chnical coupling within a product feature and cross feature dependencies is likely to be reduced our results suggest by ad equately selecting the feature owner.
traditionally i n s o f t w a r e d evelopment as well as in other engineering disciplines the select ion criteria for technical leadership positions tend to be based on ex perience and technical expertise.
certainly our analyses do not di spute such an approach but they suggest that if such a person is closely involved with an architectural component part of a product featured that highly coupled with the rest of the comp onents such decision will pay off more in terms of software quality than if suc h person is closely involved in the development of any other component of the product feature.
then our find ings provide guidance to software managers and other decision makers of how to best select feature owners.
