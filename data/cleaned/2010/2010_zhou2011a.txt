does the initial environment impact the future of developers?
minghui zhou school of electronics engineering and computer science peking university key laboratory of high confidence software technologies ministry of education beijing china zhmh pku.edu.cnaudris mockus avaya labs research mt airy rd basking ridge nj audris avaya.com abstract software developers need to develop technical and social sk ills to be successful in large projects.
we model the relative socia lity of a developer as a ratio between the size of her communication n etwork and the number of tasks she participates in.
we obtain bo th measures from the problem tracking systems.
we use her workflow peer network to represent her social learning and the is sues she has worked on to represent her technical learning.
using three open source and three traditional projects we investigate h ow the project environment reflected by the sociality measure at th e time a developer joins affects her future participation.
we find a the probability thata new developer willbecome one of long ter m and productive developers is highest when the project socialit y is low b times of high sociality are associated with a higher inten sity of new contributors joining the project c there are significa nt differences between the social learning trajectories of the de velopers who join in low and in high sociality environments d the ope n source andcommercial projects exhibit different nature in the relationship between developer s tenure and the project s envi ronment at the time she joins.
these findings point out the importance of the initial environment in determining the future of the dev elopers and may lead to better training and learning strategies in so ftware organizations.

.according to an expert developer1.
one possibility suggested by a software project manager is that many developers tend to f ocus onthe modules theyarefamiliarwith and rarelycommuni cate outside their narrow circle of colleagues to gain expertise in other areas.
the software engineering literature has investigat ed the important role of social and communication aspects in a develo per s work.
theymightimpactdeveloper productivity cataldoet al and they might affect software quality cataldo et al .
f urthermore cognitivescientistshavearguedthatinteractingwi thpartners is significantly better than learning alone .
in other wor ds the developers need both technical and social skills to be capab le of solving critical tasks though that might present two contr adicting or at leastcompeting learning goals.
on the other hand there may be obstacles for the developers t o achieve socio technical balance evenwhentheyhaveastro ngmotivation to cultivate their social and technical trajector ies because the project environment in particular the environment at the time a developers joins i.e.
the initial environment for the de veloper may have a significant impact on the individual.
for example in many offshoring projects the developers in the offshore lo cation were considered to be incompetent to implement new feature d evelopment in legacy projects i don t know if people are cl imbing up moving from defect fixing to new development in this site because initially nobody could get trained by exper ienced mentors according to an outsourcing manager.
therefore the offshore team really needs time working with onshore develo pers togainmature practices according tothe same manager.
this anecdotal evidence sparked our interest to investigat e how the initialenvironment mayimpact thedevelopers learnin gtrajectories in particular the achievement of social and techni cal balance.
improving this process may helpunderstand how toincr ease the number of developers capable of solving critical tasks to improve the developers training and to facilitate the proje ct s success.
we have toovercome twochallenges toproceed withthis inves tigation.

in addition to the challenges o f measuringthesocialandtechnicalachievementingeneral wealso needto derive these measures from commonly available project data such as version control system and problem tracking system.

271messaging communications amongdevelopers workingonthec orrespondingfiles.
thelackofcommunicationswhereatechnic aldependency exists was assumed to indicate a potential problem .
unfortunately there are many other forms of communications a mong the developers beyond what the instant messaging could capt ure.
inthisstudywedon tlookfor orstudythemismatchesbetwe en the technical dependencies and the communication paths in stead we focus on the individual developers by comparing a develop er s achievement fromthe social andthe technical aspects.
in particular wepropose ameasure ofrelativesociality rs toobser ve the developer s socio technical balance the ratio of the size of a developer s communication network to the number of tasks she p articipates in.
the former is modeled by the number of people th e developer interacted with inher task workflow.
the latter is represented by mrs in problem tracking system.
in general the num ber of people a developer encounters in the mr workflows would strongly depend on the number of mrs she participates in.
thi s number of mrs may vary substantially over time because of var ious envirnmental influences however the ratio in rs adjus ts for such influences by normalizing the social network using the n umber of tasks mrs .
we propose several hypotheses about how the initial project environment affects the developer s rs trajectory.
we consid er how the project s rs obtained fromrsesof projectparticipant s at the timethedeveloperjoinstheprojectaffectshertrajectory .
weinvestigate three open source projects and three traditional or commercial projects and partition each project s time line into low high and medium rs periods as described in section .
.
we find that thedevelopers rstrajectoriesdependonthetypeofinterv alwhen she joined the project that the project s rs measure at the t ime a developer joined affects the probability that a developer would become one of the long term or more months and productiv e top developers we refer to such developers as long ter m contributors or ltcs and that a project environment when r s measure is high is associated with a higher intensity of new c ontributors.
moreover theopensourceandcommercialprojec tsshow their different nature through this measure in particular when the project s rs is low the intensity of the joiners who eventua lly become ltcs is high in open source projects but that is not the ca se for traditional projects.
the main contributions of this work include a to propose an d evaluate the rs measure of socio technical balance b to pr opose measures of the project s success the intensity of joiners and the probability for a joiner to become an ltc c to demonstrate the associations between the project environment these measu res of success and developers learning trajectories.
in partic ular we quantify the developers learning trajectories and estab lish the association between the project environment reflected throu gh rs measure and the intensity of new contributors or the chance s that a new contributor wouldbecome an ltc.

the first group of worktries to discover the nature of communi cations in a developer s programming life.
for example com munication plays an important role for developers as begel et a l. foundinmicrosoft.
majorityofindicateddeveloperneedsi nvolved discovering meeting and keeping track of people not just code.
communicationshouldnotberegardedassomethingtobeincr eased or limited by itself what matters is the quality of communic ation experience as nakakoji etal.
highlighted in .
atraditionalapproach toinvestigate socio technical con gruence is measuring the overlap between programming dependencies and communication paths.
for example this approach has been us ed to illustrate how the mismatch between social primarily th e communications among developers and technical aspects indev eloper work has an impact on project schedule software quality an d developer effort .
thebasic idea isthat the lackofcom municationwhereatechnicaldependencyexistsmayindicateapo tential problem.
a good example of the environmental influences is conway s law stating that the structure of an organization is refle cted in the structure of the systems it designs.
the environment is r epresented by the organization s structure and it strongly i nfluences the way people produce the system.
mockus investigated the project environment measured via organizational change an d the intensity of staff reductions and found that the proximity to such environmental change was associated with reductions in sof tware quality.
other environmental factors for example the acc essibility of resources provided by the project were found to affec t the developers trainingand learning .
regarding best practices cataldo et al.
described an ex ample of improved quality of communications where the most pro ductive developers changed their use of electronic communi cation media over time achieving higher congruence between coord ination requirements and coordination activities.
new models and approaches are proposed because existing software engine ering tools ... separate time and tasks in concrete but isolated pr ocess steps .
for example redmiles et al.
proposed a way to support collaborative work called continuous coordinat ion.
it stresses the importance of integrating the coordination ac tivities within the programming environment and of making develope rs aware of the need to communicate.
it simultaneously minimiz es the distraction of software developers by using formal confi gurationmanagement mechanisms andinformal visual notificatio n and awareness techniques.
ye et al.
proposed a socio techn ical framework to provide incremental support of information ac quisition from immediately relevant information to contextu al information and to relevant peers.
it guides the design of system s that support information seeking during various phases of softw are development.
asdescribedabove manystudiesattempttosystematically treat both technical issues and social issues in a programming con text.
however thequantificationofhowthetwoaspectsinteracti npractice of the relationship between a developer s social and t echnical skills and in particular of how the initial environment af fects the developer s socio technical balance has not been investi gated.

we rel y on methods described by mockus to conduct our quantitat ive study.
we conduct the steps outlined in the following subsec tions toobtain sufficient qualitydata.
.
retrieveraw data for the open source projects we wrote crawlers to obtain the modificationrequest mr historiesanddetailsfromtheirw ebpages.
jonas and jbossas use jira for problem tracking though they used other tracking systems in the past.
jbossas used tracke r on sourceforge prior to and migrated to jira all issues rai sed since .
jonas used gforge before october and migratedtojirabuthasn ttransferredtheissuesfromgforge .
mozilla usesbugzillatotrackissues.
weobtainedinformationfora llissues inxmlformatas wellas theactivityhistoryforeachproject from all the sources in february .
for mozilla we also used th e issues we obtained in to validate the data obtained in which included these older issues as well .
for the commerc ial project f we obtained the mr history data recorded in the mr history table of clearquest.
for projects d and k we obtaine d sablime mr historyfiles.
independent of whichsystem anmrisretrievedfrom eachmr has a history from the time somebody reported it until the ti me somebody closed it it also may remain open at the time of the study .
during that period a sequence of events take place m r is created assigned submitted tested and closed.
it may also be reassigned itsattributeschanged comments debuggingt races etc added.
each such event has an associate date time the type o f action and the developer performing the action.
the transiti on from oneactiontoanothermayinvolveachangeofactorsandsuchw ork hand offs we consider to be edges in the project workflow grap hs see appendix for precise definitions .
in this study every o bservation is an edge in such workflow graph.
more specifically we obtained thechronological sequence of tuplescontaining date and time mr id contributor id action and value.
we then creat ed a linkbetweeneverypairofcontributorsimmediatelyadjace ntinthis sequence.
the assumption is that such transfer of mr ownersh ip indicatesalikelycommunicationbetweenthesecontributo rs.
even in cases where a verbal or other type of communication does no t accompany such a hand off it still represents an artifact mediated communication as demonstrated by for example .
we considered the firstappearance of a contributor in this gr aph as thedate the contributor joinsthe project.

for all projects we paid a particular attention to identifyi ng instanceswhenacontributoridhaschangedovertime.
intradi tional projects we used multi year extracts of the organization s reportingstructuretoidentifythemappingbetweenpeopleanddev eloper ids.
foropensourceprojectsweusedthemappingbetweenthe id and the name available in xml extracts and for jbossas we als o used mailing lists.
we used various heuristics to identify m ultiple ids for the same person.
in particular ids corresponding to the same name or similarly spelled name were selected for manu al verification if the joining date of one id followed the last co ntribution date of another id associated with the same name.
for e xample injbossasdeveloper withtheidasaldhana changed hi sor her id into anil.saldhana after and that appears to be a common pattern i.e.
the period before the id was construc ted byextractingthefirstcharacterofthe firstnameandappendi ng the surname but after the migration to jira the full first name s eparated by a period from the surname were commonly used as the new id.
for mozilla and projects d f and k we identified a number of loginsthatweregenericoradministrativeonesbecausewef ocused on the behavior of ordinary contributors.
examples of such l ogins were webmaster cqadmin mozilla bugzilla and so on.
to facilitate such identification in mozilla we looked for in stances where the same id was associated with multiple names.
multip le spellings of a name are not uncommon e.g.
with or without th e middle name but some ids had tens or more associated names e.g.
bugzilla suggestingthatitwasusedforadminist rativepurposes and not suitable to measure individual developer s be havior.

thus weneedtomeasure thedevel oper s technical achievement and social activities in a software p roject 273how they represent her and the project s relative sociali ty and how the project s relative sociality affects the trajector y of developer s relativesociality.
.
measure the socio technical balance using data from six projects we model the social learning3usingthesizeofthesocialnetwork numlogins adeveloperaccumulated inthe course of resolving assigning mrs over a part icular time period i.e.
a month in this study.
according to schmid t an mr system may be considered as a social mechanism of interaction supporting the articulation of the distributed a ctivities of multiple actors with respect to the system and the field of wor k it represents.
in other words mrs represent the monitoring handling inparticular coordinationofthetasks andasoftw areproject proceeds by creating and resolving mrs. therefore we calcu late the social network of a developer by adding up all the working relationships immediately adjacent hand offs in the mr work fows she was involved in during the considered time period.
for ex ample developer alice has been involved in two mrs during a specific month in one mr she received work from developers tomandjerry andinanothermrfromdevelopers kikiandjerr y. therefore the social network of developer alice is tom kiki and jerry and itssize numlogins is three.
we measure the technical learning by the developer experien ce in particular by the number of mrs nummrs the developer participated in during a month see e.g zhou and mockus .
because developer alice has been involved in two mrs her tec hnical achievement inthat month is nummrs .
we take the ratio of the size of a developer s communication network to the number of tasks she participates in to measure the balance betweenher sociallearningand technical learning andwe callitthe relativesociality rs .the periods withhighrs would indicate that relatively more social learning is taking pla ce while the periods withlow rsare indicators of more technical lear ning.
in addition to the developer rs we also define the rs for an entire project during a month as the geometric average of the rses of individual developers active in the project during that p eriod.
we use it to measure the social environment of the project at t hat time.
in particular the periods where the rs measure is high are supposed to indicate that the project environment is more so cial.
we partition each project s time line into three types of pe riods the of the time when the project s rs has the lowest values low level of the time it has the highest values hig h level and the remaining of the time it has values in betw een medium level .
we then classify the developers according t o the type of period at the time they joined the project.
figure il lustrates the project s rs measure represented by y axis th e corresponding periods represented by the two horizontal lines s howing the boundary between low medium and high values of rs and the developer joining times represented by l h m symbols for projectf.more generally wewant toinvestigate the aspect s ofrs trajectory that are relevant todevelopment practice.
the d eveloper tenure with the project is crucial for commercial projects b ecause it takes a relatively long time for developers to become prod uctive see e.g.
and even more time to be able to do central ta sks see e.g.
e.g.
mentoring newcomers.
the ability to train and retain productive developers can therefore be consid ered as a measure of project s success.
for similar reasons the deve loper tenure may be important in open source projects.

therefore insteadofthe term learning we could have used the termexperience throughout the paper.

this choice was based on the finding by herbsleb and mockus that the size of the inflow network significantly de creased developer productivity.
in practice the reported results do not change notably if we expand the social network by includi ng developers subsequent inthe workflow graph.
.
hypotheses our primary focus is to investigate how the project environm ent atthetimeadeveloperjoinsmayimpacttheevolutionofhers ociotechnical balance.
initial environmental conditions may substantially influe nce the technological trajectories of business firms see e.g.
zy glidopoulos .
four mechanisms through which this influence may be carried out are technological paradigm dominant logic or ganizational structure and configuration.
these mechanisms act a s carriers of initialinfluences and constrain the future technol ogical developments thus restricting the possible technological t rajectories a firm can follow .
a firm is organized through individuals andtheexistenceofafirmisforthesake ofindividuals thus it sof greatinteresttolookatthetechnological trajectoriesat theindividual level.
such investigation may in turn reflect the succe ss of an organization oratalowerlevel ofasoftwareproject.
wep resume that the environment of a project when a developer joins has a big impact on her future trajectory in the project for example developer kiki becomes one of the most productive developers late r on because she has been mentored by the expert developers when s he joined.
therefore 274hypothesis .thesocialenvironmentoftheprojectwhenadeveloper joins affects her future trajectory.
as discussed in section .
the contributors who stay with t he project for alongtimeandare productive ltcs are importa nt for aproject ssuccess thereforeweprovide morespecificinst ances of hypothesis1focusingontheassociationbetweensoftwarep roject s rsand the emergence of suchimportant contributors.
during the time periods when the project sociality is low th e developers who join may receive more support and attention f rom theexistingprojectmembers because presumably theyha vemore time to spend on mentoring activities and in oss projects more appreciation of external contributions thus it is more li kely that they would staywiththe project for a longtime and be product ive.
therefore amore specificinstance ofhypothesis 1canbephr ased as hypothesis .low values of project sociality measure at the time adeveloper joins increases the probability that this d eveloper willbecome one oflong term contributors.
new people joining the project are crucial for a project s su rvival because the existing contributors eventually leave or die or may alsorunoutofnewideas.
theincreaseintheproject srsmea sure islikelytoreflectanincreaseinactivitiesthatinvolve ac tivedevelopment or external events that may raise the profile of the pro ject andprovideopportunitiesthatattractnewdevelopers.
let scallthe number of new developers joining per unit time to be intensit y of joining developers.
we expect that an active project would h ave a high intensityof joiners hypothesis .the intensity of developers joining a project is high whenthe project s sociality is high.
as stated in hypothesis the low project s rs may increase t he chances that a developer will become an ltc but the number of joiners may be too low according to hypothesis to generat e a meaningful number of ltcs or it may be high enough to generate more ltcs than periods of medium or high rs.
in an open source project the periods of low rs may indicate times of lower proj ect popularitywhenthejoinersaremorelikelytohaveamoregen uine not popularity driven interest in the project and may also have more opportunities to get deeply involved for example by b eing able to add major functionality.
both of these conditions ma y increase the probability of becoming an ltc.
in traditional pr ojects the periods of low rsmay reflect external business condition s and thus associated with lower hiring activity.
however it is n ot clear whythese twopotential avenues tobecome anltcinopen sourc e project would also be available for joiners of traditional p rojects.
therefore hypothesis .the intensity of long term contributors joining an open source project is high when the project sociality mea sure is low.
whilehypothesis 2considers the probabilityforanewcontr ibutor to become an ltc hypothesis considers the intensity of inc oming ltcs.
it is also of interest to observe if there are differ ences among ltcs depending on when they joined the project.

to investigate hypothesis we fit the learning trajectory of a developer over her tenure as a generalized additive mixed ef fects modelgamm shown in equation .
the model fits a separate curve for ltcs who joined at each level of project s rs high h low l medium m. rs s1 t m s2 t l s3 t h dvlpr.
the response is the developer s rs and the predictors includ e her tenure t the level of the project s rs when she joined l m or h and the developer s id.
we consider the developer s id as a random effect.
si i are the smoothing functions such as splines that allow fittinga regression toa curve of unknown s hape.
the basic idea of gammis to fitan unknown shape witha minimal number of parameters.
thus a tradeoff between the best fit an d fewest parameters smoothness is obtained.
if the observe d data can be reasonably explained through a linear relationship b etween the predictors and the response the fitted smoothing functi on will simply be a straight line making it equivalent to a multiple r egression.
avariety of methods can be used toattaina balance betw een thebestfitandsmoothness.

limitations we have chosen familiar projects we studied earlier to ensur e a good understanding of project s process and data collecte d from problem tracking systems.
therefore this is not a random sa mple of allprojects and thatrestrictsthe generalizabilityof o ur findings but we have more confidence that these findings are not reflecting data artifacts unrelated to software development pheno mena.
the most effective way to generalize the results we obtained from the six specific projects is to reproduce them in multiple unr elated projects.
however the inaccessibility of the relevant dat a for most traditionalprojectsmaybeanobstaclethatistosomeexten talleviatedbytheavailabilityofopensourceprojectdata.
inthis studywe focused on using only the types of data that can be easily obta ined fromanissuetrackingsystemofanyproject.

if results using multiple measures are similar we have more confidence that the discovered relationsh ip is robust with respect to these operationalizations.
for exam ple to measure the project s rs using the individual developers r s we considered three measures the first one is the ratio of the nu mber of people all developers encountered in their mr workflows to the number of mrs all developers completed in that month the s econd isthearithmeticaverage ofrsover allthe developers a nd the third is the geometric average average the logarithms of rs used inthis study.

conclusions wehavetriedtomeasurehowtheevolutionofdevelopers soc iotechnical balance is impacted by the project environment th ey encounter while joining with the hope of finding the hints of so ciotechnical congruence laws and the hope of improving softwa re production.
we classifiedthe initial project environment i ntothree relative sociality types high low and medium and invest igated howitaffectsthefuturetrajectoriesofdevelopersjoinin gtheproject.
wefoundthatinbothossandtraditionalprojects ifthepro ject is in a more social condition more people per unit time tend to j oin when the project has a low social environment the newcomers are more likely to become long term contributors.
but only in os s projectstheintensityofpeople whowouldbecome ltcsishig hest when the project isinitslow socialityperiods.
ourobservations highlight thesignificant differences amo ngthe rslearningtrajectoriesofthedeveloperswhojoininlow m edium or high sociality environments and between oss and traditio nal projects.
this finding might serve as a hint for the developer s to decide whentojoina project depending onwhom they want tobe come.
it may also be helpful for the projects to design a train ing planfornewcomerstogetpeoplewithdifferentexpertisene ededby theproject.
forexample thetrainersneedtoconsider howt ocompensate people who join at bad times if they want them to mak e moremeaningfulcontributionstotheprojectandorganizat ion.
furthermore the lessons from open source projects appear rele vant to traditional projects.
for example when the project social ity measure is low more newcomers per unit time would become ltcs.
thatmayhappenbecausetheyhavemoreopportunitiestogetm ore deeply involved have more appreciation of the project for example by being able to add major functionality or to be mentore d by existing experienced developers or simply are more likely to have a more genuine interest inthe project.
