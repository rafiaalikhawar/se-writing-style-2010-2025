currently many approaches prefer autoregressive integrated moving average arima models for this task and assume the qos attributes behavior can be linearly modeled.

to address this limitation we propose an automated forecasting approach that integrates linear and nonlinear time seri es models and automatically without human intervention selects and constructs the best suitable forecasting model to fit the qos attributes dynamic behavior.using real world qos datasets of web services we evaluate the applicability accuracy and performance aspects of the proposed approach and results show that the approach outperforms the popular existing arima models and improves the forecasting accuracy by on average .

introduction the current trend towards run time adaptable and reconfigurable systems that include dedicated quality of service qos management and control components has led to a need for automatic detection of qos problems during the system operation.
action can then be taken to ameliorate underperformance subject to the range of regulation or reconfiguration capabilities and strategies available to the system.
to detect if a qos attribute misses a predefined qos goal runtime monitoring approaches enriched with statistical decision procedures are used .
however any adaptation to solve the qos problem is always in response to a violation that has already occurred thus system users have to live with the qos problem until the remedial action has been applied.
recently qos forecasting based on time series modeling has been presented as a promising technique to predict future qos values in order to support and improve proactive qos management and qos based service selection and composition in dynamic environments.
these approaches assume that historical qos measures can be linearly modeled and use time series arima models to fit these measures and predict their future values.
researchers argue that studying the dynamic characteristic of qos attributes and proposing an efficient forecasting approach is an urgent need to improve proactive management and service selection.
in addition our analysis of real qos datasets shows that they are characterized by a high dynamic and mostly nonlinear behavior to the extent that existing arima models cannot guarantee accurate qos forecasting where these models are based on a linearity assumption .
this can introduce crucial problems such as proactively triggering unrequired adaptation s which may lead to follow up failures and increased costs.
to address this limitation we propose an automated forecasting approach which integrates linear and nonlinear tim e series models and automatically without human intervention selects and constructs the best suitable forecasting model to fit the qos dynamic behavior and provide accurate forecasts.
the approach uses arima as a linear model and self exciting threshold arma setarma as a nonlinear model because these models together are very efficient and can correctly model the complicated and dynamic qos behavior .
this approach basically consists of two components one for constructing the forecasting model andpermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

.
based on qos datasets of real world web services we evaluate the satisfaction of time series models assumptions in reality and the most suitable remedies in the case of dissatisfaction.
in addition we apply the proposed approach to these datasets especially response time and time between violations to evaluate the accuracy and performance of our automated approach.

the proposed approach is discussed in section .
evaluation study of the proposed approach is reported in section .

.
time series modeling background in this section we present time series models especially arima and setarma and then discuss their main assumptions.
.
time series models .
.
arima models autoregressive integrated moving average arima models were originally proposed by box and jenkins and they are commonly used in practice to model time series data to forecast the future values.
simply a time series yt is said to be modeled by an arma model of orders pandq denoted by arma p q if it satisfies p b yt q b t where t is a sequence of independent normal errors with zero mean and variance 2. the backshift operator b is defined as bxt xt .
the autoregressive polynomial is p b parenleftbig 1b 2b2 pbp parenrightbig with order p and q b parenleftbig 1b 2b2 qbq parenrightbig is the moving average polynomial with order q. the autoregressive and moving average coefficients are 1 2 p tand 1 2 q trespectively.
the model can be simplified and written as yt p summationdisplay i 1 iyt i q summationdisplay i 1 i t i t where ytis the current stationary observation yt ifor i ... p are the past stationary observations tis the current error and t ifori ... q are the past errors.
ifddifferences have been done to transform the original non stationary time series zt into the stationary one yt then zt is said to be generated by an autoregressive integrated moving average arima model of orders p d and qand denoted by arima p d q .
.
.
setarma models self exciting threshold arma models setarma were introduced by tong and lim and studied in details by tong .
the basic idea of these models is to start with a linear model and then allow the model parameters to vary according to the past values of the time series process.
in other words the time series process is assumed to follow one of a finite set of different linear models with thresholds for the passage from one member of this set to another.
a setarma model of order l p1 p2 pl q1 q2 ql or setarma l p1 p2 pl q1 q2 ql can be written in the form yt j pj summationdisplay i 1 j iyt i qj summationdisplay i 0 j s t iif r j yt dp rj where dpis a positive integer known as the delay parameter j i j s i pj s qj j l are model parameters and braceleftbig j t bracerightbig j l are a sequence of iid random variables with mean zero and variance 2 each being independent of one another and of yt .
the ordered constants r0 r rl are known as the thresholds.
when qj j l the setarma model is reduced to the self exciting threshold autoregressive mode l setar l p1 p2 pl .
similarly the self exciting threshold moving average model setma l q1 q2 ql is a special case of setarma when pj j l .
if the autoregressive orders and moving average orders are the same for all regimes and equal to p and q respectively the setarma model takes the form yt j p summationdisplay i 1 j i yt i q summationdisplay i 0 j i t i if r j yt dp rj which is setarma l p q where pand qare repeated l times.
.
assumptions of time series models the main assumptions of time series models are serial dependency normality stationarity and invertibility .serial dependency in order for time series data to be effectively characterized using time series models it should be serially dependent autocorrelated over time.
if the time series data is random e.g.white noise time series models cannot be used to forecast future values and other forecasting methods should be investigated to be used for this task.
.normality time series models assume that the given time series data is normally distributed as all the computations of identifying estimating and evaluating its parameters are based on a normal distribution.
in the case of non normally distributed time series data it can be approximated to normal distribution using specific power transformations .
.stationarity roughly speaking stationarity means the time series has constant mean and variance no trend and same variation over time.
when a time series has no trend it is called stationary in the mean and when it has same variation over time it is called stationary in the variance.
however if the original time series is131non stationary it can be transformed into a stationary in the mean using differences and into a stationary in the variance using power transformations.
.invertibility time series models that are used to forecast the future values should be invertible.
this means error terms can be expressed as a weighted sum of current and prior observations and prior errors to enable forecasting.
for example in the simplest case ma error terms can be written as t yt t and it can be proved that they are equivalent to t yt summationtext i 1 iyt i. this model cannot be used to forecast future errors except that thas a finite value which requires that to be less than one and this is called the invertibility concept.
investigating whether the given time series data satisfies these assumptions is crucial task as unsatisfied assumptio ns leads to incorrect time series models which in turn will provide inaccurate forecasts.
in section we discuss in detail how these assumptions can be verified and if they are not satisfied how we can deal with this issue through a running example.
.
the proposed approach the proposed forecasting approach integrates arima and setarma models to capture the dynamic behaviour of qos attributes and accurately forecast their future values .
in brief summary based on the given software system behaviour in terms of qos attributes our approach selects and constructs an appropriate time series model and uses it to describe how well the software system behaves and then gives accurate forecasts for that behaviour.
technically it uses the collected qos data to construct the time series model and continuously using the new obtained qos data to update this model and provide accurate qos forecasts.
this approach consists of two components one for constructing the time series model and the other for forecastin g future qos values and evaluating the accuracy of this forecasting as explained in figure .
for more illustration how this approach works the functionalities of each component will be explained in the following with a running example of a response time data set which is referred as ws rt of a web service lodge used by messagenet1to allow customers to send and receive sms mms and efax.
.
time series model construction process the main task of this component is to construct the time series model.
it is achieved through seven phases .
.
data preparation p1 before constructing any time series model the given time series data should satisfy the underlying assumptions of ti me series models which are described above.
consequently in this phase the main task is to check for these assumptions and if they are not satisfied try to find the suitable transformation to approximately fulfill the assumptions.
the proposed approach uses statistical tests to check for the assumptions.
first the approach checks for serial depe ndency using the runs test .
if this condition is satisfied it checks for normality using the kolmogorov smirnov k s test and for stationarity using the kpss test .
series model construction process continuous forecasting processcollected qos data new qos data p9 evaluate forecasting accuracy p8 compute forecast and residualsis it ok?no yes p1 check satisfy assumptions p2 identify model order p3 test for nonlinearity p5 specify adequate models p6 estimate specified models p7 check diagnostics and select the best modelnonlinear?
p4 identify delay parameter and threshold values noyes forecasts figure the proposed forecasting approach for achieving normality and stationarity in the variance power transformations especially box cox transformatio ns can be used.
for explanation the box cox transformation yt of a time series ztis given as follows yt zt z t where the value of is chosen to reduce the variation of the time series ztand to achieve normality and stationarity in the variance.
regarding stationarity in the mean differenc es of non stationary time series can be used and produce a stationary one.
for example let zt be the original time series and it is non stationary in the mean but it has a trend over time.
it can be transformed into a stationary one yt using the first difference yt zt zt .
example the proposed approach verifies whether ws rt satisfies the assumptions as follows serial dependency to verify the serial dependency the approach uses a runs test to test the null hypothesis tha t the time series are mutually independent.
if this hypothesi s is rejected that means our time series data is serially depen dent.
the approach has applied the runs test to ws rt and concluded that it is significantly serially dependent wi th a p value .
.
normality to check whether the data is normally distributed the approach uses the k s test to test the null hypothesis that the data is drawn from a normal distribution.
if this hypothesis is rejected the approach will sear ch for a suitable transformation for the data to be approximately normally distributed.
the approach has applied ks test to ws rt and concluded that it is not normally distributed however the log transformation provided approx imately normally distributed data referred as ws lrt where the p value of the k s test equals to .
.
stationarity our approach has used the kpss test to test whether the time series ws lrt is stationary and found that it is not stationary where the p value equals to1320.
.
.
using the first difference the approach concluded that the differenced data referred as ws dlrt is stationary where p value .
.
therefore the output of this phase is the dataset ws dlrt that satisfies the assumptions and can be used in the next phases.
.
.
model order identification p2 after preparing the time series data the model order identification phase starts.
this phase selects the best sui table parameters pandqfor the time series model.
this is mainly based on an evaluation of the autocorrelation function acf and the partial autocorrelation function pacf and achieved as follows if the acf curve decays and the pacf curve cuts off after plags an ar or setar model of order p is adequate to model the processed data.
in contrast if the acf curve cuts off after qlags and pacf curve decays an ma or setma model of order q is adequate.
in addition if both acf and pacf curves cut off after q andplags respectively an arma p q or setarma p q models are adequate.
identifying the values of pandqis important for the next phase p3 to test the nonlinearity and decide what model class is statistically preferred to be used i.e.
arima or setarma.
example the acf and pacf of the prepared data ws dlrt are computed and plotted in figure .
from this figure it can be seen that acf decays and pacf cuts off after lags.
therefore the identified order of a time series model is p and q .
figure acf and pacf values of ws dlrt .
.
non linearity test p3 in this phase the approach uses the hansen test to test for the nonlinearity.
basically the approach tests th e null hypothesis that the given qos data can be modeled by a linear arima model against the alternative hypothesis that it is statistically recommended to be modeled by a setarma model.
the main inputs for this test are the parameter p which is identified in p2 and the delay parameter dp.
as the value of the delay parameter is unknown the approach uses all its possible values which are less than the parameter pand this value can be refined later based on the test statistic values.
based on the outcome of this test the approach specifies the type of time series modeling i.e.
it is arima or setarma.example because the approach found in p2 that p it runs the hansen test two times with inputs p and dp and p and dp and concludes that this dataset has significantly p values .
nonlinear behavior and requires to be modeled by setarma model.
.
.
delay parameter and thresholds identification p4 the delay parameter and thresholds values can be identified from the output of the hansen test and they are the values that correspond the largest statistic value.
example the output of the hansen test is depicted in table .
it is clear from this table that the delay parameter dp and the threshold value is .
table hansen test results delay threshold statistic value estimate value p value .
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
adequate models specification p5 after specifying the order and type of the time series model the proposed approach specifies a combination of adequate models for the given qos dataset.
this combination is based on the dependency structure of the given qos dataset and under estimation and over estimation methods .
example as the identified model order is p and q and the model type is setarma then based on the under estimation and over estimation methods the iden tified models for ws dlrt are setarma setarma and setarma .
.
.
models estimation p6 in the model estimation phase values of the parameters of the specified adequate models in phase p5 are analysed to provide the best fit to the given time series data.
maximum likelihood estimation mle and conditional least squares cls are the most commonly used methods to estimate arima and setarma models respectively.
therefore these two methods are recommended to be used by our proposed approach.
example after identifying the adequate setarma models in p5 the approach has used the cls method for each model to estimate the parameters and the estimates are depicted in table .
.
.
models checking and the best model selection p7 model checking involves testing the diagnostics of the time series models to identify whether they are satisfied.
if one or more diagnostics are not satisfied the current model is inadequate and it is necessary to be removed from the set of models specified in p5.
the following diagnostics can be performed to check the fitted time series models .
estimates significance test each estimate is tested to check whether it is statistically significant using the t test.
if all the estimates are significant they are retained in the133model and otherwise the model requires a recalculation using only the significant estimates.
.
invertibility and stationarity conditions satisfaction in the model checking phase invertibility and stationarity conditions can be checked as follows station arity condition sum of the coefficients of the ar model should be less than one it means that summationtextp i 1 i and invertibility condition sum of the coefficients of the ma model should be less than one it means that summationtextp i 1 i .
.
residuals randomness residuals of the well fitted model will be uncorrelated.
for this condition residuals can be analyzed and a hypothesis test i.e.
the box pierce test can be performed to make a statistically significan t decision regarding this condition.
once the specified models have been estimated and checked the best model is selected based on akaike s information cri terion aic where the best model is the one that has the minimum aic value.
example the approach computed the t test for all the estimates and its p values are depicted in table .
it is clea r that all the estimates of the first two models are significant and the third one has insignificant estimates.
therefore our algorithm will ignore the third model and focus only on the first two models and it is evident from table that these models satisfy invertibility and stationarity condi tions.
to analyze the residuals the approach has used box pierce test and concluded that the two models residuals are uncorrelated.
now based on aic value the approach needs to select the best model of these two.
the aic values for the models are .
and .
respectively.

continuously forecasting process this component uses the best selected model and the new obtained qos data to continuously forecast the future qos values through phase p8 .
additionally through phase p9 it computes forecasting errors and uses the box pierce test to evaluate the forecasting accuracy.
if the forecasts a re inaccurate the approach will return back to p5 to re specif y other adequate models based on the new qos data and the information obtained from the forecasting errors analysis .
example the constructed setarma model is used to forecast the future values of ws tr and the one step ahead forecasts of the last observations are depic ted in figure .
figure actual vs. predicted values of ws rt .
ev aluation in this section we investigate various applicability accu racy and performance aspects of the proposed approach and then discuss threats to validity of our work.
.
experiment setup to investigate the applicability performance and accuracy aspects of the proposed approach we identify the main research questions as follows.
rq1 to what extent the real world qos datasets satisfy the time series models assumptions and what are the most suitable remedies where the data does not satisfy these assumptions?
rq2 is the proposed approach able to capture the dynamic behavior of qos attributes and improve the forecasting accuracy comparing to arima models?
rq3 what time is required for the approach to automatically construct and use the forecasting model?
rq4 do the approach s accuracy and performance depend on the given number of qos observations?
in order to address rq1 we have invoked real world web services using the tool ws dream and computed their response time and time between violations tbv .
the response time is computed by measuring the time taken between sending a request to a service and receiving a response .
on the other hand the tbv is computed as the time between two violations of a predefined response time s constraint.
the description of all these real world web servic es and their response time datasets are available on line1 and the description of a sample of these services is reported in table .
we analyzed the statistical characteristics of the se response time datasets and their satisfaction for time seri es models assumptions.
in order to answer rq2 we apply the proposed forecasting approach and arima models to the response time and tbv datasets.

to address rq3 the time needed for the approach to automatically construct and use the forecasting model for the given response time and tbv datasets through the different phases depicted in figure was computed.

results rq1.
the satisfaction of time series models assumptions in reality the analysis results of the statistical characteristics of the response time datasets and their satisfaction for time seri es model assumptions are presented in table and discussed as follows .
serial dependency we found about .
of the real datasets are serially dependent.
that means in .
of the real cases time series models are suitable to be used to forecast the future software system response times.
.
normality the analysis concludes that most of the datasets are non normally distributed .
however using the box cox power transformation can transform the data to be normally distributed and we experienced that of these box cox transformation values are in the interval .
this result implies that normality assumption can be achieved using power transformation and based on our practical experience we can report that the logarithmic transformation can be used in most of the cases and provides symmetric if not always normally distributed data.
.
stationarity based on our analysis we can report that about .
of the real datasets are stationary and do not require any transformations or preparation activities.
of the non stationary real datasets .
and .
can be transformed to be stationary using the first and the second differences respectively.
.
linearity we applied the hansen test to these response time datasets and found that about .
can be linearly modeled however for the majority .
it is statistically recommended to be modeled by setarma models.
based on this empirical analysis we can conclude that most of the real response time datasets are serially dependent and can be transformed to be stationary and normally distributed.
this implies that time series models especia lly setarma can be used to forecast the future qos values with some suitable transformations and preparation activi ties for the original datasets to satisfy their assumptions .135table the satisfaction of time series models assumption s serial normality stationarity assum.

rq2.
the forecasting accuracy of the proposed approach comparing to arima models the boxplots of the relative prediction errors are depicted in figure while mape values of the proposed approach and arima models are reported separately for each dataset in table .
the boxplots indicate that the proposed approach can provide more accurate forecasts than arima model where the prediction errors exhibited by this approach are significantly lower than those of arima models.
this result is confirmed by the mann whitney test p value .
.
more precisely the proposed approach produces a mape .
compared to .
produced by an arima model this is a forecasting accuracy improvement of about .
.
the boxplots show another observation that the variation of prediction errors exhibited by the proposed approach is significantly lower than that of arima models.
where of the prediction errors are within .
.
with range .
for the proposed approach and within .
.
with range .
for arima models.
this indicates that the proposed approach s forecasting accuracy is more stabl e across different qos datasets than that of arima models.
for each web service the results in table show that of the web services response datasets have a nonlinear behavior and require setarma models to be modeled and predicted and it is clear that the proposed approach outperforms arima models in these cases.
this result is confirmed by the mann whitney test with all the p values .
.
the lowest and highest accuracy improvement of the approach compared to an arima models are in the cases of ws tbv where the rai is about .
and ws rt where the rai is about .
respectively.
in general we can conclude that the proposed approach in .
of the cases provides much more accurate forecasts than those of the popular existing arima models with accuracy improvements while in the other cases .
both approaches give the same forecasting accuracy.
figure boxplots of relative prediction errorsrq3.
the time required for the approach to automatically construct and use the forecasting model the time required for the approach to automatically construct and use the forecasting model for the response time and tbv datasets is computed and reported in table .
this table indicates that the time required for the approach to automatically construct the forecasting model is on the average about .
seconds.
as a comparison between the proposed approach and arima model the time needed to automatically construct only an arima model is computed and reported in table .
as expected results show that arima models need less time than the proposed approach and this is because the approach involves more computations to check for nonlinearity.
it is worth mentioning that the construction of the forecasting model is done only in the beginning or after triggering adaptations.
on the other hand the time required to use the constructed model to forecast future qos values is very small and the same for both the proposed approach and arima model about milliseconds where the constructed model is used by only substituting the new obtained qos value in the equation without more computations.
rq4.
dependency of the approach s accuracy and performance on the number of observations the time needed to automatically construct the forecasting model and the mape value produced by the approach with respect to different number of observations are computed and depicted in figure .
it is clear from this figure that the approach s accuracy in terms of the mape value and performance in terms of the required time to construct the forecasting model depend on the number of observations used to construct the model.
the figure shows that the mape value is a decreasing function of the observations number and on the other hand the required time is an increasing function.
consequently a trade off between the approach s accuracy and performance levels is required .
this trade off is shown in figure and we can conclude that observations give acceptable levels of accuracy an d performance where mape .
and required time .
seconds.
regarding the time required to use the constructed model to forecast the future qos values it is worth mentioning that it does not depend on the number of observations as it is only substituting the new obtained qos value in the constructed model s equation.
we compute the required time to use the constructed models and we find it varies from to milliseconds regardless the number of observations.
.
threats to validity the threats to internal validity include the qos datasets being used to evaluate the proposed approach and statistical tests being used to analyze forecasting results.
to re duce the impact of these threats we have considered response time measures of real world web services to reflect a realistic situation of qos attributes.

figure required time to construct the model and mape value vs. sample size non parametric tests to analyze the results and address the research questions where no constraints are imposed on the datasets distribution.
on the other hand external validity is threatened if obtained results cannot be generalized.
although we have applied the approach for the response time datasets of real world web services belonging to different domains further applications to other software systems and web services are desirable.
additionally we focus only on response time and time between violations and the generalizations to other qos attributes should be considered in future studies.
for example similarly to the time between violations the approach can be straightforwardly applied to the time between failures as a reliability metric.
.
related work as the scale and complexity of software systems continue to grow research on adaptive software systems has recently shifted onto qos attributes prediction.
this qos prediction is exploited to support and improve proactive runtime adaptation and service selection and composition.

this approach improves the availability of the storage subsystem effectively and decreases tco total cost of ownership by proactively decreasing the possibility of i o bottlenecks.
recently solomon and litoiu present a dynamic predictive model based on linear regression and arima models to predict with more confidence system performance degradations.
they also propose a feedback based evolution architecture that can proactively us ing these performance degradations predictions tune and opti mize software systems.
current studies propose failure prediction tec hniques to enable and enhance proactive failure management by avoiding possible failures.
in fu and xu develop a spherical covariance model with an adjustable timescale parameter to quantify the temporal correlation and a stocha stic model to characterize spatial correlation.
they cluste r failure events based on their correlations and predict thei r future occurrences using autoregressive time series model s. in addition zhang and fu propose a framework for autonomic failure management with failure prediction functionality to achieve proactive self management of failure s and resources in networked computer systems.
this framework analyzes node cluster and system wide failure behaviors and forecasts the prospective failure occurrences usi ng linear time series models especially autoregressive mode ls and based on quantified failure dynamics.
recently metzger discusses how accurate proactive adaptations can be achieved by improving the failure prediction techniques that trigger the adaptations and by dynamically estimating the accuracy of the predicted failures at runtime.
however this work uses the arithmetic average as a simple prediction model it recommends using the advanced time series prediction models in the future work.
in the domain of qos based service selection and composition li et al.
propose a web service selection algorith m based on qos prediction mechanism.
this algorithm uses time series modeling based on structural equations to fit qos values of web services and dynamically predicts their futu re changes to support adaptive services selection.
godse et al .
propose a method that combines monitoring and extrapolation methodologies based on arima models to predict service performance.
this method is used to support automating dynamic service selection methodology which is robust in the face of varying qos.
recently cavallo et al.
present an empirical study aimed at comparing different approaches for qos forecasting namely the use of average and current values linear models and arima models.
the study is performed on qos data obtained by monitoring the execution of ten real services for months.
it concludes that the use of arima forecasting has the best compromise in ensuring a good prediction error being sensible tooutliers and being able to predict likely violations of qos constraints.
in these existing qos forecasting approaches researchers conclude that initially time series arima models are a good statistical tool to model the dynamic behaviours of qos attributes and forecast their future values.
however godse et al.
report that studying the dynamic characteristic of qos attributes and proposing an efficient forecasting approach is a crucial need to support proactive management and service selection.
moreover cavallo et al.
conclude based on their empirical study that a good forecasting of qos violations is still a challenging issue and further ap proaches able to better deal with this issue should be invest igated.
in addition our analysis of real qos datasets shows that they are characterized by a high dynamic and mostly nonlinear behavior to the extent that existing arima models cannot guarantee accurate qos forecasting.
in our current work we propose an automated forecasting approach that addresses this limitation by integrating linear and no nlinear time series models and improves the forecasting accuracy of qos attributes.
.
conclusion and future work in this paper we have proposed an automated qos forecasting approach based on integrating linear and nonlinear time series models that is able to correctly capture and model the dynamic qos behavior and improve the forecasting accuracy.
this approach basically consists of two components one for constructing the forecasting model and the other for continuously forecasting future qos values an d evaluating the accuracy of this forecasting.
the proposed approach was applied to real world qos datasets of web services especially response time and time between violations and results demonstrate its accuracy and performance in forecasting qos measures.
in addition we concluded that most of the real qos datasets are serially dependent and can be transformed to be stationary normally distributed which implies that time series models especially setarma models are most likely suitable to model qos measures and forecast their future values.
therefore this new automated qos forecasting approach can be integrated at runtime into the existing approaches to improve proactive qos management and qos based service selection and composition.
as a future work the overhead of the proposed approach needs to be carefully evaluated.
similarly to reduce the co nsumed memory a sliding window approach for the observed qos attributes values needs to be investigated.
