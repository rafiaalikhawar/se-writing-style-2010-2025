inadequate training could likely lead to project delay or failure.
in this paper we propose an approach named yoda young and newc omerdeveloper assistant aimed at identifying and recommending mentors in software projects by mining data from mailing lists and versioning systems.
candidate mentors are identified among experienced developers who actively interact with newcomers.
then when a newcomer joins the project yoda recommends her a mentor that among the available ones has already discussed topics relevant for the newcomer.
yoda has been evaluated on software repositories of five open source projects.
we have also surveyed some developers of these projects to understand whether mentoring was actually performed in their projects and asked them to evaluate the mentoring relations yoda identified.
results indicate that top committers are not always the most appropriate mentors and show the potential usefulness of yoda as a recommendation system to aid project managers in supporting newcomers joining a software project.

.a skill is equally important in software projects where training new developers is a crucial activity.
when a newcomer joins a project she needs to be trained from many different points of view such as project architecture and implementation details development guidelines and organizationa l aspects.
training is often performed by one or more mentorsthat during the early stages of project participation for a newcomer help her in the work and actively discuss with her project details.
once the newcomer has been trained she can continue to work autonomously.
a relatively similar process may occur in open source projects where in most cases the interaction between the mentor s and the newcomer occurs through electronic means e.g.
mailing lists or issue tracking systems.
a newcomer would likely first start participating to discussion actively and then would gradually start to commit changes in the source code repository.
previous studies surveying software projects indicated that mentoring of project newcomers is highly desirable .
differently from the problem of bug triaging which requires to determine a developer who solved in the past a similar task mentoring requires to find developers having the ability to effectively communicate and train other people.
hence a good mentor is someone that i has enough expertise about the topic of interest for the newcomer and that ii demonstrated to have enough ability to help other peopl e. in this paper we propose yoda young and newc omer developer assistant an approach to identify likely mentors in software projects by mining data from software repositories and to support the project manager in recommending possible mentors when a newcomer joins a project.
yoda is inspired by the arnetminer2search engine for academic researchers in computer science which identifies relations between students and advisors based on a series of heuristics .
shortly given a pair of researchers jimandalice arnetminer suggests that jimcould have been the mentor ofalicebased on four factors f1 jimandalicepublished together a large number of papers f2 jimhas more publications than alice f3 jimis older than alicein terms of activity and f4 jimandalicestarted to publish together as soon as alicestarted her activity.
even if the studentadvisor relationship in academia is one to one the metrics employed by arnetminer allow to also identify one to many relationships.
to identify candidate mentors in the past history of a software project we consider as potential indicators on mentorship cases where i the mentor and the newcomer exchange a large number of emails in the first phases of the newcomer ii the mentor has performed a larger activity in the project than the newcomer in terms of exchanged emails iii the mentor has a longer experience in the project than the newcomer iv the mentor and the newcomer start to exchange emails as soon as the newcomer joins the project and v the mentor is very active in terms of performed commits.
the set of indicators above defined is inspired to thearnetminer although metrics being used are different for example co authorship is replaced by level of communication plus differently from arnetminer yoda needs to account both communication activity measured in terms of exchanged emails and technical activity measured in terms of commits .
once being able to identify likely mentors in the past history of a software project yoda recommends mentors each time a newcomer joins the project by selecting among the candidate mentors previously identified those who discuss similar topics to what the newcomer is discussing.
we have evaluated yoda on data from five open source projects apache httpd the freebsd kernel postgresql python and samba.
first we investigated which factors or combination of factors provide more accurate indicator of mentoring.
then we evaluated the accuracy of yoda when recommending mentors for a newcomer.
finally we also present the results of a preliminary survey conducted with some people involved in the suggested mentoring relationships of the five projects to understand i whether what we identified was actually true and ii to understand how mentoring was performed and if it was performed in that project.
the paper is organized as follows.
section describes yoda the approach proposed to identify and recommend mentors.
section describes the empirical study aimed at evaluating yoda on the five open source projects.
section reports the study results.
section provides a qualitative discussion of the empirical study performed while section discussesthelimitationsandthreatstovalidityofbothyod a andofthestudy.

how to identify mentors to recommend mentors yoda first identifies a list of available mentors by mining mailing lists and versioning systems.
then it analyzes the requests for help issued by a newcomer and identifies a list of candidate mentors that could help her.
the next sections detail the approach we use to i identify mentors from historical data of existing projects and ii to recommend mentors when a newcomer joins a project.
.
who could be a good mentor?
to identify mentors in software projects we define factors inspired by the ones arnetminer uses.
however we replace the activity of co authoring a paper with the activity of exchanging emails and in addition we consider the technical activity of a candidate mentor in terms of number of commits f1 captures whether after a newcomer joins a project she mainly collaborates with a specific person.
we measure this as the percentage of emails a newcomer exchanges with an older project member in the first period we set this to one month after joining theproject out of the total number of emails exchanged in that period.
f2 captures the difference of the amount of discussion activity carried out by mentors and newcomers in terms of the number of emails exchanged.
f3 captures the age difference between the newcomer and the likely mentor i.e.
the difference in months between the date when the newcomer exchanged her first email in the project and the date when the likely mentor did.
f4 tells whether the mentor is one of the people the newcomer starts to collaborate first.
it is defined in terms of time difference in months between the first email exchanged by a newcomer and the first email the newcomer exchanged with the likely mentor.
f5 considers the number of commits performed by a candidate mentor as an indicator of the past technical activity performed by the candidate mentor.
to allow aggregating the five factors we normalize them in the interval and then aggregate them into a score defined as summationdisplay i 1wi fi wherewiis the importance weight attributed to fi.
determining appropriate weights wiforfi and as a consequence also whether each of the fiis considered or not is part of the empirical evaluation and will be detailed in section .
.
by using the score defined above it is possible from the past history of a project to rank all other developers with the aim of identifying the list of available mentors that can be suggested to newcomers.
the higher the rank the higher the likelihood that the developer played the role of mentor for the considered newcomer.
once the developers have been ranked a threshold is used to cut the ranked list and identify the top related developers that represent the candidate mentors.
defining a good threshold a priori to cut the ranked list is challenging because a newcomer could have one or more mentors.
thus weuseascaledthreshold t usedinprevious work on traceability recovery based on the values of the factors computed considering the newcomer iand the top developers in the ranked list ti topi wheretopiis the value of the factor between the newcomer iand the top developer in the ranked list while .
the defined threshold is used to remove from the ranked list developers that have a factor value lower than of the factor value between the newcomer and the top ranked developer.
.
building the project committers communication network we identify communication between developers by analyzing mailing lists and by linking names email in mailing lists to committer ids extracted from the versioning repository.
the link to versioning repositories is needed since we are interested to select people who committed changes to the project repository.
given two mailing list contributors tomandjohn we assume a social interaction between them if the mailing listcontributor tomsends at least one email to johnthrough the mailing list.
for the purpose of our study other than just extracting the network we also need to keep track of all messages exchanged by mailing list contributors over time.
mailing list contributors and their social interactions are extracted from mailing list messages by identifying the sender name and email address and whenever available the recipient reply to name and email address.
clearly since messages can be sent to a mailing list rather than to single addresses we assume that i tomandjohncommunicate if there is a direct message with tomas sender and john as recipient or vice versa or i if johnanswers even if replying to the mailing list to a thread initiated by tom or to which tomhas previously replied.
whenbuildingthecontributors network weneedtounify the names belonging to the same person i.e.
cases of people referring themselves differently e.g.
john fitzgerald smith john f. smith john smith orj.
smith.
weuseanapproach similar to the one proposed by bird et al.
that we also applied to analyze mailing lists for a different research .
we use similar heuristics to map versioning system ids to mailing list names emails which could be straightforward in cases where the committer id is a full name and or an email e.g.
in projects adopting git as versioning system while it is less obvious when short ids are used such in the case of many cvs repositories .
specifically we use heuristics to match ids composed of initials to contributor names e.g.
mapping where this does not induce ambiguities jfktojohn fitzgerald kennedy or finding mailing list contributor names tobelinkedtocommitteridslike johnsmith orjsmith trying to compose mailing list contributors first and last names or first middle name initials and last name.
further details can be found in a previous paper by canfora et al.

recommending mentors when a contributor joins a project she needs to become knowledgeable on a specific set of topic s .
the project manager needs to find a mentor for this newcomer that is a contributor that a demonstrated already to be a mentor in the past and b actually worked discussed topics related to those the newcomer is going to work.
as for requirement a we use the method defined in section .
to identify available mentors in the past project history.
turning to requirement b we need to select among the available contributors that demonstrated to be mentors in the past the ones that had enough expertise on the topic s which the newcomer is going to work on.
rather than proposing a novel approach to identify the most appropriate mentor for a given topic we use approaches similar to what proposed in the past for bug triaging which proposed to assign a bug to a developer that in the past worked on a bug having a textually similar bug report.
specifically let us suppose a newcomer pjoins the project at time tx and let us consider the set of nmentors m m1 ...m n identified using the method described in section .
in the period before tx.
we instantiate an information retrieval ir process to rank the available mentors where each document diwithi ...nconsists of the union of the text of all emails exchanged by the mentor mibeforetx while the query qpis represented by a request for help submitted by the newcomer p. in a live setting when yoda would be instantiated as a tool the request for help can be explicitly submitted by thenewcomer when she joins the project.
for the purpose of our empiricalstudy sinceweareworkingonpastdatafromopen source projects we simulated the query by considering the union of the emails sent by the newcomer during the first week when she joined the project i.e.
within one week after the first email.
we consider a week as a time span on the one hand long enough for a newcomer to send emails and precisely ask what kind of help she needs e.g.
taking the first email only could be considered too vague on the other hand not so long to have an unrealistic scenario.
both documents and query are processed by removing english stop words performing stemming using porter stemming and indexing the text corpus using word frequencies.
we use raw frequencies tf rather than the widely usedtf idf as our aim is to mach similar corpus rather than to discriminate different documents reason for what tf idfresults useful.
then we compare the query qpwith eachdiusing the asymmetric dice coefficient dicep summationtextn j 1tfjqp tfjdi summationtextn j 1tfjqp tfjqp wherenis the size of the vocabulary of all words contained in our documents tfjqpandtfjdiare the raw frequencies of thejthdictionary term in the query and di respectively.
in other words the asymmetric dice coefficient captures how much text of the newcomer s request for help is covered by the mentor s emails.
we use it instead of the cosinecoefficient because the dice coefficient does not penalize mentors having email corpus that contains much text not contained in the newcomer s request.
.
empirical study definition thegoalof this study is to evaluate the performances of yoda in identifying mentors in software projects and in recommending mentors for project newcomers.
the quality focusis concerned with the capability to precisely identify andrecommendmentorsthat i hadamentoringexperience in the past and ii have discussed topics related to the newcomer needs.
the contextconsists of discussions extracted frommailinglistsandchangesextractedfromversioningsystemsforfiveopensourceprojects namelyapachehttpd the freebsd kernel postgresql python and samba.
the five projects are different in terms of size and application domain.
apache httpd is an open source http server freebsd is a free open source unix operating system postgresql is a database management system dbms python isawell knownscriptinglanguage andsambaacross operating system layer for printer and file sharing.
the top part of table reports key information about the five projects and above all of their mailing lists and versioning systems namely project url time period analyzed size range in kloc number of mailing list contributors mc number of committers in the versioning systems cm their intersection mc cm and number of emails exchanged by mc cm i.e.

.
study procedure the study addresses the following research questions rq1 how can we identify mentors from the past history of a software project?
this question aims at investigating whether particular combinations of the factorstable characteristics of the five projects analyzed and o f the training and test sets for evaluating yoda.
variable apache httpd freebsd postgresql python samba project url .org h ttp period considered size range knloc mailing list contribs mc committers cm mc cm emails exchanged by mc cm period training set period test set of mentors training set of newcomers training set of newcomers test set f1 f5described in section .
can be used to identify mentors and how good are such combinations compared with some baselines e.g.
using as mentors the project managers or the top project contributors.
rq2 to what extent would it be possible to recommend mentors to newcomers joining a software project?
this research question investigates how accurately could yoda recommend a mentor among those identified in rq1 for a newcomer that joins the project and is willing to work on a certain topic and how such a prediction compares with a baseline alternative i.e.
suggesting owners top committers of artifacts traced to the first emails the newcomer sends when joining the project.
to address rq1 we use different combinations of f1 f5to identify for each newcomer joining a project a ranked list of candidate mentors and then we evaluate them manually.
it is worthwhile to recall that such a metrics combination suggests a ranked list of candidate mentors for each newcomer by observing the past project history without however requiring a training set the approach is unsupervised and that in the context of rq1we are only interested to see whether the f1 f5metrics can identify good mentors without checking whether the mentor has appropriate skills required by the newcomer we deal with such an issue in rq2 .
first we perform a calibration of the weights in equation .
we consider different possible combinations of f1 f5 i.e.
all ones with equal weight single factors alone all possible pairs all groups of three and four factors.
it is important to note that by considering f5 normalized number of commits alone we provide a sort of baseline for our technique because the number of commits is a metric often used to identify experts or at least code ownership in software projects .
then we give varying weights to the five factors with the aim of investigating whether there are factors that are more important than others.
for example for combinations of three factors say f1 f2 f3 we consider other than the combination with equal weights i.e.
.
f1 .
f2 .
f3 the following cases i one factor weighted more than the others e.g.
.
f1 .
f2 .
f3 and similarly forf2andf3 and ii two factors weighted more than the other e.g.
.
f1 .
f2 .
f3 and similarly for f1 f3 or f2 f3 .
to validate the candidate newcomer mentor pairs one of the authors and another phd student not aware of how yoda works manually inspected independently discussing cases where they disagreed the communication between the newcomer and the mentor.
the pair mentor newcomer isclassified as a true positive if there is a clear evidence of cases in which the newcomer asked help to and received help from the mentor otherwise it is classified as a false positive.
to address rq2 we split the project history into two periods a first period training set in whichwe identify the set mof people who have been identified as candidate mentors using the most suitable combination of factors determined inrq1 and a second period test set for which we aim at recommending mentors for project newcomers.
for each project we have chosen training and test set in order to have a balanced number of newcomers in the two sets see the bottom part of table .
for each newcomer iidentified in the test set we identify the topkmentors mj m that exhibit the most similar discussion to the newcomer request for help.
for each possible newcomer we produce a ranked list of krecommended mentors3 as in realistic scenarios it can happen that the most suitable mentor is not available and one has to choose the second best the third best and so on.
since in the context of a post mortem analysis of data from open source projects like the one we are we do not have available other sources of requests for help we assume that the topic on which a newcomer requires helps is contained in the first emails she exchanges in the project.
we define below in the study settings how the number of emails has been chosen.
then for each newcomer iin the test set we identify mentor s using the approach described in section .
manually validate it compare with the recommended mentor and report the number and percentage of pairs for which the recommendation was correct or incorrect.
in addition to such a manual validation we consider also forrq2 a baseline i.e.
an alternative way of suggesting experts.
to this aim we trace the textual corpus of the newcomer early emails onto source code files using an approach proposed by bacchelli et al.
.
briefly such approach aims at matching file names or class names in the email text.
in some cases out of times in our study the mapping is straightforward because the emails contain a file name including extension and even in some cases a complete path.
in other cases the email only contained one or more words that were also file names which could lead to possible imprecisions e.g.
the word main might not refer to a file .
to deal with this imprecision the resulting traceability links were also manually validated.
after that we took the list of top committers for the files traced onto the emails and consider such a list as an alternative way of recommending mentors.

surveying project developers as a further evaluation after having identified candidate pairs of mentor newcomer we surveyed these developers by sending them an email explaining them the purpose of our research activity and asking them to complete an on line survey questionnaire built using surveymonkey4 an example of which is reported in the appendix asking questions about i the experience as project contributor and whether the contributor is still active ii whether the person mentored a project newcomer and if yes how important was the mentoring perceived iii whether the person was mentored when she joined the project and how important was the mentoring in the decision to stay in the project and iv which are the characteristics of a good mentor e.g.
experience communication skills project knowledge .
in addition the survey page showed to respondents a list of people that yoda highlighted in the mentor newcomer candidatepairs askingthemtotell foreachperson whether the respondent i was actually the person indicated there ii was a mentor for that person iii was advised by that person or iv never got in touch with that person.

rq1 how can we identify mentors from the past history of a software project?
figure and table report for the five projects we analyzed the performances of yoda in detecting mentors for all newcomers joining the project during the entire analyzed time interval.
in each subfigure of figure the x axis indicates the number of mentors that the approach can recommend when achieving a precision shown on the y axis.
as described in section .
we evaluated the performance of yoda for all combinations of f1 f5 as well as for combinations having varying weights.
due to space limitations table only reports a subset of the analyzed combinations complete tables can be found in the appendix and specifically f1 i.e.
the percentage of exchanged emails between newcomer and mentor.
we noticed that if considering each of the f1 f5factors alone such a factor is the one that produces the best performances.
f5 i.e.
the normalized number of commits performed by the candidate mentor.
we use this factor as a baseline to determine whether an obvious choice of mentors i.e.
top committers could be appropriate.

note that figure contains exactly the same information of table except that we do not report the combination of f1 f2 andf3orf4with equal weights since they are less interesting to be compared and has the purpose of better allowing the comparison of different combinations whereas table provides precise figures.
in summary the obtained results indicate that f5 number of commits is not a good indicator of mentorship.
also f5does not even provide a useful contributionifusedincombinationwithotherfactors.
while it is true that a very active committer can be expert on a particular topic she might not be very willing or able to exchange ideas and or instruct other people.

also it can be noticed that such a precision does not decrease when decreasing which means that the chosen combinations are able to recommend a wider set of candidate mentors without sacrificing the precision.
f1alone tend to be as precise as the other combinations and in some cases python and samba even moreprecisethanthecombinationsabove.
however it isonlyabletorecommendalimitedsetofmentorseven when decreasing .
although in the practice a singlementor would suffice having a good recall is desirable because i not all candidate mentors may be available when needed and ii among the candidate mentors we need to select those having the expertise required by the newcomer.
hence to obtain a good balance between precision and number of mentors which as said above does not mean to accept a very low precision it is necessary to combine f1 having however a higher weight with f2 rewarding mentors in general very active in discussions and f3 mentor newcomer project age difference or f4 the newcomer mainly collaborate with the mentor in her early stages .
in summary the percentage of exchanged emails per seis not enough to identify a large set of candidate mentors.
the results achieved also indicate that on freebsd yoda exhibits low performances precision around while for all other systems results are pretty consistent.
our interpretation is that such a result does not depend on the system size and on its number of project contributor.
in fact on other systems having a high number of contributors such as python or samba yoda exhibits good performances.
we believe that this can be due to the nature of the discussion occurring in the freebsd mailing lists.
by inspecting the emails we realized that most of the discussion is oneto many i.e.
people posting issues or suggestions to many other people or to the whole mailing list.
although the way we analyze mailing lists allow to treat with some approximation many to many communications the freebsd communication did not always exhibit dominant persons potential mentors .
this clearly makes the identification of pairwise collaborations less precise.table number and percentage of correct and incorrect top and top mentor recommendations for newcomers in the test set.

rq2 to what extent would it be possible to recommend mentors to newcomers joining a software project?
to evaluate the recommendation method we split the history of each project in a training set and test set.

the left side of each column in the table reports the number and percentage of correct and incorrect top mentor recommendations for each newcomer ranked according to dice asymmetric similarity while the right side reports the number and percentage of correct and incorrect top recommendations.
as the table shows the percentage of correct top recommendations is very high above except for python where it is and for freebsd where it is for the reasons explained in rq1 .
even when we consider the top recommendations the correctness remains high or above including this time python where it increases to and again with the exception of freebsd where it is .
in the appendix we also report results for top and top recommendations which nevertheless only slightly increase or decrease with respect to top and to top .
as explained in section .
results of table are obtained by considering as newcomer query to identify recommenders emails sent during the first week in the project.
as shown in the appendix results do not substantially vary if considering a longer period up to four months which is however less realistic because we cannot expect the newcomer would wait so long to get a mentorship.
for out of the newcomers for which it has been possible to trace the first week emails onto source code files table reports the precision in the recommendation in the same way as for table .
as the table shows the precision is quite low always below with the exception of samba where is and top for postgresql where is .table precision in the recommendation of mentors among top committers of files traced onto newcomers emails.

top committers or files related to newcomer early emails cannot be used to recommend mentors.
.
discussion in the following we provide additional qualitative insights to the quantitative study reported in section .
.
hints collected from project contributors this section reports results we collected surveying project developers.
since we collected a limited number of answers we report aggregate data only for the purpose of explaining how the respondents perceived the importance of the mentoring process.
figure a indicates that out of developers admitted to have been mentors and indicated that they were mentoredbysomeoneelse.
figure2 b reportstheperceived importance of mentoring when respondents performed mentoring themselves or when they were mentored.
the effect was perceived very important or important for developers performing mentoring while when developers received mentoring developers indicated that such activity is very important and that it is important.
in summary developers indicated that mentoring is important although it seems that developers are more likely to admit that they performed mentoring than they were mentored.
also mentoring seems to be perceived more important by developers that performed it rather than by developers that received it.
figure c reports what factor developers indicated to be important for good mentoring.
the respondents suggested it is mainly matter of communication skills and project knowledge while only developers indicated that experience can play an important role.
however one of the respondents said maybe good communication skills is the least important of the three above if one is working closely together.
thus the importance of communication skills depends of the cohesiveness of the project team.
some developers added comments to the survey to indicate that they performed received mentoring using communication means different from emails.
for example they added comments like suggested work they can do.
but mostly over irc.
or not only mailing lists but also irc and direct communication.
by classifying developers in the list we provided the respondents indicated us a set of mentor newcomer pairs.
we identified of them correctly the remaining were not identified while we identified pairs for which respondents indicated that mentoring did not occur.
thus with11 did mentoring?
had a mentor?
yes no a done received mentoring very important important neutral not important useless at all effect of mentor effect on newcomer b perceived importance of mentoring experience communica5on skills project knowledge others c what makes a good mentor figure survey questionnaire answers generic questions on mentoring activity and its importance.
respect to the answers provided in the survey questionnaire our approach has a precision of and a recall of .
.
examples of cases where yoda worked well and where not in the following we report some examples of collaborations and fragments of emails indicating cases in which yoda worked well to identify mentors rq1 and cases where it did not.
cases of true positives confirmed by respondents of our survey were made evident by exchanges of email in which the newcomer clearly asked for help.
figure shows an example of newcomer bjoern mentor james network found in samba when the newcomer approachedtheprojectbysendinghisfirstemails figure3 a and after one year figure b .
note that edges are labeled with the number of exchanged emails.
james had already a three years experience with commits performed when bjoern approached him.
as it can be seen from the network james has a high degree and bjoern mainly exchanges emails emails exchanged with james rather than with other people.
after one year the social importance of james increase as well as to some extent the one of bjoern which however still has james as main contact emails exchanged .
the mentoring relationship is also evident from fragments of their communication hi james maybe you can bring some light into the dark here i did some tests with ... another example confirmed by the survey respondent is the one in samba where kai asked jeremy6help because she wanted to contribute to the project as you might know i m a...student implementing ntlmssp signing sealing in wine.
i ve worked on basic ntlm authentication for wine last year using ntlm auth....i decided to give samba4 s gensec subsystem a try.
.
then jeremy responded with a detailed list of instructions answering kai specific technical questions e.g.
this is the quickest way to make this work imho .
probably second best solution.
where kai proposed two possible implementations or even discouraging kai to implement some features this will be a long long road to walk... one example of false negative is when the newcomer asked for help and the mentor never or seldom responded.
an instance of such a case was reported as a true mentoring in our survey however yoda did not detect it because of the low value of f1.
one example of false positive concerns the collaboration 6we do not report last names for confidentiality reasons.between ivan and robert in freebsd.
robert helped ivan to deal with some performance problem of the ssh protocol implementation.
although also from the email it appeared clear that robert indicated as candidate mentor by our approach was the expert giving suggestions very likely he helped to solve a specific problem only so to be considered as someone who helped ivan while not really ivan s mentor.
now we report hereby one case where mentoring recommendation rq2 worked and one when it did not.
when lucien joined the apache httpd project he asked information about proxy handling i m translating mod proxy.xml and i don t understand what the term worker means ... .
then after he received information about the meaning of this term he checked whether he correctly understood so say we have this proxy configuration proxypass path1 server1 proxypass path2 server2 ... .
in summary lucien seems to be interested to work on tasks related to proxy.
yoda recommended him joshua as a mentor which in the past helped someone else laurent on a problem related to proxy proxypassreverse only rewrites location headers .... .
that is the email referred several times to the terms proxyandpass also contained in the early email sent by lucien.
an example of false positive is between takashi newcomer and joshua candidate mentor .
both the early emails of takashi and previous emails of joshua contained some common terms such as 3d contained in xml and html fragments e.g.
note type 3d warning in the earlyemailbytakashiand meta name 3d generator in previous emails by joshua.
however the technical content of the emails was not very similar.

yoda limitations and threats to v alidity this section describes the limitations of yoda and the threats to validity of the study we performed.
we are aware that yoda is limited for the following reasons it identifies mentor newcomer pairs mainly based on their activity on mailing lists.
we are aware however as also reported in a paper by aranda and venolia that developers can communicate also outside mailing lists e.g.
using a chat.
one of the developers that responded to our survey i ve asked questions personally in private chats.
and when we asked if he helped someone else he answered yes suggested work they can do.
but mostly over irc.

however since yoda proposes a list of mentors for a newcomer the project manager can easily assign to the newcomer a mentor that is currently available.
it matches the expertise required by the newcomer with the expertise of possible mentors by comparing the early emails of the newcomer with all emails of the mentor.
however as we explained in section .
it is not the purpose of this paper to propose a better method to identify expertise as others have been proposed already in the past .
threats to construct validity concern the relation between the theory and the observation and in this work are mainly due to the measurements we performed.
first there could be imprecisions in the way we mapped mailing list names with versioning system ids.
however we manually validated this mapping.
in addition for systems using git apache httpd samba postgresql python the mapping is straight forward in that full names and emails are used as git ids.
the age of a developer is computed by observing the first email exchanged which might have occurred way before or way after the person joined the project.
anotheraspect of our validation that is inherently subject to imprecision is the manual validation of yoda recommendations.
we limited the degree of error proneness and subjectiveness by having two different people performing the inspection independently.
threats to internal validity concern external factors we did not consider that could affect the variables being investigated.
the factors we considered f1 f5 are only a partial view of the mentor and newcomer experiences and of their inter communication.
there can be other factors we did not consider.
future work will be devoted to consider other factors aiming at mitigating such a threat.
threats to external validity concern the generalization of our findings.
we have performed our study on data from five different systems belonging to different domains and having different size in terms of code base and number of developers.
further evaluation is however necessary especially in industrial environments where there can be a tacit knowledge within an organization but not encoded in the communications of who can be a good mentor and who not.
.
related work there have been several researchers investigating what happens when a newcomer joins a software project and which are the factors for her growth including mentoring.
our work falls in the general area of those aimed at relating social relations among developers with technical aspects of the project they are working on.
for example cataldo et al.related the communication activity with software quality and developers productivity .
dagenais et al.
studied by surveying ibm developers what happens when someone moves into a new project landscape making for her necessary to get acquitted with the new environment.
among the factors they found important it is worthwhile to mention the need for early practicing the availability of feedback for their work and the need for getting initial guidance .
the latter is totally in agreement with what we collected from our small survey and motivates approaches like yoda.
fronza et al.
studied how newcomers join agile projects finding that pairprogramming is used to initiate newcomers to a project.
zhou and mockus investigated on three industrial and three open source projects how the sociality level of a project in a particular moment influences the likelihood for newcomers to become long term contributors.
they found that it is more likely that this happens when the project sociality is low because senior developers have more time to train the newcomers.
zhou and mockus concluded suggesting the need for proper training plans for newcomers in open source projects this requires to identify appropriate mentors.
zhou and mockus also identified challenges in a software market where offshoring outsourcing and open source development are increasing fast understanding cultural differences analyzing how developers grow their expertise and providing tools to facilitate newcomers learning as yoda does.
a different perspective of developers growth in software projects was studied by sinha et al.
who investigated on the eclipse project how project contributors become committers and found that this depends on having contributed patches source code of the project being active in other open source projects or being part of the project organi zation.
also bird et al.
investigated the phenomenon of immigration in software projects explaining the who how and when in the process of providing to newcomers the authority to commit in the project repository.
in summary while all these works highlighted the need for supporting newcomers when they join a software project to the best of our knowledge this is the first paper aimed at proposing an approach to identify mentors in software projects and to recommend them to newcomers.
in the past and recent years other kinds of recommenders have been proposed to support developers especially junior ones.
among others hipikat provides recommendations about components relevant for the current coding context of the developer.
as discussed in section .
identifying mentors also requires the selection of people having specific expertise.
this has been done by anvik et al.
by canfora and cerulo and by tamrawi et al.
who proposed approaches based on machine learning ir and fuzzy clustering respectively for bug triaging i.e.
to determine the most suited developers able to fix an incoming bug.
.
conclusions and future work mentoring is particularly important to make software project newcomers knowledgeable of various aspects of the projectonwhichtheyarecontributing suchastechnicaldetails coding guidelines and organizational rules.
as part of our studywecontactedcontributorstoopensourceprojects one ofwhichmentioned my general view is that it is very important that mentor and mentee share at least the mindset and the same passions.
my primary mentors have been ...and they both had a very strong technical background something i definitively wanted to match.
this paper proposed yoda an approach to identify mentors by relying on historical data from a software project andthenrecommendthemwhenanewcomerjoinstheproject.
being inspired by arnetminer a tool that analyzes academic collaborations yoda identifies mentoring when the newcomer exchanges most of her emails with the mentor and the mentor has a higher social importance and project agethanthementor.
then whenanewcomerjoinsaproject her early discussion is used to identify the expertise she is requiring and yoda recommends among the candidate mentors previously identified those who exhibited a discussion textually similar to the newcomer early discussion.
yoda has been evaluated on data from five open source projects apache httpd the freebsd kernel postgresql python and samba.
results of the study indicate that except for freebsd yoda is able to identify candidate pairs of mentor newcomer with a precision in most cases higher than and recommend them with a precision greater than .
instead relying on top committers as an alternative to yoda does not produce as accurate results as those of yoda.
comments collected from project developers indicated us that mentoring is important and depends on project knowledge and communication skills more than on experience.
work in progress is directed towards different directions.
we plan to further improve yoda by considering factors able to better capture the technical skills of mentors.
also we plan to replicate the study on further projects.
finally we plan to develop an assessment technique for developers network aimed at automatically identifying cases such as the one of freebsd in your study where yoda is not applica ble as such and if possible identify countermeasures for such scenarios.
