many small and large software development companies invest considerable resources to target available opportunities.
as of today the markets for such devices feature over 850k apps for android and 900k for ios.
availability cost functionality and usability are just some factors that determine the success or lack of success for a given app.
among the other factors reliability is an important criteria users easily get frustrated by repeated failures crashes and other bugs hence abandoning some apps in favor of others.
this paper reports a study analyzing how the fault and change proneness of apis used by free android apps relates to applications lack of success estimated from user ratings.
results of this study provide important insights into a crucial issue making heavy use of fault and change prone apis can negatively impact the success of these apps.

.annual growth rate cagr in revenues since .
the app economy is a tremendous success ios blackberry and android were the most lucrative software platforms in with average monthly revenue of over and per app respectively .
additionally the developers mindshare index during the last three years shows that ios and android are the top two software platforms being used by developers worldwide .
what are the hidden forces that contribute to the app economy s success?
typical answers are ubiquitous computing low cost of handsets especially the android devices monetization models customers loyalty to brands such as iphone or blackberry etc.
however beyond explaining the hidden forces that drive consumer developer decisions and de ne the reasons for the success of the apps that success can be in uenced by the software infrastructure that developers use to build apps i.e.
application programming interfaces apis .
apis encapsulate the complexity of low level programming details and provide developers with a high level model for using the underlying hardware.
however the ease of use of these apis is impacted by factors related to api design and quality.
for instance top categories of api learning obstacles are related to learning resources e.g.
documentation or code examples and api structure e.g.
design or name of api elements .
also apis not ensuring backward compatibility support are typically hard to use because their instability and api breaking changes could introduce bugs in the client code.
moreover since developers often assume correctness behind underlying apis faults in apis can drastically impact the client code quality as perceived by the end users.
for example zibran et al.
found that among bug reports related to various components of eclipse gnome mysql python .
and android projects bug reports were related to api usability issues and about .
of those issues were related to api correctness.
although one can possibly assume that api instability change proneness and fault proneness may impact the success of software applications to the best of our knowledge such relations have not been empirically investigated yet .
the goal of this paper is to provide solid empirical evidence about the relation between the success of apps in terms of user ratings and the change and fault proneness of the underlying apis.

477a set of android free apps belonging to di erent domains.
we estimated the success of an app based on the ratings posted by users in the app store google play1 .
then we identi ed the apis used by those apps and computed the number of bug xes that those apis undergo.
in addition to the bug xes we computed di erent kinds of changes occurring to such apis including changes in the interfaces implementation and exception handling.
finally we analyzed how the estimated success of an app is related to apis fault proneness and change proneness speci cally to di erent kinds of changes occurring to apis.
although there is not always a direct cause e ect relationship between fault and change proneness of used apis and the app s success our conjecture is that fault and changeproneness can play an important role in the success along with the other internal e.g.
app features and usability or external e.g.
availability of alternative similar apps factors.
that is a heavy usage of fault prone apis can lead to repeated failures or even crashes of the app hence encouraging the user to give low ratings and possibly even abandoning the app.
similarly the use of unstable apis that undergo numerous changes in their interfaces can cause backward compatibility problems or require frequent updates to the app.
such updates in turn can introduce defects into the applications using the unstable apis.
results of our study demonstrate that android apps having higher success generally use apis that are less fault and change prone than apps having lower success.
for instance among apps that we analyzed the least successful apps use apis that are more fault prone and more change prone on average than apis used by the most successful apps .
structure of the paper.
section de nes our empirical study and the research questions and provides details about the data extraction process and analysis method.
section reports the study results and discusses them from both a quantitative and qualitative point of view.
section discusses the threats that could a ect the validity of the results achieved.
section relates this work to the existing literature while section concludes the paper and outlines directions for future work.
.
empirical study design the goal of this study is to understand to what extent the apis fault and change proneness could have a ected the success of the apps using them.
the context consists of free apps from the google play market and the quality focus is the success of those apps in terms of ratings expressed by users on the market.
we chose android apps since android is the only platform among the top developer mindshare platforms i.e.
apple ios and google android with open source apis.
moreover there are two other factors that make android apis a suitable and interesting resource for our empirical study.
first the fast evolution of android apis2is represented by major releases over four years.
table lists the major releases of the android apis the release times and the di erence in months between each pair of subsequent releases.

the fast evolution could also be explained due to a sheer number of needed hot xes.
thus breaking changes and bugs in apis could impact the quality of android apps as perceived by the consumers.
second reuse is widespread in android apps especially when compared to desktop open source programs.
android api reuse by inheritance is widely implemented by android developers and android apps are highly dependent on the apis .
almost of classes in android apps inherit from a base class as shown in a recent study by mojica ruiz et al.
.
even though such studies were done on an small set of apps they still provide valuable insights into the magnitude of software reuse in the android framework .
table reports characteristics of the apps that we analyzed.
for each category considered in our study e.g.
photography medical games etc the table lists i the number of apps analyzed from the category column apps ii the size range of the analyzed apps in terms of number of classes column classes and bytecode size in terms of thousands of lines of code kloc .
as mentioned we focused on free apps since information needed to perform our study cannot be retrieved for commercial apps because their bytecode is not publicly available.
.
research questions in the context of our study we formulated the following two research questions rq does the fault proneness of apis a ect the success of android apps?
this research question aims at investigating if android apps having lower success make heavier use of fault prone apis as compared to apps having higher success.
the conjecture is that the usage of fault prone apis can cause annoying failures and crashes and for this reason users give low ratings.
speci cally we test the following null hypothesis h01 there is no signi cant di erence between the average fault proneness of apis used by successful and unsuccessful apps.
rq does the change proneness of apis a ect the success of android apps?
this research question is478table characteristics of the apps grouped by category used in our study.
category apps classes kloc arcade books and reference brain business cards casual comics communication education entertainment finance health and tness libraries and demo lifestyle media and video medical music and audio news and magazines personalization photography productivity racing shopping social sports sports games tools transportation travel and local weather total similar to rq however it considers the change proneness instead of the fault proneness as the main factor to analyze.
thus the null hypothesis being tested is h02 there is no signi cant di erence between the average change proneness of apis used by successful and unsuccessful apps.
thedependent variable for both research questions is represented by the success of the considered apps.
it is estimated as the average mean rating provided by the users to those apps.
such ratings are posted by users on the android market as a discrete value between one and ve stars.
theindependent variable considered to answer rq 1is the number of bugs xed in the apis used by the apps during the investigated time period.
the analysis is restricted to the period of time going from the date in which the considered app version was released until the date in which either i the app has been superseded by a new version or ii the last rating for such app was collected i.e.
the last observation for our dependent variable.
forrq 2theindependent variables are the number of changes performed in apis used by the considered apps.
speci cally we computed the following variables the overall number of method changes.
the number of changes in method signatures method names parameters return types visibility .
the number of changes to the set of exceptions thrown by methods as detected by analyzing their signatures.
such kind of change is particularly important to analyze because a better usage of exception handlers may improve the apps robustness.
note that for all changes we separately computed data for all methods andpublic methods .
changes to public methods were analyzed apart in our study because these methods represent the api public interface that is directly called by the apps.
similarly to rq the analysis of changes was performed in the same time period considered for bug xes.
.
data extraction process the data needed to answer our research questions are i the user ratings of the considered apps ii the list of android apis used by each app and iii the bug and change history of those apis.
the user ratings were downloaded from google play by selecting ratings related to each app version considered in our study.
to prune out unreliable ratings we only consider apps having at least ten votes.
with a smaller number of ratings there is a higher risk that our results may depend on the subjectiveness of the ratings themselves.
that is if an app receives only one or two votes the fact that they are extremely positive or negative can depend too much on the subjective reasons of those particular users.
to identify apis used by the apps in our study we downloaded their apk android package les using a third party library3.
an apk le is a variant of a jar archive containing among other information the compiled classes in the dex dalvik executable format used by the process virtual machine in android.
for extracting api calls from the apk les we adopted the following process .
we converted the les to jars using the dex2jar4disassembler tool.
note that from the list of apps available in google play we selected randomly a list of apps to download.
however a downloaded app was included in the analysis only if its apk could be converted to a jar le without errors .
we extracted calls to api classes from .class les using the jclassinfo5tool .
we discarded all the api classes outside the android.
packages.
in this study we focus only on the o cial android apis which are generally used by several applications whereas future work will also consider the impact of third party apis used by the apps.
the total number of api classes belonging to the android.
packages is .
once we collected the list of apis for each app we mined the apis entire change history from their git6repositories7.

veri ed on june .479we analyzed developers commits performed in a period going from september to january for a total of bug xing activities and method s changes.
we identi ed bug xing commits activities by using an approach proposed by fischer et al.
i.e.
by mining regular expressions containing issue ids and the keyword x in the git commit notes e.g.
xed issue id or issue id .
for the changes we used a code analyzer developed in the context of the markos european project8to compare the apis before and after each commit at a ne grain level.
in particular while the git logs just report the changes at le level granularity performed in a commit we used the markos code analyzer to capture changes at method level.
the code analyzer parses source code by relying on srcml and categorizes changes occurring in methods into three types i generic change including all kinds of changes ii changes applied to the method signature i.e.
visibility change return type change parameter added parameter removed parameter type change method rename and iii changes applied to the set of exceptions thrown by the methods.
moreover we distinguished between changes performed topublic methods directly used by the apps and changes performed to non public methods.
to distinguish cases where a method was removed and a new one added from cases when a method was renamed and possibly its source code changed we use a heuristic that maps methods with di erent names if their source code is similar based on a metric ngerprint similar to the one used in metric based clone detection .
after having analyzed all the apis we used such information to compute for each app the total number of bugs xed in the used apis and the number of changes along the three categories mentioned above.
.
analysis method to de ne the analysis method it is important to analyze the distribution of successful and unsuccessful apps in our dataset.
figure reports the distribution of the average ratings assigned by users to these apps.
note that the number of ratings received by each app vary between the minimum we considered and with a rst quartile median third quartile and mean .
as expected user ratings are generally very high for free apps as those considered in our study.
this is likely due to the fact that user expectations are generally lower for free apps than for the paid ones and also that disappointment for lack of reliability and functionality may be higher when users spend money.
in particular apps exhibit an average rating greater than stars.
nevertheless due to quite large corpus of apps considered in our study we also have apps with an average rating lower than stars.
thus we can verify a possible relationship between faultand change proneness of used apis and apps success in terms of average user rating .
we grouped the apps in four di erent groups on the basis of their average user rating.
in particular given rathe average user rating the four sets are i apps having ra apps ii apps having ra iii apps having ra and apps having ra .
note that we do not consider apps having ra as a separated group since only one app falls in it.
the results of our research questions were analyzed through box plots and the mann whitney test .
for the latter we veri ed on june .

the results were intended as statistically signi cant at .
since we performed multiple tests we adjusted our p values using the holm s correction procedure .
this procedure sorts the p values resulting from ntests in ascending order multiplying the smallest by n the next by n and so on.
we also estimated the magnitude of the di erence between fault and change proneness of the apis used by di erent groups of apps we used the cli s delta or d a nonparametric e ect size measure for ordinal data.
we followed the guidelines in to interpret the e ect size values small for d positive as well as negative values medium for d and large for d .

as explained in section .
the apps are grouped into four sets on the basis of their average user ratings ra .
the boxplots in figure highlight that apps having higher user ratings exhibit a lower number of bug xes in the used apis.
in particular apps with an average rating greater than four use apis with .

this number increases for apps having lower average ratings .

bug xes in the set of average ratings lower or equal than .
moreover the distribution of bug xes as reported in the boxplots con rms the conjecture that there is relation between high user ratings and low number of bugs in the apis that apps use.
the di erence in terms of api bugs drastically increases when comparing the most and the least successful apps in terms of achieved average user rating .
while for the most successful apps the average number of bug xes in the used apis is for the least successful apps we measured an average of bug xes in the used apis .
we also analyzed our data at a ner level of granularity.
that is we computed the average number of bug xes in a single api class used by the four sets of apps.

when comparing apps having ra with those having ra .
thus there is a strong division between apps having a rating higher than three and those having a rating less than or equal to two.
summarizing we can reject our null hypothesis h01i.e.
apis used by successful apps are on average signi cantly less fault prone than apis used by unsuccessful apps .
.
change proneness vs. apps success boxplots in figure show the change proneness of apis used by the four di erent sets of apps considered in our study.
in particular figures a and b report the overall number of method changes and the overall number of changes in the method signatures respectively while figures c and d show the same data by considering the apis public methods only.
figure suggests that apps receiving higher average ratings generally use more stable apis i.e.
apis having a lower change proneness.
in particular the apis used by apps havingra underwent on average method changes as opposed to the changes in the apis used by apps having ra apps having ra use apis with method changes and apps having ra use apis with method changes see figure a .
also the three quartiles show a continuous upward trend of the number of changes as the average rating decreases.
the trend is almost the same if considering public methods only method changes for apis used by top rated apps for the set ra for apis used in apps having ra and for apis in apps481 and and average app ratingmethod changes27365378overall method changesaverage app rating a and and average app ratingchanges in method signatures571015overall changes in method signaturesaverage app rating b and and average app ratingpublic method changes16213041public method changesaverage app rating c and and average app ratingchanges in public method signatureschanges in public method signaturesaverage app rating45710 d figure boxplots of change proneness in api classes used by apps having di erent average ratings.

again the analysis of boxplots con rms that apps having a low average user rating generally use more change prone apis as compared to apps having a high average user rating.
also for changes involving method signatures figure b d results highlight that successful apps are generally built using stable apis.
if considering both public and private protected methods figure b we observe on average ve changes in apis used by apps having an average rating greater than four changes for apps having ra changes for apps having ra and for the least successful apps .
results are con rmed if considering public methods only figure d .
moreover by computing the average number of changes performed in a single api class the achieved results show that an api class used by apps having ra underwent on average method changes when just focusing on public methods an api class used by apps having ra underwent on average method changes when just focusing on public methods an api class used by apps having r a underwent on average method changes when just focusing on public methods an api class used by apps having ra underwent on average method changes when just focusing on public method .

finally table reports the results of the mann whitney test and the cli s dwhen comparing the change proneness of apis used by apps belonging to di erent groups of average user ratings.
the main results from table can be summarized as the following there is statistically signi cant di erence p value .
when comparing apps having a higher average user rating with those having a lower one.
we observe a large cli s delta .
when comparing the most successful apps i.e.
those having ra with the less successful ones i.e.

then we analyzed another category of changes that might occur in the android apis i.e.
changes to the set of exceptions thrown by methods.
in total we identi ed changes to exceptions thrown by methods were aimed at adding new exceptions to a method.
results are reported in figures a and b for all methods and public methods only respectively.
di erently from the trends observed for the other kinds of changes shown in figure for what concerns changes to exceptions we do not observe also according to mann whitney tests performed any signi cant di erence between di erent levels of rating.
this result is and and average app ratingchanges in exceptions thrown by methods1.

not surprising since robust java programs generally make a massive use of exception handling mechanisms .
on summary we can reject our null hypothesis h02i.e.
apis used by successful apps are on average less prone to changes occurred to api signatures and implementation than apis used by unsuccessful apps.
instead there is no signi cant di erence when the changes are on the exceptions thrown by api methods .
.
qualitative analysis the quantitative analysis performed to answer our research questions provided us with strong empirical evidence that android apps having higher success generally use apis that are less fault and change prone than apps having lower success.
although we are aware this is not su cient to claim causation we performed a qualitative analysis to at least483doesnotworkcrashesupdateuselesscrapforcecloseuninstallboringhorribleblackscreenfreezespay uninstalledpleasefixitworthmoneywasteoftimelackswouldbegreatifneedsupdate notcompatiblewithterriblebuyannoying versionsucksthisistheworst cantevenopenitnotworkonmymalfunctionfigure word cloud of the most common ngrams in unsuccessful apps user comments.
in part nd a rationale of the relation between the use of problematic apis and the low success of some apps.
first we performed a coarse grained automatic analysis of comments left by users to unsuccessful apps i.e.
apps having an average score lower than three for a total of comments.
the goal of this analysis is just to get an idea of the main reasons behind the users dissatisfaction with unsuccessful apps.
in particular we are interested in understanding if these comments are mostly related to lack of features in the apps and thus no relation with the use of fault and change prone apis can be hypothesized to bugs malfunctions of apps and thus a possible relation with the use fault and change proneness apis could exist or both.
to this aim we extracted from comments the n grams composing them considering n2 .
figure reports the most common n grams we found.
as we can notice the most frequent n grams are related to problems with the correct working of the app does not work crashes update needs update please x it not compatible with freezes can t even open it force close .
however there are also comments that seems linkable to unsatisfactory features o ered by the app useless lacks annoying boring .
thus as expected bugs malfunctions of apps represent one of the main reason behind users dissatisfaction with downloaded apps.
the next step to nd insights about the relation between the use of fault and change prone apis and the apps success is to manually analyze some of the unsuccessful apps on google play trying to understand if apis bugs frequent changes directly impacted the apps user experience.
we found several user reviews directly related to problems present in the apis used by the app that they downloaded and tried.
an interesting case is the o cial cnn app for android tablets.
in our study we analyzed the release .
.
of the cnn app.
that version received several low ratings from users out of votes rated the app with one star mostly because the presence of bugs.
however we found that some of those bugs were related to the android apis.
for example these are two reviews in google play for the cnn app version .
.
rating ?
a google user july version .
.
widget?
the widget looks awesome when it doesn t foul up.
i just don t understand the invisible widget thing.
please x. rating ?

.
needs some major bug xes i was excited to see that the app has nally been updated and for a few hours it worked great.
but then some of its widgets became invisible and it froze my desktop several times.
galaxy tab .
with ics.
by analyzing the change log of the apis used by the cnn app we identi ed a possible cause for the problem described in the reviews.
in particular with a commit performed on the developer chet h. implemented a bug x solving the issue in the android api layered views animating from o screen sometimes remain invisible .
the layered views are the mechanism used by the cnn app to implement its widgets.
we also found several user reviews reporting problems related to functionalities in apps that are provided by android problematic apis.
an interesting example is the subsystem android.speech.tts providing developers with the possibility of integrating the text to speech tts technology in their apps.
more than users of the apps using tts complained about problems related to this feature.
examples of reviews are useless.
tts doesn t work.
and every time i restart my phone i have to reinstall it as app related to tts.
.
by analyzing the change history of the android.speech.tts subsystem we found that the classes contained in it were subject in total to commits by android developers distanced on average days from each other.
in these commits a total of methods have been changed of which changes to public methods and changes to signatures and of these changes have been performed to x bugs.
this can suggest that very likely it has been di cult for app developers to stay tuned with changes performed in such unstable and fault prone apis.
in general the performed qualitative analysis con rmed the results of the quantitative one fault and change prone apis represent a serious threat for the success of android apps.
.
threats to validity threats to construct validity concern the relationship between theory and observation and it is essentially due to the measurements estimates on which our study is based.
the most important threat is related to using ratings as an indicator of success.
we are aware that such ratings can be highly subjective and imprecise.
to mitigate such a threat and the randomness subjectiveness e ect i we analyzed a very large sample of apps and ii we discarded apps having less than ten ratings.
another imprecision incompleteness can be related to how fault proneness of apis is estimated.
we chose to consider bug xes instead that number of reported bugs since the latter could represent false alarms.
also we did not consider dead apps in our study i.e.
apps with inactive development for which bug xes might no be reported.
however we are aware that the information from484software repositories can be imprecise incomplete in terms of the actual number of bug xes performed on a project .
moreover our study did not distinguish how the apps used apis by inheritance or invocation because the jclassinfo tool lists the
