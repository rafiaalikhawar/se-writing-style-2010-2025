building it together synchronous development in oss qi xuan y qxuan ucdavis.eduvladimir filkovy filkov cs.ucdavis.edu department of automationydepartment of computer science zhejiang university of technology university of california davis hangzhou china davis ca usa abstract in distributed software development synchronized actions are important for completion of complex interleaved tasks that require the abilities of multiple people.
synchronous development is manifested when le commits by two developers are close together in time and modify the same les.
here we propose quantitative methods for identifying synchronized activities in oss projects and use them to relate developer synchronization with e ective productivity and communication.
in particular we de ne co commit bursts and communication bursts as intervals of time rich in co commit and correspondence activities respectively and construct from them smoothed time series which can be subsequently correlated to discover synchrony.
we nd that synchronized co commits between developers are associated with their e ective productivity and coordination during co commit bursts vs. at other times the project size grows faster even though the overall coding e ort slows down.
we also nd strong correlation between synchronized cocommits and communication that is for pairs of developers more co commit bursts are accompanied with more communication bursts and their relationship follows closely a linear model.
in addition synchronized co commits and communication activities occur very close together in time thus they can also be thought of as synchronizing each other.
this study can help with better understanding collaborative mechanisms in oss and the role communication plays in distributed software engineering.

introduction software engineering projects depend on collaboration as almost any non trivial software requires the e ort of multiple developers to design it implement features maintain revisions and so on.
open source software oss projects are examples of organized software development where collaboration is essential.
collaboration is well de ned and organized in traditional companies however its mechanism in oss projects is still unclear to date although it is considered to play a key role in the success of many oss projects such as apache mozilla eclipse etc.
how does collaboration come to pass in oss and why?
while lacking formal organization these projects do exhibit a social network among the participants enabling them to accomplish complex tasks .
for example often multiple developers work on the same or related les around the same time and these activities or collaborations are accompanied by task coordination via remote communications through di erent electronic tools such as emails instant messaging and web based applications.
so collaboration and communication in oss should be strongly connected but how can we quantify that?
many oss projects have existed for a long time e.g.
more than ten years and are comprised of large numbers of les while their organizations are highly dynamic i.e.
developers join and quit frequently.
thus to assert that there is a collaborative relationship between two developers we need more than just evidence that they simply contributed to the same project or same les we need to know whether their activities occurred close together in time.
note that here we only focus on le level collaboration in order to observe the generative process of a project more carefully.
a collaboration in oss projects therefore involves at the minimum a pair of developers their possible contribution to the same artifacts and overlapping times of contribution.
to emphasize the synchrony of such a collaborative activity and distinguish it from the traditional de nition of collaboration here we call it synchronous development .
fortunately most activities of developers including code commits and communication are all recorded in oss repositories .
these valuable data sets provide an excellent opportunity for us to dene synchronous development between developers in an objective way to study the relationship between synchronous development and communication and further reveal their e ects on productivity in these projects.

ated lines of code loc by developers and the association between developer communication and their synchronous development.
speci cally we make a dual contribution.
first we present a theoretical framework to quantitatively study synchronous development and communication based on intervals of time rich in co commits and correspondence activities between pair of developers which we call respectively co commit bursts or c bursts and email communication bursts or e bursts.
time series smoothing and correlation allow us to identify synchronous patterns across bursts.
our second empirical contribution is in applying the quantitative framework to data from six oss projects with the following results we nd that during a synchronous development more loc are generated and fewer are deleted i.e.
the projects grow faster less coding e ort is expended and the coordination is more e ective we show that synchronous development and communication are positively correlated and accelerate each other we present a metric to compare communication tools as e ectors on task coordination between developers we provide case studies by analyzing the content of email messages in support of the quantitative results.
the rest of the paper is organized as follows.
next we discuss our research questions.
in section we present our methods followed by the results in section .
then we discuss the possible threats to the validity in section followed by a section on related work in section .
finally the paper is concluded in section .
.
research questions the c burst and e burst methodology which we present in the next section is useful for quantifying emerging synchronous relationships between actions of participants in complex distributed systems like oss projects.
we put it to use in answering questions related to synchronization of developers in oss projects.
to make the case for synchronous development we rst ask if there is su cient evidence in the data to support the assertion that synchronous development is more than random commits by pairs of developers.
research question is synchronous development more than a random phenomenon?
that is does it occur signi cantly more frequently in real oss projects than it would by chance?
next we consider the e ects that synchronous development might have on e orts expended and on code growth in oss projects.
in an oss project it is plausible that developers can contribute more when they participate in synchronous development.
here to quantify this phenomenon we follow previous studies and use the lines of code or loc to measure the e ort developers expend as well as the project sizeand its growth.
in a simpli ed but easy to quantify sense each commit activity of a developer consists of twoparts adding new code and deleting old code.
if we let laddandldelete denote the loc added and deleted per commit respectively then the change in loc or project size for each commit is l ladd ldelete similarly we can also de ne the e ort expended as w ladd ldelete we note that e ort may go into appropriately deleting lines of code which may result in a small if any size di erence to the project code.
then we ask research question do projects grow more in terms of larger l per commit when developers participate in synchronous development?
do developers expend more or less e ort in terms of w during synchronous development?
software projects are inherently cooperative which requires many software engineers to coordinate their e orts in order to produce a large software system .
collaboration between developers always involves coordination challenges which have been studied extensively including careful interview studies .
in oss coordination means respecting others work while making one s own work more compatible with theirs.
in other words a developer adding his lines of code tries not to a ect much others lines.
this we expect should be easier done during co commit bursts.
research question are developers more e ective in coordination in terms of smaller ldelete per commit during co commit bursts than outside of co commit bursts?
communication is vital in making collaboration e ective.
since software developers in oss projects work from wherever they happen to be electronic communications such as email rather than traditional face to face conversations are preferred .
the public availability of email traces makes it possible to analyze the relationship between commit and communication activities.
we have already found that communication and commits accelerate each other in apache oss projects .
since communications are necessary for collaboration here it is natural to assume that synchronous developments accompany communications very closely.
research question what is the relationship between c bursts and e bursts?
are more co commit bursts always accompanied with more email bursts?
further if there exists a positive relationship between the c and e bursts it is plausible that communication and synchronous development are positively coupled i.e.
having more of one increases the other.
research question are communication and synchronous development activities positively coupled in a dynamic sense ?
that is will increase in one result in increase in the other shortly thereafter?
.
methodology here we describe the mathematical framework we use to make the concept of synchronous development more practical based on time series of commit and communication activities of developers.
for an oss project we denote by dthe set of developers and byfthe set of les.
for each developer d2d let t d be the sequence of their commit times.
since a developer may submit changes to several les at the same time letfi d fthe subset of les to which developer dmade changes at the i th commit.
for a pair of developers daand db we denote by da db the sequence of their interleaved email communications times.
we consider all communications undirected thus da db db da for anyda db.
we denote by a xed time window based on which we de ne the time series of events we call co commit bursts or c bursts and email bursts ore bursts .
co commit bursts a co commit burst or c burst is a sequence of temporally interleaved commit activities of two developers such that each commit of the rst developer is followed closely within time by a commit of the second developer and of the les the two commits modify at least one is the same in both.
more precisely in a c burst sequence for every commit activity of the rst developer da modifying a set of les fi da at timeti da in the burst there is at least one commit activity by the other developerdbon the le set fj db at timetj db in the burst and no such activities outside of the burst exist satisfying jti da tj db j andfi da fj db .
based on the above de nition we use a one dimensional clustering algorithm to identify c bursts as follows .
for each pair of developers daanddb a6 b we denote byuthe sub burst set and set u .
.
for each commit of daat timeti da 2t da it is in a sub burst if there is at least one commit of dbat time tj db 2t db such thatjti da tj db j and the same les were changed i.e.
fi da fj db .
we group all such commits of db as well as the commit of da into the sub burst and record its time interval from the rst commit to the last in the sub burst.
then we add this sub burst to u. .
for all sub bursts in u we merge those with overlapping time intervals and update the corresponding start and end times of the burst.
.
the nal set of c bursts for daanddbis denoted by bc da db with the occurrence time of each burst given by the mean of its start and end times.
we note that the simpler approach of dividing developers overlapping active time intervals into successive timewindows of the same length and then checking for commits to the same les in the same time windows does not work in general as it results in breaking up a synchronous development especially when the synchronous development lasts for a longer time.
email bursts an email burst or e burst is a sequence of temporally interleaved email communication activities of two developers such that the time interval between any two successive emails in the burst is smaller than some minimal time say .
thus for every pair of developers daanddb all their e bursts are just the subsequences remaining afterexcising all intervals longer than from their sequence of email communication activities occurring at da db .
note that an e burst is di erent from an email thread which is the group of emails referring to the same subject.
in contrast an e burst is determined by the time that emails were sent and not their content.
.
comparing bursts via smoothed curves work related communications may occur before or after the commit activities being discussed as e.g.
plans or conclusions respectively.
hence c bursts and e bursts can occur at non overlapping time periods which makes it difcult to gainfully correlate those time series.
in addition the bursts are in general non regular time series and also discrete and noisy.
to extract trends and patterns from such challenging timeseries and at the same time reduce the e ect of noise we use smoothing .
this technique reduces complexity in time series data and allows for easy comparison of the smoothed curves.
for the c bursts and e bursts we use gaussian smoothing based on a symmetric bell curve de ned as f x 1p e x where is the position of the peak and controls the width of the curve.
an important character of the gaussian function1is that it quickly decreases to zero when xgoes outside of the range .
for every two developers let cand ebe the sets of occurring times of their co commit and email bursts respectively.
then the corresponding smoothed bursts c curve and e curve are de ned as j jis set cardinality c x j cjx cf x e x j ejx ef x if we let be the time interval between the minimum time and maximum time in c e then the corresponding centralized curves on the whole interval are calculated by c x c x zu l c x dx e x e x zu l e x dx then we can measure the synchronization between the two curves by calculating the pearson correlation coe cient de ned as r ru l c x e x dxqru l 2dxqru l 2dx based on this de nition ris when c x e x it is when c x e x and it is when the two curves are independent of each other.

to calculate the signi cance we conduct simulations to generate randomized instances of our data.
we simulate random email communication time series by randomizing the time intervals between successive activities using a method we recently developed summarized here for completeness first for each pair of developers let their communications occur at the successive time t1 t2 tn in reality.
denote the n ordered inter communication time intervals by tk tk tk withk n .
then randomly rearrange them to get a new sequence of time intervals denoted by ta k k n .
finally weld these new ordered time intervals together to get a new time series ta ta ta n satisfying ta k tk k ta k ta k ta k k such simulated email communication time series have the same distribution of time intervals as the empirical one.
we generate simulated e curves with the above and then calculate the correlation coe cients between the real c curves and the corresponding simulated e curves for comparison.
note that to make the argument that synchronous developments occurs more frequently than by chance we also randomize the commit activities for each developer by the same method while keeping the order of each activity and the associated les they access.
then we enumerate the simulated c bursts for all pairs of developers and compare them with the numbers of real c bursts.
in both cases the communication or committing activities are randomized one hundred times.
.
results and discussion we obtained data for oss projects from the apache software foundation on march 24th .
for each project the commit activities of developers on di erent les are gathered from the corresponding git repository while the email communication activities are gathered from the online developer mailing lists.
for each commit activity we recorded the developer id le id le type the exact submitting time in seconds and the numbers of added and deleted loc in each le.
for each communication activity we recorded the sender id receiver id and the sending time in seconds.
note that developers may have multiple aliases which were resolved by using a semi automatic approach .
in this paper we focus on the six projects with most developers ant axis2 java cxf derby lucene and openejb in order to get most meaningful statistical results.
several of their basic properties are presented in table .

synchronous development is real based on the methods described above we identify the cbursts for each pair of developers.
to show that synchronous development is a signi cant emergence rather than a random phenomenon that developers committed to the same les at close time just by chance we created simulated commit time series for each developer with our null model.
then by the same method we also generated c bursts for each pair of developers based on their simulated co commit timeseries.
we nd that developers exhibit synchronous development much more frequently than in the simulated case as indicated by the t test results presented in table .
this answers in the positive research question .
note that the number of c bursts between a pair of developers is dependent on the time window e.g.
it goes to zero when !
i.e.
developers cannot commit to the same les at the exactly same time and it goes to one when !
if they commit to at least one common le over the whole project history.
in reality there may be several c bursts for a pair of developers.
there are some practical limitations on the size of the burst time window.
it cannot be too narrow otherwise the daily work rhythm and di erent time zones may have a signi cant e ect on the results.
it also cannot be too wide otherwise the development cannot be considered synchronized.
therefore we chose in this paper.225table the fraction of c bursts in which at least one .java le was committed to by both developers.

synchronous development code growth and effort before we present the main results it is worthwhile to rst investigate the le types where synchronous developments occurred.
generally there are always dozens of le types in each oss project including .java .xml .txt and so on.
as expected most c bursts involved .java source les i.e.
most pairwise developers committed to at least one.java le when they work synchronously.
the ratios of .java les and the coverage ratios of these les on c bursts over all c bursts for the six oss projects under di erent time windows are presented in table .
we can see that besides synchronous development on source code developers also spent at least one quarter of their c burst time on other kinds of les e.g.
writing documentation.
since .java les are dominant in these oss projects and most of the creations of developers are re ected in their contributed source codes stored in these les in this part we will mainly focus on the e ect of synchronous development on .java les.
here we also do not consider all the .java les because some of them may be committed to by developers separately all the time and never be committed to by more than one developer in the same c burst and thus they cannot provide useful information for our study on identifying synchronous development commit.
therefore we will just focus on those.java les that were committed to by two or more developers in at least one same c burst.
for an oss project we gather a list of les such that each is co committed to within c bursts by two or more developers at some times and committed to by a single developer outside of c bursts at some others.
then we obtain the synchronous and nonsynchronous commit activities for all developers on each of these les and calculate the average number of added loc ladd deleted loc ldelete and land wper commit.
figure shows the box and whisker diagrams of lduring and outside of co commit bursts under di erent timewindows from one day to ten days to visualize their di erences in the six projects.
we also use the t test to ascertain if the di erences are signi cant.
the statistical signi cance for each case is marked on the x axis.
e.g.
on the x axis of figure a means that the developers in the project antproduce more lines of code per commit during co commit bursts with signi cance p when the time window is set to .
in general we can see that for the four of six projects including ant axis2 java cxf and openejb the overall code grows faster during synchronous development in most cases answering largely positively research question .
more interestingly we nd that for those relatively older projects including ant axis2 java and openejb synchronous de day ldeleteant inside co commit bursts outside co commit bursts a day ldeleteaxis2 java b day ldeletecxf c day ldeletederby d day ldeletelucene e day ldeleteopenejb f figure the box and whisker diagrams of the average ldelete number of deleted loc per commit during and outside of co commit bursts under di erent time windows on the x axis where p p p p and p .
velopment has positive lwhile non synchronous development has negative l in most cases.
for the relatively younger projects cxf and derby most commit activities synchronous or not have positive l. this interesting nding may indicate that these projects are in di erent stages of development.
the less signi cant results in lucene may be partly attributed to the relatively fewer les and the lower coverage ratio of .java les on c bursts in this project.
considering all types of les together we can still observe significantly faster code growth during synchronous development in that project when .
similarly we considered w ladd ldelete as a proxy for the total e ort expended by developers.
we found that for all projects except cxf wwas signi cantly smaller during synchronous development than at other times.
again we hypothesize that the age of the project might be a signi cant determinant to these results but that needs further study.
we omit the boxplots due to space constraints.
figure shows the box and whisker diagrams of ldelete during and outside of co commit bursts under di erent timewindows.
we can see that for all six projects developers delete signi cantly fewer loc when they participate in synchronous development in large majority of the cases answering positively research question .
note that we also did these experiments by considering all types of les together and obtained similar results.
.
.
case study to illustrate what goes on during synchronous development we looked at the content of emails between a pair of developers in derby .
they have the most e bursts that are close to their c bursts in the project i.e.
when the time window is set to be day we nd e bursts near and e bursts far from their c bursts.
an e burst is considered near a c burst if their time periods overlap or the gap between them is not larger than some threshold.here the threshold is set to be days in order to get a comparable number of e bursts near c bursts.
although much coordination among developers may not be explicitly addressed in their emails we still nd a number of such examples in the examined emails.
we nd that the developers provide suggestions3to improve the current work in e bursts near c bursts while the number signi cantly decreases to for those far from c bursts.
due to space considerations we just provide the following two examples.
case in derby message i think this code either should be changed to work regardless of ...... or the assumption that ...... should be documented in the comments.
reply as a consequence of this patch ...... it may arise ...... i have not been able to gure out ...... but it may arise when we re enable ...... we may want to handle this situation more gracefully.
for instance we may want to add two need kinds of restriction subclasses to model the boolean literals.

reply that reminds me why we decided not to include ...... i would prefer a solution that didn t require code changes in the application when moving from one java version to another.
3such suggestions always include the words such as we should probably we may want to add we could perhaps have i would prefer in addition to ...... we need to we would then do something like this would it be better worthwhile it would be nice to here are some options for etc.227table correlation test for the numbers of cbursts and e bursts under di erent time windows day .

case indicates that developers remind each other to do more related work and sometimes to add more comments to make their work more clear for both of them.
and case indicates that developers indeed prefer solutions that didn t require more code changes i.e.
they delete less code.
such suggestions are provided more frequently when the developers work synchronously than at other times in support of the numerical results on research question and research question .
.
the role of communication as we established above synchronous development is more than a random phenomenon therefore communication is expected to play an important role in this process.
in other words we expect that more communication is needed to achieve and maintain synchronous development and that these two activities synchronize each other i.e.
they occur close together in time.
first by the correlation test for the numbers of c bursts and e bursts we nd that these values in all the six projects under di erent time windows are signi cantly correlated with each other with relatively high correlation coe cients .
and small p values .
as presented in table answering research question .
in fact when we consider all pairs of developers in the six projects together the relationship between the number of c bursts denoted by ncand that of e bursts denoted by ne for pairwise developers can be tted very well with the following linear model nc ne with parameters con dence bounds equal to .
.
and .
.
when the time window is set to be day which means that on average we would expect one burst of co commits to the same les for every four bursts of email communications between two developers in these projects.
the data figure the relationship between the numbers of c bursts and e bursts where each point is a pair of developers.
all the developers in the six projects are considered together here and the time window is set to be day .
the data are tted by a linear function and smoothed by moving averages with span set to .
the circled samples are discussed in the case studies.
and t are shown in figure where we also show the goodness of t including sse r square adjusted r square and rmse.
in addition to the data on the plot we also show the data smoothed by moving averages with span of .
the overall strongly linear trend is in support of eq.
being a suitable model here.
the large variance of the original data suggests that some developers may have unusual behavior discussed carefully in our case studies.
because the number of e bursts is a monotonically decreasing function of the time window the parameter may steadily increase as the time window increases.
for example we nd that this parameter will be .
.
and .
.
when the timewindow is set to be day and day respectively.
since we only consider the strictest synchronous development that developers must co commit to the exactly same les at close times it is not surprising to observe that the slope of the linear model is much smaller than even for a large time window.
this is because in reality communications between developers may be about co committing synchronously on functionally related rather than exactly the same les which we do not consider here.
.
.
case study although the numbers of c bursts and e bursts are linearly correlated on average we can still nd pairs of developers that have extremely high ratios of c bursts versus e bursts and vice versa which may be determined by their distinct roles in these projects as indicated in figure .
we selected ve pairs of developers with the highest cto e burst ratios under the condition that the number of ebursts is larger than and nd that the associated seven developers are distributed in two projects antandcxf and centered by two apache pmc chairs who spent quite a bit of time on committing to les in these projects.
we present two of their emails in the following to show that they seem engaged in commit activities to an extraordinary degree.228case in ant message the other possibility is to write a routine of the type public static le which ...... reply i have something close to that almost ready to commit .
it s a little bit more than that ...... case in cxf message i somehow neglected to commit most of what i thought i committed last night ...... reply i gured you were something with ...... i just did the bare minimum to get the build building and cruise control to stop spamming me .
we also selected ve pairs of developers with the lowest ratio of c bursts to e bursts under the same condition and at the same time have at least one c burst.
we nd that the associated nine developers are distributed in ant derby and openejb .
the pair of developers with the lowest ratio are from ant and one of them is an adviser rather than a committer at most time as described on the antwebpage he has been involved non stop with the ant user community ...... he is opinionated always striving for the best possible design .
his role is also re ected in the content of his emails one of which is selected as follows.
case in ant message contributor would be anybody who contributes to the project in any way...... not necessarily code contributions it could be contributions to documentation or just discussions on the mailing lists.
reply yes ...... i might contribute ideas and opinion but i don t foresee having enough bandwidth for more.
.
synchronous development and communication are coupled finally how closely do synchronous development and communication activities follow each other?
recall we use ccurves and e curves as smoothed versions of the corresponding bursts eqs.
and respectively and then measure the synchronization4between synchronous development and email communication activities by calculating the correlation coe cient between the corresponding c curves and ecurves eq.
.
the value of the correlation coe cient tends to if the numbers of c bursts and e bursts are exactly the same and they occur together at very close times while it tends to if these two kinds of activities are independent from each other.
we calculate the correlation coe cients of c curves and the corresponding e curves for all pairs of developers with numbers of c bursts and e bursts both larger than ve for the six projects and then compare them with the results obtained from the corresponding simulated curves created by our null model.
the results are presented in table where we can see that the correlation coe cients in the real case are indeed signi cantly larger than those in the simulated 4the synchronization we discuss here is not the strict synchronization from mathematics which is always expected to be realized in in nite time.table t test for the di erence between the correlation coe cients of c curves and the corresponding e curves in the real and simulated cases.

case with relatively small p values .
which indicates the signi cant synchronization between the two kinds of activities answering research question .
here it is expected that the correlation coe cients tend to in the simulated case because the random mechanism of the null model makes the synchronous development and simulated email communication activities independent from each other.
in this experiment we set the time window day and the curve parameter and the results are stable to changes to other appropriate values.
note that correlation coe cient tends to when !
and tends to when !
therefore cannot be chosen too small or too large.
.
.
case study the synchronization between email communication and synchronous development is also partly re ected in the contents of some c bursts and the accompanied e bursts between developers.
we manually sample two such cases in lucene as examples to see whether the developers discussed the same les that they both committed to in the c burst.
the time window is set to be day .
the rst c burst occurred on oct from pm to pm with the accompanied e burst from am oct to pm oct .
and the second c burst occurred from am nov to pm nov with the accompanied e burst from pm nov to nov .
we nd that the two pairs of developers commit to the same le russianlowercasefilter.java andstandardtokenizerimpl.j ex in the respective c bursts while the accompanied e bursts indeed recorded the discussion of the developers about these les and the related ones.

measuring communication tool effects the signi cant synchronization between synchronous development and email communication indicates that there are a considerable number of c bursts that overlap with or closely follow e bursts.
for a c burst between two developers denote by ts candte cits start and end time respectively then it is called email inspired c burst if we can nd an eburst between this pair of developers with its start and end time equal to ts eandte e respectively satisfying that the time intervals ts c te c and ts e te e overlap.
for a given project denote by nc real andnc inspired the average numbers of c bursts and email inspired c bursts between pairs of developers in the real case and by nc simulated the average number of c bursts between the corresponding pairwise developers in the simulated case.
then the relative email usage when developing code with each other synchronously can be measured by pe nc inspired nc real nc simulated we nd that developers are more likely to use email to coordinate with each other in derby andlucene while the usage of email is lower in cxfand openejb as shown in figure .

day pe ant axis2 java cxf derby lucene openejb figure email use during synchronous development.
one of the reasons may be that the latter two projects provide other communication tools for users conspicuously.
for example cxfprovides the link to the chinese language cxf user s list available at google groups on its website and openejb has a communication group on twitter openejb .
however the higher ratio of email communications adopted by derby and lucene doesn t make the developers in these two projects easier to generate more lines of codes when developing synchronously as indicated by figure .
this phenomenon is interesting and suggests that comparing with the other more real time communication tools email may not be the best choice to coordinate the work between developers.
note that here the value of pemay be larger than if developers frequently communicate with each other by email and the time window is large enough.
if there are several alternative communication tools and assuming one can get all the communication records this metric can be used to measure the tendency of developers to use these tools to coordinate their work with others.

threats to validity there are a number of threats to this study.
the six oss projects are selected from the same foundation and are all written in java which may limit the generalization of the results.
the methods therefore need to be tested on a greater variety of oss projects in the future.
we use loc per commit rather than per unit time to measure the code contribution of developers as it relates to synchronous development because it is much harder to know the exact amount of time that developers took to write those lines.
we acknowledge that loc is more about the e ort of developers than the code quality.
ideally it is better to use alternative measurements e.g.
the development time of tasks and the number of merge con icts to check the bene ts of synchronous development however such measurements are relatively more di cult to obtain.
we believe that as we de ned them code growth l together with e ort w are suitable to measure the e ects of synchronous development given the current data sets especially since loc has been used extensively to measure the productivity of developers.
thus loc per commit is a proxy of code contribution per developer.
our results indicate that developers indeed become more e cient when they synchronously collaborate with each other i.e.
contribute to more code growth with less e ort which is well supported by the clues found in their emails that developers reminded each other more frequently to expand the current work and make fewer changes to the original code when they develop synchronously.
it may be argued that the code base grows more during cbursts because developers collaborate more on code that is of signi cant size or complexity e.g.
adding new features while cleaning up code may not require synchronous development hence more lines get deleted in solo mode.
however this assumption is not simple to validate.
another threat is that we only consider email communication here while in fact developers may coordinate their work via other communication tools.
such incompleteness of data doesn t in uence the results on rq1 rq2 and rq3 since they only involve commit activities.
however it may indeed in uence the results on rq4 and rq5 in the following several aspects.
for rq4 the slope of the linear relationship between the numbers of c bursts and e bursts and the variance of the original data as shown in figure may be overestimated since more e bursts can be expected when considering more communication records and developers may have di erent preference to use di erent communication tools.
for rq5 the positive correlation between c curves and e curves may also be overestimated when developers are more likely to communicate with each other by email when collaborating on same les synchronously and by other tools otherwise.

related work collaboration in socio technical systems two individuals are collaborating if they contribute to the same component of a particular socio technical system.
e.g.
collaboration among scientists is mainly re ected in their coauthored papers while among musicians or actors in their joint performances .
collaboration in oss projects has di erent levels of meaning due to the hierarchical structure of the artifact.
develop 230ers can be considered to collaborate when they have simply worked on the same oss projects .
on the other hand if we are interested in a particular project and hope to observe its generative process more carefully the collaboration between developers can be seen in the co commit activities on same les in this project .
there may also be other more general collaborative activities such as sharing programming knowledge through communication tools not o cially documented in the project but such contributions are di cult to quantify.
in most of these studies developers are considered to collaborate with each other all the time if they contribute to the same projects or commit to the same les.
in contrast here we allow that developers collaborate with each other at some time and work alone at other times and quantify those using c bursts.
synchronization in nature and society synchronization is a very common phenomenon in nature underlying most of the coordination processes on which biological systems rely e.g.
re ies that ash in unison and neural activities in cognitive processing .
recently similar synchronization mechanisms were used to explain the formation of collective opinion and the mimicry of online user actions .
as pointed out by choudhury et al.
understanding social synchrony can be helpful in identifying suitable time points for intervention e.g.
viral marketing .
one of the most remarkable features of oss projects is that voluntary developers can work on the same artifacts remotely which presents extra challenges for the coordination between them due to the lack of face to face communication .
recently real time remote communication tools such as twitter has been used to coordinate or synchronize the work of developers meanwhile oss sites like advogato and github already provide user pro les so developers can better understand the current focus of others and thus enable them to synchronize their commits.
social individuals bene t from synchronous behaviors .
for example synchronized ashing helps male re ies nd females more frequently while synchronized nonverbal cues can in uence face to face communication in a positive manner .
dabbish et al.
suggested that awareness of others work can increase the e ciency of coordination among developers using case interviews .
on the other hand herbsleb et al.
described coordination as a distributed constraint satisfaction problem dcsp and found that dense constraints in terms of dependencies between developers or between software components slow down development but don t signi cantly a ect productivity.
in this paper we de ne synchronous development between developers and nd that developers indeed bene t from synchronous development in terms of code contribution.
communication in synchronization processes it is well known that communication plays an essential role in synchronization processes i.e.
individuals can acquire the current states of their neighbors via communication and adjust their own states correspondingly.
oss projects blanket adopt or recommend for adoption to their participants communication tools like email facebook twitter etc.
.
some researchers even advocate for the creation of software immersion environments where project artifacts are arranged in physical 3d space so that developers can communicate and coordinate more directly like in a real world face to face communication.there are still debates on the e ect of communication on working e ciency.
for example herbsleb and grinter found that lack of communication between software developers introduced more coordination problems.
gutwin et al.
supported this viewpoint and suggested that distributed developers do need to maintain awareness of one another by interviews and analyzing email messages in three successful oss projects i.e.
netbsd apache httpd and subversion .
on the other hand however it is also argued that social communication have some negative e ect on the e ciency of work related activities since both communication and working activities may compete for the time resources of individuals .
as a result a large number of companies have begun monitoring the usage of emails or o ce telephones and employees face consequences for misusing them .
there is research that focuses on the design of large systems with smaller communication overhead .
communications are also used to build social networks in oss projects evoking the studies to identify the relationship between social structure and code properties .
in this paper we reveal strong correlation between communication and synchronous development which can help to better understand when and how much communication is necessary for e cient code development in oss.
.
conclusions in summary we nd that synchronous development is far more than a chance occurrence and plays an important role in the development of oss projects.
we identi ed and quanti ed the positive e ect of synchronous development on the contributions of developers and quanti ed its strong correlation with email communication activities.
thus this work can help to better understand the role of communication in the development process.
moreover we also provide a plausible metric to characterize the preference of developers to use a particular communication tool to coordinate their work.
the contrast between larger project growth and smaller loc e ort expended during synchronous collaboration is an interesting nding which can in uence the way distributed development is understood and conducted.
this work can be expanded in several ways.
first synchronous development can be generalized beyond co commit to the same les at close time to include functionally related les too based on the dependence relationship between them.
second larger scale synchronous developments can be revealed by similar methods since we expect that in many cases more than two developers are needed to solve more complex programming problems.
such a synchronous development network can provide more information about the organizational structure and then help to better understand the collaboration mechanisms in large systems.
third alternative measurements such as development time the number of merge con icts and the number of bugs can be used to measure the e ects of synchronous development on coordination e ciency more comprehensively.
