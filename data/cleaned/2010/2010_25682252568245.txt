box fi aalto finland casper.lassenius aalto.fi abstract time pressure is prevalent in the software industry in which shorter and shorter deadlines and high customer dem ands lead to increasingly tight deadlines.
however the effects of time pressure have received little attention in software engineer ing research.
we performed a controlled experiment on time pressure with observations from subjects.
using a two by two cro ssover design our subjects performed requirements review and test case development tasks.
we found statistically significant ev idence that time pressure increases efficiency in test case developm ent high effect size cohen s d .
and in requirements review m edium effect size cohen s d .
.
however we found no statist ically significant evidence that time pressure would decrease ef fectiveness or cause adverse effects on motivation frustration or perceived performance.
we also investigated the role of knowl edge but found no evidence of the mediating role of knowledg e in time pressure as suggested by prior work possibly due t o our subjects.
we conclude that applying moderate time pressure fo r limited periods could be used to increase efficiency in sof tware engineering tasks that are well structured and straight for ward.

introduction the use and effect of time pressure on software eng ineering tasks has received limited attention in software engineer ing research.
while we do not know the exact prevalence of time p ressure in the software industry we know that most projects encounter overruns .
as there always is pressure t o complete a project on time and overruns are frequent we can a ssume that time pressure is present in many software developme nt projects.
in software engineering literature time pressure i s typically associated with negative outcomes.
time pressure discourages careful planning and corrupts an engine ering standard of quality makes developers take short cuts reduces the time on software engineering activities is a demotivator for software process improvement causes failure to learn from mistakes causes lower test case quality is a factor of burnout in software teams current trends such as the use of agile development with rapid release cycles and globally distributed development can increase time pressure.
for example the move to the rapid r elease model in the firefox project forced the hiring of extra t esting resources and reduction of regression testing coverage .
f urthermore a study of software testing proposed that global soft ware engineering gsd increases time pressure .
currently many studies of time pressure in softwar e engineering only capture the perceived effects of time pressure through qualitative data or authors negative beliefs .
in fact the scarce studies with none perceived data display a more diverse picture of time pressure in software engineering.
n an and harter found that medium time pressure on software de velopment caused a reduction in the effort used and cycle tim e. our past work found that time pressure increased defect dete ction efficiency in software testing by .
similarly j rg ensen and sj berg found that time pressure decreased the effort used on software engineering tasks.
furthermore literature outside software engineering contains several studies on time p ressure showing both positive and negative effects .
still current work on time pressure in software en gineering context is insufficient.
the prior studies have suffer ed from nonequal settings between the treatment and control gr oups a small sample size and covering only databa se query creation tasks .
furthermore studies at the compan y level data are influenced by confounding factors such as changes in the project scope and personnel.
in this paper we present a controlled experiment o f the effects of time pressure in a software engineering context.
we investigated the effect of time pressure by conducting an experi ment with student subjects applying test case driven inspecti on where requirements are reviewed while simultaneously crea ting highlevel test cases based on the requirements.
we meas ured the effect of time pressure by the time used the number of de fects detected and the quality of the test cases created.
furtherm ore we analyzed the perceptions of the subjects with respect to the time pressure.
the rest of the paper is structured as follows.

effectiveness and efficiency h1 and h2 prior work on time pressure on software engineering tasks using measured effort effectiveness and efficiency is li mited.
our initial study indicated that time pressure decreased e ffectiveness less defects found in total but increased efficie ncy more defects found per time unit in software testing tasks.
sim ilarly topi et al.
found that shorter time available was asso ciated with decreased correctness on database query development tasks.
surprisingly the study found no evidence supportin g increased efficiency correctness minute .
additionally j rgensen and sj berg found in a small experiment that time pressure reduced the effort spent but also increased the nu mber of errors in programming tasks.
unfortunately measurements on t he efficiency were not provided.
nan and harter found that tim e pressure reduced development effort and cycle time in a soft ware consulting company .
when we extend our scope beyond the domain of softw are engineering and information systems research we can fi nd more published research.
in the domain of accounting mc daniel performed an experiment with professional staff auditors and showed that time pressure and time restriction incr eased efficiency but decreased the effectiveness of individual a uditors matching our findings in .
in economic decision maki ng kocher and sutter found that time pressure reduced de cision quality reduced effectiveness .
however time pressure and timedependent payoffs led to increased speed in decisio n making without reducing the accuracy of the decisions inc reased efficiency .
the authors think that opportunity t o gain considerably higher payoffs seems to trigger higher concent ration or effort levels and this helps to maintain high accuracy wi th increased speed in decision making.
additionally study of ch ess moves showed that games played under time pressure had lo wer move quality decreased effectiveness .
studies suggest that time pressure decreases effectiveness giving us hypothesis and the correspond ing null hypothesis.
h1 time pressure decreases effectiveness h1 time pressure has no effect on effectiveness studies suggest that time pressure incr eases efficiency leading to hypothesis .
h2 time pressure increases efficiency h2 time pressure has no effect on efficiency .
the mediating effect of knowledge h3 high knowledge and skill is typically associated wi th automated and effortless mental processes .
that probabl y explains why knowledge mediates the effect of time pressure.
the re exists several examples of this outside software engineeri ng literature.
in applied psychology beilock et al.
studied golfing under instructions that either a highlighted accuracy w ith taking as much time as needed or b instructed to perform as fast as possible while still being accurate.
they found that nov ices produced typical speed accuracy tradeoffs i.e.
playing fas ter decreased accuracy.
however experts performed better when pl aying faster.
furhermore a study in accounting domain showed tha t accountants with high knowledge performed better under tim e pressure while low knowledge accountants performed worse .
similarly a study on chess players found that under time pressure the quality of chess moves was reduced less for chess m asters than for weaker players .
thus we get hypothesis h3 knowledge mediates the effect of time pressure h3 knowledge does not mediate the effect of time press ure .
perceptions of time pressure h4 empirical studies of perceptions of time pressure o ften mention time pressure as a negative factor.
for example pra ctitioners mention it as impediment to software quality as a demotivator for software process improvement as a fact or of burnout and as a decreaser of job satisfaction .
t hus hypothesis is as follows h4 time pressure is perceived negatively h4 time pressure is not perceived negatively .

the findings of these studies help in understanding human behavior under time pressure and are used later in the d iscussion section of this paper.
the results can be summarized under categories of positive negative and explanatory results.
positives increased efficiency less reliance on i rrelevant information negatives decreases effectiveness decreases job s atisfaction poorer results in tasks where interaction bet ween humans is required explanatory knowledge and burnout rate mediates th e impact of time pressure time pressure leads to less risky and less cognitively demanding behavior .
prior experiments on reviews and test case development numerous software engineering experiments have been conducted with many focusing on software reviews or inspections e.g.
.
however according to our know ledge prior experiments on software reviews or test case develo pment have not assessed the impact of time pressure.
table s hows that time pressure has been the subject of experimental study only for programming manual software testing and da tabase query development tasks .
thus it is important to st udy time pressure for other tasks as well.
we wanted to study time pressure in a context where subjects had an additional task on top of the review task.
we we re motivated by fogelstr m and gorschek who studied test d riven inspection where subjects performed two tasks inspection of requirements and simultaneous development of high level te st cases.
they showed that the additional task of test case d evelopment did not impact the number of defects found in compariso n to a situation in which only the inspection was performed.
a hypothesis from suggests that the additional task of test case development engages and forces the subjects to do a deeper review of the requirements.
thus the additional task of test cas e development can be performed as cost free .
a similar two task setup has also been used by klein et al where subjects were required to perform pension calculation tasks while searching f or defects in the pension data.
in both prior works of two task e xperiments the tasks involved a single object of investigation i. e. requirements or pension data .
furthermore one of the tasks was defect detection while the other was something that forces the subject to process th e object of investigation i.e.
develop high level test cases or perform pension calculations .
the two task context has obvious benefits but also drawbacks.
it allows investigating two tasks with a single experi ment and thus can potentially allow quicker progress in understan ding time pressure.
the drawback is that we do not know how w ell the results can be compared with situation where only o ne task is performed.

research methodology .
experimental design we utilized a two by two crossover design usi ng two sessions and two groups of subjects see table .
part of the experiment material is also available online .
the tr eatment group was forced to work under time pressure later refer red to as the time pressure group tp while the control group w as not working under time pressure.
we refer to the control gr oup as the nontime pressure group ntp .
the difference between s essions is the requirements specification that was used.
in the fi rst session we used a requirements specification for an automatic teller machine atm and in the second session we used a requirem ents specification for an online web shop ows .
85the experiment had two tasks which were performed on a single object i.e.
the requirements specification of an a tm or an ows.
first the subjects were asked to develop high leve l test cases based on the requirements.
second they were asked to review the specifications and record any defects they found in them.
both tasks had equal importance.
from prior work we found three main approaches on how to create time pressure.
the first option is to pre te st how much time is needed and then allocate insufficient time for t he treatment group to create time pressure as was done in .
this approach has the problem that different individuals work at a different pace.
thus some individuals in the treatment group may b e so fast that they do not experience time pressure at all while the slowest individuals might experience so much time pressure that they give up.
therefore time pressure created this way may h ave fluctuating effects on the individuals due to their individ ual speed.
the second approach allows both the treatment and contr ol group to use as much time as they like but the treatment gr oup is instructed to act as fast as possible e.g.
by giving them a low expectation on how much time they should use .
the problem with this approach is that the subjects may simply ignore the time pressure as the completion of the task faster offers no bene fits to the subjects.
finally the third option is to have a linea rly increasing incentive if the subjects complete the task faster used in .
the third option was chosen for this experiment as it a pplies similar time pressure to all subjects regardless of the ind ividual speed and it offers incentive for being faster.

subjects and incentives students on a software engineering course at aalto university finland had the possibility to voluntarily partic ipate in the experiment.
in total we had observations tp a nd ntp from students out of who participated in the course.

they got points for both participation and their performance in the experiment.
as an ethical considera tion we must mention that the points given based on this volunta ry experiment based on this voluntary experiment performance were negligible for the students .

in the time pressure condition the performance poin ts where multiplied by a linear multiplier similar to one us ed in .

figure and section .
show the time used in the experiment and they indicate that our time p ressure manipulation was successful.
.
students as subjects the results of this paper have been obtained using student subjects the use of which has been discussed both in software engineering and in other fields .
several p apers indicate that student subjects do not have a significant dif ference compared to industrial subjects and the ge neral conclusion appears to be that students can be used as long as they are trained and used to establish trends.
in our experiment al l subjects were trained they completed a pre assignment based on i nstructions given to them.
the pre assignment had the same task as in the real experiment but using a different requirements spec ification.
furthermore this study focuses on finding trends r ather than absolute effects of time pressure.
however there are three possible sources of proble ms with student subjects.
first cultural differences might af fect the student behavior.
luckily many past empirical studies of s tudent subject use have been conducted in sweden with a highly similar culture to finland as measured with hofste de s cultural dimensions .
second berander presents dat a that the commitment of student subjects might bias the resul ts.
in our case the experiment was voluntary thus the least motiva ted students are likely to be out of the subject sample.
further more the subjects participating had a performance incentive as a small portion of the extra credit points were awarded based on th e experiment performance.
finally we surveyed the subjects mot ivation in the experiment with a post experiment survey question.
naturally the motivation fluctuated between the subjects but the correlation analysis revealed that there were no significant a lpha level .
correlation between the reported motivation and the measured output time used the effectiveness or the efficie ncy.
thus this indicates that our incentive manipulation mitigated the effect of motivation on the task performance.
third mortense n et al points out that in the context of accounting tasks students cannot be used as surrogates when the task is unstructured and complex.
however they also present data that when the task is structured and straight forward using students as subjects is feasible.
in this experiment the task of creating test cases and rev iewing requirements to find defects was well structured and strai ghtforward.
.
measures the measures that we used to analyze the effectiven ess are the number of requirements defects detected and the sc ore received from the test case development.
additionally we ca lculated the efficiency i.e.
the requirements defects detected per hour and the test case score per hour.
the test case score was b ased on the number of identified correct input and output varia bles and created equivalence classes in the test cases.
86considering the requirements defects most of them were known to the researchers in advance as the same material had been used in a previous experiment .
examples of requirem ent defects are conflicting information in requirements or mis sing information e.g.
the rules of credit card withdrawal mi ssing what happens if atm is out of money.
all individual defe cts were assigned a unique id.
the subjects handed in their lists of defects at the end of both sessions.
when a subject had fou nd a defect that was not identified previously a new id was given f or the defect.
later all unique id s were reviewed together by th e first and third author to determine whether they represented a true defect or a false positive.
for the test case score the correct input and outp ut variables and equivalence classes were pre created by the authors .
we further improved these measures based on the findings of th e students that were not recognized by the authors but were r easonable and valid.
using this type of process where valid find ings by the subjects improve the pre created correct solution increases the validity of the results.
the test case score is a sum of correct input and output variables and equivalence classes identified.
for example in the atm system the requirement for log i n could have a card as one input variable point equivalence classes for the card could be valid invalid card point that cou ld be split further to valid cards bank credit bank credit card and invalid cards malfunctioning not supported card point .
the effort used was measured in minutes for each st udent individually.
the starting time was marked at the beginnin g on a piece of paper and when the students returned their assignme nts the experiment instructors marked down the individual end ti me.
thus cheating on the start and end time was not possible .
additionally we surveyed the perceptions of subjec ts about the time pressure.
after the experiment each subject w as given a survey form see for online version of the sur vey.
the survey consisted of questions about their background thei r motivation during the experiment and their perceptions about the test case development and defect detection tasks.
there were also questions about the working order that the students had follo wed and how well they could make a distinction about the two ta sks.
the perceptions of the tasks were collected using the nasa task load index a well known instrument for measuring task d ifficulty .
importantly for this experiment one of the six que stions of the task load index enquired about the temporal demand of the task.
other questions assessed mental demand physical de mand performance effort and frustration.
furthermore one of our hypotheses was related to t he mediating role of knowledge on time pressure.
measuring knowl edge in software engineering tasks is difficult and is curr ently lacking standardized tests for an example of developing pr ogramming knowledge tests see .
thus we collected sever al measures of the subjects background knowledge with the survey form see for the survey and section .
for the descri ptive numbers of the measures.
we used work experience and grade po int average gpa of computer science courses scale avg s tdev .
.
in software development as knowledge meas ures for both review and test case development performance.
gpa was collected from a course registration database inste ad of the survey to increase reliability.
in addition for review pe rformance we used their prior experience in reviews.
for t est case development we used prior experience in the development of manual test cases and experience in the development of aut omated tests.
thus in total we used measures of knowledge f or review performance and for test case development perform ance work experience and gpa used for both .
to analyze the d ifferences in knowledge for all cases we split the subjects to t wo knowledge groups to high knowledge and low knowledge.
we aime d for getting as equal sized groups as possible but due t o distributions this was not always possible.
.
statistical analysis and tests statistical tests were conducted using the r statis tical computing program.
we used the t test to compare the outcomes between treatments when the assumption of normality was not rejected.
tests of normality were conducted using the shapiro wilk test.
when the data was not normally distributed we used the wilcoxon sum rank test wrst .
we report the effect size using cohen s d and confidence intervals ci for it.
fo r non normal distributions cohen s d is computed using the r pa ckage orddom which converts the d values from cliff s delt a which is a non parametric effect size measure.
we have opted to present all effect sizes as cohen s d as interpreting two measu res of effect size would be cumbersome for the reader.
positive c ohen s d values favor the tp and negative values the ntp gro up.
a suggested way to interpret the effect sizes measured w ith cohen s d are as follows a value of .
means a large effect .
means a medium effect and .
means a small effect .
a dditionally we conducted exploratory correlation analysis with pearson and spearman correlations to study relationships betwee n variables.
finally for testing the interaction effect between knowledge and effectiveness we used anova for normally distribute d data and poisson regression for non normally distributed dat a. analysis of distributions and the non central chi squared dis tribution test of fit showed that using poisson distribution was v alid for the non normally distributed data was valid.

thus spending more time resulted in a better outcome for both defect detection and test case development .
however the perceived time pressure collected with nasa task l oad index did not correlate with effectiveness.

our results consolidate the hypothesis that time pressure reduc es effectiveness but only because less time is available.

fewer defects.
however the d ifference between the groups is too small to allow rejecting the nullhypothesis see table .
second exploratory data a nalysis showed a high and significant correlation between time use d and the number of defects found.
a non supporting fact is t hat the perceived time pressure did not correlate with effecti veness.
thus our interpretation is that time pressure reduces de fect detection effectiveness but only because less time is availa ble not because the pressure would have made our subjects less capa ble of finding defects.
regarding the test case score our results indicate that time pressure does not reduce effectiveness.
the time pressu re group was actually marginally better than the non time pressu re group.
additionally perceived time pressure did not corre late with effectiveness.

knowledge h3 table shows data from all interactions we studied .
defect count is studied of interaction effects with gpa prior r eview and work experience.
test case score is studied of interacti on effects with gpa prior manual test case development test autom ation and work experience.
the data shows that in all except one case highknowledge group benefits from time pressure where a s lowknowledge suffers from it.
the exception is that bo th high and low gpa students suffer from time pressure in defec t detection.
furthermore for test case development the differen ces are very small.
also for defect detection the interaction e ffects of review and work experience were not statistically signific ant.
figure a box plot with mean lines illustrates the interacti on between prior review experience and time pressure with respect to defect count.
thus our data offers weak support to the prior the ory of the mediating role of knowledge in the effect of time pre ssure.
however for test case score the differences are so small th at they are in practice meaningless.
for defect count the differe nces are higher and they could be meaningful in practice.
finally none of the knowledge measures are correlated with perceived ti me pressure.
thus it seems that the individuals with different knowledge experience time pressure similarly.

perceived effects of time pressure h4 in the post experiment survey we used the nasa tas k load index ntli to measure the perceived effects of the task s for the tp and ntp group.
the ntli has six questions that eval uate the task with respect to following criteria on a point sc ale.
mental demand how mentally demanding was the task ?
scale very low very high physical demand how physically demanding was the task?
scale very low very high temporal demand how hurried or rushed was the pac e of the task?
scale very high very low performance how successful were you in accomplish ing what you were asked to do?
scale perfect failu re effort how hard did you have to work to accomplis h your level of performance?
very low very high frustration how insecure discouraged irritated stressed and annoyed were you?
very low very high we asked the questions for the defect detection and test case development tasks separately as we thought that the tasks would be perceived differently.
however we found no sign ificant differences between the task load indexes for the two tas ks.
in fact the perceptions of subjects about the tasks of defect d etection and test case development had high and statistically signifi cant correlations r values from .
to .
all with alpha le vel .
.
this indicates that both the defect detection and test c ase development were perceived similarly by the subjects as measure d by the ntli.
analysis revealed that only the questions about tim e pressure temporal demand had a high and significant differ ence between the tp and ntp group.
for the remaining questions the differences were statistically insignificant and the eff ect sizes small see table .
figure show a comparison between the tp and ntp groups with respect to test case development an d defect detection respectively.
regarding the frustration a nd performance of subjects small adverse effects of time pressure in the defect detection task were found.
however the differences are statistically insignificant and the effect sizes small d .
and d .
.
similarly under time pressure some subjects felt that the tasks were physically more demanding.
we think that this might be due to the need to increase the hand writing speed.
how ever these differences are also small and not statistically si gnificant.
furthermore in the post experiment survey we aske d the motivation of each subject during the experiment.
the mot ivation was marginally higher in the tp than in the ntp group but the difference was not statistically significant wrst p .

thus we conclude that the adverse perceiv ed effects of time pressure are small.

contextual factors and managerial implications our positive results of applying time pressure in t he tasks of test case development and requirements review were relat ed to a wellspecified task for a limited period of time with mo derate levels of time pressure.
there are several important contextu al factors that have an impact on the effect of time pressure.
here we position this study among those contextual factors and exten d the discussion into the managerial implications.
the amount of time pressure affects whether time pressure improves performance or not.
time pressure has been shown to produce an inverted u shaped diagram with respect t o performance in software development i.e.
the optimal ti me pressure that is neither too low nor too high creates optim al performance.
this is known as the yerkes dodson law and it has for example been demonstrated that excessive financial r ewards in time pressured tasks make people fail in the tasks they could otherwise complete in other words people do choke under pressure.
the time pressure in our study was related only to a small share of extra credit points given to the students yet it s till gave them an incentive to be fast.
thus we think it is likely t hat our experimental conditions represented an optimal or a near optimal case of time pressure leading to high increases in efficien cy.
managerial implications use moderate time pressure to increase efficiency.
however avoid excessive time pressure as it create s suboptimal performance.
both too large incentives and penaltie s should be avoided.
individuals knowledge or skill affects how people are affected by time pressure.
previous studies ind icated that knowledge has an important effect on how one reacts to and works under time pressure.
two studies conducted in completely different contexts golf and selecting keyword s in accounting provide the same results i.e.
for experience d people time pressure has a positive effect while the effect is negative for people with low experience.
in this study the high knowledge individuals did better in defect detection albeit not statistically significant but not for test case development.
ou r results with prior work suggest that people with experience migh t benefit from time pressure however it should be avoided for pe ople with low experience.
managerial implications most experienced and knowledgably individuals and teams are the best tar gets for time pressure.
task type affects whether time pressure is beneficial.
a stud y of database query creation tasks did not find increase d efficiency due to time pressure .
this conflicts with this wor k and .
we think the difference is due to tasks types.
steiner s taxonomy of tasks claims that roughly speaking tasks can b e either types of optimizing which emphasizes the quality of the end result or maximizing that emphasizes quantity.
we think the d atabase query creation tasks represent an optimizing task i.e.
you need only a single query but it has to be top quality correct.
our tasks were more of the maximizing type i.e.
the goal was to find as many defects as possible and creating high quality test cases actually mean test cases that had the highest possi ble coverage see section .
.
thus time pressure might be more suitable for tasks aiming at quantity rather than quality.
furth ermore our tasks were well structured and straight forward se e section .
but the same is true for .
managerial implications tasks that require only the top quality and are complex e.g.
programming an encryption algorithm are less suitable for time pr essure.
tasks that require high quantity and are straight forward e.g.
finding as many defects as possible are more suitable for tim e pressure.
there are also other dimensions in task type dimens ion than the quantity and quality.
findings outside software eng ineering indicate that interactive tasks suffer from time pressu re .
managerial implications time pressure should not be applied to for example the inspection meeting or other tasks with interaction tasks.
however the individual preparation for inspection meeting has potential of time savings through time pressure without significant impact on performance.
duration of time pressure may affect whether time pressure is beneficial or not.
prior work has shown that time p ressure has negative effects on job satisfaction and motivation .
additionally opinion based papers suggest that peo ple working under time pressure might take shortcuts and corrup t the engineer 91ing standard of quality when executing processes .
such effects are well captured using the nasa task load index.
our investigation showed no significant effects of time pressure on perceived mental demand physical demand performan ce effort or frustration including insecurity being discour aged irritated and stressed .
furthermore our subjects did not pe rceive effects on performance or taking shortcuts.
additionally t here was no difference in the motivation of subjects between th e tp and ntp group.
this discrepancy to prior work might be due to the duration of time pressure.
it is possible that short du ration of time pressure boosts efficiency without affecting motiva tion but if the duration increases motivation starts to shrink.
managerial implications avoid long term time pressure as it may lead to bur nout and the loss of motivation.
in large organizations the savings of applying moderate time pressure for limited periods could be substantial when being applied to a high number of individuals while it might be less relevant to small organizati ons.
.
threats to validity we investigate the threats to validity by using the three viewpoints of internal construct and external validit y .
internal validity focuses on the causal relationship and sta tistical analysis used.
it is affected by the violation of statistica l test assumptions and by low statistical power.
we tested for the dis tribution of data when selecting statistical tests for hypotheses.
fu rthermore effect sizes and their confidence intervals have been repo rted given that only checking for significance with respect to p va lues is considered having limited value .
also using a de sign allowed to increase the sample size and with that the statist ical power.
construct validity is concerned with whether the de sign and measures of the experiment actually capture what th ey intend to capture.
in this study these included the design o f time pressure and the measurements on effectiveness time used e fficiency subject knowledge and perceptions of subjects.
rega rding the design of time pressure we think our design was un flawed as subjects used significantly less time and perceived more time pressure in the tp condition see section .
.
addi tionally we used incentive based time pressure that should crea te more homogenous time pressure individuals as discussed in section .
defect counts were used to measure effectiveness.
h owever this measure does not tell anything about the defect sev erity or impact.
as the severity or impact of the defects was not an alyzed it is possible that there is difference in this respect b etween tp and ntp conditions.
furthermore no analysis of the qua lity of the defect reports was done as it was enough that we we re able to verify the defects.
at the same the test score was defined objectively e.g.
has a particular input variable been m ention or has an equivalence class been formed yes no .
thus the t est case score measured the coverage of the developed test cases p er subject only.
however it is possible that test cases devel oped in the tp group are less clearly written or have fewer words than those developed in ntp group.
the uninvestigated quality of writing issues may pose a problem if one using the test cas es or defect reports is a junior individual.
in this paper the primary evaluator first author had years of experience in teaching software testing and has plenty of experience in analyzing defect re ports.
thus in the future we should look at how interpretable the quality of reporting would be for less experienced individuals.
cheating in the time used was impossible as researc hed registered starting time and end time.
therefore the risks fo r construct validity regarding the efficiency are similar than the risks of effectiveness.
we had several measures of knowledge that were anal yzed.
however most of our knowledge measures were self repo rted measures of experience i.e.
software development w ork experience and task experience specific measures.
further more experience represents only a possibility to acquire knowl edge .
we also measured gpa but it is unclear whether it migh t represent more discipline and general intelligence than knowl edge about the tasks.
thus we only had indirect measures of knowl edge which creates a construct validity threat.
the risks of construct validity related to the perc eptions of subjects are minor.
the nasa task load index is a well established and tested instrument .
additionally the other questions of the survey that we used were easy to understand see su rvey for details.
considering the external validity there are two im portant risks that should be underlined.
first is about using stu dents as subjects which was discussed in section .
.
we think that t he conclusions of this study would not have changed even if we had used professional software engineers as subjects.
the second r isk is related to the transferability of the lab conditions to indust rial settings.
we cannot say anything about the effects of time press ure over a longer period of time.
furthermore based on this s tudy we cannot say what mitigation strategies time pressure might cause in real work situations.
for example in we showed how the need to keep up with rapid releases caused the firefox proj ect to reduce regression testing scope hire contractor resources while reducing the use of larger voluntary testing community.
natu rally with lab conditions such process changes that may be caused by time pressure cannot be captured.
thus industrial studi es about time pressure are needed.
.
future work in future work replications of this study are need ed.
it would be of great benefit to replicate this experiment with industry practitioners.
importantly the industry practitioners wo uld also act as a better source of high knowledge individuals than st udents.
also different types of tasks should be exposed an d observed in relation to time pressure in controlled settings.
t he effect of time pressure on risk needs further work.
prior works in dicate that risky behavior changes under time pressure .
th is could have implications on software engineering studies that h ave studied the risks taken by product managers .
the overall number of studies focusing on time pres sure is low and hence there is no good understanding of the lon gitudinal effects on human factors as well as outcome variab les.
case studies and surveys in the area of software enginee ring would help to understand the effect of time pressure.
.
conclusions time pressure has both positive and negative effect s. whether to use time pressure depends upon whether its positive s outweigh the negatives.
in the context of this experiment we ha ve demonstrated statistically significant benefits in terms of e fficiency in test case development and defect detection with high and medium effect sizes.
we found no statistically significant negative effects in terms of effectiveness or motivation frustratio n or perceived performance.
weak non significant adverse effects o f time pressure were found with defect detection in requiremen ts review.
however no adverse effects were found with test ca se development.
therefore in this experiment where moderate time pressure was applied for a limited period to well struc tured and straight forward task the positives outweigh the n egatives.
