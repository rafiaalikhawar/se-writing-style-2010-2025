geographical and temporal separation in a large scale software development project patrick wagstrom ibm watson group kitchawan rd yorktown heights ny usa pwagstro us.ibm.comsubhajit datta singapore university of technology and design dover drive singapore subhajit.datta acm.org abstract distributed software development allows firms to leverage cost advantages and place work near centers of competency.
this distribution comes at a cost distributed teams face challenges from di ering cultures skill levels and a lack of shared working hours.
in this paper we examine whether and how geographic and temporal separation in a large scale distributed software development influences developer interactions.
we mine the work item trackers for a large commercial software project with a globally distributed development team.
we examine both the time to respond and the propensity of individuals to respond and find that when taken together geographic distance has little e ect while temporal separation has a significant negative impact on the time to respond.
however both have little impact on the social network of individuals in the organization.
these results suggest that while temporally distributed teams do communicate it is at a slower rate and firms may wish to locate partner teams in similar time zones for maximal performance.

introduction software engineering may be the finest example of distributed computer supported cooperative work.
tools for software engineers are natively designed to account for teams working around the world and around the clock with a variety of di erent levels of communication fidelity .
processes in software engineering even those which are designed to be intensively collaborative and co located such as agile software development and pair programming have excellent tools to support coordination and collaboration across time and space .
these tools have led to an explosion of distributed software development in both the commercial and open source worlds.
in the modern business world distributed software engineering teams are not just common they are almost the norm.
within large multi national companies it s not uncommon to have teams located in the united states brazil china india and europe all working together on the same project .
businesses have flocked to outsourcing and distributed software engineering as a vital component to stay relevant cost competitive and evolve in the face of a shifting international marketplace.
while early results from the field showed promising financial advantages for outsourcing more recent work has made the advantages of outsourcing and distributed work considerably less clear .
a primary challenge of working in these spatio temporally distributed teams is synchronizing the team such that employees share some degree of working hours.
while companies and individuals often use a variety of strategies to cope with temporal separation these strategies only address part of the issues.
fully addressing the challenge if possible requires a deeper understanding of how mature teams function in a distributed environment.
specifically it requires knowledge of how repeated interactions between individuals both inside and outside the business impact the development process.
in this paper we dive into some of the questions surrounding globally distributed software development by examining a large distributed team from ibm.
we examine the artifacts collected by their work item and task management system to understand how individuals communicate with one another in the presence of geographical and temporal separation.
in the next section we develop and position our hypotheses in the context of previous literature on organizational structure software development and distributed collaboration.permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

icse may june hyderabad india acm this is followed by a description of how our data was collected and two di erent methods of analysis multiple linear regression and exponential random graph modeling to test our hypotheses.
finally we close with a discussion of the implications of these findings.
.
background and related work in this section we outline the background of our study in the light of related work.
our hypotheses lie at the intersection of research trends around communication and product structure global software development agile software development and broader research on distributed collaboration in software development and other fields.
.
the dual relation between communication structure and product structure the association between the structure of communication in a team and structure of the product built by that team has long been an intriguing question.
conway conjectured that these structures typically reflect one another .
this idea has subsequently inspired the mirroring hypothesis and the notion of socio technical congruence .
conway s conjecture subsequently canonized as conway s law by brooks has a strong intuitive appeal particularly in the context of organizations with streamlined communication channels between di erent teams working on di erent parts of a product.
a colloquial illustration of the phenomenon was provided by eric raymond who wrote if you have four groups working on a compiler you ll get a pass compiler .
empirical validation of the relationship between communication structure and product structure has attracted significant research interest in recent years.
cataldo et al.
introduced a definition of socio technical congruence in the context of software development .
they measured congruence using the di erence between coordination requirements arising out of technical dependencies vis a vis actual coordination and gave empirical evidence that congruence between developers coordination patterns and coordination needs relates to reduced resolution time of modification requests .
this work has been extended by wagstrom et al.
to make a distinction between general communication and that aligned with task dependencies .
the authors demonstrate that the latter has minor benefits while the former relates to reduced bug resolution time.
the e ects of socio technical congruence on software build success in the ibm rational team concert project was later studied by kwan et al.
who report that surprisingly high congruence is found to be related to lower build success rates in some situations while many zero congruence builds are successful .
these results seem to o er interesting counter indications on the e ects of socio technical congruence.
maccormack et al.
explored the duality between product and organization structures in the software industry and find evidence that loosely coupled organizations develop products that are significantly more modular than those developed by tightly coupled organizations .
on a related theme nagappan et al.
explored the impact of organizational structure on software quality and report that organizational metrics can e ectively predict failure proneness .
colfer et al.
examined the lineage of the mirroring hypothesis across domains and validated it across empirical studies finding support for the hypothesis in of the cases .understanding how communication structure relates to product structure has assumed an urgency of late due to the increasing popularity of global software development.
.
global software development the world of software engineering is evolving.
since conway s law was conceived software development in the large has undergone many changes.
today software engineering teams are frequently made up of skilled individuals gathered from locations around the world the combination working nearly round the clock a paradigm commonly referred to as global software development .
communication is nearly always mediated through internet accessible systems that automatically record publish and archive all information for future reference.
this style of teamwork allows teams to be high performing even when distributed across dozens of locations on multiple continents.
for example github which itself is a platform for supporting distributed collaboration and software development has a globally distributed work force of which only a small portion is located close to their san francisco o ce .
through the use of the github software real time and archived chat instant messaging and email the github team is able to manage more than employees and deploy their software to production servers dozens of times a day.
understanding the nuances of global software development has been the focus of much research in the past decade and half.
herbsleb et al.
demonstrated how common but unanticipated events can influence the breakdown of project communication .
herbsleb and mockus found evidence of notable communication and task completion delays for modification requests involving work across locations .
the importance of intra and inter team communication and coordination in a global development setting was established by cataldo et al.
along with the need for accruing a common knowledge pool and for recognizing expertise .
bird et al.
studied the development ecosystem of windows vista to dispel the notion that distributed development in more risky than co located development .
ehrlich et al.
study the negative impact of distance in while evidence for informal hierarchies facilitating smoother coordination in distributed teams have been found reported in .
nguyen et al.
examined the question does distance still matter?
in the context of a distributed project wide jazz team and report that barring some exceptions evidence for major di erences between communication structures of colocated and multi site jazz teams were not found.
as evident from this discussion the outcome of global software development is variously impacted by the communication mores of team members.
and communication is a central theme in the agile philosophy of software development.
.
interactions in agile development the first credo of the manifesto for agile software development proclaims individuals and interactions over processes and tools and one of the guiding principles is ... developers must work together daily throughout the project italics added .
taken together these imply a significant emphasis on the role of interactions in the context of project work.
thus agile development is inherently interaction centric with unfettered communication encouraged between various stakeholders most notably the devel 200opers.
in the cathedral and the bazaar raymond uses the metaphor of a bazaar to highlight how the myriad of spontaneous and seemingly unconnected transactions can fulfill local objectives of individuals as well as global objective of the marketplace .
although originally invoked in the context of open source development the bazaar metaphor aptly captures the spirit of interaction in large scale agile development.
many of the concepts behind the agile way of software development were first popularized by open source projects which have long stressed the need to have a small nugget of a project such that a new user or potential developer is able to quickly ascertain the value of the project .
these open source teams typically eschewed long term planning in favor of short iterations and used computer mediated communication systems usually email a centralized code repository and a shared bug tracker to keep all of the developers connected and in sync.
the adaptation of some of the open source development traits into the agile software development movement with its emphasis on short development iterations adaptive scheduling and always having a product that compiles and can be automatically tested is one of the most notable trends in the evolution of software engineering processes .
the advent of new development practices like agile extreme programming xp etc.
has put renewed emphasis on the role of team interactions in the success of a software development endeavor as explored by chong paasivaara and others .
it s not uncommon for large scale projects that adopt agile methodologies to also imbibe additional traits from open source software development.
one increasingly common practice is to open up a portion of the software development process to the wider community of users and customers.
most frequently this is done by providing a forum or blog to discuss development directly with developers.
sometimes projects allow developers to have direct to project work trackers as is the case with ibm s rational team concert which not only is a tool for developers to collaborate on software development but allows end users to comment and look directly into the project work item trackers through the jazz project.
.
jazz and extended development teams jazz seeks to transform software development .
.
.
by making it more collaborative productive and transparent through integration of information and tasks across the phases of the software lifecycle .
jazz facilitates the definition and monitoring of units of work through developer discussions around them.
development on the jazz platform is informed by the eclipse way of development which adapts the spirit of agile methodologies for large scale distributed development .
jazz supports the introduction of non team members to core project infrastructure such as the work item tracker and consequently has the potential to radically change the nature of interactions within the team.
prior to the introduction of these non team members the team was primarily responsible for maintaining interactions and responding to additional queries amongst team members.
the non team members greatly increase the number of possible interactions required.
this introduces additional cognitive load on the team members as they attempt to address all the con1 one common observation about these environments is that repeated interactions between individuals encourages the building of common ground which then leads to more willingness to collaborate in the future .
in recent years several studies have analyzed data from projects on the jazz platform.
in addition to some of the papers cited earlier we briefly mention few more interesting results.
wolf et al.
develop a predictive model from a set of communication structure measurements to indicate whether an integration build is likely to fail .
mcintosh et al.
establish that that build maintenance yields up to a overhead on source code development and a overhead on test development when studying a group of projects including one on the jazz platform .
ehrlich and cataldo examine how centrality and closure a ect individual performance .
datta et al.
study the development e ort of a major product on the jazz platform across months of development activity including work items and comments made by more than developers in locations .
they find evidence that the number of defects owned by a developer is influenced by the number of other developers he communicates to his interpersonal influence in the network of work dependencies the number of work items he comments on and the number work items he owns.
as evident from the preceding discussion studies of jazz projects have found interactions between project stakeholders to play a central role in influencing project outcome.
.
interaction across latitudes and longitudes today large scale software development is at an interesting juncture.
increased awareness about the e ects of sociotechnical congruence are encouraging organizations to search for the most e ective orientation of development teams.
to best leverage the benefits of a distributed workforce and hour follow the sun development cycles organizations are deploying global software teams.
additionally the predominance of interaction centric methodologies such as agile and the availability of collaborative development environments such as jazz have contributed to a truly global pool of developers working together.
these trends contribute to a situation where members of a software development team can be located anywhere on the globe.
the agile manifesto places special emphasis on face toface communication .
when team members are distributed across locations the best alternative to face to face communication is connecting synchronously over chat telephone or video conferencing supplemented by occasional travel.
synchronous communication has the basic requirement for all participants to be awake and working at the same time.
locations which are far apart in latitude will be separated by long distances.
but their time zones may not be commensurately apart if their longitudes are near one another.
but places far apart in longitude will definitely have very di erent times zones no matter how long it takes to travel from one place to the other.
thus within a distributed team latitude and longitude are expected to have very di erent influences.
dispersion of team members across latitudes leads to some degree of di culty due to longer travel distances should the need for travel arise .
however team members distributed in di erent longitudes may make it necessary for a deeper readjustment of nearly everyone s daily work schedule and in extreme201cases can also interfere with natural sleep wake cycles .
on an ongoing basis the e ect of longitudinal separation appears to be more severe than being dispersed across the latitudes.
this contingency is well recognized in agile circles dealing with large distributed teams.
it has been pithily captured in the adage like phrase latitude hurts longitude kills2.
but like all aphorisms the statement latitude hurts longitude kills elides some subtleties which are worth exploring.
in today s milieu the co workers of a typical software developer are commonly spread out over distances and time zones.
thus investigating how developer interaction is affected by latitude and longitude is important for organizational behavior project governance as well as individual work profiles.
in this context we introduce the following hypotheses to guide our investigations hypothesis .repeated interactions between individuals are associated with a decreased time to respond in future interactions.
consistent with previous research it is likely that individuals who are not co located will have a reduced chance of interacting with one another.
this is partially due to the lack of visibility between individuals at di erent locations and also due to the way that the product teams are structured.
if teams tend to be geographically centralized and there is an e ort to minimize communications between team members then individuals at di erent locations will have less of a reason to interact with one another.
this lack of communication between geographically distributed individuals may result in a decreased motivation to quickly respond to requests and leads to our next two hypotheses hypothesis .geographic distance is associated with a decreased chance to reciprocate interactions.
hypothesis .geographic distance is associated with a increased time between interactions.
similar to the previous two hypotheses that examined geographic distance we can also examine how temporal o set the number of hours di erence between two individuals plays a similar role.
while these two metrics are often correlated it is becoming quite common to have teams with shared work days that may be separated by a distance of thousands of kilometers while having little temporal separation .
for example damian et.
al.
studied the collaboration of a team spread between unnamed locations in the united states and brazil .
if we take the cities to be new york city and sao paulo these cities are kilometers apart greater than the kilometer distance from new york city to moscow.
despite their greater distance they are typically separated by only one hour as opposed to the eight hour time di erence between new york and moscow.
it seems likely that a team distributed between new york and moscow would have greater di culties maintaining a collaborative atmosphere than one separated by the one hour di erence between new york and sao paulo.
this prompts hypotheses 4and5 which isolate temporal o set between two individuals as a factor in the propensity to reciprocate interactions and also in the time for those reciprocations to occur.
.temporal o set is associated with a decreased chance to reciprocate interactions.
hypothesis .temporal o set is associated with a increased time between interactions.
finally it s likely that there is a relationship between geographic distance temporal o set the propensity to reciprocate interactions and the time for interactions to take place.
it it our belief that given the prevalence of modern tools for computer mediated communication the dominant factor related to the interaction between individuals will be the temporal o set and not geographic distance between the pair of individuals.
hypothesis .after controlling for temporal o set geographic distance will have little relation to the propensity to reciprocate interactions.
hypothesis .after controlling for temporal o set geographic distance will have little relation to the time between interactions.

data collection the data were collected from a long lasting ibm project in the field of software development.
this is considered to be a very important product for ibm and it is developed in such a way that customers have access to information from the development team including project plans work items build logs and reporting dashboards.
the team uses agile programming methodologies and is generally considered to be very high performing.
at the time of this writing the project is a little more than seven years old.
the team uses rational team concert to support their development.
this allows the team to consolidate their project planning work item management defect management source code control and many other important software engineering tasks in a single tool that provides excellent traceability and auditability for the software development process.
we used publicly available oslc apis3on the project s rational team concert server to download the complete discussion history on all of the work items from the project for a period of five years.
the first discussion on a work item is from january and the last discussion in our dataset is from march .
a discussion typically begins with an individual explaining the reason for the creation of the work item such as describing a bug or an idea for a new feature and then proceeds with a linear non threaded discussion system similar to mechanisms present in bugzilla and other common work item tracking systems .
each discussion item had the following pieces of identification that were used in this research work item identification number identity of comment author timestamp of comment other fields such as the text of the comment and work item specific fields such as the type of the work item e.g.
enhancement defect etc or priority were available but were not needed for this research.
obtaining the conversation history surrounding work items the data were augmented with two additional pieces of information the physical location of the individual and the time zone of each individual.
for employees of ibm the location of an individual was taken to be the physical location of the individual as recorded in the ibm corporate directory.
for other individuals the location of the individual was obtained through the customer account registration information provided to ibm.
we assumed that non ibm individuals were truthful in sharing their location information and that ibm employees worked in the location recorded in the employee directory.
this provided location information for of the total individuals registered on the site.
additionally the ibm employee directory allowed us to further segment ibm employees into two groups those that worked for rational the brand developing the product and general ibm employees.
the time zone o set was obtained by examining the standard time zone for the user s location and was recorded as an o set from utc.
for locations that used daylight savings time or summer time the standard time zone was used which was usually one hour later than summer time.
no attempt was made to deal with locations that have switched time zones during the course of the analysis.
a summary of the data appears in table .
table data set summary statistics rational only all ibm non ibm total individuals with location unique locations unique timezones using this information we were able to create a matrix with both the geographic distance and temporal o set between each pair of individuals in the organization.
temporal o set was normalized to the range of to hours and then the absolute value of this distance was used.
geographic distance was calculated using the spherical law of cosines method to provide for great circle paths between two points on the globe.
for the purposes of this work as we are most concerned with the interactions between individuals when taking into account the geographic and temporal location of the individuals we filtered the complete data set to include only instances of interactions when location information was present for the individuals generating the comments.
the resulted in an examination of di erent work items with comments on those work items.
the number of comments added to work items over the project life span is shown in figure .
within the data most of the comments were created between june and march the end of our dataset.
prior to june the team was using multiple di erent systems for managing work items and comments and therefore activity was sparse with fewer than comments being entered during this time period.
this is most obvious from the fact that there were only comments added to work items prior to march most of which were test comments as the team experimented with early versions rational team concert.
it was only after the first major release rational team concert in june that there was a major e ort to consolidate all work into the team s rational team concert server and thedatenumber of comments0 200620072008200920102011figure number of comments added to work item tracker by date number of commentsnumber of work items0 0102030405060708090100110120130figure histogram of number of comments per work item in dataset number of comments available for analysis began to rapidly increase.
most work items attracted very little discussion getting only one or two comments.
a steep drop o was seen in the number of comments added to each work item with slightly more than work items having between comments and fewer than work items having more than comments as shown in figure .
as would be expected from a community of this size there was no single individual that interacted with all other participants and the distribution of the frequency of interaction between pairs of individuals varied wildly.
figure 3shows a distribution of the number of times various pairings of individuals interacted with one another in the work item tracker.
in most cases there were few interactions between pairings but there are substantial number of cases where the number of repeated interactions goes into the hundreds or even thousands indicating that this was a collaborative community with frequent repeated interactions.
.
data analysis our analysis takes two di erent forms.
for the hypotheses that address the temporal delay in responses hypothesis and we used linear regression models to to understand relationships to geographic distance temporal o site and the time to respond to comments.
however such methods are not appropriate when attempting to understand the propensity for links to form between individuals in a net 203number of interactionsnumber of pairs0 1000figure histogram of number of interactions between pairs of individuals worked context.
for hypothesis and 6we used an advanced form of statistical network modeling exponential random graph models ergm to build a probabilistic network model and identify the factors related to communication between pairs of individuals.
.
temporal delay in responses to understand the temporal delay in responses it was necessary to filter the data to remove those comments which had not received a response by the end of our data set a total of items.
in addition because we are concerned about the time it takes to respond to comment from someone else we also removed all comments in which an individual responded to their own comment an additional items.
this resulted in a total of comments from work items that had su cient usable data to examine the temporal delay in responses.
before advancing into the examination of response time we conducted appropriate statistical tests to determine the similarity of response times across the di erent populations rational employees the brand of ibm developing the software we examined ibm employees and non ibm employees.
as there are a variety of reasons why there may be extremely long tails in the model we compared the median amount of time until a work item comment received a response on the basis of what population the respondent belonged to.
a kolmogorov smirnov test a non parametric test for analyzing similarities in the underlying distributions of sample populations when the underlying distribution is unknown was unable to ascertain that the populations were drawn from di erent samples and this allowed simplification of our work by allowing us to consider the population as a whole.
we then plotted the response temporal delay against the geographic and temporal o set between the original comment poster and the respondent as shown in figure 4and5.
in both cases there were no clear trends that emerged from this analysis aside from the observation that most messages were responded to within a period of about two weeks and that most cases that involved very quick under minute responses were between individuals with little temporal o set.
after gaining an overview of the data we created a simple model to examine the relationship between the time it takes for a response and the number of previous interactionstemporal delaygeographic distance km minute1 hour1 day1 month1 yearfigure relationship between temporal delay of responses on work item tracker and geographic distance temporal delaytemporal offset hours minute1 hour1 day1 month1 yearfigure relationship between temporal delay of responses on work item tracker and temporal o set between the two parties in the discussion.
we also control for the amount of time that the previous message in the discussion took regardless of what two parties it was between.
because there is a diversity of several orders of magnitude for the values we used the natural logarithm of the values in our regression model.
the output of this first model can be seen in table .
as is widely practiced we use multiple linear regression models to understand the influence of independent variables on the dependent variable in this case response time .
in the following tables we report the estimates of the coe cients of the independent variables along with their standard errors.
the magnitude and sign or of the coe cients indicate the level and directionality of influence of the corresponding independent variable on the dependent variable.
the tvalue is the ratio of each coe cient to its standard error.
using this tvalue and the student s t distribution the pvalue is calculated.
if the pvalue is less than the level of significance the corresponding result is taken to be statistically significant.
the level of significance is usually taken to be .
indicating a in chance of an e ect being observed purely by chance.
df denotes the degrees of freedom.
fis the fisher f statistic the ratio of the variance in the data explained by the linear model divided by the variance unexplained by the model.
r2is the coe cient of determination the ratio of the regression sum of squares to the total sum of squares indicating the goodness of fit of the regression model in terms of the proportion204of variability in the data set that is accounted for by the model.
to compensate for over fitting a model adjusted r2 adjusts the r2value for the number of explanatory terms in the model.

in this simple model we also control for previous delay in discussion time between comments because some discussions naturally proceed more slowly because of organizations or technical issues as shown by previous delay which reduced the number of data points to .
this model shows that the more times a pair of individuals interacted as shown by repetition the less time we can expect future interactions between those individuals to take.
therefore this provides support for hypothesis .
the next step was to construct a model that incorporated the geographic distance between the pair of individuals in addition to the repetition.
we expect that based on the problems associated with geographically distributed teams we will find individuals who are further apart physically will be less likely to promptly respond to messages.
however this is not the case with the regression model that is shown in table .
rather we see a very slight but statistically insignificant factor that indicates that an increase in distance may reduce the amount of time necessary to respond.
therefore we do not find support for hypothesis .

knowing that within our data there is little relation between geographic separation and the time to respond to messages on the work item tracker a model was constructed that included the temporal o set between the individuals as shown in table .
note that because temporal o set is bounded between and we do not perform a logarithmic transform on it.
here we see a strong response that indicates that a larger temporal o set between individuals is associated with a slower response time to comments on the work item tracker providing support for hypothesis .
finally we propose a model that includes both geographic distance and temporal o set shown in table .
when the model is completely assembled we find that temporal o set has a very large e ect on the time to respond to comments on the work item tracker on average individuals who are six time zones apart will take more than twice as long to respond e6 .

link formation using the data collected from the team s rational team concert work item tracker we built a network of the collaborations present as a property graph.
a property graph is a collection of nodes and edges and each node or edge may have multiple properties associated with it.
in addition nodes and edges may be of multiple types for example we can represent the geographic distance between two individuals as an edge between their corresponding nodes in the network.
these edges have a numeric property that indicates the geographic distance between the people represented by the nodes.
likewise we can use edges to represent temporal o set the number of previous collaborations and nearly any other dyadic property.
as an example a sociogram showing the collaboration network obtained from examining comment replies from the work item tracker is visible in figure .
this network shows that the communication network that emerged was quite dense and there was not a clear core periphery structure between employees of rational ibm and other users of the system.
the construction of a network allowed us to construct an exponential random graph model ergm to examine the propensity of network links to form over time on the basis of overall network density network structure vertex properties and edge properties .
similar to a logistic regression the output of an ergm is a model that can be used to evaluate the probability of an edge being present given the factors of the model.
rather than providing estimates of coe cient multipliers relative to the outcome variable as is done with a regression in an ergm estimates are given as factors of the inverse logit function logit e e that can then be used to calculate the odds ratio for the probability of an edge to exist in the network.
for example ergms can be used to model the likelihood the friendship links will be reciprocated in online social networks and to model interactions in real world o ces .
the ergm package for r was used to model these networks.205figure sociogram of data showing edges between nodes if individuals communicated over the work item tracker.
non ibm a liated individuals are red general ibm employees are blue and employees of ibm s rational brand are green.
at the most simple level the network state and density represented by the edges parameter in an ergm can be used to model the probability of an edge existing based on dyadic properties such as previous collaboration geographic distance and temporal o set.
in addition ergms allow edges to be formed on the basis of network related properties such as reciprocity the tendency of a network given that there is a directed edge between the pair of nodes a b the reciprocal directed edge b a is also in the network.
in a friendship network this is similar to saying that alice says she is friends with bob then bob will often reciprocate and say he is friends with alice.
the complete list of all variables used in our models is shown in table .
the most basic version of this exponential random graph model is shown in table .
it shows the logit probability for an edge to be present given the overall density of the network edges and the tendency for ties to be reciprocated reciprocity .

this indicates a very strong preference for an individuals to reply to each other in the network.
a slightly more advanced model shown in table introduces two new parameters that help to test hypothesis .
the first parameter isrational is a binary node property that indicates whether or not the individual represented by the node in the model was an employee of rational ibm s brand that developed the project.
it s positive estimated value indicates that individuals are slightly more likely to respond to comments from employees of rational.

to test hypothesis 4we replace the geographic distance with the temporal o set between each pair of individuals shown in table .
we find no statistically significant relation between the chance of two individuals collaborating with one another and their temporal o set from one another.
therefore we do not find support for hypothesis .
the final ergm model shown in table t a k e si n t o account both geographic distance and temporal o set between individuals.
in this case the combination of the two e ects creates a very complicated situation increasing the significance and estimated e ect of both factors.
as before geographic distance is not statistically significant.
the e ect for the temporal o set is statistically significant and in the positive direction although the e ect is fairly weak.
in this case and in contrast to the previous regression models the positive direction results in an increase to the odds ratio of206table ergm controlling for temporal o set estimate std.

an edge being present in the network.
thus the model indicates that if two individuals are temporally separated they are slightly more likely to be connected to one another.
this is in complete contrast to our expectations of hypothesis and is a very surprising result.

discussion attempting to predict social behaviors such as two people communicating is always a di cult process.
this is magnified even more so when examining just a small sliver of the communication between those individuals such as that provided in a project work item trackers within a collaborative development environment such as rational team concert.
however these tools can still provide a rich lens to understand and study the behavior of complex projects.
based on existing literature we built and explored seven di erent hypotheses in this work four were based on the time to respond to comments on the project work item tracker hypotheses and and three were based on the propensity of two individuals to communicate hypotheses2 and .
surprisingly while there are many ways that our findings complement previous literature they also contrast and pose a challenge to some aspects of elements of existing literature.
at the most basic level we found that repeated interactions between a pair of individuals resulted in reduced future response times supporting hypothesis .
this agrees with prior research on team building and suggests that organizations should support periodic team building interactions for all team members e.g.
face to face meetings for the entire team introductory one on one phone calls for new project members shared video conferences over meals to promote a higher sense of connection between team members leading to lower response times in future interactions.
when it came to strictly looking at the e ect of geographic distance on the propensity to reciprocate interactions hypothesis and the time it takes to respond hypothesis we found that there was no statistically significant relationship.
while this is in contrast with the previous findings of olson and olson it is consistent with the findings of of nguyen et.
al.
.
part of this is likely due to the fact that tools for supporting collaboration across geographic distances have significantly improved since olson and olson s original work.
in particular rational team concert was designed with distributed teams in mind.next we examined the role of temporal o set in reciprocation of interactions hypothesis and time to to respond to comments hypothesis .
here we found no indication that temporal separation resulted in a decreased chance of reciprocation but we did find that temporal separation resulted in an increased average time for interactions.
this seems to indicate that the primary issue is not that team members in di erent times zones do not want to collaborate it s just that the di erence in working hours make it so they can not respond immediately.
this finding seems to support the findings of tang et.
al.
who found that a common coping strategy for globally distributed was to partially time shift an employees schedule for example by allowing an employee with a young child to work from 10am 3pm and again from 8pm 11pm after the child had gone to sleep .
this tactic of shifting a schedule also results in a greater probability of times overlapping for radically distributed teams.
our final analyses which take into account the e ects of both geographic and temporal distance on the reciprocation of communication hypothesis and the time to respond to comments on the issue tracker hypothesis had the most nuanced results.
first we found counter intuitive results regarding reciprocity.
when accounting for both factors geographic and temporal distance it was found that geographic distance was not a statistically significant factor in reciprocity while temporal distance actually made people more likely to reciprocate interactions.
it is not clear how this finding lines up with existing theory and it s presence suggests that future research may be needed to see if this is an abnormality in our data or a more common phenomena.
in contrast hypothesis was consistent with both the predictions of existing theory and the oft repeated statement latitude hurts longitude kills that indicates that it is not merely the presence of geographic distance that results in slower interactions but the presence of temporal distance that causes the greatest challenge to response time in distributed teams.
this has significant implications for distributed teams and in particular suggests that teams may be significantly better o by searching for development partners in a similar time zone.
from a practical perspective this research was not designed to say if globally distributed software engineering teams were a positive or negative asset to the software industry.
rather it was designed to shed light on the process of communication in a globally distributed team.
it shows that while there may be cost savings related to globally distributed development there is still much to understand about optimal placement.
although the strategy of using development teams in china and india is quite popular the time distance from teams in the united states may suggest that partner teams in south america would create an environment with a faster response time.
.
threats to validity there are some clear drawbacks and potential threats to validity for this work.
it is extremely hard to predict social behaviors in any context much less in a globally distributed environment such as this community.
the adjusted r2of the regression models were small indicating that these e ects highlight only a tiny amount of the wide variance in the time to respond to comments on work items.
because of the complex nature of the items discussed on the tracker external feature requests bug reports and planning for new207features are all common it is di cult to tell to what degree these results are in line with prior research.
the use of exponential random graph models holds significant promise for the future of modeling these behaviors.
in particular this work took the network as a static entity rather than a dynamically evolving entity that grows and morphs as a project progresses.
basic exponential random graph models cannot account for this level of dynamism in the social graph however there are advanced models being developed that may be able to account for these shifting networks .
archival communication data obtained from computer mediated communication systems such as work item trackers is an ideal data source to use to generate these evolutionary social networks and may prove for a very fruitful research path.
finally we ve only studied a single albeit very large and open project for this research.
the team behind the project is one of the best teams inside of ibm and is very experienced with distributed collaboration both in terms of using tools to support distributed collaboration and also in terms of managing a distributed agile development process.
however being a single project this may amplify issues with the data used for this work.
for example we made no e ort to account for transitions to daylight savings time summer time.
additionally although we were fortunate with this model a team that works in extreme northern parts of the world would have a very di erent model because of the fact that the shortest geographic distance between two individuals would cross the polar regions.
in addition to the rational team concert server employed by the team the team also makes heavy use of additional web based collaborative development tools instant messengers and of course email.
as the team matured the use of non automated email decreased significantly while the use of the tracker skyrocketed which may have an impact on the final model.
although we did find that temporal o set resulted in slower responses we counterintuitively found that geographic distance resulted in faster responses.
it is possible that this team was an extreme outlier in these regards and that examination of other teams may result in dramatically di erent findings.
.
conclusion this work attempted to put some hard data behind the oft repeated mantra of agile and distributed software development latitude hurts longitude kills which is taken to mean that geographical separation between members of a development team may cause some di culty in interaction whereas temporal separation is likely to make things significantly more di cult.
we evaluated the relative pain in two di erent ways the amount of time that it takes to get a response from another individual and the probability of ever having communicated with other individuals on the team.
we found that indeed when it comes to the amount of time required to respond to a comment on a work item that longitude kills.
in contrast we found very little evidence of latitude hurting.
on a social basis when a statistical network model was created the opposite e ect was found.
individuals who were temporally distributed were more likely via the project work item tracker perhaps using it as a substitute for synchronous communication.
we hope that this work has put some academic rigor behind latitude hurts longitude kills .
in reality like mostaphorisms the reality is significantly more complicated.
organizations using global software development strategies may want to consider finding ways to reduce response time of geographically distributed teams by minimizing temporal separation while strengthening the support for computer mediated communication tools that foster communication across time and space.
