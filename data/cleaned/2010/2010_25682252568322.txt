yet we know little on whether developers are bene tting from the extra power of dvcs.
without such knowledge researchers developers tool builders and team managers are in the danger of making wrong assumptions.
in this paper we present the rst in depth large scale empirical study that looks at the in uence of dvcs on the practice of splitting grouping and committing changes.
we recruited participants for a survey that sheds light into the practice of using dvcs.
we also analyzed 409m lines of code changed by commits made by developers in repositories containing a total of 73m loc.
using this data we uncovered some interesting facts.
for example i commits made in distributed repositories were smaller than the centralized ones ii developers split commits more often in dvcs and iii dvcs commits are more likely to have
