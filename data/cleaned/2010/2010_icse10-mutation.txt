ncsu.edu abstract due to the expensiveness of compiling and executing a large number of mutants it is usually necessary to select a subset of mutants to substitute the whole set of generated mutants in mutation testing and analysis.
most existing research on mutant selection focused on operator based mutant selection i.e.
determining a set of sufficient mutation operators and selecting mutants generated with only this set of mutation operators.
recently researchers began to leverage statistical analysis to determine sufficient mutation operators using execution information of mutants.
however whether mutants selected with these sophisticated techniques are superior to randomly selected mutants remains an open question.
in this paper we empirically investigate this open question by comparing three representative operator based mutant selection techniques with two random techniques.
our empirical results show that operator based mutant selection is not superior to random mutant selection.
these results also indicate that random mutant selection can be a better choice and mutant selection on the basis of individual mutants is worthy of further investigation.

introduction in software testing test adequacy criteria play an important role in determining whether the software under test sut is adequately tested .
with a test adequacy criterion a tester can continually create new test cases until the suite of test cases created so far satisfies the criterion.

is an intensively studied way to construct such a test adequacy criterion.
in mutation testing many faulty versions known as mutants of the sut are generated through automatically changing the sut with mutation operators each of which is a rule to produce faulty versions and can be applied to various statements.
since the first proposal mutation testing has attracted the attention of many researchers .
recently researchers used mutation operators to automatically produce faulty software to facilitate experimentation in research of software testing .
andrews et al.
and do et al.
reported some evidence that faults generated with mutation operators are similar to real faults in evaluating test effectiveness.
following the terminology of andrews et al.
we refer to this way of using mutation as mutation analysis .
mutation testing and mutation analysis are usually very expensive.
for example using mutation operators proteum generates mutants for tcas which is the smallest program among the siemens programs and contains only non commenting and non whitespace lines of code .
thus compiling and executing a large number of mutants can be a big burden in mutation testing and analysis.
to alleviate this burden researchers have proposed various techniques for selecting a subset of all the mutants.
naturally researchers want the set of selected mutants to be similar to the set of all mutants e.g.
in terms of defining a test adequacy criterion .
one simple technique is random mutant selection in which given a fixed percentage number denoted as x x mutants are randomly selected.
however researchers seem to be more enthusiastic at investigating operator based mutant selection which aims to select mutants generated with only a set of sufficient mutation operators1.
while early research on operator based mutant selection tries to determine sufficient mutation operators via simple rules recent research relies on sophisticated procedures to determine sufficient mutation operators involving statistical information that can be acquired only through executing a large number of mutants with a sufficiently large set of test cases.
despite the enthusiasm in investigating operator based mutant selection whether operator based mutant selection is superior to random mutant selection for mutation testing remains an open question.
that is to say despite recent progress in operator based mutant selection e.g.
offutt et 1a set of mutation operators are sufficient if the mutants generated by the mutation operators can very much represent the mutants generated by all the mutation operators.al.
barbosa et al.
and siami namin et al.
there is lack of empirical evaluation of these operator based mutant selection techniques against random mutant selection techniques.
furthermore as we can view random mutant selection as an approach to mutant selection with average effectiveness answering the preceding open question can help us gain insights and deep understanding to the current research and achievements on mutant selection.
in this paper we report an empirical study attempting to answer this open question.
to evaluate the effectiveness of each mutant selection technique we adopt a widely used metric for evaluating mutant selection techniques.
the metric aims to measure to what extent the selected mutants are able to represent the whole set of mutants.
furthermore we also evaluate the stability of each technique by checking how consistently the technique performs under different circumstances.
for either effectiveness or stability our empirical results do not support that operator based mutant selection is superior to random mutant selection.
that is to say random mutant selection remains a competitive or even better choice compared with recent progress in operator based mutant selection.
as random mutant selection selects mutants on the basis of individual mutants instead of mutation operators our empirical results also indicate that mutantselection techniques based on individual mutants should be worthy of further investigation.
the main contributions of our study are as follows.
our study empirically evaluates three recent operatorbased mutant selection techniques i.e.
offutt et al.
barbosa et al.
and siami namin et al.
against random mutant selection for mutation testing.
our study produces the first empirical results concerning stability of operator based mutant selection and random mutant selection for mutation testing.
beside the random technique studied previously referred to as the one round random technique in this paper our study also investigates another random technique involving two steps to select each mutant referred to as the two round random technique in this paper .
the subjects used in our study are larger than those used in previous studies of random mutant selection.
to the best of our knowledge due to the extreme expensiveness of experimenting mutant selection techniques the siemens programs are by far the largest subjects2used in studies of mutant selection .
we organize the rest of this paper as follows.
section presents the experimental design in our study.
section presents and analyzes the results obtained from our experiments.
section discusses issues in our study.
section discusses related work.
section concludes and presents some future work.
.
experimentaldesign in this section we first present the research questions in our study.
then we describe the experimented techniques the tool used to obtain mutants the subject programs and the way of measuring each technique.
finally we describe the details of our experimental procedure.
2some studies such as do et al.
do use larger subjects but they do not focus on mutant selection and they do not consider all the generated mutants.
.
researchquestions in our study we investigate the following research questions rq1 how does operator based mutant selection compare with random mutant selection in terms of average effectiveness?
rq2 how does operator based mutant selection compare with random mutant selection in terms of stability?
in general average effectiveness measures how good the selected mutants are on average and stability measures how likely the selected mutants can be very bad.
sections .
and .
provide details of calculating average effectiveness and stability.

experimentedtechniques in our study we experimented three operator based mutantselection techniques i.e.
offutt et al.
s mutation operators barbosa et al.
s mutation operators and siami namin et al.
s mutation operators 3and two random mutant selection techniques.
given a number denoted as u the first random mutantselection technique is to randomly select umutants.
this technique is basically the x random technique studied by wong and mathur .
the second random mutantselection technique employs two steps when selecting each mutant.
the first step randomly selects a mutation operator and the second step randomly selects a mutant that is generated with the selected mutation operator.
using the two steps the second random technique continually selects one mutant that has not been selected previously until umutants are selected.
in this paper we refer to the first random technique as the one round random and the second random technique as the two round random .
for the one round random the probability of selecting each mutant is equal but for the two round random probabilistically speaking the number of selected mutants that are produced by each mutation operator is about the same.
.
supportingtool in our study we used proteum which is a mutation system implementing a comprehensive set of mutation operators for c programs to generate mutants for each subject.
the version of proteum used in our study supports mutation operators including traditional mutation operators and interface mutation operators .
as the mutation operators include offutt et al.
s mutation operators4 barbosa et al.
s mutation operators and siami namin et al.
s mutation operators we are able to use proteum to compare random mutant selection with all the three operator based mutant selection techniques.
.
subjectprograms the subjects used in our study are the siemens programs.
the siemens programs include seven c programs whose numbers of net lines of code not counting whitespace or commenting lines range from to .
hutchins et al.
3as wong and mathur s two mutation operators are among offutt et al.
s five mutation operators and offutt et al.
showed that any subset of the five mutation operators is not sufficient we did not empirically compare wong and mathur s two mutation operators in our study.

rothermel et al.
elbaum et al.
li et al.
jones et al.
and andrews et al.
used the siemens programs as subjects in testing experiments.
in particular a recent study on mutant selection by siami namin et al.
used only the siemens programs as subjects.
for each of the siemens programs hutchins et al.
provided a test pool and rothermel et al.
augmented the test pool through manually adding some white box test cases.
after augmentation the test pool for each program ensures that each executable statement edge and definition use pair in the base program or its control flow graph was exercised by at least test cases .
table depicts the statistics of the subjects.
note that the second column in table lists the abbreviations of the seven subjects and we use these abbreviations to denote the subjects when presenting our experimental results in section .
similar to siami namin et al.
we considered the following three reasons when choosing our subjects.
first the siemens programs contain typical structures that also appear in various large programs in c. second there is a large test pool for each of the siemens programs.
as measuring the effectiveness of selected mutants relies on the use of different test suites see section .
for the details of measurement in our study a large test pool allows us to construct a large number of test suites containing different test cases.
third as proteum generates a large number of mutants for even a small program using programs significantly larger than the siemens programs as subjects may result in huge computational cost.
actually beside siami namin et al.
who used only less than one third of the mutants that proteum generates for the siemens programs5 other researchers i.e.
wong offutt et al.
and barbosa et al.
used programs much smaller than the siemens programs for evaluating mutant selection techniques.
.
measurement in our study we adopted a metric that researchers used to evaluate the effectiveness of mutant selection techniques in previous studies on mutant selection for mutation testing e.g.
wong and mathur offutt et al.
and barbosa et al.
.
given a program denoted as p and a set of mutants denoted as am generated for pwith all mutation operators we removed equivalent mutants from amand acquired a set of non equivalent mutants denoted as nem .
when evaluating a mutant selection technique denoted as t we used tto select mutants from nem and denote the set of selected non equivalent mutants as mt.
to evaluate the effectiveness of t we created a series of test suites 5except for the smallest subject i.e.
tcas siami namin et al.
used mutants for each other subject.
denoted as ts1 ts2 ... ts n each of which can kill all mutants in mt.
we denote the subset of mutants in nem that can be killed by tsi i n askilled nem tsi and then we use formula to measure the effectiveness of t. eff t c8n i killed nem tsi nem n intuitively this metric measures the effectiveness of tas the representativeness of the set of non equivalent mutants selected by tfor the whole set of non equivalent mutants nem .
as the aim of mutation testing is to provide a testadequacy criterion this metric measures the representativeness of mtfornem as the representativeness of the testadequacy criterion based on mtfor the test adequacy criterion based on nem .
thus the closer eff t is to .
the more effective tis.
when eff t is equal to .
technique tis able to select a subset of mutants that fully represent the whole set of non equivalent mutants.
as measuring the effectiveness of a subset of mutants in our study requires a series of test suites we used a procedure similar to the procedure used by offutt et al.
to construct the test suites.
in particular for a subset of mutants we continually selected ktest cases from the test pool until the test suite composed of all the selected test cases is able to kill all the mutants in the subset.
offutt et al.
selected i.e.
k test cases each time when constructing such a test suite.
that is to say the numbers of test cases in test suites used by offutt et al.
are multiples of i.e.
etc.
.
actually offutt et al.
used this way of test suite construction to simulate the situation of applying mutation testing as a test adequacy criterion and the number of test cases selected each time represents an increment of test cases in the process of building up each test suite for evaluating mutant selection.
considering that testers may use different incremental numbers to create the test suite we used four different incremental numbers i.e.
k and including offutt et al.
s incremental number.
in our study given an incremental number we constructed test suites when measuring the effectiveness of a subset of selected mutants.
.
experimentalprocedure for each subject we used all the mutation operators in proteum to generate mutants.
the fifth column in table lists the number of all the generated mutants for each subject.
after acquiring all the mutants for each subject we executed each test case in the test pool of the subject against each mutant of the subject and the subject in the original form.
thus we acquired the information of which mutants are killed by which test cases for each subject.
similar to siami namin et al.
we deemed mutants that cannot be killed by any test case as equivalent mutants in our study.
the last column in table lists the number of nonequivalent mutants for each subject.
for a subject different operator based mutant selection techniques select different numbers of mutants.
thus it is difficult for us to compare all the three techniques with random mutant selection on the same ground.
therefore we used the following way to compare an operator based mutant selection technique with random mutant selection.
when comparing an operator based mutant selection technique denoted as t with random mutant selection on one subject we used tto select a subset of mutants denotedtable offutt et al.

asmt from all the non equivalent mutants denoted as nem of the subject.
to compare twith random mutant selection we used each random mutant selection technique to select a series of subsets of mutants from nem each subset containing mt mt and mt mutants.
to reduce accidental results for each random technique and each size of subsets we randomly selected msubsets of the same size.
that is to say for each subject and each random technique we randomly selected msubsets each containing mt mutants msubsets each containing mt mutants and msubsets each containing mt mutants.
after acquiring the subsets of mutants selected with tand the random mutant selection techniques we used the metric defined in section .
to measure the effectiveness of each technique.
for each random technique and each size of subsets e.g.
using a random technique to select mt mutants we used the average effectiveness of the msubsets as the effectiveness of that technique with that size.
in our study we set the value of mas which is large enough to avoid accidental results.
we further studied the stability of each technique in terms of standard deviation of its effectiveness.
for a random technique we calculated the standard deviation over the test suites and the subsets of mutants and for an operatorbased technique we calculated the standard deviation over the test suites.
.

to make the difference clear we keep two digits after the decimal point for each value.
from the three tables we have the following observations related to the average effectiveness.
first our results confirm that all the three operator based mutant selection techniques are able to achieve good effectiveness values.
in other words our results confirm that all 6due to space limit we use tables instead of figures to present the experimental results.

the three sets of mutation operators are sufficient.
according to the criterion proposed by offutt et al.
a mutantselection technique is good in effectiveness if it achieves an average effectiveness value over using test suites created with as the incremental number7.
based on this criterion all the three technique are good in effectiveness except for siami namin et al.
s technique on tcas i.e.
.
.
second despite the good effectiveness of the three operatorbased mutant selection techniques none of them is superior to random mutant selection when selecting the same number of mutants.
both random techniques outperform offutt et al.
s technique for four subjects i.e.
print tokens replace schedule and totinfo out of seven.
this trend is consistent for all the four incremental numbers.
both random techniques consistently outperform barbosa et al.
s technique for print tokens replace and totinfowith different incremental numbers.
for print tokens and schedule the two random techniques achieve almost the same average effectiveness as barbosa et al.
s technique.
both random techniques consistently outperform siami namin et al.
s technique for replace tcas and totinfowith different incremental numbers.
the two round random technique also achieves similar effectiveness values as siami namin et al.
s technique for schedule for different incremental numbers.
overall for any subject the difference between one operatorbased mutant selection technique and its corresponding random mutant selection techniques is quite small.
this ob7note that offutt et al.
s criterion of using an effectiveness value over is specific to the incremental number of .servation indicates that random mutant selection is still as competitive as or even better than operator based mutantselection in terms of average effectiveness.
third compared with the three operator based mutantselection techniques random mutant selection is able to achieve competitive effectiveness when selecting fewer mutants.
in general for any random technique and any subject the differences between selecting and mutants are quite small.
thus the difference between each operator based mutant selection technique and its corresponding random techniques selecting or mutants are also small.
based on offutt et al.
s criterion for each operatorbased mutant selection technique using its corresponding random techniques to select is also good in effectiveness since the average effectiveness values are also over for all the subjects using test suites created with incremental number .
since there is no sophisticated strategy in random mutant selection this observation indicates that mutants selected by any of the three operator based mutantselection techniques are likely to be more than necessary.
fourth when comparing the two random techniques the one round technique is less effective than the two round technique for smaller subjects but more effective than the tworound technique for larger subjects.
we suspect the reason to be that the one round technique may fail to select any mutant for some important mutation operators when the number of mutants generated with these mutation operators is small.
without mutants generated with these mutation operators the selected set of mutants is not as representative as those containing mutants generated with all the differenttable siami namin et al.

mutation operators.
however for the two round technique the distribution of selected mutants over the mutation operators may be very different from the distribution of all the non equivalent mutants over the mutation operators when the subject becomes large.
thus mutants selected by the two round technique may be less representative than those selected by the one round technique for large subjects.
finally although different incremental numbers impact the effectiveness values for any experimented techniques and any subjects the preceding observations are consistent for different incremental numbers.
typically with the increase of the incremental number the effectiveness value for any technique on any subject also increases.
we suspect the reason to be that different incremental numbers result in different sizes of created test suites and the differences in test suite sizes lead to the differences in effectiveness value s. we further checked the average sizes of test suites under different incremental numbers and corroborated this suspicion.
table depicts average test suite sizes for measuring offutt et al.
s technique on the seven subjects under different incremental numbers.
the trends in average test suite sizes for other experimented techniques are similar.
due to space limit we do not present the average test suite sizes for them here.
note that due to the nature of the metric used in our study the test suites created with any incremental number usually are of different sizes and thus the average test suite sizes are not multiples of or .table average test suite sizes for measuring offutt et al.

stability based on the standard deviation values depicted in tables and we have the following observations on comparing the stability of the three operator based mutant selection techniques and random mutant selection techniques.
first all the experimented techniques are quite stable in effectiveness.
for any experimented technique the standarddeviation values are typically less than .

percentage points.
most of those exceptionally large standarddeviation values come from siami namin et al.
s technique and random techniques with mutants on tcas which is the smallest subject.

second similar to the observation on average effectiveness any of the three operator based mutant selection techniques is not more stable than random mutant selection when selecting the same number of mutants.
both random techniques are more stable than offutt et al.
s technique for print tokens replace schedule and totinfo and are as stable as offutt et al.

both random techniques are more stable than barbosa et al.

s technique for print tokens schedule and tcas.
both random techniques are more stable than siami namin et al.
s technique for schedule tcas andtotinfo and are as stable as siami namin et al.
s technique for replace .
it is interesting to note that a technique achieving better effectiveness values is typically also more stable.
third when comparing the two random techniques the one round technique seems to be less stable than the tworound technique for smaller subjects but more stable than the two round technique for larger subjects.
this observation is in accordance with the observation on comparing the effectiveness of the two random techniques.
furthermore given a random mutant selection technique selecting more mutants is more stable than selecting fewer mutants.
.
reduction inmutants as the preceding results indicate that none of the three operator based mutant selection techniques is superior to random mutant selection in terms of either effectiveness or stability we further examine their ability to reduce the number of mutants.
table depicts the percentage of selected mutants among all the non equivalent mutants for each subject.
from this table we have the following observations.
first all the three operator based mutant selection techniques are able to substantially reduce the number of mutants.
either offutt et al.
s technique or siami namin et al.
s technique is able to reduce about mutants i.e.
select about mutants while barbosa et al.
s technique is able to reduce mutants i.e.
select about mutants .
our result for siami namin et al.
s technique is similar to that reported by siami namin et al.
i.e.
.
.
our result for offutt et al.
s technique is different from that reported by offutt et al.
i.e.
.
we suspect the reason to be that we considered much more mutation operators than offutt et al.
our result for barbosa et al.
s technique is also different from that reported by barbosa et al.
i.e.
.
we suspect the reason to be that barbosa et al.
used mutation operators which were implemented in proteum by rather than mutation operators in our study.
this result also indicates that barbosa et al.
s technique selects much more mutants than either offutt et al.
s technique or siami namin et al.
s technique.second for each technique the precentage of selected mutants does not differ much for a different subject.
this observation indicates that the reduction in mutants is highly predictable for any of the three operator based mutant selection techniques.
furthermore when applying random mutant selection in practice we may use the average ratio of selected mutants for an operator based mutant selection technique as a guidance to determine the number of mutants to select.
for example randomly selecting mutants from mutants generated with the proteum mutation operators is likely to achieve similar effectiveness and stability as offutt et al.
s technique.
.
discussion in this section we discuss the following issues related to our study threats to validity cost of mutant selection and some further implications of our experimental results.
.
threats tovalidity .
.
internalvalidity threats to internal validity are concerned with uncontrolled factors that may also be responsible for the results.
in our study the main threat to internal validity is the possible faults in our experiments and result analysis.
to reduce this threat we used proteum for mutant generation.
furthermore we reviewed all the code that we produced for our experiments and analysis before conducting the experiments.
note that the experimented techniques are all straightforward to implement and their implementation is thus less likely to threaten the internal validity.
.
.
externalvalidity threats to external validity are concerned with whether the findings in our study are generalizable for other situations.
the main threat to external validity lies in the representativeness of the subjects.
to reduce this threat we chose seven subjects written in c and these subjects contain a wide range of data and control structures commonly used in c or even c and java programs .
conducting more experiments using more subjects of larger sizes and with structures not contained in our subjects is one way to further reduce this threat.
note that when experimenting with subjects containing object oriented structures mutation operators on these structures should also be considered.
.
.
constructvalidity threats to construct validity are concerned with whether the measurement in our study reflects real world situations.
the main threat to construct validity is the way we measured the effectiveness of selected mutants.
to reduce this threat we used a metric commonly used by previous studies such as offutt et al.
and barbosa et al.
.
further reduction of this threat requires the design of better metrics to assess the effectiveness of selected mutants in mutation testing.
the metric used in our study actually measures to what extent the selected mutants are representative for mutants generated with all the mutation operators.
indeed users of mutant selection techniques may be more concerned with the representativeness of the selected mutants for real faults.
such concerns may be alleviated by previous empirical studies showing evidence that mutants generated with mutation operators are similar to real faults in evaluating test effectiveness.
but it is worthwhile of conductingempirical studies directly on representativeness of the selected mutants for real faults in future work.
furthermore the metric used in our study requires a series of randomly created test suites but test suites used in practice may not be created randomly.
.
cost ofmutantselection according to offutt et al.
the expensiveness of mutation testing mainly lies in the need to compile and execute a large number of mutants against each test case.
compared with the cost of compiling and executing mutants the cost of mutant selection is typically very small.
in our study we used proteum as the platform for mutant selection.
in particular we ran proteum on a pc with a genuine intel cpu t1400 at .83ghz and 1gb memory running suse linux version .
.
.
.
with the tcshshell version .
.
.
for each subject proteum generated the selected mutants in a few seconds.
for the smallest subject i.e.
tcas the time is less than one second for the largest subject i.e.
replace the time is less than four seconds for each other subject the time is less than two seconds.
but the total time for us to compile and execute all the mutants for all the seven subjects against all the test cases under the same hardware and software environment is about one month cpu time.
note that offutt et al.
s barbosa et al.
s and siami namin et al.
s techniques averagely select .
.
and .
mutants respectively.
that is to say compiling and executing mutants selected by one of the three operator based mutantselection techniques for all the seven subjects against all the test cases may take two to five days.
as a result for either operator based mutant selection or random mutant selection there is little difference in the cost of mutant selection.
one issue that we may need to consider is the way that barbosa et al.
s and siami namin et al.
s techniques use to determine mutant operators.
in particular both techniques determine the set of sufficient mutation operators using training data acquired through compiling and executing mutants against test cases.
that is to say both techniques may require some extra cost besides compiling and executing the selected mutants.
however as their cross validation indicates that the set of sufficient mutation operators determined with some programs may also be applicable for other programs the extra cost of either barbosa et al.
s technique or siami namin et al.
s technique should be considerably small.
.
furtherimplications the findings of our study have the following implications.
first as the three operator based mutant selection techniques are not superior to the two random mutant selection techniques in terms of either effectiveness or stability random mutant selection techniques may be a better choice in practice due to their flexibility in controlling the number of selected mutants.
note that random mutant selection techniques can achieve similar effectiveness and stability even when selecting much fewer mutants.
second the findings in our study also imply that we may need much fewer mutants in mutation testing than those selected by existing operator based mutant selection techniques.
that is to say it is very likely that new mutantselection techniques can be invented to select much fewer mutants but with similar or even better effectiveness and stability.
random mutant selection may be a good starting point.third considering the nature of random mutant selection the following difference between random mutant selection and operator based mutant selection may be an explanation of the surprisingly good results of random mutant selection.
random mutant selection selects mutants on the basis of individual mutants but operator based mutant selection needs to include or exclude all the mutants generated with one mutation operator as a whole.
if this difference accounts for the goodness of random mutant selection techniques that both consider the difference in operators and select mutants individually may outperform existing random or operator based mutant selection techniques.
.
relatedwork we next discuss related work on mutation testing and analysis and mutant selection.
.
mutation testingand analysis mutation testing is a fault based testing approach which is first proposed by hamlet and demillo et al.
.
in mutation testing the primary aim is to provide a rigorous test adequacy criterion that can help enhance test suites.
for the software under test sut a tester can use mutation operators to generate a number of mutants.
after identifying equivalent mutants the tester can use the remaining non equivalent mutants to enhance test suites.
for example if a test suite cannot kill all the remaining non equivalent mutants more test cases may be required to enhance the test suite.
another usage of mutation is mutation analysis whose aim is not to enhance test suites but to provide assessment of test effectiveness to facilitate experiments in testing research.
it is interesting to note that researchers such as briand et al.
have already used mutation faults to measure test effectiveness even before the empirical confirmation of their appropriateness by andrews et al.
and do et al.
.
for both mutation testing and analysis a major concern is the expensiveness of compiling and executing a large number of mutants.
in the literature there are mainly four categories of techniques to reduce this cost.
the first category is to select a subset of mutants as substitute.
as our research in this paper falls into this category we detailedly discuss research in this category in section .
.
the second category is to use low cost ways to determine which test case kills which mutant.
weak mutation and firm mutation are two representative techniques in this category.
the third category is to use efficient ways to generate compile and execute mutants.
as mutants only slightly differ from the original program taking the advantage of the commonalities of the mutants may accelerate the generation compilation and execution of the mutants.
compiler integrated mutation and schema based mutation are two representative techniques in this category.
the last category is to compile and execute mutants in parallel.
researchers have investigated parallel compilation and execution of mutants on different computer architectures .
techniques in different categories are typically complementary to each other as they can be combined together to reduce the cost of mutant compilation and execution.
the second concern in mutation testing and analysis is the cost in identifying equivalent mutants.
in the literature researchers proposed techniques for detecting equivalent mutants statically or dynamically .
for mutation testing there is still another concern the costof acquiring mutation adequate test suites.
in the literature researchers also proposed some techniques to automatically generate mutation adequate test suites .
techniques addressing both concerns are also complementary to research on mutant selection the focus of our research in this paper.
.
mutantselection mutant selection is an important way to reduce the cost of mutation testing and analysis.
since mathur first proposed the idea of excluding some mutation operators in mutation testing several researchers have studied operatorbased mutant selection.
in operator based mutant selection researchers first determine a set of mutation operators and then select only mutants generated with this set of mutation operators.
wong and mathur studied mutation operators among the mutation operators in mothra and found that mutants generated with these mutation operators can achieve similar results as mutants generated with all the mutation operators.
offutt et al.
experimentally determined mutation operators among the mutation operators in mothra and found that the effectiveness values of the mutation operators are between .
and on ten subjects with the average .
.
note that the effectiveness values are based on test suites created with incremental number .
furthermore offutt et al.
also found that without any of the mutation operators the effectiveness value on some subject would be lower than which they defined as the minimal requirement of a set of sufficient mutation operators for mutation testing.
note that wong and mathur s mutation operators are among offutt et al.
s mutation operators.
barbosa et al.
proposed six guidelines to determine sufficient mutation operators.
the application of some of the six guidelines requires compilation and execution of a large number of mutants.
based on the six guidelines barbosa et al.
determined mutation operators and found that using the same way as offutt et al.
to measure the effectiveness the effectiveness values of the mutation operators on subjects which were also used to determine the mutation operators are between .
and with the average of .
.
siami namin et al.
leveraged variable reduction to determine mutation operators using the execution information of a subset of mutants.
as their work aims at mutation analysis rather than mutation testing they evaluated the mutation operators on the siemens programs only in the context of mutation analysis.
they did not provide evidence about whether the operators are sufficient in mutation testing.
compared with studies on operator based mutation selection studies on random mutant selection which acree et al.
first proposed in are limited.
wong and mathur empirically studied the technique of randomly selecting to mutants generated with mutation operators in mothra.
barbosa et al.
used random mutant selection as a control technique when evaluating their mutation operators.
in their study barbosa et al.
s mutation operators are more effective than random mutant selection.
our study differs from previous studies on random mutant selection for mutation testing as follows.
first our study investigates some operator based techniques i.e.
offutt et al.
s technique and siami namin et al.
s technique previously not empirically compared withrandom mutant selection and our results on barbosa et al.
s technique contradict previous results.
second our study investigates two random mutant selection techniques while previous studies investigated only one random mutantselection technique.
third our study uses larger subjects than previous studies on random mutant selection.
finally our study investigates both average effectiveness and standard deviation of effectiveness while previous studies investigate only average effectiveness.
.
conclusion andfuturework in this paper we report an empirical study attempting to answer one important open question in the field of mutant selection for mutation testing.
our experimental results show that none of the three experimented operator based mutant selection techniques is superior to random mutant selection in terms of either effectiveness or stability.
furthermore random mutant selection can still achieve competitive results when selecting much fewer mutants than each operator based mutant selection technique.
in future work we plan to investigate the following issues.
first as siami namin et al.
s mutation operators which are determined for mutation analysis are quite effective in mutation testing we are thus interested in whether random and operator based mutant selection techniques for mutation testing are also effective in the context of mutation analysis.
second we plan to extend our experiments to other and larger subjects to further corroborate the findings in our study.
finally we also plan to investigate new techniques of mutant selection such as techniques combining random and operator based mutant selection as well as techniques on the basis of individual mutants.
