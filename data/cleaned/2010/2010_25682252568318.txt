nonetheless it remains unclear whether practitioners in the industry also share this percep tion.
this paper describes the outcome of an exploratorystudy in which industrial practitioners were interviewedon what makes a software system a legacy system what the main drivers are that lead to the modernization of such systems and what challenges are faced during the modern ization process.
the findings of the interviews have beenvalidated by means of a survey with respondents.
the results show that practitioners value their legacy systems highly the challenges they face are not just technical butalso include business and organizational aspects.

the primary aim of software modernization is to reduce maintenance cost and increase flexibility.
afterthree decades of legacy system modernization research itmay come as a surprise that many legacy systems are still in daily operation.
most of these systems were developed years ago and have continued to evolve.
new requirements haveled to frequent modifications of these legacy systems result ing in unstructured source code that is difficult to maintain.furthermore knowledge about the legacy systems is scarce as original programmers leave the company or retire and documentation is usually lacking .
these issues have been recognized by the software engineering community and a plethora of legacy system modernization approaches have been proposed cf.
section .
despite the problems introduced by legacy systems and theacclaimed benefits of legacy system modernization technol ogy consulting firms estimate that billion lines oflegacy code are still in active use .
this fact has triggered us to investigate how legacy systems and their modernizationareperceivedinindustry.
specifically weaimto identify the perceived benefits of legacy systems the maindrivers for legacy system modernization and the challenges professionals face with the modernization of legacy systems.
we have set up our research as an exploratory study aiming to discover new perspectives and insights about legacysystemsintheindustry.
accordingly weadoptedtheground ed theory approach an increasingly popular method to conduct empirical software engineering research .
we designed conducted and analyzed semi structured interviewswith industrial practitioners.
the findings of the in terviews were then validated through a separate structured survey in which professionals expressed dis agreementwith the results of the interview.
our study makes the following contributions .
we document the industrial perception of legacy systems and their modernization.
.
we identify the perceived benefits of the legacy systems driversofmodernization andchallengesthattheindustry faces during modernization.
.
we report the differences in perception of legacy systems between the industry and academia.
the paper is structured as follows.
in section we describe our study design.

.
study design we employed two different research techniques to conduct our study.
we started with semi structured in depth interviews a qualitative technique to identify how legacy sys tems and their modernization are perceived in industry.
wefollowed a grounded theory gt approach to ana lyze in depth semi structured interviews.
to further validate the findings of the gt we used a separate structured survey a quantitative technique.
in an empirical study suchas this the use of multiple research techniques qualitativeand quantitative techniques in our case increases the confidence that the results are reliable.
gt is an explorative research method that aims at discovering new perspectives and insights rather than confirmingexistingones .
westartedwithaseriesofinterviewscon ducted with practitioners identified as p1 p26 in this paper each lasting hours.
the informants were selected based on the two criteria that they have experiencewith legacy systems and with legacy system moderniza tion projects.
the informants were identified opportunistically via industrial collaborators followed by snowball sampling in which the first generation informants helpedus to identify other informants who fulfilled the criteria.
intotal interview sessions were performed.
in three of theinterview sessions the interview was conducted with two informants from the same organization.
furthermore two practitioners were from the same organization and this re duced the sample size of the participating organizations to22.
the sample is arguably broad enough to well represent the software engineering professionals.
moreover the sample shows diversity in the industry domain and the rolesand experiences of the participants.
table provides thedetails regarding the domain of each informant s company.with respect to size the companies range from small consulting firms to global corporations such as ibm deloitte and capgemini.
the variation among the informants rolesisalsobroad rangingfromsoftwaredeveloperstosysteman alysts consultants software architects business architects research and development managers and chief information officers cios .
the experiences of the informants rangefrom years to years with years as an average expe rience of the sample and cumulatively the informants have490 years of experience in information technology.
additionally the interview data totaled more than hours of recorded data.

prior to the interview session informants were provided with an interview protocol that consisted of sample questions to be discussed during the interview sessions.
the interview session has three categories of questions about characteristics of legacy systems driversfor legacy system modernization and challenges faced dur ingmodernization.
afterwards therecordedinterviewsweretranscribed and each interview transcript was analyzed throughcoding a process of breaking up the interviews into smaller coherent units and adding codes to these units.subsequently a process of writing down narratives that ex plain the ideas of the evolving theory known as memoing was used to develop the coding.
these coherent units represent key characteristics of the interview being analyzed.later the codes were organized into concepts which in turn were grouped into categories .
as the interviews progressively provided answers similar to the earlier ones a saturation stage was observed.
to confirm the saturation stage we conducted two more interviews and found that the anal ysis resulted in similar responses to the earlier ones.
weused nvivo 1as an instrumentation tool to facilitate the interview analysis process.
in the second and final phase of this research we adopted a structured survey as a data triangulation process in orderto validate the findings of the interview results.
a data tri angulation process a method that uses more than one data source or collects the same data at different occasions is typically used to increase decrease confidence in a find ing by providing confirming contradictory evidence and helps to improve validity of the findings of an empirical study such as this .
the survey was public and announced via mailing lists social media such as twitter linkedin facebook and via personal referrals.
in the end participants responded to the survey originating frommore than different countries.
we performed sampling to exclude responses having no experience with legacy systems.
in total out of were excluded leaving 176valid responses.
the respondents have an average experi ence of .
years with legacy systems.
developers formed the largest group of participants followed by it managers and researchers they come from variousdomains such as software development companies consulting companies service providers andfinancial institutions .
in the subsequent sections we present the results of our research categorized over the four themes legacy systems perceivedbenefitsoflegacysystems driversoflegacysystemmodernization and challenges of legacy system modernization.
for each theme we provide relevant quotes from the practitioners and the results of the survey.
for further details of the research we refer to our technicalreport inwhichweprovideadditionaldatatosupportour analysis.
in the technical report we provide the coding process consisting of different codes within categories.
for each code we give a short working description.
in addi tion we detail key quotes of all the informants p1 p26 toillustrate how the codes are derived.
furthermore the technical report also presents the survey with final results along with response counts and percentages.
the report also de scribes statistical analysis particularly multiple regressionanalysis to identify the relationships among the drivers oflegacy system modernization and use the results in this pa1 to support our findings.
to increase transparency of the data analysis process we publicly provide anonymous interview transcripts the nvivo project file of interview analysis and the survey data in excel format2.
.
findings in the following subsections we present the results of the analysis of the interview sessions and the results of the sur vey.
for each interview we started asking questions regard ing their personal information and experiences with legacysystems.
subsequently the informant was asked to give a definition for a legacy system based on his her opinion and the findings are discussed in subsection .
.
the discussion then proceeded by asking questions about perceived bene fits of legacy systems these findings are presented in sub section .
.
furthermore the informants were asked about the issues associated with legacy systems which are the drivers for legacy system modernization and such driversare discussed in subsection .
.
moreover the discussionproceeded to investigate the challenges faced during legacysystem modernization these findings are presented in subsection .
.
.
legacy systems the interview sessions started by asking a definition of a legacy system from the informants.
most of the informantsagreed that legacy systems are old systems.
additionally the informants pointed out that legacy systems are core systemsthathavebeenproventoworkcorrectlyinaproduc tion environment for decades.
p1 said most of the legacy systems are older than years.. most of the systems of the legacy systems are the core system .
p11 agreed with p1 by stating it is an old system ... a l o to fl e g a c ys y s t e mi st h ec o r es y s t e m .
interestingly most of the informants related legacy systems as systems that donot fit with the future it strategy of the organization.
p19 expressed this as my definition of a legacy system is systems and technologies that do not belong to your strategictechnology goals .
to investigate further the informants were asked if programming language is a determining factor for a system being legacy we obtained a mixed opinion.
more than half ofthe informants do not agree that the programming languageis a determining factor for a system to be legacy while therest were in agreement.
such a mixed opinion is also observed from the results of the survey.
around of the respondents agreed that the programming languages do de termine if a system is legacy.

.
business critical the interviews reveal that the practitioners view legacy systems as business critical.
as per the informants legacysystems are the core systems of the organizations and their failure can result in serious consequences for daily business.
p11 argued that legacy systems are significant to business taking an example of a financial organization.
he expressedhis opinion as it is very useful and has a business impact still and generates a lot of revenue for banking and their clients .
p14 a years experienced it director of a poultry company simply stated that legacy for me is let s say business critical .
p24 explained that legacy systems are old and business criticalas because they have been there for years so they really are the foundation for the survival of the organization .
these opinions clearly indicate that legacy systems support core business processesof a business and their failure can have significant impacton an organization.
the results of the survey also strongly support that legacy systems are business critical.
.
cf.
figure of the re spondents indicated that legacy systems are typically busi ness critical.
one of the respondents with years of experience gives his strong opinion through an open question of the survey as by definition a legacy system is business critical.
a system that is old and obsolete and is not businesscritical would never reach the status of legacy .
.
.
proven technology informants have frequently expressed that legacy systems are old and have been developed tested and have been inproduction environment for years.
hence it is an indica tion that legacy systems are of a proven technology that still remain as the core systems of many organizations.
p17 explained the proven technology characteristics with an ex ample of as400 as most of the time it s proven technology.
as400 is stable it always works and is quitegood.
so it s proven technology and normally it s stable is a good thing .
.
in our discussion with p4 he expressed proven technology is often the reason why they are still in use .
p11 associated availability with the proven technology andsaid they are available and they are more less up and running .
in the survey .
cf.
figure of the respondents indicated that legacy systems are proven technology.
.
.
reliable systems thedefinitionofreliabilityisadoptedfromiso iec25010 standard as degree to which a system product or component performs specified functions under specified condi tions for a specified period of time .
this definition wasprovided to the participants of interview and survey.
based on the interviews the practitioners indicated that legacy systems are reliable systems primarily because they arerunning in a production environment for decades.
p18 sup ports this statement and said it is reliable...people know h o wt ou s ei t .a llt h ep r o b l e m sh a v eb e e nfi x e do v e rt h ey e a r s from it.
so technical problems are usually not there .
other informants also share p18 s opinion as p1 stated the system has been around for a long time and has been tuned tostability robustness availability and so on.
so they re well performing and stable.
functionalities 38that count are stability robustness reliability and availabili t yo ft h i ss y s t e m .
in general legacy systems are perceived as reliable systems in industry because of the fact that they have been in production for years and possible bugs anderrors are already fixed in the past.
p12 s opinion is also in line with the others and he said they have been around for many years and during this period they have been stabilized .
the findings of the survey are in agreement with the opinion of the practitioners regarding legacy systems being re liable systems.

performance with regards to performance the interview revealed a mixed opinion.
some of the informants e.g.
p3 p10 p24 strongly emphasize on the high performance characteristics of legacy systems.
p3 expressed it s enormous.
enormous quick.
so the old system itself didn thave ...i don t think the performance isa problem .
p24 agreed with the opinion of p3 and further added i think ten thousand people are airlines booking with this little processing power.
so performance is never an issue in legacy system at least i ve never seenit .in contrast p9 and p18 perceive that legacy systems do not have high performance.
p9 with reference to a real time system that is being used in his manpower security company referred it is very poor .
p18 a software developer agreed with p9 the performance is not really good .
there are informants p13 p14 p9 p16 p26 who consider that performance of legacy systems as ok or enough .
inthesurvey .
cf.
figure2 oftherespondentsindicated that legacy systems are of high performance whichis comparatively low with respect to other characteristics.
one of the plausible reasons could be the fact that legacy systems get their job done and operate at good enough sat isfactory speeds in many cases.
.
drivers for legacy system modernization the informants not only expressed their opinion about perceived benefits of the legacy systems but also explainedabout issues related to the legacy systems.
.
.
to remain agile to change in current dynamic business environment organizations have to quickly adapt to various changes including intraorganizationalchanges changesinlawsandregulations changes in business collaboration mergers and acquisitions andfaster time to market .
despite the fact that legacy sys tems are business critical and reliable systems the infor mants expressed that legacy systems are inflexible to support changing business requirements.
p20 explained howthe inflexibility to adapt to new changes has enabled him to modernize legacy systems.
he said other point is that my costumer wants flexibility and a short time to market then you have to get rid of your legacy.
because legacy is rigid and it is not flexible .
p25 an it architect at the tax office agreed with p20 and said we had a lot of systems before and they were built in cics cobol db2 and were notflexible.
so they needed to be modernized to get more flexibility .
the informants identified faster time to market as one of the drivers for legacy system modernization becauselegacy systems are rigid which increases the difficulty inpromptly addressing the market demands.
p22 expressed this as we need a faster time to market and we are not able to do that in cobol environment .
the findings of the survey are in line with the opinions expressed by the interview respondents in which respon dents have strongly expressed that the need of flexibility to comply with the changing business requirements and rapidlyevolving future technologies do cause organizations to initiate legacy system modernization projects.
for the flexibil ity to change driver we depict the contributing drivers i.e.

high maintenance cost the interviews revealed that one of the significant drivers of legacy system modernization is high maintenance cost.more than half of the informants strongly argued that the cost involved in maintaining the legacy systems is high.
one of the most common motivations to modernize the legacy39systemsistoreducemaintenancecost.
p17explained with legacy systems the cost is getting higher because maintenance is getting more expensive maybe you should think of modernization .
often participants such as p12 p13 p14 argued that maintenance cost could be lowered ifthe legacy systems were modernized to standard softwareproducts.
for instance p12 mentioned but if you can move to standard product then it could be usually an advantage because the maintenance cost for standard productis usually lower .
p14 expressed if you look at the cost i m quite sure i can run a similar environment against lower cost if i would use a standardized product.
let s say state of the art erp environment...because i don tneed somebody to maintain .
from the survey we observed that respondents .
strongly indicated .
for strong and .
for very strong that the high maintenance cost of legacy systems is oneofthemajordriversbehindlegacysystemmodernization cf.
figure .
.
.
lack of knowledge as per the participants one of the most significant drivers of legacy system modernization is a lack of knowledge particulary scarcity of experts unavailability of up to date documentation and limited number of suppliers vendors ofthe legacy system.
more than of the informantspointed out that lack of resources of the legacy systemscauses organizations to modernize their legacy systems.
p10 argued that i think the big problem is that you can t find people to understand them and understandthe technology .
p11 not only indicated lack of experts but also pointed out the outdated documentation and explained the issue is that there is less knowledgeable people are available in the organization because the people of the system are already gone .
the characteristic of legacy systems is the lack of documenta tion .some informants p1 p2 expressed a fear that in future the scarcity of the experts of legacy systems will be a severe problem.
as to the limited number of supplier s vendors informants indicated it as a problem.
p17expressed there s no patches.
if suppliers stop their product organization needs to find another way to keep supporting their system .
in figure we depict the lack of knowledge driver comprising of lack of experts documentation and limitedsuppliers vendors as presented in the online survey.

for very strong of the respondents indicated that lack of suppliers ven dors is a strong driver for modernization.
furthermore .

driver for modernization cf.
figure .
.
.
prone to failures although reliable system is one of the perceived benefits of the legacy systems there is a fear shared by mostinformants that the legacy system might fail due to lack ofexperts and suppliers vendors.
informants have identified that prone to failure as a driver of legacy system modernization.
legacy systems are business critical and or ganizations cannot afford their legacy systems to fail.
p13expressed this as we have an old erp system old almost years old.
and it drives the production in the plantand also the logistic and warehouse and also the order towards the customers.
if that system stops the plant stops the warehouse stops .
often the informants indicated that risk of failure can be the result of other drivers such as limited suppliers vendors and lack of experts.
such opinion is shared by p2 as so when your environment runs out of support then it is really dyingand if that s true then you are already late .
in comparison with other drivers prone to failures is indicated as the weakest driver by .
of the respondents cf.
figure .
one of the plausible reasons for this could bethe fact that the prone to failure issue is countered by the reliable system perceived benefit of the legacy systems.
.
challenges of legacy system modernization upon identifying the drivers of legacy system modernization the study focused on identifying what challenges are faced by practitioners while modernizing legacy systems.based on the interviews the following challenges were iden tified.
.
.
time constraints to finish modernization the interviews revealed that finishing any legacy system modernization on time is the biggest challenge.
the timing constraint is influenced by other existing issues of legacy systems such as scarcity of resources such as experts and docu mentation.
p1 expressed the challenge as they run out of budget.. they run slightly out the time.
that s mainly to do with scarcity of people on the legacy system .
p13 also agreed with p1 and stated that the time constraint to finishmodernization project is influenced by lack of resources.
heexpressed this as your biggest problem is an availability of resources and availability of money and extent availability of time .
due to the long duration of the legacy system modernization projects many earlier plans regarding the modernization change andthis further delays the projects.
p7 shared his experience as legacy modernization project lasts too long.
we plan modernization for years and after years we stop the wholemodernization and start it over .
some of the respondents indicated that lack of resources is also one of the factors ofnot finishing legacy system modernization projects on time.
interestingly by far the largest percentage .
of the respondentsindicatedthatlegacysystemmodernizationpro jects frequently face time constraints to finish .
for challenging and .
for very challenging .
.
.
data migration theinformantsalsorevealedthatdatamigrationinlegacy system modernization project is also challenging.
p11 who was conducting a modernization project in an insurancecompany stressed the importance of the data migration as the main risk in modernization is that the data migration which cannot be done perfectly.
errors are made and you have some risk that your new system is disturbed after mod ernization .
some of the informants indicated that the difficulty of data migration is due to the old databases thatthe legacy systems use.
p17 explained this as data migration is really difficult because legacy system doesn t support modern databases or doesn t have relation database model .to mitigate the risk of legacy system modernization projectfailure p14 suggested planning for data migration upfront.

complex system architecture dealing with the complex system architecture of legacy systems is one of the important challenges that the practitioners face while modernizing legacy systems.
in the interviews the informants used poor architecture monolithicarchitecture or ill designed to express complex architec ture.
p1 expressed his opinion about system architecture as if you have ill designed legacy system or old fashioned design as a monolith system that might still be a challenge .
the informants frequently expressed that the complex ar chitecture is a result of ad hoc maintenance upgrade of thepast.
p9 explained this as not only the development part we have to think about the architecture of the system also.
because if people are bumping against architecture changingthe earlier architecture .
p2 further illustrated the challenge as and what you also find is that one application is developed that it uses also the database of another one.
and it s not through a normal interface but it s via back door to get some data over there .
p18 said because the program is really hard coded it is not configurable that makes modern ization difficult .
furthermore the result of such complex architecture has an impact on testing during modernization.
p12 argued that testing is a challenging during moderniza tion because it can be difficult to extract all the use cases to test.
it also requires a lot of work to compare functionality from legacy system to the new application.
it can be time consuming and difficult work .
in figure we represent the two contributing challenges of complexsystemarchitecture i.e.
non evolvablearchitecture and difficult to test individually as presented in the online survey.
cumulatively non evolvable archi tecture is perceived as a serious challenge by .
of therespondents while .
expressed the same for difficult totest .
.
.
lack of knowledge theinformantsfromtheinterviewperceivedlackofknowledge of the legacy systems as one of the important challenges.
p11 explained this as it is complex because you have a lot of different expertise needed to modernize such aspeople who understand database environment and operatingsystems middleware enterpriser services bus of architecture.
you also need people who understand business functionality to transform business functions from legacy sys tems to another system .
additionally lack of knowledge particularly documentation can be a big risk in legacy system modernization as p20 said if documentation is lacking then it is a bigger risk to migrate.
because you don t knoww h a ti sg o i n go ni nt h eo l ds y s t e ma n dt h er i s kt om i g r a t ei sbigger .
nevertheless p18 indicated the use of reverse engineering techniques to mitigate the lack of up to date documentation challenge.
he explained for the old systems 41we reverse engineer the old system and document them well so we know what the requirements are and can help to build new system .
as per survey results .
of the respondents have indicated that lack of knowledge is either challenging or verychallenging for legacy system modernization.
.
.
difficult to extract prioritize business logic asaneffectoflackofknowledge identifyingbusinesslogic within legacy systems becomes more challenging.
the informants revealed that extracting business logic is one of thechallenges in legacy system modernization.
p20 expressed this as to extract all the rules and details in there legacy systems is really difficult .
p12 expressed his experience as the company or the project team has to extract exactly the internal functionality of this legacy application.
itcan be difficult to extract to document and to implement it properly .
p12 further suggested using automated techniques to initially extract diagrams to better understand the business logic.
he explained this as so i think it can be really helpful to provide in sight into the internal working of the system to extract itto a human readable diagrams or documentation .
additionally p18 said yes you can only do that if you know exactly what the thing does.
that is is the hard part .
within the critical business processes supported by the legacy systems prioritizing the extractionof such business logic is also equally important.
note that we depict the difficult to extract prioritize business logic challenge comprising of difficult to extractbusiness logic and difficult to prioritize the functionality as presented in the online survey.
as per the results of the survey cf.

of the respondents agree that extracting business logic from the legacy systems is an ob stacle .

resistance from organization resistancetochangefromtheorganization includingusers and technical staff of legacy systems towards a new tech nology is a well documented phenomenon as they fear thattheir expertise and professional experience with legacy systems may become redundant due to modernization.
surprisingly not only is there resistance from technical staff but the informants also reported that cultural resistance toadapt to new technology is another challenge in legacy sys tem modernization.
p12 explained the resistance from staff as sometimes they see legacy systems as their baby and they tend to know every aspect of it.
sometimes it is diffi cult to work with them while modernizing because they mightnot share their knowledge .
most of the informants observed that the resistance of the existing technical staff is due to job security.
p6 explained this as because what is our need if we have a new system which is working not withcobol.
who is gonna need me anymore so theyditch me after it is done.
so why should i cooperate?
regarding cultural resistance informants identified that adapting to new technology is difficult for thestaff.
p11 strongly emphasized that cultural adaption is oneof the serious challenges.
he stated sometimes people do not like changes.
not only in the business organizations butalso in it organization.
so you need to persuade them for the need of transformation .
for the resistance from organization challenge we depict the challenges individually i.e.
resistance from staff and cultural resistance of organization in figure as presented in the online survey.

addressing soft factors of modernization in this study we adopted the concept of soft factors in modernization from murer et al.
that considers non technological factors such as people communication andbusiness values of organization.
the practitioners identified three soft factors as challenges.
first communicating the reasons consequences of legacy system modernization fol lowed by securing funding from the top management.
oftenthe informants indicated that the earlier challenge has an implication on the latter.
p10 a legacy system modernization consultant expressed his view as i think top management doesn t understand the issue and they don t give budgetfor it .
additionally the informants indicated that communicating the consequences of the modernization is also a challenge that is often centered on the return of investment roi .
p20 explained the difficulty ofpredicating roi as they are always looking for a short term return of investment.
once you put the money in they want to earn it back .
an effective way to convince the top management is to identify appropriatebusiness cases and explain the need consequences of legacysystem modernization.
p19 explained the need to use busi ness cases as you have to somehow come up with the business case that says what is my current cost what is the cost of migration what the new total cost of ownership and thatyou have to predict the return of investment.
a businesscase can have soft components like improve maintenance or improve performance because they represent business value .

discussion a number of pervasive findings have emerged from the current research regarding legacy systems and their modern ization many of which are new and surprising while some resonate with the findings of other researchers.
this section discussestheconfirmation contradictionofthefindingswiththe academic research and reflects on threats to validity ofthis research.
.
core system vs. obsolete system evidence from current research indicates that practitioners perceive legacy systems as core systems rather than ob solete systems as generally perceived in academia.
practi tioners do agree that there exist many problems with legacy systems such as they are inflexible and costly to maintain.
notwithstanding these issues legacy systems are crucial tothe execution of day to day business processes of organiza tions whatever the business domain they operate in.
legacysystems are often the back office systems which are rigid and inflexible compared to the front office systems.
for in stance in financial business cobol is predominantly used as back office systems to process millions of batch trans actions per day which is crucial to any financial institution.
the practitioners perceive legacy systems as crucial systems as they are business critical reliable and have been run ning in production for decades.
within the life cycle of thelegacy systems they have been well tested and practicallyrun without errors to execute business processes.
surprisingly the main consideration for practitioners to determine if a system is legacy depends on whether the func tionalities of the system are still in line with the business italignment of the organization.
this finding contrasts with the observations made in academia in which factors such as inflexibility expensive to maintain and evenuse of obsolete programming languages are frequentlyused to decide if a system is legacy.
however the findings ofthis study stand in contrast with this.
we observed mixed resultsfromtheinterview andsurveyfindings .
who agree that programming language is one of the factorsto determine if a system is legacy.
such a mixed observa tion has led us to further investigate if there is any interesting correlation.
consequently we performed a pearson chi square test to check if there exists any association be tween the role of the respondents different categories andthe choice of programming language as a deciding factor fora system being legacy.
the analysis with .
which is far less than the critical value .
revealed that such an association does not exist.
further it is interestingto observe that the practitioners could not formulate a con crete definition for a legacy system a frequently observed issue in academia e.g.

legacy system is a cash cow as identified by adolph the findings of this study just i f yt h en o t i o no fc a s hc o wu s e df o rl e g a c ys y s t e m s y s tems that have been bringing in revenue for years for or ganizations.
despite various problems this study revealed that practitioners perceive legacy systems as critical systems that execute the day to day business processes.
one of thefindings with respect to the business critical characteristicconforms with the observation made by brodie .
however other characteristics such as reliable system proven technology are merely discussed in academia.
in general legacy systems are presented as a quagmire in academia of ten reporting about the problems associated with them andhence urge for their modernization.
but in industry the legacy systems are still perceived as the backbone system of organizations.
these systems are developed tested andhave been processing millions of records for decades on adaily basis.
apart from the business critical characteristic the reliability of the legacy systems is the other predom inant factor that keeps legacy systems still alive in industry.
frequently the informants of the interviews indicatedthat legacy system are cash cows as generate a lot of revenue for banks p11 the most profitable systems p7 and great business value p10.
.
if it ain t broke don t fix it the aphorism if it ain t broke don t fix it suitably captures the belief among practitioners.
not only in the interviews but the respondents of the survey also stated in the others section of the survey that if the legacy systems are working well then legacy system modernization projects are unlikely to be initiated despite various problems.
some of the responses include they have been working why fix it?
by a developer with years of experience with legacy system and we didn t fix it last year and survived.
why should this year be different?
by a chief technical officer of a software development company.
one of the most significant problems raised by the practitioners is scarcity of knowledge including legacy expertsand up to date documentation of the legacy systems.
evidence in academia shows that lack of knowledge is one of the enablers for legacy system modernization .
apart from issues with documentation erosion of softknowledge existing knowledge in the form of skills andexperiences within the technical staff original developers maintainer users is also another problem that has triggered legacy system modernization in industry.
over theyears soft knowledge has become scarce resulting in knowl edge erosion due to factors such as ageing retirement and staff changing jobs.
furthermore khadka et al.
report on how various mergers and acquisitions of the supplier oftandemnonstopbasedcobolhastriggeredlegacysystemmodernization in a bank.
additionally the other significantdriver for legacy system modernization identified by practitioners is high maintenance cost a well reported issue of legacy systems in academia .
with respect to drivers of the legacy system modernization the findings of our study are in line with the problems reported in academia.
.
business vs. technical aspects a tale of two perspectives surprisingly the study findings reveal that the challenges of legacy system modernization in industry largely emerge from the business perspective and also complements most of the technological challenges reported in academia.
chal lenges such as funding modernization projects resis tance from organization predicating roi timing con straints to finish strongly relate to business perspectives of legacy system modernization.
this observation also holds true for the drivers of modernization.
in particular the become flexible to change driver is identified by and the fastertime to market by68 oftherespondentsinthe surveyreflecttheimportanceofthebusinessaspectoflegacy system modernization.
furthermore the need for a busi ness case to communicate the necessity and consequencesof modernization to the top management also reflects theimportance of business aspects of modernization.
such evidence clearly indicates that legacy system modernization is not just a technical endeavor but also a business endeavor.lately legacy system modernization research has also fo cused on considering the business and organization aspects43together with the technical aspects e.g.

limitations and threats to validity adolph et al.
argues that explorative qualitative research is often viewed with discomfort in software engineer ing with regards to research validity and verification as assessing the validity of qualitative research is a challengingtask .
in the following subsections the most relevantthreats to validity are discussed.
.
.
credibility credibility refers to the fact that the findings of the research are free from any potential research bias.
as to mit igate the internal validity and to strengthen the credibilityof the research various measures have been adopted.
to start with sampling of the informants for the interview and survey was performed in which only the informants havingexperiences with legacy systems and legacy system mod ernization were included.
furthermore the research closelyfollowed the gt guidelines including careful coding memoing and categorization.
each coding and categories were cross validated with the other researchers in the process ofdeveloping.
additionally the results of the interviews weretriangulated with an online survey filled in by respondents.
to increase the transparency of the research various artifacts such as interview records interview transcripts in terviewprotocol detailsofthecodingprocessandtheresultsof the survey are made available .
.
.
generalizability generalizability is concerned with to what extent the findings can be generalized.
one of the potential threats to theexternal validity is the fact that all the interview informants are from the dutch industry.
this choice may somehow biasthe results.
however the distribution of the informants includes different company sizes different level of experience different roles and variation in the domain of the companies refer table arguably increases the generalizability of the findings.
furthermore thefindingsoftheresearchhavebeen validated by respondents from more than different coun tries in the survey which also increases the confidence ofgeneralizability.

legacy systems and their characteristics legacy systems have been researched over the past three decades.
the seminal work in this area is the first law ofcontinuing change by belady lehman followed by theconcept of preventative maintenance .
both of these works put emphasis on addressing changes to make software systems more maintainable.
following the conceptsof software evolution maintenance brodie stonebrakerdescribe legacy systems as any systems that cannot be modified to adapt to constantly changing business requirements and their failure can have a serious impact on business .
mentions various characteristics of legacy systems such as mission critical hard to maintain inflexible and brittle.
bisbal et al.
listed problems of legacy systems such as legacy systems run on obsolete hardware areexpensive to maintain suffer from lack of documentationand understanding of system and are difficult to extendand integrate with other systems.
alderson and shah describe the issue regarding the lack of legacy experts resources.
from the aforementioned definitions and charac teristics of legacy systems it is evident that legacy systemsare perceived as a serious problem in academia.
the current study in contrast takes a different approach in identifying the characteristics that still keep them operational in theindustry.
nevertheless the study also explores various is sues of the legacy systems that are in line with the issuesidentified in the academia.
in fact we explicitly identified overlaps between the issues of legacy systems as observed in academia and in industry such as high maintenance cost lackofresources achieveflexibility.
inthisresearch wehavepresented these issues as drivers for legacy system modernization.

seacord et al.
in their book presenteda risk managed approach to legacy system modernization.
various methods techniques have been used to modernize legacy systems such as architectural pattern languages feature modeling iterative engineering wrappers and aspects .
in the last decade theadvancement of web based technologies has fostered legacy system modernization e.g.
.
in particular the service oriented architecture soa has been a popu lar target architecture for legacy system modernization andvarious legacy to soa modernization approaches have been reported e.g.
khadka et al.
razavian lago almonaies et al.

with respect to legacy system modernization challenges brodie listed various technical challenges of legacy sys tem modernization that are more influenced by academic research experiences.
sneed discussed recurring risks such as performance loss architectural mismatch testingbottleneck current staff s rejection that are associated witha reengineering projects.
van deursen et al.
presented an overview of techniques to facilitate legacy system modernization and the issues of modernization particularly aim ing at identifying objects.
in a research roadmap bennett rajlich argued to generalize the legacy system mod ernization approaches beyond source code and to include data and objects of the current legacy systems.44the legacy system modernization research and the challenges identified in the academia are largely technologyoriented.
they provide different techniques methods to facilitate legacy system modernization and point out vari ous challenges faced in the course of applying those tech niques methods.
our research not only identified variousbusiness and organizational issues but also confirmed the technical observations made by researchers.
.
empirical system legacy modernization research sneed reported a case study of modernization of a commercial application system for distributing books andother publications.
colosimo et al.
performed two controlled experiments to evaluate migration of cobol based system to a j2ee web based system.
murer et al.
pre sented their experience with an evolutionary approach tomigrate legacy software of credit suisse bank.
their findings largely complement our results as they focus not only in technical details of the modernization but also on thebusiness and organizational aspects.
apart from technicalissues the authors in particular identify the importance ofknowledge existing within the technical staff role of cultural values of the organization in the modernization process.
nasr et al.
present their experience with realizingtwo soa migration case studies in which they identify var ious business issues such as resistance to change from the organization time constraints to finish modernization along with technical issues such as lowering the maintenance cost and increased flexibility.
from an industrial perspective torchiano et al.
surveyed italian companies to iden tify the state of the practice in software modernization and explained that the main factor influencing the modernization process is human factor followed by technological fac tors and issues related with data inconsistency.
razavian lago conducted interviews to understand how legacy to soa migrations are conducted in industry aiming at identifying which modernization activites processes are prevalentin industry.
in a report published by nascio a surveyof states in the us is reported with the aim to identifythe state of art of legacy systems and the challenges faced during their modernization.
the findings of these studies resonate with the results of our study.
the findings of this study undoubtedly supportthe results of these studies yet we have employed different research methods qualitative and quantitative methods to further increase the reliability of the findings.
in most ofthe aforementioned studies such as a single re search method is used.
with respect to the observationalstudies we refer to future work to validate our findings.
.
concluding remarks although legacy systems and their modernization have been extensively researched this paper addresses the rel ative absence of empirical studies of industrial perceptionof legacy systems and their modernization.
to the best ofour knowledge this is the first attempt to empirically investigate the perceived benefits of legacy systems problems associated with legacy systems that initiate modernization and the challenges faced during modernization from an in dustrial perspective.
with the current status of our research some of our findings provide empirical evidence for existinghypothesis from the literature while others provide new insights that extend the body of knowledge on software mod ernization.
what this study adds to the discourse is an evidence that legacy systems are not necessarily a quagmire but are business critical reliable and proven systems that effectively ex ecute the day to day business of organizations.
such per ceived benefits of legacy systems are the factors that keep them alive in industry.
not to mention that the practitioners are largely motivated by the if it ain t broken don tfix it aphorism towards legacy system modernization.
inaddition the study identifies drivers of and the challengesfor legacy system modernization.
the drivers of the legacy system modernization in industry confirm the observation made such as lack of knowledge high maintenance costs and achieving flexibility.
however the challenges of legacysystem modernization faced by the practitioners are not just technical but also organizational and highly motivated bybusiness considerations.
in summary this study documents the following contributions .
we document the industrial perception of legacy systems and their modernization.
.
we identify the perceived benefits of the legacy systems driversofmodernization andchallengesthattheindustry faces during modernization.
.
we report the differences in perception of legacy systems between the industry and academia.
the findings reported in this study is the outcome of an empirical research.
we therefore want to convey that thefindings and the conclusions drawn are suggestive ratherthan conclusive.
we do not claim to have comprehensivelyaddressed all the perceived benefits and the drivers of legacy systems andthechallengesfacedduringlegacysystemmodernization in the industry.
however the detailed groundedtheory approach that we have adopted for analyzing the in terview data followed by the validation of the findings via an online survey increase our confidence to claim that the findings and conclusions drawn represent a significant view.
the findings have the following implications with these findings in hand academics can re focus their efforts inlegacy system modernization to include besides the technological scope the organizational issues and business drivers for modernization and in order to benefit from academicresearch results practitioners should examine the academictools techniques and methods developed for legacy system modernization and initiate collaborations.
as to future work we aim at validating the findings of the current study using observational participating research in anumber of real world modernization scenarios.
in addition we believe that this study has highlighted practitioners issues which the research community can address in order to facilitate technology and knowledge transfer.
