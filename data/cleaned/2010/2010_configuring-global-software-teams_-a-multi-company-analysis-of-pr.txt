configuring global software teams a multi company analysis of project productivity quality and profits abstract in this paper we examined the impact of project level configurational choices of globally distributed software teams on project productivity quality and profits.
our analysis used data from projects of four different firms.
these projects spanned a wide range of programming languages application domain process choices and development sites spread over countries and continents.
our analysis revealed fundamental tradeoffs in choosing configurational choi ces that are optimized for productivity quality and or profits.
in particular achieving higher levels of productivity a nd quality require diametrically opposed configurational choices.
in addition creating imbalances in the expertise and personnel distribution of project teams significantly helps increase profit margins.
however a profit oriented imbalance could also significantly affect productivity and or quality outcomes.
analyzing these complex tradeoffs we provide actionable managerial insights that can help software firms and their clients choose configurations that achieve desired project outcomes in globally dist ributed software development.

introduction global software development has become a dominant operational model for developing and deliveri ng software intensive systems.
software development organizations continue to expand and disperse geographically in search of lower project cycle times the ability to deliver high quality software at a lower cost and the right talent necessary to develop the increasingly more complex software systems.
however realizing the benefits of dispersing software development does come with associated costs and challenges.
over the last decade the negative impact of geographic distribution in softwa re development has been well documented e.g.
.
physical separation often introduces barriers that hinder software engineers ability to adequately communicate and coordinate their work as well as stay aware of other peoples activities .
problems in communication coordination and awareness lead to longer times to complete development tasks as well as more errors which ultimately resu lt in more software defects and development costs.
given the rapid growth of the global software development model in spite of the documented theoretical and empirical evidence of the pitfalls and challenges of the model it is important to understand how global software teams are still able to reap benefits from distributed development.
recent research has highlighted ways in which some teams have mitigated the challenges of global distributed development through appropriate process investments and quality management practices .
this study takes a step further by examining the relationship between the configurational characteristics of the software project teams and project performance.
configurational characteristics of distributed software teams refers to the structural properties of the geographic dispersion and accounts for the different ways in which the developers are dispersed in addition to the well studied time zone and distance measures i.e.
the spatio temporal characteristics .
theoretical support for the need to study configurational characteristics comes from recent organizational studies that have established geographic dispersion as a multi dimensional construct with each dimension having distinct implications for the psychological social and organizational proces ses that underlie individuals ability and willingness to adequa tely communicate coordinate and collaborate .
there is also an emerging body of empirical evidence supporting the call for a more careful consideration of how the nature of work distribution impacts critical outcomes in software development projects.
for example a very consistent result reported by researchers is that development tasks take longer in a distributed setting versus a co located one e.g.
.
however a software project represents a collection of development tasks and the loss in productivity at the task level could be reduced or overcome by increasing the concurrency of proj ect activities.
in the context of software quality time zone separation reduces the opportunities for synchronous interaction leading to higher levels of misunderstandings and errors .
nearshoring locating teams nearer to the customer in terms of time zones has been proposed as an alternative that alleviates these detrimental effects .

261the ways in which developers are dispersed across the development locations is significantly more detrimental to quality than the impact of time zone separation per se .
these examples illustrate the need to develop a better understanding of how the different dimensions of geographic dispersion jointly impact performance outcomes such as development productivity and software quality.
in this paper we examine the impact of several configurational dimensions of geographic disper sion on the productivity quality and profit outcomes of distributed software development projects.
we collected data from projects from four different companies.
these projects spanned a wide range of programming languages application domain process choices and development sites spread over countries and continents.
our analyses revealed that project configurations that achieve high productivity tend to achieve low quality and vice versa suggesting that managers face a challenging optimizing task when configuring their project teams.
further imbalances in the configurations are often benefi cial to project profitability presenting a complex tradeoff between the three performance outcomes of productivity quality and profits.
the key contributions of this paper are the following we take the first step in rigorously establishing the relationship between configurational dimensions of dispersion with multiple project performance outcomes that are considered jointly.
this departs from prior work that typically considers each performance outcome in isolation and therefore missing the interrelated tradeoffs between different performance outcomes and project level configurations.
we analyzed the complex tradeoffs induced by project configurational choices and provide actionable insights that can help development managers and clients choose configurations that achieve desired outcomes in a distributed software development environment.
we collected and analyzed a large dataset spanning multiple companies programming languages processes application domains and geographical locations which significantly improves the generalizability of our results.
.
geographic dispersion and software project performance as global software development projects become pervasive the nature of the distribution of development work and its relationship to outcomes of distributed projects have gained increasing attention from software engineering researchers e.g.
.
this line of research has typically considered the spatio temporal characteristics of work distribution distinguishing between co located and distributed development using measures such as the number of locations involved or the time zone separation .
a recent stream of research in organizational studies has started to examine the multi dimensional nature of distribution by considering conf igurational characteristics of distributed teams in addition to spatial and temporal dispersion measures .
spatial dispersion refers to physical separation among the engineers participating in a development project and researchers have typically measured it as the distance between team members.
the key implication of spatial dispersion is the reduction in impromptu communication which leads to lower levels of awareness of what the distributed project members are the decisions that they are making or the problems that they might have .
such a barrier to communication and awareness could result in coordination brea kdowns and software integration problems which in turn could lead to longer time to complete development tasks increase in rework and or higher numbers of defects .
temporal dispersion refers to the time zone differences among project members and its key impact on distributed work is quite distinct from spatial dispersion.
temporal dispersion reduces the possibilities of synchronous interaction which is a critical communicational attribute for r eal time problem solving and design activities .
managing the flow of information in asynchronous interactions can be quite complex.
for this reason temporal dispersion makes misunderstandings and errors significantly more likely to happen .
on the other hand temporal dispersion may allow distributed groups to accelerate the completion of development tasks using approaches such as follow the sun i.e.
hour round the clock development .
configurational dispersion refers to structural properties of the geographic dispersion of teams and projects and it can be disaggregated into three elements the number of sites involved in a project the evenness of distribution of project members across those sites and the work experience level variations of project members at each site.
increasing the number of sites in a project could increase the complexity of the coordination effort.
the coordination challenges could stem from more site spanning dependencies as well as other factors such as diverse national cultures regulatory boundaries and processes .
on the other hand if the development effort can be partitioned into autonomous units of work without any complex dependencies increasing the number of locations helps concurrent development and might not per se translate in to lower project performance.
the second aspect of configurational dispersion evenness of distribution of team members acr oss locations influences the dynamics of interaction and coordination among development locations.
for example an uneven team distribution could promote behaviors such as majority influence and conflict which are not conducive for good collaboration .
in an imbalanced configuration members of larger locations might disregard the input from members of smaller locations and attempt to impose majority decisions that are incons istent with the requirements of other locations negatively impacting project outcomes.
while such problems can be averted if project members are distributed evenly across different locations an even team distribution might not make a good business case especially in the presence of significant labor cost differences across the different locations.
finally the third aspect of configurational dispersion is experience dispersion which has not received much attention in the literature.
however anecdotal evidence from our field observations suggests that it is an important factor affecting performance.
experience dispersion refers to how individuals with particular skills or levels of e xperience are distributed within the various development locations of a project.
a concentrated presence of domain experts in a particular location could be beneficial to achieve good results as experienced engineers tend to produce better software faster .
on the other hand such a concentration of experts in one location could be associated with large numbers of less experienced individuals in other locations 262which might increase the likelihood of integration related problems and the resulting loss of productivity and quality.
the discussion of the different dimensions of distribution presented in the previous paragraphs highlights two important gaps in the literature.
first the impact of the different configurational dimensions of wo rk distribution might be varied depending on the unit of analysis.
the direction of a particular effect at the level of the development task can be different or nonexistent when considering the project as the unit of analysis.
second we still lack systematic empirical evidence to understand how the various configurational di mensions of distributed teams jointly impact project performance.
this leads to the two interrelated research questions examined in this paper rq1 how do the configurational dimensions of distribution impact the performance productivity quality and profits of globally distributed software projects?
rq2 what are the team configurations that firms can use to mitigate the ill effects of spatio temporal dispersion and overcome the challenges of distributed software development?
.
research methodology in order to answer the research questions described above we approached several firms that have adopted globally distributed software development models in their operations.
the data corresponding to projects tracked from start to finish from four firms were used in our study.
the data we collected were audited by the quality assurance and central process engineering groups of the firms and hence we can place high confidence in the reliability of the archival data.
we augmented the archival data from the projects with structured interviews and field observations of the processes followed at the firms.
similar to prior research we used a series of econometric models to examine the empirical relationship between the work dispersion measures and software project performance.
.
description of datasets we describe the projects and firms in the four data sets in the following sections.
.
.
dataset the first firm in our dataset is a development organization that specializes in custom software development.
it is privately held and headquartered in the usa with development teams located in europe and india.
the firm was certified for iso quality processes followed the rup development process model and had an established clientele in usa europe and japan.
we collected data on projects executed by the firm between january and december .
the projects involved developing payment and billing enterprise solutions for the telecommunications industry using the j2ee .net and php platforms.
all the projects were executed using fixed price contracts between the firm and its clients.
.
.
dataset the second company we collected data from produces businessto business solutions for electronic transactions.
we collected data from projects that were completed between and .
this company had development locations distributed across mexico ecuador brazil and argentina and utilized agile processes for its development.
all development sites followed a subset of agile processes with daily builds and periodic short status meetings among the members of the project.
all developers had access to the same version control system and a task tracking system.
the organization also used an internal instant messaging tool for communication between de velopers along with standard teleconferencing.
the projects were built using java based technologies java j2ee etc.
and fixed price contracts.
.
.
dataset our third data set is from a multi national company that produces complex embedded systems for the automotive industry.
the software organization used a product line approach for developing its solution offerings.
in such a setting a base version of all the architectural components of the software system is first developed and then integrated to form a platform on which specific solutions are further developed.
this company had development centers located in north america europe india and japan.
we collected data on projects that were completed between and .
these projects involved analyzing requirements of a particular customer determining if the platform needed to be modified and implementing those necessary changes in collaboration with the engineers that developed the platform.
while the india based development center of the firm was successfully assessed as operating at cmm level the projects spread across the different development centers followed a rup process model with extensive tailoring at the individual development centers.
this set of projects used time and material contracts and developed their solutions using a mix of c c and assembly languages.
.
.
dataset the fourth company we collected data from is a multi national firm specializing in custom software development with a large client base and development centers in australia western europe india and usa.
all the development centers of the firm were assessed at cmmi level .
we were able to collect data on projects completed by the firm during and .
the projects involved developing custom web enabled business software in j2ee and .net platforms for the financial services industry.
the projects were executed using fixed price contracts with clients with provisions fo r performance based adjustments.
.
description of measures we describe the key measures in our data set in this section.
.
.
dispersion measures as stated earlier we collected data on the spatial temporal and configurational characteristics of the work dispersion that occurred in the observed projects .
the data regarding development locations and number of developers per location was extracted from the project documentation modification requests reports and change logs process databases and human resource database at the firms.
for each pair of development locations we observed in our project we determined the distance between these two development sites using google maps and other map tools to calculate the spatial distribution measure.
we determined the difference in time zones between the development locations in order to calculate the temporal distribution measure.
the third dimension of distribution configurational dispersion which is a key focus of this study was assessed using three measures number of sites personnel imbalance and experience spread.
the descriptions formulas and examples of how we calculated the dispersion measures are shown in table .
263table .
dispersion measures .
.
project performance measures we utilized three project performance measures productivity quality and profits.
productivity we measured productivity using the following ratio of output and input parameters where code size is measured using kloc and function points and total project effort is measured using person hours quality we measured quality as the delivered code defect density as following where defects delivered were the number of defects reported by the client afte r the project had been delivered project profits we measured project profits using the following measure we intentionally used ratio measures for all the project performance measures listed above as this allows us to control for the project size scope and scale effects across our four companies the ratios normalize the code size costs and personnel effort across the different projects in our data set .
this allows us to then rigorously compare measures across the four companies with a high degree of confidence.
.
.
control measures other than the dispersion and project performance measures we also collected information on project team size and process models followed in the projects.
these control measures are needed to ensure proper statistical model specification and analysis as these measures are know n to have a significant effect on project performance from prior research but are not the main focus of our analysis.
team size and project processes are well established as having impact on project performance .
these additional variables along with the firm level dummy identification variables are used as control measures in our empirical models.
team size the total full time equivalent count of personnel involved in a project at all development locations is our team size variable.
process model through structured interviews with team leaders and team members and through our field observations of the projects we gathered information on the process models followed in the projects.
we encounter ed two development process approaches in the projects in our data sets projects that followed a highly plan based waterfall or v model approach for development and projects that followed an agile cyclical or spiral approach to development.
in our dataset there was a complete correlation between the waterfall development approach and the adoption of cmm process templates whereas the projects that followed a cyclical or spiral approach to development had hybrid process templates based on both agile rup and cmm.
to control for these differences in process approaches across the projects we created dummy categorical variables in our dataset structured waterfall or v model approach agile iterative dispersion measure description formula i j a location pair k no of location pairs n i team size at location i n j team size at location j n total team size in the project example of calculation team size distributed across locations location new york frankfurt bangalore with people located in new york in frankfurt and in bangalore.

264process approach and used these categorical variables in our statistical models.
firm level controls finally we clustered the projects according to their firm level characteristics such as the contract choice and the programming language used.
this allowed us to robustly compare results across projects with different firm level characteristics.
.
description of empirical models in order to examine the associations between the dispersion measures and project performance measures we developed and tested our empirical models.
the functional forms of the empirical models were derived from prior re search utilizing the economic production function view of software development i.e.
project performance outcomes expressed as a production function of personnel related pro cess related and project related input variables .
corresponding to the three performance outcome measures we studied the three equations that form our empirical models are shown in equations to .
it is important to note that our modeling approach analyzes the associations between the dispersion measures and performance outcomes by jointly accounting for the individual effects of various dimensions of dispersion and the performance measures are estimated simultaneously accounting for any potential interrelationships between them.
in our dataset the spatial separ ation dispersion and temporal time zone dispersion measures were highly correlated with each other pair wise correlation of .
with p value .
.
this indicates that our data involves east west geographical dispersion which correlates highly with the time zone classifications of the world rath er than north south geographical dispersion.
hence we used only the separation dispersion measures in our empirical models to jointly stand for spatiotemporal dispersion and omitted the time zone measure .

profit 0 1 ln development productivity 2 ln quality 3 number of sites 4 personnel imbalance 5 experience spread 6 ln team size 3 clustered by dataset ... eq.
the summary statistics of the variables in our equations are shown in table .
we log transformed two of the dependent variables development productivity and quality to ensure normality of the variable distributions.
we estimated equations to using seemingly unrelated regression method.
this approach accounts for the correlation of error terms in the equations i.e.
we assume that any external and firm level events such as technology boom and bust cycles ceo resignation etc.
would impact all the three performance outcomes simultaneously leading to a more accurate analysis.
we also clustered the projects as per the datasets to derive robust standard errors and corresponding p values.
since our models posit interrelationships between the performance outcomes there is a potential for the independent variables to be correlated with error terms of the regression models an issue known as the endogeneity problem.
the implication of such a problem is the potential for biased estimates resulting in inaccurate inference.
therefore we tested for presence of endogeneity using the durbin wu haussmann test and found no evidence of it.
we also conducted other regular regression diagnostics such as testing for outlier sensitivity using cook s distance multicollinearity effects using variance inflation factors and verified that our results are robust.

results project performance the results of our regression esti mation are presented in table .
our empirical models are statistically sound i.e.
they are statistically significant and they pass all endogeneity multicollinearity and other diagnostic tests and have good explanatory power to explain the associations between the dispersion measures and project performance outcomes chisquared values are highly significant and adjusted r squared values are similar or higher than typical values documented in prior research .
overall our results indicate that variations in the configurational characteristics of distributed team s lead to different performance outcomes.
for example from table we notice that an increase in the number of sites and in the imbalance in personnel configurations both boost productivity at the expense of quality the regression value for both these variables is positive .

on the other hand an increased spread in experience across the sites is associated with improved quality but decreased productivity.

table supports this result by showing that a balanced configuration that balances the tension between personnel imbalance and experience spread has the highest productivity.
further any imbalances should be towards the offshore orientation to minimize the productivity loss.
the results for quality show that the best quality is achieved when one measure either experience spread or personnel imbalance is balanced and the other is customer oriented.
this agrees and sheds more light onto our regression results which show opposite effects for the two measures.
finally table shows that the highest profits are achieved when both the personnel imbalance and experience spread measures are offshore oriented.
this agrees well with our regression results and our intuition as the offshore sites tend to have lower labor costs.

discussion .
choosing a dispers ion configuration our results indicate that choosing any specific configuration for a globally distributed software project induces fundamental tradeoffs between project produc tivity quality and profit.
fortunately there appear to be some prescriptions that can be applied for rationalizing the tradeoffs and optimizing performance outcomes which we discuss in this section.
.
.
impact of profit orientation our results show that by creating an imbalance of resources across the development centers e.g.
more headcount in cheaper locations firms are able to improve their profit margins despite taking a dent in delivered quality and the associated warranty and rework costs and or productivity see tables and table .
this is because there is a significant cost arbitrage in software development labor costs.
our results show that distributed team configurations that depict larger spatio temporal separation and personnel imbalances are going to be sustained simply because they are profitable to the firm.
hence an important next step for researchers is to identify mechanisms that can help software teams manage the quality and productivity tradeoffs at the team or project level when they use pr ofit oriented configurations.
.
.
managing tradeoffs given the inherent tradeoffs between productivity quality and profit it is important that tradeoff managing mechanisms are proposed that can help developers and or clients choose configurations that achieve preferred outcomes.
our work provides this in two different ways.
first the prescriptions emanating from our regression results in table and the rank ordering of configuratio n choices in tables to can be used to choose configurational choices that are optimized for specific performance outcomes.
second we observe that process choice can play an important role in determining performance outcomes.
for example teams that are originally configured to boost quality e.g.
lower spatio temporal disp ersion and personnel imbalances could adopt a shorter planning range and more frequent release cycles as compared to the traditional waterfall model in order to improve their productivity.
similarly teams that are originally configured for high productivity e.g.
larger spatio temporal dispersion and experience spreads across locations could boost quality and eventually profitability by incorporating structured processes and more disciplined planning.
thus we prescribe a dynamic and context sensitive software development process environment that helps teams to alleviate the tradeoffs induced by specific project team configurations.

limitations of the study our study has limitations worth highlighting.
our study only considered dependencies at the team level and not at the architectural or code level.
modular structures for instance tend 269to exhibit a number of benefits in terms of quality and productivity.
therefore an assessment of the technical coupling along with team level data could provide further insights.
second despite the large number of projects from multiple companies we were not able to examine the joint impact of spatial dispersion and temporal dispersion as these two measures were highly correlated in our dataset due to our predominantly east west site locations .
further research is required to examine the combined relative impact of both dimensions of distribution on development productivity and software quality.
finally we have not looked at the individual level leadership social and cultural factors that could possibly affect team dynamics and configurational choices that impact performance outcomes.
we defer this investigation to future work.
.
implications for future research our results suggest several areas for future investigation.
first it would be useful to understand the ro le that collaborative tools can play in reducing the tradeoffs in choosing configurational choices.
for example collaborative tools could facilitate easier coordination between locations thus improving performance outcomes.
we would also lik e to study the effect of complementary and conflicting process choices across multiple geographically distributed locations on various performance outcomes.
finally we have anecdotal evidence through our field observations and interviews that project teams often face a need to overcome the tradeoffs in performance outcomes by dynamically changing their team configurations at different phases in the project lifecycle.
we plan to investigate these issues in the future.
.
conclusion in this paper we have analyzed the performance outcomes of globally distributed projects from four different companies with respect to the configurational characteristics of those projects.
we showed that there is a fundament al tradeoff between productivity quality and profits at the project configurational level.
finally we provided actionable insights for development and client teams to choose configurations that help achieve preferred performance outcomes and mechanisms for shifting the observed tradeoffs.
