index t erms traceability requirements engineering study of human analysts information foraging.
i. i ntroduction following the life of a requirement and tracking the information in the requirements traceability matrix rtm arecrucial to many software engineering activities such as ver ification and validation risk assessment and regression testselection .
research has shown that information retrievaltechniques can be effectively applied to help recover thetraceability information in an automated fashion .in this way plausible links can be generated between softwareartifacts e.g.
between requirements and test cases.
one area that traceability is indispensable is the engineering of mission or safety critical software systems.
for example the u.s. federal aviation administration s software certifyingstandard specifies that at each development stage develop ers must be able to demonstrate traceability of designs againstrequirements .
under these circumstances a human analystmust vet e.g.
browse and validate the candidate rtm offeredby the tool .
v etting is thus a central activity in assisted requirements tracing in which a human analyst engages with an automated tracing tool to perform the assigned tracingtask .
studies of human behavior showed that in interacting with the tracing tool to prepare their finalrtm the analysts made both errors of omission threw outcorrect links and errors of commission added incorrect links .a thoroughly conducted experiment by dekhtyar et al.
tested vetting variables.
the results revealed that only the accuracy of the initial rtm and the analyst effort expendedin validating offered links had statistically significant effectson the final rtm while the other factors e.g.
tool used tracing experience effort on searching for omitted links etc.
did not make a difference .
a qualitative study by kong et al.
provided additional insights into analysts behavior.
for example all the analysts were observed to make multiplecorrect decisions in a row and such correct decision boutswere interleaved with streaks of incorrect decisions .
currently empirically observing analysts behavior is adopted as the main methodology for researching the humanfactors in assisted requirements tracing.
observational studiesare particularly valuable in answering what questions by uncovering behavioral patterns.
however little is known about why analysts behave in a certain way and how to improve the analysts tracing performance in a principled manner.
ad dressing these knowledge gaps is of vital importance because with a deeper theoretical understanding about the fundamentalmechanisms underlying the analysts behavior the empiricalobservations can be related more coherently and the keyfactors can be tested more completely.
in this work we explore the theoretical underpinning of analyst s requirements tracing behavior based on pirolli s information foraging theory .
the theory uses our animal ancestors built in food foraging mechanisms to understandhuman information seeking and gathering in the vastness of the web.
lawrance and colleagues have recentlypioneered the application of information foraging theory tothe debugging domain and presented encouraging results that matched the theory s predictions with the developers actualcode navigations.
building on their influential work we aimto investigate human analysts requirements tracing strategies in light of foraging theory s constructs and principles.
this paper reports an exploratory study that examines two of foraging theory s foundational models in the contextof tracing the diet model optimizes the decision related to what kinds of information to consume and what to ignore and the patch model determines the optimal time to spend in an information patch.
these optimality models allow us to define the behavioral problems that are posed by therequirements tracing environments and therefore allow us to978 c ieee icse san francisco ca usa accepted for publication by ieee.

determine how well an optimal forager analyst performs on those problems.
we then compare the behavior of real analysts with that of the optimal forager.
in particular the theory s predictions are confronted with the tracing behaviorof analysts who validated the links between requirementsand code of a software system in the healthcare domain.
thedepartures from optimality revealed by the comparison notonly offer concrete insights into the obstacles faced by thehuman analysts but also lead to principled ways to overcomethe obstacles.
the contributions of our work lie in the analysis of optimality within the shaping limits placed by the task andthe information environments.
our work advances the funda mental understanding about analysts information seeking inlight of the adaptiveness of human behavior.
this improvedunderstanding in turn enables principled ways to increasepractical support for software traceability.
in what follows we present background information on foraging theory andassisted requirements tracing in section ii.
we then detailour research methodology in section iii.
sections iv and vdescribe the empirical study s design and results respectively.the implications of our work are discussed in section vi andfinally section vii concludes the paper.
ii.
b ackground and rela ted work a. optimal f oraging theory animals adapt among other reasons to increase their rate of energy intake.
to do this they evolve different methods a wolfhunts for prey but a spider builds a web and allows the prey tocome to it.
optimal foraging theory is developed in biology for analyzing the adaptive value of food foraging strategies .optimality here refers to the strategy that maximizes the gainper unit cost.
central to optimal food foraging are the diet model and the patch model .
the diet model deals with the tradeoffs when a predator forages in an environment in which food is distributed ina patchy manner.
fig.
1a illustrates the patchy environmentby presenting a hypothetical bird foraging in berry clusters.the forager must expend some amount of between patch time t b arriving at a prey patch and twdenotes the within patch foraging time.
in fig.
1c g tw represents a deceleratingexpected net gain function.
the amount of energy gained per unit time of foraging is therefore r g tw tb tw .
following stephens and krebs we use g twto denote the patch s profitability and use tbto denote the patch s encounter rate.
the optimal diet selection follows the principle of lost opportunity .
intuitively the principle states that the prey patch is predicted to be ignored if its profitability is less thanthe expected rate of gain of continuing search for other prey patches.
formally as shown in fig.
1b let the patches beranked by profitability i gi twi such that 1 ... n. the optimal diet can be expanded by adding prey patches in order of decreasing profitability i.e.
from to n until the rate of gain for a diet of the top kprey patches is greater than thek 1st prey patch s profitability parenleftbigg r k summationtextk i 1 i gi summationtextk i 1 i twi parenrightbigg parenleftbigggk twk k parenrightbigg .
the left side of the inequality concerns the rate of gain obtained by the diet of the khighest profitability prey patches whereas the right side concerns the profitability of the k 1st prey patch.
in fig.
1b the optimal diet contains prey patch prey patch ... p r e y patch k and therefore prey patch k ... p r e y patch n are predicted to be ignored by the forager.
once a prey patch is selected to be part of the forager s diet the patch model deals with predictions of the amount of time to spend within the patch.
the basic idea is illustratedin fig.
1c.
as the forager gains energy the amount of fooddiminishes or depletes.
consequently there will be a pointat which the expected gains from foraging within the currentprey patch become less than the expected gains that could bemade by leaving for a new one.
fig.
1c shows that the rate maximizing time t occurs when the derivative of g tw is equal to the slope of the tangent line r .
in a nutshell the simple rule in optimal foraging theory is do not expend more energy finding the food than the foodprovides.
animals including humans have evolved somevery sophisticated and fascinating food seeking mechanisms.
optimal foraging theory has been proven to be productive and573resilient in addressing food searching behavior in the field and the lab whereby the adequacy of the tenets e.g.
the patchmodel and the diet model is tested to account for the evolutionof given structures or behavioral traits .
b. f oraging theory applied to web and code navigation humans seeking information adopt various strategies sometimes with striking parallels to those of animal foragers.the wolf prey strategy bears some resemblance to classicinformation retrieval and the spider web strategy is likeinformation filtering .
pirolli developed information foraging theory by laying out the basic analogies between food foraging and information seeking predator human in need ofinformation forages for prey the useful information alongpatches of resources and decides rationally on a diet whatinformation to consume and what to ignore .
by adopting theoptimality models and adding details where necessary pirolliraised foraging theory from the physical and biological levelsto the knowledge and rational levels.
the main application area of information foraging theory is the study of users information seeking on the web.
duringweb navigation users operate in two environments .
thetask environment embodies a goal problem or task that drives human behavior whereas the information environment structures users interactions with the content.
an optimal webuser s navigation is then calculated according to the notion ofinformation scent a subjective sense of value and cost of accessing an information source based on perceptual cues.
the wufis web user flow by information scent algorithm represents one of the most rational and effective computational models of information scent by considering both environmentsin its computation a spreading activation network that represents user s goal memory in the task environment and an inter word correlation representation used to approximate user s conception of word synonymy in the information environment.
computing the web user s information diet provides remarkable insights into issues like link selection anddecision to leave a webpage.
as a result information foragingtheory has become extremely useful as a practical tool forwebsite design and evaluation .
inspired by human s adaptive interaction with information on the web researchers began to apply foraging theory insoftware engineering.
ko et al.
were among the first to relate information foraging to developers seeking relevant code in software maintenance.
in recent years lawranceet al.
have made tremendous strides in understanding programmer navigation during debugging byviewing programmer as predator and bug fix as prey.
build ing on pirolli s work lawrance et al.
developed the pfis programmer flow by information scent model bycombining a spreading activation over the source code s topology analogous to links on webpages and a word similarity measure between the bug report and the sourcecode computed as vector space model s cosine similarityusing the tf idf weighting schema .
extending beyondpirolli s work lawrance et al.
presented the pfis2 modelwhich incorporated the incremental changes in programmers conception of the navigation goals during debugging.
more recent work focused on empirically assessing programmernavigation models predictive accuracy and optimally compos ing single factors e.g.
recency spatial proximity etc.
into afamily of pfis3 models.
in summary information foraging theory provides an evolutionary ecological approach to understanding human information seeking on the web.
applying the theory insoftware engineering has also been fruitful as the foraging theoretic approach provides a foundation for studying devel opers navigation around the code base .
building andexpanding upon lawrance and colleagues seminal work ondebugging we investigate an important butdifferent information intensive software engineering task assisted requirements tracing.
c. assisted requirements tracing when dealing with a software system s traceability information a requirements traceability matrix rtm establishes themapping between elements of one artifact e.g.
requirements level use cases and elements of the other artifact e.g.
implementation level classes .
any rtm that exists before thetracing process is complete is called a candidate rtm .
the final rtm is the one approved or certified by a human analyst .
because manually building the rtm can be tedious and error prone modern tools employ information retrieval ir methods for automated support .
these methodssearch for documents i.e.
candidate traceability links andretrieve those that are relevant to the query i.e.
element tobe traced .
extensive empirical studies have been conductedto evaluate the effectiveness of different ir based traceabilitylink recovery methods.
converging evidence indicates that all the exploited methods so far are equivalent in that they are able to capture almost the same traceability information .in most cases a recall of is achievable at precision levels of where recall is defined as the percentage of correct links that are retrievedand precision is defined as the percentage of retrieved links that are correct .
although ir based tools automate the rtm generation to a large extent in coping with mission or safety critical softwaresystems the human analyst must vet the candidate rtmproduced by the tool and add and remove links as necessaryto arrive at the final rtm .
it is important to emphasize that traceability is not an end in itself but a means towards some other end.
the analyst who vets the candidate rtm maybe involved in risk assessment criticality analysis regulatorycompliance or some other software engineering activities.
asa result the analyst can always override any tool s output and has the final say on whether or not the traceability is correct .
assisted requirements tracing thus refers to the process in which the human analyst becomes actively involved and makes574decisions concerning the automated tool s output.
the foundational work in this area was laid by hayes and dekhtyar where they elucidated the need to study human interaction reaction with the tracing tool s results.
since then a seriesof studies investigated analyst behavior and revealedthat human tended to degrade the accuracy of the rtmprovided by the tool.
among the important findings a rathersurprising one was that incorrect decisions were often madeif the analyst spent much time on the links .
in orderto understand the findings like this it was suggested that wemight need to experimentally study one variable at a time .eleven variables were then examined by dekhtyar et al.
.
the work represents one of the most significant empiricaldiscoveries to date.
in essence assisted requirements tracing is aimed at providing the best of both worlds allowing human and automatedtool to do what they do best .
while recent empiricalcontributions have enlightened the vital role of human factors we believe gaining a theoretical understanding can furtheradvance the field.
a foraging theoretic exploration can shedlight on the mechanisms underlying the human s adaptiveinteraction with the information presented in the tracing tool.
this is precisely the focus of our research.
iii.
r esearch methodology assisted requirements tracing shares many characteristics with1 ir based web search and navigation along the software entities.
as both are domains to which informationforaging theory applies cf.
section ii b we contend that theanalyst s seeking and gathering traceability information canbe mathematically modeled in light of the built in foragingmechanisms.
in this way the human analyst can be viewedas a predator in pursuit of prey the relevant traceabilityinformation.
the overall goal of our research is to explore the differences between the analyst s actual information foraging behavior and that defined by the optimality models.
our comparisonconcentrates on the information diet selection the diet model and the residence time within a selected information patch thepatch model .
before formulating specific research questionsin section iii b we detail how an optimal analyst s decisions are made based on the rational analysis of information foraging.
a. rational analysis anderson s rational analysis is built upon the principle ofoptimization under constraints .
the basic idea is that the constraints of the environment place important shaping limits on the optimization that is possible .
applied to debugging the principle implies that optimal programmers will make thebest possible navigational choices given the information theintegrated development environment ide like eclipse makesavailable to them at each moment .
similarly the humananalyst s optimal behavior in tracing must be rationalized by scrutinizing the information that the automated tool makesavailable at each moment.fig.
2a shows a screenshot of the automated requirements tracing tool used in our study.
we call the tool art assist to emphasize the integral yet supportive role it plays in assistedrequirements tracing in which the human analyst must beactively involved .
the foremost aim in developing art assist was to obtain functional adequacy of state of the art tracing tools.
to that end we surveyed the basic features ofretro adams and poirot and also reviewed our own experience from building the tracter tool .
asdifferent ir based traceability recovery methods show compa rable performance the back end of art assist adopts thevector space model with tf idf weighting .
the front end uses the ordered list to display the retrieved traceabilitylinks according to the similarity score computed by the ir al gorithm.
art assist ranks traceability links much like searchengines like google rank search results in response to a user squery.
to support the best practice of in place traceability which advocates tracing related artifacts being managed withintheir native environments each page of art assist presents10 retrieved links or more accurately the links snippets asif they reside in google s search result page srp .
several design decisions about art assist s information handling are worth discussing.
we restrict the discussionto the rtm between requirements level use cases andimplementation level classes as this is the granularity levelat which our empirical study is conducted.
what information is used for retrieval?
art assist extends our indexer to process both source code and use case descriptions.
three steps are carried out tokenizing filtering i.e.
removing stop words like the andint and stemming i.e.
reducing a word to its inflectional root patients patient .
the resulting indices which contain the artifacts partial and important information are then used for retrieval.
how much retrieved traceability information to keep?
a basic tenet of ir based methods is that the list of retrievedlinks contains a higher density of correct traceability linksin the upper part of the list and a much lower density ofsuch links in the bottom part of the list .
art assisttherefore presents the human analyst with of themost similar links a threshold used in prior work .
what information is included in the snippet?
the snippet design is informed by our recent study on topical locality where we found that class name along with header comments conveyed class body s topic.
in addition theclass path offers the file hierarchy information and canact as the url for the retrieved link.
thus art assistdisplays a line snippet in the srp the class name the class header trimmed in line and the class path.an innovative design in art assist is that a mouse hover over a link s snippet pops up the full class headercomments as shown in fig.
2a.
how to interact with the traceability information?

a shopping cart like area in art assist s upper rightcorner enables the explicit management of selected links.once a link is selected its snippet is yellow highlighted.
once the final rtm is approved the submit button shall be pressed.
understanding how art assist works is necessary for modeling the way the information environment structures anoptimal analyst s foraging.
due to the information needs of the human analyst navigation in art assist has two fundamentaldifferences from both navigation on the web and navigationin an ide such as eclipse.
first what counts as a hyperlink is well defined in a website and can be readily modeled bythe one click link built in eclipse .
in contrast onlya single hyperlink type is defined in art assist namely theclick that enables the viewing of the complete source code file.
second web and program navigations can be of great depthbecause many information items can be reached via clickablehyperlinks.
in contrast the depth of art assist navigationsis rather limited because the analyst is primarily interested in viewing and de selecting a traceability link.
such differences suggest that the hyperlink topology in a website or a modernide is much richer and denser than the one defined in art assist.
for this reason we apply foraging theory s optimalitymodels directly instead of adopting the spreading activationtechnique used in wufis and pfis .
we model each page retrieved by art assist as an information patch in which the prey might hide .
a patch then contains the srp and the enclosed information items traceability links that can be viewed and collected.
the key forinstantiating patch one of foraging theory s core constructs is to preserve the locality such that there are more transitions within a patch than between patches.
in web navigation for instance a website is treated as an information patchsince it is easier to navigate information within the samepatch website than to navigate information across patches websites .
to assess our patch selection fig.
2b uses a576problem behavior graph to visualize an analyst s interaction with art assist when tracing the use case shown in fig.
2a view physician satisfaction survey results .
a problembehavior graph which is the foundation for web behaviorgraph and code navigation graph is particularly goodat showing the structure of human s problem solving.
fig.
2b not only illustrates art assist navigation s limited depth but also supports patch selection s locality property.
amongthe total of sessions in our empirical study presentedlater the average ratio of within to between patch operations transitions is .
.
this ratio is comparable to the values foundin web navigation ratio .
and in code navigation ratio .
.
fig.
illustrates how to apply the principle of lost opportunity to determine an optimal forager s information diet.for each of the patches given in fig.
3a the informationgain g is defined by precision.
to characterize the withinpatch foraging time t w we leverage map mean average precision a metric widely accepted in the ir community.
map measures the quality across the recall levels .the formal definition of map can be found in the standardir reference and the traceability specific literature .intuitively the higher the map the closer the correct linksare to the top of the information patch and therefore the less within patch foraging time t w an optimal analyst would need.
thus we define an information patch s profitability as g t w precision map .
the optimal diet can then be selected according to the relationship specified in equation here the encounter rate of all patches is assumed to be a single unit i.e.
as art assist allows each patch to be accessed by a single click on the page number.
fig.
3b showshow the theoretical diet d th is iteratively expanded and optimized in order to counteract the lost opportunity .
to analyze the optimal residence time within a patch we apply charnov s theorem to examine how muchinformation value the forager acquires over time t g t n r t nt ts nr th.
in this equation nris the number of relevant information items the forager handles ntis the total number of information items encountered tsis the scanning time and this the handling time.
we instantiate the value of these parametersbased on analysts actual tracing sessions.
this allows fortheoretically determining the optimal within patch residencetime cf.
fig.
1c which we denote by t th.
b. research questions the research questions addressed in our work are the differences and discrepancies between d th optimal diet in theory and d ac analyst s actual information diet and those between t th optimal within patch residence time in theory and t ac analysts actual within patch residence time .

the answers to the research questions will enable not only a systematic assessment of the factors suggested byinformation foraging theory but also a coherent account for unifying the observations that would otherwise not be linkedin a meaningful way.
for example with the foraging theoreticfoundation we speculate that i the interleave of analyst s correct and incorrect decision streaks might be due tothe inclusion of both optimal and non optimal informationpatches in the actual diet and ii the incorrect decisions after a long foraging period might be attributed to the excessiveresidence time within a patch.

e mpirical study setup to answer the research questions we conducted an assisted requirements tracing experiment by using the itrust dataset itrust is a java applicationaimed at providing patients with a means to keep up withtheir medical records as well as to communicate with theirdoctors.
although originated as a course project itrust hasexhibited real world relevance and served as a traceability testbed for understanding the importance of security andprivacy requirements in the healthcare domain .
the itrust dataset has use cases ucs and java classes.
the requirements to source code traceability matrixis of size .
the answer set prepared by itrust s developers contains true links.
since we wanted to observe577table i requirements traces used in the experiment id our title true true links study itrust id links retrieved uc1 document office visit uc uc2 maintain a hospital listing uc uc3 maintain standards lists uc uc4 safe drug prescription uc uc5 view physician satisfaction survey results uc uc6 view patients uc analyst s navigation behavior only the ucs with more than true link defined in the answer set were considered.
weidentified such ucs among which were randomlyselected.
table i lists these requirements tracing tasks.
notethat art assist keeps of the most similar links in theretrieval results.
table i shows that in some cases not everytrue link is presented in art assist.
we recruited upper division students in computing science from mississippi state university including seniors and graduate students.
none of the participants knew itrust before the experiment but all of them reported being familiarwith the healthcare domain.
the participants had all learnedabout traceability and reported a median of .
years tracingexperience mainly done manually .
during the experiment each participant analyst worked alone in a lab and began by signing the consent form andby learning how to use the art assist tool.
the analyst was then given hard copies of the uc descriptions and was toldto use only art assist and not to use internet or any otherresources in the experiment.
we asked the analyst to trace all ucs and to carry out the tracing tasks in any orderthey would prefer.
a researcher was present to run the artassist tutorial to encourage the analyst to think aloud duringtracing and to conduct an informal exit interview to elicitthe analyst s feedback about their tracing experience.
eachexperiment session lasted approximately hour.
v. r esults and analysis art assist logs fine grained time stamped user interactions.
in order to extract the analyst s actual diet d ac from the logs we analyze the task environment by modeling theproblem space of tracing.
fig.
shows the state transitiondiagram that depicts the lifecycle of an information item namely a traceability link .
the analyst may view scan the item as it is presented in art assist s retrieval page patch and further pursue the prey link if she regards it asrelevant.
the analyst may refine an item s de selection forseveral times during which the item can be viewed optionally.upon analyst s approval the item becomes part of the finallysubmitted rtm.
modeling the task environment is critical to defining the variables of rational analysis cf.
section iii a especiallythose appeared in equation .
in our study t s scanning time denotes the view time for an item that is not selected.in another word t srefers to the time the leftmost self looped view transition in fig.

thus the time transitioned to and fromthe selected state in fig.
gives rise to t h the handling time.
based on this we define the analyst s actual diet to be theset of patches containing handled items i.e.
d ac patch p linkl psuch that the analyst handles las a relevant link at some point during tracing .
for the comparison of d ac with d th fig.
5a shows the average case in which the trace s information environmentshapes the optimal diet selection.

5b provides d th specific to each uc along with the total number of patches pages retrieved by art assist.
on average only .
ofthe available patches are included in d th.
in contrast d ac is much less selective as it is composed of an average of .
available patches.
for all tracing tasks d th is a proper subset of d ac which implies that the theory s predictions are highly accurate.
to evaluate the matching degree with d th we expand upon the work of lawrance et al.
and use the analysts consensus to further categorize the patches in d ac.
match refers to the overlap between d ac and d th.
we define the match is large if the patch appears in over half of the analysts actual diets i.e.
analysts diets in our study otherwise the match is slight .
departure refers to the difference of d ac and d th.
we say the departure is large if the patch is handled by over half of the analysts as they pursue relevant prey inthe patch otherwise the departure is slight .
table ii shows the structural and behavioral aspects of requirements analyst s information foraging.
descriptive statis tics are given in terms of mean standard deviation .
inferential statistics are performed via the mann whitney test a non parametric test which was also used by lawranceet al.
for assessing software developer s information foraging.
it is evident from table ii that the matched dietsare more profitable than the departed ones.
this should notbe surprising since the optimal diet d th is selected based on the descending order of profitability .
however the analysts did pursue in a greater number of low profitableprey patches than in theoretically high profitable ones mannwhitney u .
p .
.
on one hand this may account for the quality degradation on the rtm after human vettedthe retrieved links .
on the other hand this maysuggest that analysts needed to consume the bad in order torecognize the good .
in this sense the correct and incorrectdecisions were indeed interdependent.578gain .

profitability is computed based on the answer set that defines the true links for each requirement.
under non experimental settings where no answer set is available duanand cleland huang argued that internal metrics such ascoupling and cohesion could be used to assess the quality ofthe cluster patch.
we adapt this idea and compute the patch cohesion as the average pairwise tf idf differences of all the information items in a given patch.
table ii shows thatgreater consensus largely matched and largely departed wasachieved on more cohesive patches.
further comparison re veals that the cohesion of analysts handled patches i.e.
thosein d ac is significantly greater than that of the patches the analysts did not view as relevant mann whitney u .
p .
.
thus analysts seem to use cohesion to judge an information patch s relevance testing this hypothesis requiresfuture research.
as far as the navigation behavior is concerned the patches matched with d th were visited mostly once.
however the dth departed patches received a surprisingly high number of revisits.
this shows analysts struggles with deciding the relevance of certain prey patches.
even when relevance wasdetermined the struggles with d th departed patches continued as analysts expended more time handling the links th .
interestingly the scanning time ts stayed roughly the same across the d ac categories.
our final analysis is concerned with analysts within patch residence time t ac and how it differs from the optimal residence time t th .
as shown in table ii t ac exhibits considerable variation among d ac categories but in all the cases the actual residence time is greater than t th.
such deviations from optimality t were observed to be substantially greater in d th departed diets than in d thmatched ones mann whitney u .

d iscussion as our results indicate that discrepancies exist between human analyst s information seeking and the behavior determined via foraging theory s optimality models we suggestdesign guidelines for tools supporting analysts in performingrequirements tracing.
we then relate our work to other models and discuss the limitations of our study.
a. implications for tool support our objective of uncovering the gaps from optimality is to enable principled ways to reduce the gaps.
our study showsseveral important discrepancies that provide concrete insights into the behavioral traits of and the obstacles faced by humananalysts.
first although the low profitable non optimal patches i.e.
d th departed patches turned out to be indispensable for analysts information diets the analysts did struggle to determinethe relevance of those patches.
the primary reason based onour interviews was the lack of contextual information whenthe analysts navigated from one patch page to another.
infact the analysts often unintentionally returned to locations579that had already been visited.
most agreed that such revisits were wasted interactions since they had to repeat the relevancejudgments.
one way to alleviate the struggles is to introduceexplicit tagging or rejecting the patch as a whole as designedin the work of duan and cleland huang .
another supportis to leverage advanced information scent modeling tech niques such as exploiting analyst s navigation recency to generate reactive navigation recommendations.
second while the scanning time t s remained approximately constant the handling time th was longer for d thdeparted diets than for d th matched ones.
during tracing more than half of the analysts expressed uncertainty aboutwhether a link should be placed in the shopping cart forcheckout.
some suggested that the gathering of traceabilityinformation could be diversified.
for example a black listof irrelevant links and a working area for storing to be determined links could be added to the tracing tool.
third the analysts invariably overspent the within patch time t ac t th especially when foraging in d thdeparted patches.
enabling analysts to correctly reason aboutthe patch profitability can help them to shorten the timedifference t .
however it is not possible to expect the analysts to have the perfect knowledge about the informationenvironment.
our study implies that patch cohesion one ofthe internal quality indicators can be of much practical value.in this way cohesion acts as the perceived profitability and its improvement via clustering has already led toremarkable enhancements in tracing.
b. relationship to other models models of information seeking and gathering .k o et al.
suggested that software maintainers seeking relevant code follows an iterative search relate collect process.while in line with ko s model assisted requirements tracingis also related to web search e.g.
the initiation selection and collection stages described by hearst .
although it iswell known that web users view only the first few search resultpages e.g.
jansen et al.
reported that of the users viewed only the first pages our results show that humananalysts did go as far as the last page to collect the relevanttraceability information.
foraging theoretic approaches to code navigation .
table iii situates our study within the previous research investigating programmer navigation.
because tracing is anew domain for applying foraging theory our mapping of aninformation patch is different from the prior work.
the mostimportant difference in our opinion is the use of the dietmodel in our study to determine d th which represents a novel mechanism for assessing d ac.
studies of human factors in tracing .
our work complements the studies of analyst s tracing performance based onthe final rtm s quality e.g.
.
in our study both thertm decision and the rational decision making process are examined.
while our work demonstrates the value of optimalforaging models how to expand the analysis to account forthe predictable level of human fallibility and to balancetable iii comparing our work with other foraging theoretic models fundamentals of information foraging theory patches scent diet seminal work classes textual similarity dac textual similarity pfis classes program topology dac program topology pfis2 methods navigation recency dac single factors pfis3 methods optimal composites dac pages textual dac our work retrieved similarity dth the economics of maintaining and utilizing the requirements traces remains an open question.
c. study limitations the applicability of this study s results may be limited by art assist s design operationalization of analyst s actualdiet and participants unfamilarity with the subject system.
art assist provides basic features commonly found in irbased tracing tools.
the threshold filters out certain truelinks.
adjusting this value statically or dynamically may alter the analyst s information foraging behavior.
a similarlimitation applies to structuring links per page.
when defining d ac we adopted a behavioral viewpoint by focusing on how to operate a link cf.
fig.
rather than what links were approved in the end.
shifting d ac s definition to the final rtm s perspective would modify an importantassumption of the decision problem.
once assumptions likethis are updated they can feed back into the rational analysisof the information forager.
our work with student participants limits how the results could be generalized.
egyed et al.
note that in many industrial settings people have no intimate system knowledgeduring trace recovery.
there is also precedence in traceabilitywork prior studies have used students with low levels ofindustry experience to represent new people joining a com pany .
nevertheless it would be interesting tostudy how familiarity levels may alter the tracing behavior.

c onclusions the main contributions of this paper are the evolutionaryecological understanding of the fundamental mechanisms un derlying human analysts requirements tracing behaviors thetheoretical analysis of optimality within the shaping limits placed by tracing s task and information environments the empirical evaluation of the matches and mismatches betweentheory s predictions and analysts actual behaviors and theconcrete insights of the principled ways to increase practicalsupport for software traceability.
building on the extensive research on the ir based candidate link recovery methods the study of humananalysts represents a milestone in the traceability literature as we now have reached a general consensus regarding theequivalence of the underlying ir methods .
the success ofrequirements tracing as measured by the final rtm s quality 580therefore hinges largely on the analysts interactions with and decisions about the tool s output.
building on the growingbody of work on human factors it is hoped that ourwork contributes a step towards understanding the ecologicallyvalid ways to design a fast accurate and certifiable tracingprocess .
