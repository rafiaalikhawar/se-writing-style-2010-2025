controlled modeling environment using flexibly formatted spreadsheets hisashi miyashita cybernet systems ibm research tokyo japan himi meadowy.orghideki tai ibm research tokyo japan hidekit55 gmail.comshunichi amano ibm research tokyo japan e35063 jp.ibm.com abstract as modeling in software and system development becomes increasingly prevalent many engineers need to collaboratively develop models spanning many disciplines such as requirements management system design software etc.
however integrating modeling languages for various disciplines is challenging because uml and sysml are too complex for many engineers to understand.
therefore in complicated engineering processes engineers with different areas of expertise often find it difficult to access the same information in different domain specific modeling environments.
our approach to address this problem is to share and edit the models as task oriented spreadsheets using a unified model in uml or sysml and a unified user interface in the spreadsheet program .
the formats of the spreadsheets are optimized for various tasks while the target models remain in a unified modeling language.
since the transformation between the spreadsheets and the models is automated and transparent users do not have to be skilled with the modeling languages to edit the spreadsheets.
using our novel approach we were able to reduce the errors and time and also the difficulty for each task without providing specialized training for the engineers.
a preliminary user study showed that by applying the spreadsheet based approach we could reduce the number of errors with less time for typical systems engineering tasks.

introduction modeling in many areas such as software systems and enterprises is maturing because the higher levels of description during development are important to share information and collaborate among engineers.
for example systems engineering must integrate many disciplines when developing large systems and many engineers with different areas of expertise have to collaborate with each other .
typically this involves project management requirements management system design and domainspecific tasks such as mechanical software and e e electrical electronic engineering.
however integrating modeling languages for various disciplines is not easy.
although uml and sysml an extension of uml for systems engineering are regarded as the most promising languages to unify modeling information in a single format many studies have reported that the complexity of uml is a serious concern .
petre reported that the majority of the informants did not use uml partly due to the overhead of understanding the notation .
moody reported that the visual notations of uml have many problems such as symbol redundancies and excesses visual ineffectiveness and graphic complexity .
dobing et al.
concluded that uml is useful for clients and users to participate in the development and reviews of artifacts but many uml components especially class and activity diagrams are not well understood.
they also concluded that uml should not be limited to software professionals and a greater understanding of uml in building systems is needed throughout organizations .
although several existing studies addressed these problems by simplifying the uml metamodel altering the metamodel requires new modeling tools new formats for models and new model data transformations all of which are very high barriers to delivering the new metamodels to the users.
in our work we address this issue by introducing a simplified presentation to edit the models while the underlying metamodels are unchanged.
we propose a novel approach to share and edit models using spreadsheets our spreadsheet based modeling ssm .
it uses spreadsheets as simpler notations to create edit and browse the engineering information and the formats of the spreadsheets are optimized for various tasks and disciplines while the target models are kept in a high level uml or sysml representation.
since the transformations between the spreadsheets and the unified models are automated and transparent users do not have to take special care to conform to the modeling languages when editing the spreadsheets with our novel modeling tool the model spreadsheet platform msp .
although there are a number of existing case computer aided software engineering tools supporting import from or export to spreadsheets or editing model elements in tables or matrices suchpermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

as rational software architect reqpro doors and rhapsody to the best of our knowledge none of them support for interactively editing both model elements and their relationships in tables by using spreadsheets section .
since this feature is vital for ssm we illustrate it in figure with examples.
in the left panel we show a model and a metamodel of our model.caryyy andcarxxx are instances of car andbike ais an instance of bike .
in addition all of them are instances ofvehicle .john andalice are instances of the user metaclass.
since the user metaclass owns the vehicle metaclass the instances of user owns the instances of vehicle as shown in the diagram.
all of the existing software can support limited tables as shown in u b and c .
in these tables each instance has its own record row that shows the attributes of the instance.
we cannot specify the relationships among vehicles and users in these tables and we need distinct tables to show instances of each metaclass.
therefore developing models by using the existing software is not practical.
msp provides a more flexible spreadsheet format as shown in z by combining u b and c to provide a holistic view.
in this table we can choose the second column or the third forth and fifth columns to select bike orcar metaclasses.
if we change the name ofalice in row to alicia all thealice cells in lines and are also automatically updated to alicia in a just intime manner.
if we remove line the carxxx instance will be removed and then line will also be removed.
if we remove line the dependency of maintainedby fromcarxxx toalice will be removed.
manually maintaining such tables is too cumbersome for users.
therefore interactive editing with automatic updates is vital for modeling by spreadsheets.
even if we use flexible model transformations to import and export spreadsheets we need to manually maintain such consistencies in a table which is quite inefficient for practical modeling.

almost all of the project members both non technical people and engineers understand how to use spreadsheets.
this means we need less training for project members to use spreadsheets in comparison to specialized tools.
although quite a few modeling tools such as rational rhapsody and emf support tabular user interfaces the configurable formats of these tools are too limited and the user interfaces discourage many users.
for example we cannot cut and paste multiple cells in such tables even though such operations are standard in spreadsheets.flexible but controlled experience although uml provides various sorts of diagrams and a flexible extension mechanism to describe a vast range of concept for systems development learning all of the language is quite difficult.
some researchers proposed adopting a critical subset of uml which could reduce the learning costs.
this suggests that controlling the user experience while retaining flexibility is important for the practical use of uml.
ssm allows us to choose an optimized representation for each model by using tables matrices or charts which can be integrated into a single workbook to specify a wide range of systems development.
note that our basic approach is that the spreadsheet models coexist with the diagrams rather than replace them.
we can choose the best method that matches each task since msp provides real time synchronization between the spreadsheets and the models as addressed in sections .
and .
unified model editing unified models with various spreadsheet representations is vital to manage and reuse the engineering information.
msp allows spreadsheet users to edit models based on a mof meta object facility such as those supported by uml or sysml.
this tool allows designing various spreadsheet formats and the users can edit the models without deep knowledge of the modeling languages.
they only have to use the spreadsheet to edit and browse the model information.
in addition we can use other modeling tools that can access the unified models.
we applied our msp to the actual development of an automotive transmission system that used four different types of representations.
in section we describe the development method using ssm by showing the spreadsheet formats for the tasks.
in section we give details about how we handled some selected tasks with the tool chain using msp.
section evaluates ssm with an experiment by executing the tasks covered in section and discusses the advantages and the disadvantages of our new approach.
finally section provides our conclusions.
.
related work our work is built on top of various technologies in the area of model driven architecture mda in the sense that we use the unified modeling languages to describe engineering information and propose a novel modeling tool that automatically offers a userfriendly experience using spreadsheets with support for collaboration.
we classify these approaches based on three aspects existing case tools supporting spreadsheets automated modeling tools with adaptive or customized user interfaces and model transformations for mapping models to tables.
regarding as stated in section we found that many existing modeling tools including rhapsody have already introduced features to edit models in tables or matrices and to import and export spreadsheet files.
however to the best of our knowledge none of the existing tools supports direct editing capability via these spreadsheets.
while some tools such as siemens teamcenterr allow users to conveniently edit product information by automatically importing and exporting spreadsheets users need to carefully edit the spreadsheets to avoid inconsistencies because the tools do not synchronize with the data managed by the tools before importing the spreadsheets.
in addition no tools support the editing of model elements and their relationships in an integrated table.
msp is the first attempt to implement a spreadsheet user interface as part of a modeling environment and thus979we were able to design a flexible spreadsheet format for editing the models which is critical for the ssm approach.
in the area of spreadsheet user interfaces and modeling gencel classsheets and its successor mdsheet provide spreadsheet interfaces for uml models.
first these tools are different in scope from our work they offer frameworks for modeldriven software development for buisiness applications while our msp is intended for engineers who need to work with uml sysml models.
second while classsheets models can be transformed into uml models they do not support the editing of existing uml models though this is mentioned as future work in .
in contrast msp allows users to work with various types of models with a standard interface engineers can open edit and save model files through the spreadsheets with msp.
for aspect emf eclipse modeling framework and gmf graphical modeling framework from the eclipse project are well known frameworks to support various dsm domain specific modeling tools.
developers can design their own dsm with little effort by using them.
our msp also uses emf internally to manage the logical object model and to generally support dsms.
tiger transformation based generation of modeling environments and vmts visual modeling and transformation system addressed the needs for flexible presentation frameworks to support multiple views for modeling.
the work is related to ours in the sense that we want to provide an optimized interface for modeling.
however they do not support any spreadsheet interfaces.
for aspect msp is technically classified as automated mapping between models and spreadsheets.
for transparent editing msp also provides bidirectional transformations.
since model transformation is one of the core technologies in mda there have been many research projects in this area .
however there are no studies that share our goals other than mdsheet and the related tools.
although many tools such as the eclipse m2t project and rational publishing engine provide features to present models as tables by using templates they only support one way transformations and thus do not provide editing functions.
microsoft office excel injector provides a function to transform between excel files as xml documents and models by using atl they also lack editing functions.
.
examples of ssm in this section we show examples of the spreadsheets and explain how to edit the models via the spreadsheets.
figure shows the modeling process used in this example.
in each pentagonal symbol we show a name and a typical role for the task because we assume that various engineering roles are required for this process.
these tasks can be grouped into two phases.
the upper phase is responsible for managing requirements and the lower phase is for developing target systems satisfying the requirements.
since typically we need different types of people and information for these two phases communicating consistenly in uniform information presentations throughout the process is challenging.
first in section .
we show an overall view of the models of this example.
next in sections .
and .
we explain how we can effectively use the spreadsheets to describe the models and provide controlled and efficient user experiences for each role to process each task.
.
example models as mentioned in the introduction we manage all of the engineering information in sysml and each process accesses the unified repository to edit the information.
we use a standard sysml editor rational rhapsody and msp to compare the productivities of thetwo modeling approaches.
the target product was a transmission system for an automobile which involves multiple disciplines spanning software design mechanical engineering and control systems.
we assume many engineers in the various disciplines collaborate to perform these tasks.
more specifically the stakeholders are the sources of the requirements in requirements acquisition the system analysts are responsible for analyzing the requirements and deriving the functional requirements the software engineers are responsible for developing the software design of the system in design synthesis and the customization engineers are responsible for customizing the system by tuning the parameters in customization and all of the engineers need to ensure the traceability by managing the links among the artifacts during the various tasks.
note that this example does not include state machine diagrams sequence diagrams activity diagrams nor parametric diagrams but msp can also support such models.
since msp regards models as directed graphs and transforms such graphs into records by querying the model elements it covers any types of models as directed graphs which we will explain in section .
we had already applied these diagrams to msp and ssm mainly for supporting the design synthesis task where we need to design the dynamic behaviors and constraints of systems.

the parts denoted by ur fr and sa are sysml diagrams of the requirements and blocks.
the parts denoted by a c are spreadsheet representations.
notice that part x n of the diagrams corresponds to part x n of the spreadsheets where x is capitalized and x is lowercase.
for example part a corresponds to part a .
.
requirements modeling in the upper phase we manage all of the requirements that the target product must satisfy.
in the step of requirements acquisition we collect and list all of the original requirements coming from the stakeholders which we call the upper level requirements.
the input is typically in the form of documents from the stakeholders.
in the following step requirements analysis we identify all of the functions of the system by deriving the upper level requirements which we call the functional requirements.
this upper phase needs a comprehensive view of all of the requirements to browse and check them since any incorrect or missing requirements in this phase will lead to project failure .
for this purpose we need a flexible tool to analyze and edit many items with view related functions such as sort and filter to check the consistency and the coverage of the full set of requirements.
tabular formats satify these needs and are widely accepted for requirement analysis.
the sysml standard defines an exception for a tabular format to present the requirements in other ways than a diagram format and many requirements management tools such as rational doors also provide tabular formats to edit requirements.
in ssm we exploit spreadsheet functions to achieve these aims.

shows the corresponding requirements in the form of spreadsheets.
due to space limitations we intentionally removed some requirements from the diagrams.
in this example msp shows the upper level requirements horizontally a and the functional requirements vertically a and displays the derivedreq dependencies in the matrix a .
at the same time we can specify which attributes of each requirement should be displayed in the configuration of msp so we show ids names specifications and kinds and categories of the tag values of these requirements in this example.
in this spreadsheet we can insert or update new columns to create or update upper level requirements.
likewise we can insert or update new rows to create or update functional requirements by using standard spreadsheet operations.
by setting or clearing an x value for cells in the matrix we can create or delete derivedreq dependencies.
msp transparently handles almost all of the spreadsheet operations such as cut paste insert and delete and also provides an import function by inserting entries from external spreadsheets into the spreadsheet currently being edited which are then reflected into the model.
these functions are convenient to help input many entries into the models.
operations that improperly change the layouts of the spreadsheets will be blocked by msp with an error message.
for example moving the positions of tables or matrices or adding or removing certain rows in horizontal tables e.g.
table a or adding or removing certain columns in vertical tables e.g.
table a will be blocked.
this feature is important to guide users in correctly editing the models as spreadsheets since users would frequently break the layouts of the spreadsheets without such protection.
.
design modeling in the lower phase we complete the design of the target system that satisfies all of the requirements defined in the upper phase.
in the step of design synthesis by considering the functional requirements we create specifications for the component systems by deciding on their architectures and behaviors.
this process requires sophisticated engineering expertise for covering the functions provided by each component.
since these decisions typically have major impacts on the products of the systems engineering we need to carefully review and verify whether or not the results satisfy the requirements.
in contrast to the upper phase software engineers have to deal with relatively more complicated structures and behaviors of the target systems such as architectures activities and states.
however especially in complex system designs engineers often need to reuse existing assets and incrementally improve them.
in typical cases some templates should already be prepared and engineers will need to change the existing designs by following these templates.
therefore we need a tool that can control the user experiences both for flexible and formulaic editing to fit each situation.
in ssm we support flexible template design with the spreadsheets.
in figure panel sa defines the system architecture in the block definition diagram and panels b and c show the corresponding information in the spreadsheets.
panel b focuses on the hierarchy of the architecture and panel c focuses on the satisfy dependencies between the functional requirements and the architecture.
in panel b the first column b lists the top level block the gearshiftcontext in b the second column b lists the second level blocks in b and the third column b lists the third level blocks in b .
by using spreadsheet b the engineers can only create or delete blocks or change the names of blocks or change the hierarchy of blocks.
they cannot change anything else in this sheet such as editing the attributes or dependencies.
if some spreadsheet templates predefine top level components e.g.
gearshiftcontext engineers can extend them by defining a new component hierarchy.
unlike diagram editing in which users can change any model elements spreadsheet editing can effectively control the user s experience.
even if some diagram editing tools protect users from editing certain model elements they will not be able to quickly understand what operations are allowed based on how they appear in the diagrams.
in spreadsheet c part c lists the functional requirements corresponding to part fr part c lists the blocks corresponding to part sa and matrix c shows the satisfy dependencies corresponding to part c .
by using this spreadsheet the software engineers can check whether or not all of the requirements are satisfied by the design by using a spreadsheet filter function as explained in section .
.
for parameter tuning for customization the benefits of the controlled user experience are large.
since the customization engineers do not need to change any design artifacts other than the parameters the modeling tool insures that they focus only on editing the parameters.
in our example part d in the spreadsheet d simply lists the parameters to be edited that are associated with the attributes of the blocks of part sa .
part d shows the calculated values from the parameters in d by using spreadsheet equations.
part d shows a graph of the values in d .
the customization engineers can concentrate on the parameters and the expected results by working on this spreadsheet.
spreadsheet modeling is quite suitable to provide these focused user experiences.
there are limitations in spreadsheet editing since it does not present the shape of the structures of the model elements.
for example in figure the engineers can organize the software components which are shiftcontroller andclutchsignalgenerator and place them close together to imply that they should be grouped.
in contrast in the spreadsheets b and c such groupings are not visible.
in addition users can attach more shapes and figures to the diagrams to convey their intentions.
these features of the diagrams are beneficial for engineers to illustrate new concepts.
.
synchronization of models and spreadsheets since our approach is designed to support synergy between the diagrams and spreadsheets as mentioned in section msp can synchronize the changes between the spreadsheets and models.
when users change the models by using rhapsody they can get the feedback in the spreadsheets and vice versa.
therefore when a system analyst changes some functional requirements in sheet a in figure with msp the software engineers will receive the updates by using rhapsody allowing them to improve the design models to satisfy the updated requirements since many modeling tools support diagram updates which is called the populatediagram feature in rhapsody .
in a similar way when users update the models via the diagrams msp automatically updates the spreadsheets as specified by the configuration.
for example if the systems engineers change the satisfy dependencies between the requirements and the blocks in diagram fr the system analysts can see the updates in sheet c .
with this synchronization feature msp works well with the existing modeling environments such as rhapsody and this makes ssm applicable to the iterative processing between design synthesis and requirements analysis as shown in figure .
.
design and implementation in this section we describe the details of msp that allow us to implement the examples described in section .
in brief msp can be viewed as a modeling environment on top of a spreadsheet that maps between the data of other models and spreadsheets.
.
overview of msp figure shows the major components inputs and outputs of msp.
it uses a spreadsheet as a presentation component i.e.
msp updates cells in spreadsheets to display the model data and receives each user s input from the spreadsheets as change events.
in the current implementation of msp we used microsoft exceltm as the spreadsheet and thus users see just excel windows when editing models.
we call the spreadsheets controlled by msp model spreadsheets and they allow us to edit model objects through the spreadsheet ui user interface .
more specifically msp loads model objects from a rhapsody model file via the rhapsody api when a model spreadsheet is opened and presents the information on the spreadsheets.
msp updates the loaded model objects whenever the model spreadsheets are updated and msp saves the changed model objects in the target model file when the model spreadsheets are saved.
we are able to design the model spreadsheet by defining a configuration file in which we define the mappings between the logical tables and the model objects and also the layouts of the tables in the spreadsheet.
msp transforms the model objects into logical tables that are defined as collections of records and then presents these logical tables in one of three types of layouts a vertical table a horizontal table or a matrix.
msp uses the ranges of the spreadsheets feature to synchronize the data with the model by creating a range for each table and matrix to catch any changes of the range.
msp ignores any other changes not in these ranges and blocks any operations that try to move or delete these ranges.
msp automatically maintains the consistency of the spreadsheet data.
this is one of the major reasons why we need model spreadsheets for ssm as stated in section .
.
configurations of msp in msp a configuration file specifies how to organize the vertical and horizontal tables and matrices by flexibly querying the model objects.
the major feature for model spreadsheets is to update the spreadsheet information from the updates of the model objects without conflicts and vice versa.
in general msp regards the insertion and deletion of a record as the addition and deletion of a model element.
we will clarify this mechanism by using an example which corresponds to the example in figure .
we first show an example model in figure and an example configuration in figure .
in the following sections we elaborate the features of msp tree based model to table transformation model editing via tables and finally the formal syntax and semantics of the configuration.
figure arcthitecture overview of msp4.
.
trees to construct records of tables msp uses trees as intermediary data structures to transform model objects into records.
in figure we show an intermediary tree and the corresponding table defined in line in figure .
the lines starting from dim in figure are called dimensions by which we define the nodes of such trees called dnodes by associating them with the model elements specified in the path expressions.
line defines udim consisting of the user model elements in theownedelement1of the root the pkg package which are alice andjohn .
each dimension may have an arbitrary number of columns.
a dnode of dimension udim has auname column by extracting the value of the name attribute from the model element associated with the dnode.
as shown in the left panel of figure the two dnodes of dimension udim associated with alice and john under root were created because line specifies the main table starts from the udim dimension.
since line continues bdim cdim ddim the child dnode can be either bdim or cdim ddim which is called an alternative operation.
this means that if the path of bdim that is .
ownedelement matches bdim should be applied otherwise if the path of cdim that is.
ownedelement matches cdim should be applied and then ddim will be applied if it is possible.
therefore bdim is applied to the bike a model element and cdim is applied to the carxxx andcaryyy model elements.
since ddim is applied only to cdim the dnodes of dimensionddim associated with depx anddepy are the children of the dnodes of carxxx andcaryyy respectively.
next msp organizes a logical table by translating the path from the root to each dnode of the dimensions marked as rec which we callrec dimensions into a record as denoted by the dotted lines in figure .
we do not create distinct records for udim because it is not a rec dimension.
msp uses named perspective to construct a record as a tuple.
for example the first record in figure is constructed as uname alice regid carxxx at true which comes from the pairs of the name and the value of the columns.
the columns that do not have any values are called empty columns and are grayed out.
then msp lays out these logical tables as named tuples into horizontal as shown in a and c of figure and vertical tables in a b c and d and matrices in a and c .
to present the records in vertical or horizontal tables we specify the cell addresses associated with the column names of the record definition in an excel template.
for example when we specify the column names as uname bname regid at anddname in this order in the cell range of b3 f3 we obtain the vertical table z in figure .
likewise when we specify these names in the cell range ofb3 b7 we obtain a horizontal table by transposing the rows and columns of table z .
to show these tuples in a matrix we combine vertical and horizontal tables with matrix cells by specifying which fields in a record are shown in horizontal and vertical tables of the matrix and which field is shown in the matrix cells.
for example when we specify uname is presented in a vertical table bname andregid are shown in a horizontal table and at is shown in matrix cells we obtain the matrix shown in figure .
in this way by separating the logical table structures and layouts msp can flexibly map the model data into spreadsheets.
regarding the scalability of msp each of the created records corresponds to a dnode of rec dimensions.
therefore roughly speak1the uml specification defines ownedelement feature .
2all the key fields in the logical table must be specified in vertical and horizontal tables of the matrix to ensure more than one tuple is not assigned to one matrix cell.

dependson name figure a sample configuration ing the number of rows in the vertical tables is proportional to the number of dnodes of rec dimensions and the sizes of the matrices are proportional to the squares of these dnodes.
because modern spreadsheet programs can support more than one million rows we easily handled more than one hundred thousand model elements in msp.
although this is adequate for practical use msp should support a model database or repository for large scale model editing which is future work.
.
.
editing models via tables msp allows the users to edit the models via tables by translating a insertions b deletions and c updates of records into additions removals and updates of model elements respectively.
as shown in figure each dnode is associated with a model element.
we illustrate each of these three operations.
regarding a the insertion of a record msp first interprets it as the insertion of some dnode.
msp uses the key columns to identify which dnode is to be inserted.
in figure uname bname regid anddname are key columns and each dimension must have at least one key column to identify the dnode from the values of the columns.
by matching the key columns from the first dnode of the table we can identify a path through the dnodes from the root.
if the path fully matches an existing path msp reports an error to force the user to input the correct keys in the corresponding cells to avoid inserting a duplicate record in the table.
otherwise msp identifies a path through the dnodes to be added.
in figure we show an example of inserting records into the main table.

note that users need to input the key columns of one of the dimensions in the alternative operation to identify it in the insertion record.
thus in this case the bname should not be input even if it is a key column.
after that by inserting row i2 a new dnode of ddim will be created because carzzz matches the existing dnode.
msp allows adding only one dnode of the rec dimension in each record insertion because all of the dnodes of the rec dimensions must have a one to one mapping with records.
thus if we insert row i2 before inserting row i1 msp will report an error.
after identifying the dnodes to be added we need to translate them into the additions of the corresponding model elements.
for this purpose we deliberately designed the specification of a path expression to derive a model element satisfying a path expression see section .
.
for details .
for row i1 msp creates a car model element to satisfy the path expressions of the cdim and then sets the attributes of regid tocarzzz andattotrue based on the column definitions and the fields of the record.
finally msp adds this model element to the ownedelement of the model element associated with the parent dnode which is the john model element .
when inserting row i2 we need to add a model element corresponding to the dnode of the ddim .
in this case msp creates adependency model element in the ownedelement of carzzz .
independson we can only set relationships and cannot add any model elements.
therefore msp tries to set the dependson relationship by searching for a model element of the type ofuser that matches the value of name which isalice in this case.
if this fails then msp reports the error that it cannot find any reference targets.
regarding b the deletion of a record since each record has a corresponding dnode that has a corresponding model element msp simply removes the model element.
regarding c the update of a record in a similar way msp updates the corresponding model elements by considering the column definitions and the fields of the record.
as soon as the models are updated rhapsody checks the validity of the updates e.g.
equality and uniqueness of model element names and if any of them are now invalid msp reports an error.
if rhapsody accepts these changes then msp updates the tables to reflect the changes.
for this purpose msp uses the emf notification mechanism to receive the changes in the models.

.
syntax and semantics of configuration to define the syntax of the configuration of msp we assume countably infinite sets of the names of tables dimensions and columns ranging over x y and z respectively.
then the definitions984of table and dimension are then defined as t x table name y dimension name y t sequence t t alternative d rec ?
p c dimension c key ?
z p column where p is a path expression.
the bindings of table and dimension names are given by a single global set of definitions of the forms oftable x t anddim y d respectively.
for simplicity in this grammar we consider only the normal form of table definitions which is defined as table x x1j jxj table x1 y1 y k1 table xj yj y j kj to reduce the table definitions to the normal form we assume the sequence and alternative operators are associative and the sequence operators is distributive over the alternative operator i.e.
t1jt2 t3 t1 t3 j t2 t3 andt1 t2jt3 t1 t2 j t1 t3 .
then by considering yis atomic in the algebra we obtain the normal form by taking a sum of products .
for example line in figure can be reduced to table main x1 x2 table x1 udim bdim table x2 udim cdim ddim wherex1andx2are temporary table names.
before giving a formal definition of the path expression we need to give a definition of a model in msp as definition .a model is a tuple m w s n v e f n where wandsare sets of type names and labels nis the finite set of nodes of the model vis a set of values e n s n n s v is the edge set f2n!wis a function to map nodes into type names and n02nis a root node.
each named edge e2eassociates a node with a node or a value.
the path expression is designed based on a subset of the notation of xpath though we intentionally eliminated many complicated expressions that prevent editing models via tables.
the formal syntax of a path expression is defined as p root only pc otherwise pc .
current a child pc a child a s path element s path element with qualifier q q q sequence w type name s v equality expression the semantics of the path expression is given by the matching relation n x2p where ois a context node of the match.
this relation is read value or node xis matched by punder the current nodeo and the matching rules are defined as n02 root o o2 .
cur o 9n2p n s x 2e o x2p s child o n2p n q o n2p qualifier n q1 n qk n q1 qk seq w f n n w type n n s v 2e n s v eq where p means it adds to p only if p is not .
notice that we can derive model elements from path expressions.
for this purpose by not discriminating between type names and types we can define a function g2q!wto map qualifiers to a model element type as g q g q1 g q2 ifq q1 q2 q ifq2w otherwise where is the top type and it is eobject in emf.
as shown in equation we assume that we can obtain the intersection of types.
we also assume f 1exists which means we can instantiate a model element from a type name.
if either of these operations fails then msp reports the error that it failed to create a model element of that type.
then the derivation rules from a path expression to model elements can be given as !
fn0g inv root o .
!
fog inv cur o m2p o p s!
f m s f g inv child o m2p m q!e o p s !
f m s f g q g e inv child n q1!e1 n qk!ek n q1 qk!e1 ek inv seq n s v!
f n s v g inv eq with these rules starting from path expressions we can derive the nodes edges and values to be created in the model.
the semantics of a table definition can be given as model totree relations n t t where we assume the set of unranked and unordered trees tl over dnodes l defined as l f g d n r r where is a root node of a tree and each r z vis a pair of a column name and a value.
this relation is read the tree t is related to the table t under the dnode n. by using this relation we can derive the tree tfrom the model mand the table definition tbyn0 t t. in order to derive these relations we regard a table definition t as a set of trees i.e.t22tl which is defined as d dim y o l2dnode l t ft1 t kg o l t1 t k 2y t child d y p c c k l d n r r k o n2p8i2 f1 kgn ci ri o l2d dim 985c z p r z v o v2p o c r column o t2t1 o t2t1 t2 alt o t 2t1o t2t2 o t2t1 t2 alt where dim y is the dimension named y and node l isnfor l d n r r k .
then we derive a tree from a set of trees t by adding the root node which is defined as o t ft1 t kg o t t1 t k root .
ev aluation we conducted a preliminary study by comparing the productivities of the approaches of ssm and general purpose tool based modeling gpm .
our objectives in this study are to evaluate whether or not ssm allows a wider range of users to perform typical modeling tasks and what errors typical users made with ssm compared to those made with gpm to improve our approach and msp.
.
method we chose seven participants from various disciplines a systems engineer a control system engineer a database engineer an application software engineer an embedded software engineer a verification engineer and a project manager to cover a wide range of roles in practical engineering projects by following the research so that we would cover more roles rather than increase the number of participants .
three of the participants the systems engineer the application software engineer and the verification engineer had more than five years of experience in sysml modeling and the rest had less than three years of experience.
all of the participants were familiar with excel and rhapsody.
our research involved about two hours of work for each participant.
first we explained the diagrams and spreadsheets shown in figure and provided a short tutorial on editing models by using msp and rhapsody which typically took thirty minutes and then gave a task script for predefined tasks with msp.
after a fifteenminute break each participant performed the equivalent tasks with rhapsody.
this order was intentionally determined because we wanted to estimate the worst case performance of ssm by giving a handicap to gpm for the task learning effects.
finally we conducted an interview to get detailed feedback.
we designed these tasks by reducing typical tasks in automotive development to reflect practical usage since for such complex product development we need to make small changes to reduce the impacts of each change.
we used an automobile transmission sysml model consisting of about blocks and requirements and asked each participant to perform four tasks.
the first task was to create five requirements each of which consists of an id name specification kind and category.
the second task was to create six requirements by deriving from the five requirements created in the first task by using the derivedreq dependencies.
the third task was to edit seven sysml blocks by using compositions and then create seven satisfy dependencies for the predefined requirements.
the fourth task was to manage the traceability among the blocks and requirements by moving two dependencies and creating three new dependencies with the satisfy stereotype.
.
results and discussion figure shows the results of the experiments.
these results show that ssm is more efficient in both time and accuracy than gpm although the number of errors the participants made varied.
in our detailed analysis the error ratios of the numbers of errors are .
in ssm and .
in gpm.
by using the confidence intervals the number of errors in ssm is 3while that in gpm is .
regarding the working time the error ratios are .
in ssm and .
in gpm.
by using the confidence intervals the time in ssm is seconds while that in gpm is seconds.
our main interest in this study is to understand possible barriers for users to develop models in gpm and ssm.
figure shows the analysis of the errors in both approaches.
this indicates that the errors in ssm were only simple mistakes such as misspellings or incorrect names or incorrect relationships while the errors in gpm had a wider spectrum of errors presumably due to the complexity of sysml.
for example in gpm two users who had less experience in sysml modeling used derive instead of derivereqt .
the other three users missed the satisfy stereotype.
in uml sysml setting proper stereotypes seems to take a long time.
both the expert and novice users used reversed directions for dependencies which also seems to confuse many uml sysml users.
four users set incorrect requirement ids and put data in incorrect slots because checking for the proper data in many different slots in sysml requires careful attention.
figure analysis of the reasons for the errors.
the sizes of the charts are proportion to the numbers of errors in ssm and gpm approaches as shown in the left side of figure .
in contrast these results show that ssm is more efficient especially when the tasks can be clearly formulated.
the configurations of msp work as templates to guide users to edit the appropriate models.
for example since the dependencies between the upper level requirements and the functional requirements must be derivedreq this rule should be predefined in the configuration.
likewise we should prepare spreadsheets to encourage users to fill satisfy dependencies for all of the functional requirements.
as stated in section .
since we chose the typical and well formulated tasks that are executed by many engineers in actual automotive development they fit with the ssm approach.
this reflects our intention to apply modeling technologies to the area where many engineers in different disciplines work in established processes.
in the interviews with the participants we received three major suggestions for improvements with ssm i in ssm they were able to concentrate on editing the optimized spreadsheets while in gpm they had to also consider the design of the diagrams and the details of sysml to achieve the goals ii ssm provided the optimized spreadsheet formats to indicate the appropriate operations g1004 g1005 g1006 g1007 g1008 g1009 g1010 g1011 g100 g258 g400 g364 g3 g1005 g100 g258 g400 g364 g3 g1006 g100 g258 g400 g364 g3 g1007 g100 g258 g400 g364 g3 g1008 g100 g381 g410 g258 g367 g28 g396 g396 g381 g396 g400 g3 g94 g94 g68 g39 g87 g68 g1004 g1009 g1004 g1004 g1005 g1004 g1004 g1004 g1005 g1009 g1004 g1004 g1006 g1004 g1004 g1004 g1006 g1009 g1004 g1004 g100 g258 g400 g364 g3 g1005 g100 g258 g400 g364 g3 g1006 g100 g258 g400 g364 g3 g1007 g100 g258 g400 g364 g3 g1008 g100 g381 g410 g258 g367 g100 g349 g373 g286 g3 g894 g400 g286 g272 g856 g895 g94 g94 g68 g39 g87 g68figure the number of errors left and the required time right on average for each task and total.
the error bars show the standard errors.
while gpm could only provide some templates for the diagrams and these were not sufficient for the users to effectively understand the required operations and iii to work with the complicated links especially for the tasks involving design synthesis and traceability management the users needed too much time to find the appropriate arrows while in ssm they easily found these links by using the filters and sort functions.
these results and feedback implicated that the advantages of ssm came mainly from two factors a the views were optimized for each task and b the efficiency of the spreadsheet ui.
separating these two factors leads to further research topics in modeling environments since a means that we should compare ssm with task optimized user interfaces in the existing modeling tools and b means that we should invent a generic spreadsheet based modeling environment and then compare the productivity to the existing modeling tools.
although both of these areas have not yet been studied both approaches are suggestive to improve modeling tools.
we presume from our experiment that the errors shown in figure would be reduced by factor a because task specific views can reduce the complexity of uml sysml and the time for modeling is mainly reduced by factor b because spreadsheets and excel ui have been improved by many developers and are quite popular with many users compared to the existing modeling tools.
for example although rhapsody provides advanced find replace features to search for names tag values etc.
users need to carefully specify which model information should be in the scope.
in contrast since msp only shows model information in cells users can easily use the search and replace features of excel to edit models.
regarding the efficiency of verification both approaches have strengths and weaknesses.
with gpm we can check any kind of model element without any special configuration while msp requires some extended configuration data to handle some of the data as a spreadsheet.
this implies that if the model contains unexpected errors we cannot find some of these errors in ssm.
however in ssm it is less likely that such bad data will be input compared to gpm.
when checking for inconsistencies in the model information msp is better for browsing the large numbers of items.
as the users reported in iii since the presentations with a generalpurpose tool are less well organized they require more effort to check the consistency compared to msp.
with ssm we need a configuration file for each task to customize the formats of the spreadsheets while in gpm we need less work to prepare the templates of the diagrams.
thus the configuration costs for ssm are larger than for gpm.
however when we need to deploy selected methodologies for a large number of team members this overhead is less significant compared to the trainingoverhead in gpm.
we conclude that the ssm approach fits well with development based on more established technologies where all of the tasks and processes must be rigorously defined and thoroughly verified.
in contrast the gpm approach is suitable for research and experimental work where many tasks are not defined in advance and depend on the situation.
.
concluding remarks we proposed spreadsheet based flexible modeling for developing systems an application in which many experts in different disciplines have to collaborate with each other.
we applied this approach to the four main tasks of systems development requirements acquisition requirements analysis design synthesis and customization.
we were able to design an optimized user experience on top of spreadsheets that enhanced productivity compared to generic uml sysml modeling tools.
we did this by considering what information each user needs.
our approach reduced the time and the errors for the typical modeling tasks in systems development.
in our experiment our approach was faster and more accurate than using general purpose tools in addition we received feedback that they were able to perform the tasks with fewer errors.
we think this spreadsheet based modeling approach has great potential to improve productivity in modeling by integrating various technologies such as validation and verification v v and cloud based scalable collaboration.
regarding v v currently msp itself supports only key constraints and rhapsody checks the other constraints as discussed in section .
.
.
by integrating with a more general validation system such as emf validation we can specify a wider range of constraints for efficient model editing.
regarding cloud collaboration for large scale model development we are now continuing to work on incorporating oslc open services for lifecycle collaboration to support collaborative alm application lifecycle management and plm product lifecycle management to cover more processes beyond modeling throughout the development process.
