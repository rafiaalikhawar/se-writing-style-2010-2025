transformation for class immutability fredrik kjolstad danny dig gabriel acevedo marc snir university of illinois at urbana champaign kjolsta1 dig acevedo7 snir illinois.edu abstract it is common for object oriented programs to have both mutable and immutable classes.
immutable classes simplify programing because the programmer does not have to reason about side e ects.
sometimes programmers write immutable classes from scratch other times they transform mutable into immutable classes.
to transform a mutable class programmers must nd all methods that mutate its transitive state and all objects that can enter or escape the state of the class.
the analyses are non trivial and the rewriting is tedious.
fortunately this can be automated.
we present an algorithm and a tool immutator that enables the programmer to safely transform a mutable class into an immutable class.
two case studies and one controlled experiment show that immutator is useful.
it i reduces the burden of making classes immutable ii is fast enough to be used interactively and iii is much safer than manual transformations.

introduction an immutable object is one whose state can not be mutated after the object has been initialized and returned to a client.
by object state we mean the transitively reachable state.
that is the state of the object and all state reachable from that object by following
