evolution of a bluetooth test application product line a case study narayan ramasubbu rajesh krishna balan singapore management university stamford road singapore smu.edu.sg abstract in this paper we study the decision making process involved in the five year lifecycle of a bluetooth software product produced by a large m u l t i national test and measurement firm.
in this environment customer change requests either have to be added as a standard feature in the product or developed as a special customized version of the product.
we first discuss the influential factors such as evolving standards market share installed base and complexity which collectively determined h o w t h e f i r m responded to product change requests.
we then develop a predictive decision model to test the collective impact of these factors on d e t e r m i ning w h e t h e r t o s t a n d a r d i z e o r customize a customer s change request.
finally we develop and test a customization cost estimation model for use by software product teams w h i c h specifically accounts f o r f a c t o r s u n i q u e t o t h e customization stage of a product lifecycle.

introduction a packaged software product refers to a software application that is developed for mass distribution and not specifically designed to fulfill the unique n e e d s o f a n i n d i v i d u a l c u s t o m e r .
packaged software manifests itself in many domains including customer relationship management crm enterprise resource planning erp and supply chain management scm systems.
as such packaged software is a big business for example the worldwide market for packaged systems software products alone is estimated to be more than billion .
in addition to the stages of a typical software development l i f e c y c l e r e q u i r e m e n t s a n a l y s i s design build test maintain a packaged software product lifecycle includes the standardization a n d c u s t o m i z a t i o n p h a s es which have n o t yet drawn much attention from the software engineering research community.
customization refers to the process of modifying the generic product functionalities found in a packaged software application to fulfill the unique needs of a customer.
over time the packaged software product vendor might release these individual customer specific modifications to all its installed base by standardizing the feature in its future release.
when a customer raises a change request a packaged software product vendor thus has to decide whether to fulfill the customer request by offering a customized solution to the individual customer or to offer a standardized solution by releasing a new feature in a future v e r s i o n o f t h e product.
this standardization customization decision b e c o m e s significantly complex in the presence of heterogeneous customer needs compatibility constraints and evolving standards.
in this paper we analyze the standardization customization decisions made by a vendor over the lifecycle of its bluetooth test and measurement software product.
the l i f e c y c l e o f t h i s p r o d u c t was marked by several uncertainties including the rapidly evolving bluetooth standards specifications and a diverse customer base.
thus it provides a rich empirical context to understand the factors that influence the standardization customization decisions of a vendor.
further by analyzing how the firm responded to change requests from customers in the face of evolving standard specifications we are able to draw lessons a n d recommendations for both product management and managing complexity in software product development.
the three main contributions of this paper are .
we present a d e t a i l e d s t u d y s h o w i n g h o w a t e c h n o l o g y company organized its processes to deal with constantly changing specifications o r i g i n a t i n g f r o m s t a n d a r d s e v o l u t i o n and diverse customer requirements.
.
we develop and test a predictive decision model accounting for the factors that influence the standardization customization decision of a software product vendor and thus advance a step towards a generalizable theory of software product line evolution.
.
we develop and test a customization cost estimation model that fairly accurately predicts the customization costs of packaged software product contributing to the advancement of our understanding of the economic aspects of modeling variability in product line evolution.

measuretronics invests about a third of its revenues in research and development across five businesses oscilloscopes logic analyzers video test products telecommunications equipment and optical sensor products .
the firm has about c u s t o m e r s i n v a r i o u s industries including electronic standards compliance testers semiconductor chip manufacturers c o m m u n i c a t i o n e q u i p m e n t manufacturers and telecommunication application developers.
the product we study in this research was developed by measuretronics and is called the bluetooth protocol analyzer .
bluetooth is a short range wireless communication standard that allows connectivity between electronic equipment .
t h e bluetooth protocol analyzer is a test and measurement equipment used during the production of bluetooth consumer products.
typical customers of the bluetooth protocol analyzer are not consumer end users b u t t h e f i r m s p r o d u c i n g b l u e t o o t h enabled consumer goods.
firms producing bluetooth devices need to test the interoperability of their devices with other bluetooth devices that may be used in the consumer s personal area network.
this test procedure involves analyzing the radio frequencies transmitted and received between the networked devices.
the bluetooth protocol analyzer facilitates this procedure by intercepting the traffic between bluetooth devices and enables detailed engineering and statistical analysis of the intercepted communication data.
the bluetooth protocol analyzer product consists of a hardware component and a software component.
the hardware component comprises of an air sniffing probe to intercept wireless communication traffic between bluetooth devices a cable sniffing interface to intercept wired communication traffic and serial and parallel data port interfaces for connecting to a personal computer.
the software component involves a firmware operating system that is stored in the memory of the hardware component a n d a packaged software product that needs to be installed on a client personal computer.
the physical hardware and the firmware together intercept and capture data from traffic between two bluetooth devices.
this data is passed to the client software package for further analysis.
the software package is used to define specifications represent results in a graphical manner and prepare testing reports.
the development of this product was started in and continued until when the product was eventually shelved by measuretronics.
it should be noted that the bluetooth protocol specification was constantly changing during this time period.
for example the bluetooth special interest group sig was only formed in .

product development process the base product development process followed at measuretronics involved three major steps.
the first step involved collection and consolidation of customer requirements.
the firm uses an online system called customer support network t o l o g a l l c u s t o m e r requests and feedback.
when a customer enters the details of a request in the system a unique ticket number is created.
these feature request tickets are consolidated on a weekly basis.
the second step in the product development process involves a thorough analysis of the feature request tickets.
this involves removing duplicate tickets grouping tickets from different customers that have similar content and validating the content of each customer ticket.
if the requested feature is already present in any of the released versions a response is sent to the customer and the feature request ticket is closed.
in the last step the product management team works in tandem with the development team to a analyze the technical feasibility of the change request b check if the requested feature is shipped by a competitor and c generate an appropriate customer survey for the requested feature.
t h e c u s t o m e r s u r v e y i s d e s i g n e d t o o b t a i n installed base feedback on the proposed feature and is emailed to the existing customers of the product.
customers are asked to give feedback on whether they find the proposed feature or change useful.
to discourage casual feedback or non response customers are also informed of the impact of the proposed change in terms of code modifications and future service pack installations.
after consolidation of installed base opinion a final decision is made on the fulfillment of the request.

data collection as a first step we established the research protocols for the study which i n c l u d e d d e t a i l s o n p a r t i c i p a n t s e l e c t i o n r o l e s a n d responsibilities among participants interview structure archival data collection rules structuring learning opportunities and implementing recommendations.
we adopted a participatory action research methodology.
participatory action research enables researchers to co investigate or involve the communities whose practices they study in their research activities.
these activities include data collection record keeping model building solutions development and implementation.
this research methodology allows researchers to obtain a deep understanding of the problem context with a view to make improvements in the practices even when they do not a priori have well defined solutions or theories.
we formed a three member c o r e t e a m c o n s i s t i n g o f o n e o f t h e authors and one manager each from the program management and engineering division of our research site.
the program manager was the senior most personnel involved in the development of the bluetooth protocol analyzer product and had a global view of product development process.
the engineering manager worked independent of the program manager i.e.
did not have direct reporting responsibility and had in depth knowledge about the technicalities of the product.
the core team was responsible for the overall conduct of this study and recruited additional participants at different stages of the study.
learning opportunities were structured using a three phase c y c l e c o n s i s t i n g o f d i a g n o s e take action evaluate stages.
during the course of the study the core team conducted ten structured interview sessions with project leaders engineers and product managers of the bluetooth protocol analyzer team.
t h e first four of our interviews happened during the active product release cycles one each from .
the rest of the interviews were conducted after the active product lifecycle years the most recent one in december .
our archival data collection process was spread throughout the product release years until early this year.
we recorded all the interviews and the archival data was organized using a version control system to help us not lose track of the activities spreading multiple years.
one of reasons for the long delay between end of the product lifecycle and this case study reporting process is the mandatory requirement of a five year g a p a s p e r t h e f i r m s non disclosure a g r e e m e n t s i g n e d with us.
further the firm was recently acquired by another multi national company leading to new regulations and clearance procedures.
because we facilitated good record keeping and were able t o p u l l up objective data from the process database at any time we are confident that the long gap in the reporting process does not threaten the reliability and validity of our research data.
moreover the core research team including the participants from the firm did not change throughout this project w h i c h f u r t h e r facilitated good organizational memory for this study.
each structured interview session with the project managers and software developers lasted about an hour.
before each interview session the core research team organized the questions and collected all relevant archival data related to the discussion.
each of our archival data analysis and interview sessions h a d a diagnose phase and a evaluate phase.
the diagnose phase of the sessions were structured to understand the specific practices of the product t e a m d u r i n g t h e p r i o r r e l e a s e c y c l es and discuss the experiences of the team.
in the evaluate phase participants had to correlate their experiences with the archival data of the process database and reflect on the matches a n d d e v i a t i o n s .
t h e d a t a collected through these sessions along with the archival process database at the firm form the basis for this case study analysis.
thus our collected data spans the entire life cycle of the bluetooth analyzer product and includes the following in depth records of the functional features and specification changes of the bluetooth protocol analyzer.
these were obtained from the company s product database.
in depth process records detailing the product development processes and choices made.
these were obtained from the company s process databases and the structured interviews.
interviews with product managers program developers customers and bluetooth domain experts to provide more qualitative insights on our data points.
t h e s e i n t e r v i e w s a l s o helped us validate the quality of the process data collected.
on an average the bluetooth product line team at measuretronics had a full time equivalent head count of p e r s o n n e l developers usability engineer project managers program manager and product marketing manager .
the core product team worked with other divisions of the firm including the program management office and marketing department and occasionally borrowed more resources from other divisions.
there were customer generated product requests made during the product s lifecycle.
with the assistance of the product management team at our r e s e a r c h s i t e w e f i l t e r e d o u t d u p l i c a t e requests and ended up with unique customer requests.
we then analyzed the processing history of these requests and categorized them in to two divisions customer requests that were decided to be standardized into the next product release a n d customer requests that were processed as c u s t o m i z a t i o n p r o j e c t s t h r o u g h contractual relationships with individual customers.
there were instances where the firm decided to process customer requests as standardized product features i n f u t u r e r e l e a s e s a n d customer requests that were handled as customization projects.
we then collected cost and development personnel related data from the customization projects.
the product and program management departments could not furnish data for of these projects.
so our final data set includes data on standardization customization decisions during t h e p r o d u c t l i f e c y c l e and customization projects executed by the firm.
our final data collection step was the analysis of the software code to collect data on complexity a n d i n d i v i d u a l p r o g r a m r e l a t e d metrics.
an exhaustive analysis was made for different versions of the source code.
the metrics we collected were verified individually by two domain experts at our research site.
whenever there was a mismatch the source code was pulled again from the repository and checked for inconsistencies.
later t h e s e collected metrics were authenticated using an independent object oriented metrics collection tool.
any mismatch that arose from the authentication was checked by a technical expert at our research site and rectified.
.
factors influencing software standardization customization in this section we discuss the influential factors affecting the standardization customization decisions at measuretronics.
we identified these factors by analyzing our case data a n d b y interviewing product management and engineering teams about their decision making process when presented with i n d i v i d u a l customer requests.
.
.
evolving standards being a test and measurement company measuretronics had to develop its test application even when the bluetooth standard specifications were not well established and accepted.
under this uncertainty measuretronics product management was constantly facing customers who requested features that violated bluetooth standards existing at that time.
releasing features which violated bluetooth standards would jeopardize measuretronics o f f i c i a l position in the bluetooth standards making process.
at the same time some of the feature requests came from business units of influential multinational customers who were loyal to measuretronics for multiple years.
finally t h e r e w e r e o t h e r competitors in the market who boldly offered features that violated the bluetooth standards of the time and marketed those violations as positive features .
hence it was difficult for the measuretronics product management team to enforce a uniform policy on features that violated bluetooth standards.
in the absence of a uniform standards violation policy the engineering team started playing an important role along with the product management team in deciding the fate of feature requests.
this created additional coordination overheads in the product decision making process.
figure .
effect of standards the error bars indicate standard deviations.
person days are calculated for a team of developers.
person days no standard viola1on with standard viola1on average wai1ng time average development time figure shows that the customer requests that a s k e d f o r f e a t u r e s violating the existing bluetooth standards usually took significantly longer to be fulfilled.
we also observed that the heuristics employed by the product management and engineering teams for determining the features that violated standards depended on several other factors including competition compatibility the nature of change involved and complexity considerations.
we discuss these factors subsequently and model their collective impact on the standardization customization decision in section .
.
.
competition our analysis of how measuretronics reacted to competition shows interesting patterns as shown in figure .
the no competition bars describe features for which measuretronics had no competition while the with competition bars describe features for which there was viable competition.
first we notice that more than half of the features in measuretronics s product had no viable competition.
it is interesting to note that although the average wait time for a customer request to be implemented was about the same with or without competition the development time for product features that had competition was significantly lower as compared to the development times of features that were unique to measuretronics.
this indicates that the measuretronics product teams were particularly sensitive to competitive pressures and wanted to stay ahead in the market by uniquely positioning the product.
we also note that the firm kept its standard violations to a minimum in the presence of competition again to uniquely position the product as being better standards compliant than its competitors.
figure .
effect of competition note y axis units vary and are stated below each pair .
.
compatibility for every customer request that is received measuretronics also assessed whether the proposed feature would cause incompatibility with previous releases of the product i.e.
violate backward compatibility.
we noticed that in the initial stages of the product evolution measuretronics was more diligent in providing backward compatibility.
features that violated backward compatibility were more often stripped in the standard version a n d w e r e p r o v i d e d through a custom release for specific customers.
however as the market share of measuretronics s product increased rapidly several features with s e v e r e b a c k w a r d c o m p a t i b i l i t y problems were standardized across the board for all customers.
for example we noticed a i n c r e a s e i n b a c k w a r d i n c o m p a t i b l e f e a t u r e s i n t h e fifth release of the product as compared to the previous four releases.
while part of the reason for increase in violations of backward compatibility could be b e c a u s e o f t h e w a y b l u e t o o t h standards evolved it also appears that measuretronics used its dominant market share position t o s t a n d a r d i z e i n c o m p a t i b l e features in a general release.
.
.
nature of change the increased participation of engineering teams in product management decisions at measuretronics as noted before in section .
added an interesting dynamic to the analysis of customer feature requests.
along with the marketing and profitability considerations the engineering nature of potential product changes also became a central focus.
our observation of the product release strategy meetings revealed that the measuretronics teams carefully classified the effect of a customer requested feature on a release in to four categories of changes incremental changes modularity changes c h a n g e s which affected significant portions of self contained modules of the product architectural changes c h a n g e s which s i g n i f i c a n t l y affected the fundamental software architecture of the product and radical changes c h a n g e s which s i g n i f i c a n t l y d i s r u p t e d t h e entire product ecosystem including the software hardware and development platforms.
to see if this engineering consideration of changes had any impact on fulfillment o f c u s t o m e r r e q u e s t e d f e a t u r e s w e a n a l y z e d t h e customer waiting times and feature development times f o r e a c h category of changes.
the pattern of waiting and development times across the four different categories of changes is shown in figure .
we notice that measuretronics gave priority attention to c h a n g e s that affected modularity and architectural changes lowest development time bars e v e n l o w e r t h a n i n c r e m e n t a l c h a n g e s indicating that there was an active effort to maintain the structural complexity of the system.
figure .
nature of change .
.
complexity in our interviews with the measuretronics teams complexity was repeatedly mentioned as one reason why certain customer requests went unfulfilled even when the marketing reasons for f u l f i l l i n g those requests were compelling.
also we noticed that a simple complexity based heuristic was used by the measuretronics engineering teams to decide on fulfilling customer requests.
customer requests that were functionally complex i .
e .
t h o s e demanding complex algorithms and data structures tended t o b e satisfied through customization.
on the other hand customer feature requests that involved high levels of structural complexity features introduced count of standard viola1ons avg.
wai1ng time person days avg.
development time person days no compe11on with compe11on incremental change modularity change architectural change radical change person days wai1ng time development time i.e.
those involving complex cross modular interfaces tended to be fulfilled through standardized general releases.
the application of this simple complexity based heuristic to decide the standardization customization strategy seems to stem from measuretronics s quality management considerations.
managers rationalized that fixing errors arising from higher levels of functional complexity often required close relationship with customers to understand their full implementation set up the networked devices and the related software applications .
hence product managers preferred custom solutions for customer requests that involved high levels o f f u n c t i o n a l c o m p l e x i t y .
on the other hand measuretronics engineering team had better internal capabilities to understand the overall structure of their product than any one single customer.
hence when a customer feature demanded structural alterations standardizing structural changes was seen as more appropriate than a customized solution.
.
standardization customization decision model our interaction with the measuretronics managers helped us discover the key factors that influenced their decisions.
while we discussed these individual factors in the previous section a standardization customization decision is however b a s e d o n t h e collective influence of all these factors i n c l u d i n g t h e c o m p l e x interactions between t h e s e v a r i a b l e s. in this section we present how we built and tested a standardization customization decision model that takes in to account the collective influence of the factors discovered through our managerial interviews.
developing and testing such an empirical decision model based on our case study is a significant step towards a generalizable theory of the software product line evolution.
our empirical model of the standardization customization decision complements other specification based process centric and architecture centric approaches prevalent in the software product line evolution research .
our approach specifically highlights t h e c o l l e c t i v e a n d i n t e r a c t i v e effects of both software complexity and economic or market related factors on product line evolution.
figure shows a pictorial representation of our standardization customization decision model w i t h t h e s t a n d a r d i z a t i o n customization decision on the right hand side a n d t h e v a r i a b l e s representing our major hypotheses on the left hand side.
we also introduce three control variables in our model size of the change request customer influence and the product version.
we explain each of these in the following sub sections.
.
.
output variable standardized or customized solution.
this output variable captures the standardization customization decision that measuretronics has to make on a customer s request.
this is essentially a binary choice to process the customer s request as a standard product feature in a future release coded as or as a separate customization project coded as .
.
.
input variables installed base impact.
whenever a change request is processed by measuretronics a survey is sent out to all customers to check if the requested change will be of any use to them.
this variable gives the of installed base customers who indicated that the proposed change would b e o f u s e t o t h e m. if the proposed change is implemented i n a f u t u r e r e l e a s e customers will h a v e t o i n s t a l l a patch even if they don t intend to use the new feature.
hence customers do not have any incentive to blindly accept any changes proposed by measuretronics.
this variable ranges from .
standards constraint.
upon the receipt of a customer request measuretronics v e r i f i e s w h e t h e r t h e r e q uest violates the standard bluetooth protocol standard a t t h e t i m e w h e n t h e r e q u e s t w a s logged.
we employed an indicator variable coded as if the customer request violates the current bluetooth protocol otherwise.
compatibility constraint.
for every customer request that is received measuretronics also assesses whether the proposed feature will cause incompatibility with previous releases of the product i.e.
violate backward compatibility.
we created an indicator variable coded as if the proposed c h a n g e r e q u e s t w i l l cause incompatibility with previous public releases otherwise.
market share.
this variable captures the market share in of measuretronics in the bluetooth test product segment at the time when a customer request was logged.
we o b t a i n e d t h i s v a r i a b l e from the product management division of measuretronics.
this variable ranges from to .
.
.
control variables change size nature of change.
we coded the nature of change based on our description in section .
.
we measure the extent of the change needed to fulfill a customer s request using the number of function points that are required to be developed or modified in order to implement the change request.
in our data set we encountered situations where the function point data for a change request was zero.
this is because some of the change requests only involved changing configuration settings and no addition or deletion of actual software code.
customer influence.
a customer raising a change request with measuretronics is required to indicate the importance of the request.
this variable is coded on a likert scale ranging from to and measures the perceived importance of the requested feature for a customer s business.
the values of the scale were as following figure .
standardization customization decision model installed base impact compatibility constraint standards constraint market share standardized or customized solution?
control variables nature of change change size customer influence product version the change is preferred by the customer but is not essential for day to day productive operations of the customer.
the customer does not intend to be a test partner for implementing the change the change is preferred by the customer but is not essential for day to day productive operations of the customer.
the customer agrees to be a test partner for implementing the change the change is needed for the day to day operations of the customer.
the customer is willing to accept roundabout or alternate ways of implementing the feature and does not intend to be a pilot and test partner for the change.
the customer cannot allocate resources to simulate a production environment the change is needed for the day to day operations of the customer.
the customer is not willing to accept roundabout or alternate ways of implementing the feature but can wait until the feature is released in f u t u r e v e r s i o n s .
t h e c u s t o m e r i s willing to simulate a test production environment the feature requested is essential and time critical.
the customer is willing to allocate resources for piloting.
the customer might stop using the vendor s product if the feature is not made available.
product version.
there were different versions of the packaged software product line.
hence this variable ranges from to .
.
.
interaction effects our standardization customization decision model also hypothesizes two interaction effects involving the market share of the product at the time when a customer request is logged.
we expect that the market share of the product influenced t h e w a y measuretronics made s t a n d a r d i z a t i o n customization decisions especially when faced with decisions that involve violating compatibility with prior versions or any industry recommended bluetooth standards.
.
validating the standardization customization decision model in this section we statistically test our proposed standardization customization decision model using the data we collected through our case study.
the empirical formulation of our standardization customization decision model is shown in equation probability standardized or customized solution?
0 1 installed base impact 2 compatibility constraint 3 standards constraint 4 market share 5 customer influence 6 market share compatibility constraint market share standards constraint change size 9 version 10 nature of change ... equation the summary statistics of the data collected is shown in table .
since the dependent variable standardization customization decision is a binary choice we used a probit regression model for estimating equation .
the results of the probit regression are presented in table .
the statistical test results indicate that our hypothesized standardization customization decision model is valid note the highly significant p value for the model significance f test in table .
in probit regression the coefficients of the variables 0 10 indicate an increase or decrease of log odds probit score of the dependant variable i n s t a n d a r d d e v i a t i o n s u n i t s w h i c h i s harder to interpret.
for easier interpretation w e c o n v e r ted t h e probit effects to probability effects by calculating the effect of one unit increase in an independent variable on the probability of the vendor making a standardization decision holding all other variables at their mean levels.
table shows these easier to interpret probability effects.
robustness checks.
we performed a variety of robustness tests including the influence of outliers using cook s distance multi collinearity effects variance inflation factors and condition numbers heteroskedacity checks robust errors to confirm the validity of our empirical results and did not find any problems.
.
.
decision model results an analysis of the decision model results presented in table provides the following insights .
effect of market share a v e n d o r w i t h h i g h m a r k e t s h a r e monopoly in a heterogeneous d e m a n d e n v i r o n m e n t w i l l respond to customer change requests more through custom solutions than through product standardization.
specifically we see that for every increase in market share of its product there is a decrease of in the probability that measuretronics would provide a standardized product offering for i t s diversified customer base refer to coefficient 4 in table .
.
role of standards w h e n a c u s t o m e r r e q u e s t s a f e a t u r e t h a t violates industry standards then the vendor is likely to fulfill the need only through a customized solution.
this is true even when the market share of the vendor is high monopoly .
specifically we find that a customer request that violates standards h a s a lesser chance of getting accepted as a standard feature see coefficient 3 in table .
.
role of compatibility needs when a customer requests a feature that is not compatible with prior versions of the vendor s product the vendor is likely to fulfill the need through a customized solution.
however when the market share of the vendor is high monopoly the vendor might consider standardizing a feature even when presented with compatibility constraints.
holding all other variables at their mean level we find that customer requests that have a compatibility constraint have lower probability for getting standardized in a packaged software product see coefficient 2 in table .
however in the presence of higher market share the probability of a customer request that has compatibility constraints getting accepted in to the standard version of the product increases by see coefficient 6 in table .
.
needs of customers we observe that customers who declare a feature as essential to their operations have a significantly higher probability of having their requests standardized see coefficient 5 in table .
.
product variability cost model costs of standardization are typically recovered through the product pricing mechanisms across several product r e l e a s e s common to all customers.
however costs involved in product line variability or customized solutions are typically borne by specific customers who in turn typically make purchasing decisions based on the product line variability pricing schemes.
hence it is important for measuretronics to provide reasonably accurate and reliable cost estimates for product line variability i.e.
customized services .
while several models of general cost estimation exist in the software engineering literature to the best of our knowledge existing cost estimation models do not specifically address the costs involved in software product line variability by specifically taking in to account the customization lifecycle of a packaged software product.
in this section we develop and test a customization cost estimation model specifically suited for packaged product line variability.
the empirical formulation of our cost estimation model is presented in equation .
figure shows a pictorial representation of our proposed customization cost estimation model.
we explain each of these components of our model in the following sub sections.

we measure product variability costs in terms of the customization cost i.e.
the total person hours spent in the customization project for a customer.
the effort spent for fulfilling customer requests at measuretronics was tracked through a project planning and employee resource planning software.
w e extracted the relevant information from this system using the customer request id.
the information was later verified by the project leaders of the customization teams.

customization cost research model functional complexity structural complexity compatibility constraint customer knowledge product variability cost customization cost personnel experience size product version quality complexity is the measure of complexity of decision making and algorithmic logic in a program.
data complexity is a measure of the data processing complexity of a program.
in a system software package such as the one involved in this research logic and algorithmic functions dominate a program rather than the data processing functionality.
unlike enterprise applications such as erp or crm software the bluetooth p r o t o c o l a n a l y z e r p a c k a g e that we studied had very minimal data processing capabilities.
thus we used a logical complexity measure mccabe s number as the functional complexity of the software.
mccabe s number measures the complexity of code based on the number of edges the number of nodes and the number of connected components in a program flow graph.
this measure is thus an indication of the number of decision trees available in the system.
mccabe s complexity number is given by v e n 2p.
e is the number of edges n is the number of nodes and p is the number of predicates in the program flow graphs .
