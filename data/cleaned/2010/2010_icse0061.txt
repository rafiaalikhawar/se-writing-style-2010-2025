the ability to predict reliability of service oriented sys tems early at the architecture design phase can help to reduce re engineering cost and to produce more reliable systems.
software reliability prediction is a task to determine future reliability of software systems based on the past fail ure data .
various software reliability prediction models such as musa s execution time model putnam smodel rome laboratory model and so on havebeen proposed for predicting software reliability by observing accumulating and analyzing previous failure data.
traditionally comprehensive testing schemes are conducted onthe software systems to collect failure data and to makesure that the reliability threshold has been achieved before releasing the software to the customers or end users.
how ever reliability of a service oriented system not only relieson the system itself but also heavily depends on the remoteweb services and the unpredictable internet.
influenced bycommunication links difference service users may experi ence quite different reliability performance on the same webservice.
web service evaluation from the client side isusuallyrequiredforassessingperformanceoftargetwebser vices.
however traditional exhaustive testing becomes difficult and sometimes even impossible for the service oriented systems due to web service invocations may be chargedsince the web services are owned and hosted by other orga nizations.
even if the web service invocations are free executing a large number of web service invocations imposescosts for the service users and consumes resources of the ser viceproviders and itistime consumingandexpensivetoconduct evaluation on all the service candidates since theremay exist a lot of alternative web service candidates in theinternet with similar or identical functionalities.
however without comprehensive evaluation we cannot collect suffi cient past failure data of the web service components.
it is thus difficult for the system designer to determine whether the service oriented system is reliable enough for release.
thepreviousreliabilitypredictionmethodsforcomponentbased systems and service oriented systems are mainly focused on system level compositional anal ysis.
these approaches assume that reliabilities of the indi vidual components web services are known.
the detailedprocedures for obtaining the component reliabilities are usu ally ignored.
a few approaches which considercomponent level reliability prediction are mainly designedfor traditional component based systems.
we argue that re liability prediction for service oriented systems is more chal35lenging because there is a lack of internal information of the service components since the remote web servicesare provided by other organizations without any design and implementation details and different service users may obtain different performance from a same web service sincethe web service performance is greatly influenced by communication links.
without sufficient past failure data without internal information of the service components and influenced by the unpredictablecommunicationlinks itisthusmuchmoredif ficult to make accurate reliability prediction on the service oriented systems than traditional component based systems.to attack this challenge we propose a collaborative reliabil ity prediction approach.
the idea is that the web service reliability for the current service user service user is usuallydesigner of the service oriented system not end user of thesystem can be predicted by employing past failure data ofother similar service users.
a service user is selected as asimilar user with the current user if he she has experienced similar reliability performance on the same set of commonlyinvoked web services.
by our approach reliabilities of webservice components can be predicted even if the current userdoesnotinvokethesecomponentspreviouslyandhasnoideaon their internal information.
complementary to the existing reliability prediction approaches which mainly focus on systemlevelcompositionalanalysis thispaperfocusesonbothcom ponent level reliability prediction and system level reliabilitycompositional analysis.
the service component reliabilities obtained from our framework can be employed by other pre vious reliability prediction approaches.
our reliability pre diction framework can be employed at the early phase of system development to help produce more reliable system.
more importantly it can also be employed at runtime toenable optimal system reconfiguration.
the contributions of this paper are twofold firstly a collaborative framework is proposed for pre dicting reliability of service oriented systems.
differ entfrompreviousreliabilitypredictionapproaches ourapproach employs past failure data of similar serviceusers for making reliability prediction for the currentservice user.
secondly extensive experiments are conducted usingreal world web service dataset which contains .
mil lions real world web service invocation results from distributed service users on real world web services.
our real world web service dataset has beenpublished online which provides detailed experimental information for future research and makes our experiments reproducible.
the rest of this paper is organized as follows section introduces a collaborative framework.
section presents our collaborative reliability prediction approach.
section 4describes our implementation and experiments.
section 5introduces related work and section concludes the paper.

figure shows an example of a simple service oriented system which is presented as a service flow .
the service flow in figure includes a set of abstract tasks t1 ... t6 with certain control flow structures sequence loop a n d parallel .
for each abstract task an optimal candidate will be selected from a set of functionally equivalent web servicecandidates.
an execution plan is obtained by composing the selected web services s ...s6 which will be invoked to implement the abstract tasks.
similar to work we assume that the alternative service candidates are available.
the problem of obtaining the functionally equivalent web service candidates which has been discussed by a lot of pre vious work is out of the scope of this paper.
reliability of the service oriented system highly depends on the selected web services.
our approach employs past failure data from other similar service users to predict thefailure probabilities of web services for the current serviceuser.
therefore mechanisms are required for enabling pastfailure data collection from different service users.
a user collaborative mechanism is proposed in our previous work for web service recommendation.
this mechanism can also be applied to the web service past failuredata collection.
the design of this user collaborative mech anism is inspired by the recent success of youtube 2and wikipedia3.
the key idea is that instead of contributing videos youtube or knowledge wikipedia the service users are encouraged to contribute their individually observed web service past failure data.
by contributingmore past failure data on the used web services the serviceusers can obtain more accurate failure probability predictionof the web services which they do not use before since morecharacteristics of the current service user can be discovered from the provided data.
by this way the service users areencouraged to contribute their observed past failure data.
to speedup the process of web service failure data contributions client side middleware can be designed for theservice users to automatically record the failure informationof web service invocations and contribute this informationto a centralized server to exchange for failure probability prediction services.

.
reliability prediction for an abstract task in a service flow an optimal web service needs to be identified from a set of functionally equivalent candidates for executing the task.
the most straightforward way is to comprehensively evaluate all the service candidates and select out the best performing one.
however as discussed in section it is time consuming expensive and sometimes even impossible to make comprehensive eval uation on all the candidates.
another approach is to employ the web service past failure data observed by other service users for predicting the web service performance for the current user.
for exam ple for the new service users who do not invoke any webservices previously the performance of a web service canbe indicated by its average failure probability pi which is defined as pi mm summationdisplay a 1pa i wherepa iis failure probability of web service candidate i observed by the service user a mis the number of service users and piis the average failure probability of the web service candidate i. based on the average failure probability values of the service candidates the best performing candidate can be determined.
however since service users are in different geographic locations and are under different network conditions the currentusermaynotbeabletoexperiencesimilarfailureprobability performance as the average failure probability .
in case that the service users have invoked some web services previ ously we can take advantage of the past invocation informa tion to enable more accurate failure probability predictionon the uninvoked web services.
our collaborative reliabilityprediction approach is designed as a four phase process asshown in figure .
in phase we calculate the similarity of the service users with the current user based on the pastfailure data of their commonly invoked web services.
then in phase a set of similar users are identified.
after that inphase the invocation failure probabilities of web services are predicted for the current user by using the invocation failure probabilities observed by similar users.
finally inphase the reliability of the service oriented system is pre dicted by aggregating the failure probabilities of the servicecomponents.
details of these phases are presented at sec tion .
to section .
respectively.
.
phase similarity computation we assume that there are mservice users nweb services and the relationship between users and web servicesis denoted by an m nmatrix.
each entry pa iin the matrix represents the failure probability of web service i observed by the service user a.pa i nullif useradid not invoke web service ibefore.
pearson correlation coefficient pcc which has been widely used in a number of recommendation systems is employed for the similarity computation.
pcc employs the following equation to computes the similarity between service user aand service user ubased on their commonly invoked web services sim a u summationdisplay i ia iu pa i pa pu i pu radicalbigg summationdisplay i ia iu pa i pa radicalbigg summationdisplay i ia iu pu i pu whereia iuis a set of commonly invoked web services by both user aand user u pa iis the failure probability of web serviceiobservedbytheserviceuser a a n dparepresentsthe average failure probability of all the web services invoked by usera.
the similarity sim a u of two service users is in the interval of and where a larger value indicates higher similarity.
similar to the above approach we also employ pcc to calculate the similarity between web service iand web servicejby using sim i j summationdisplay u ui uj pu i pi pu j pj radicalbigg summationdisplay u ui uj pu i pi radicalbigg summationdisplay u ui uj pu j pj whereui ujis a set of service users who invoke both the web services iandj a n dpiis the average failure probability of web service i which can be calculated by equation .
.
phase similar user selection after calculating and ranking the pcc similarity values between the current user and other users a set of similar users can be identified by setting a parameter top k which indicates that kusers which have larger pcc values than others will be selected as similar users.
in reality a service user may have limited number of similar users and the dis similarusers e.g.
withnegativepccvalue maybeselected when the number of similar users is less than k. however including dissimilar users will greatly influence the prediction accuracy.
in our approach the service users who havenegative correlation negative pcc values with the currentuser will be excluded.
to predict a missing entry p u iin the failure probability matrix a set of similar service users s u can be identified 37by s u a sim u a simk sim u a a negationslash u wheresimkis thekthlargest pcc value with the current useru sim u a is to exclude the dissimilar users and sim a u canbecalculatedbyequation .
asetofsimilar web services s i with the current web service ican also be identified by s i k sim i k simk sim i k k negationslash i wheresimkis thekthlargest pcc value with the current web service iandsim k i can be computed by equation .

the predicted values by eq.
and eq.
may not fall in the probability range of to .
the predicted value is setto be when it is smaller than and set to be when it islarger than .
due to the sparsity of the m nfailure probability matrix predicting failure probability only by similar service users upcc or similar web services ipcc will potentially ignorevaluableinformationthatcanmakethepredictionmore accurate.
to address this problem the prediction results by the user based approach equation and the item basedapproach equation can be combined to fully utilizethe information of both similar users and similar web ser vices .
when s u negationslash s i negationslash we employ both the similar users and similar web services to predict the missing value by employing the following equation p u i pu summationdisplay a s u wa pa i pa pi summationdisplay k s i wk pu k pk where is a user defined parameter for determining how much the missing value prediction relies on the similar users or the similar web services.
in practice a missing pu ivalue may not have similar users or similar items.
to predict the missing value as accurate as possible when s u negationslash s i our approach only employs the information of similar users for making prediction.
in this case our approach degrades to the user based approach as shown in equation .
whens u s i negationslash we only use the information of similar items for making prediction.
in this case our approach degrades to the item based approach as shown in equation .whens u s i there are no similar users or similar web services.
consequently we predict the p u iby employing the following equation pu i pu pi pu pi noprediction pu negationslash null pi negationslash null pu negationslash null pi null pu null pi negationslash null pu null pi null wherepuis the average failure probability of different web services observed by the service user u named as umean andpiis the average failure probability of web service iobserved by different service users named as imean .

phase reliability aggregation in a service flow compositional structures describe the order in which a collection of abstract tasks are executed.there are four types of basic compositional structures i.e.
sequence branch loop a n d parallel .
these basic structures are included in bpmn and can be mapped to bpel easily.
similar to the work in weassume independent task failure in the service flow.
the effect of error propagation e.g.
the problem studied in is not considered in this paper.
the aggregation of compo nent failure probabilities of these compositional structuresis introduced in the following sequence.
the tasks in a sequence structure are executed one by one.
the sequence structure fails if anyof its sub task fails.
the composed failure probability 38of a sequence structure is calculated by p n productdisplay i pi wherenis the number of sequential tasks and piis the failure probability of the ithtask.
branch.
in the branch structure only one branch will be executed for each execution.
the composed failure probability of the branch structure is calculated by p n summationdisplay i 1bi pi wherenis the number of branches piis the failure probability of the ithbranch and biis the execution probability of the ithbranch summationtextn i 1bi .
loop.the composed invocation failure probability of the loop structure is calculated by p n summationdisplay i 0li p1 i wherep1is the failure probability of the task in the loop structure liis the probability of executing the loop for itimes nis the maximum looping times and summationtextni 0li .
w h e n n the composed invocation failure probability is since the task is not executed.
in this paper we assume that the values of n maximum looping times and liare provided by the system designer e.g.
the designer can simulate the service flow for a lot of times and record that approximate values .
parallel.
all tasks are executed at the same time in the parallel structure where each branch has an execution probability of .
a parallel structure is counted as a failure if any of the parallel branches fail in execu tion.
the invocation failure probability of the parallelstructure is calculated by p n productdisplay i pi wherepiis the probability that the ithparallel branch will fail.
these basic compositional structures can be nested and combined in an arbitrary way.
for calculating the aggregated failure probability of a service flow we decompose theservice flow to the basic compositional structures hierarchi cally.
as shown in figure firstly the failure probabilities of the basic compositional structures t 1andt2are calculated by using the corresponding formulas introduced above.
then the failure probability of t3is calculated by employing the failure probabilities of t5andt2.
finally the failure probability of the whole service flow can be obtained by us ing equation and the failure probabilities of t t1 t3 andt6.
by the above approach we obtain the aggregated failure probability of the service flow.
to predict the reliability of the service flow we adopt the commonly used exponential reliability function r t e t serv i ce plan t t t t 1t 1t t t t t 4t t t t t t 2t 5t figure failure probability composition where failure rate is the number of failures of the service flow during a certain time duration and ti st h et i m ep e riod for which the reliability is to be calculated.
the valueof can be calculated by p f where pis the composed failure probability of the service flow fis the execution frequency of the service flow e.g.
number of executions per hour .
therefore we obtain the following equation for thereliability prediction for a service flow r t e p f t. by the above approach designers of the service oriented systems are able to predict reliabilities of the systems early at the architecture design phase.
moreover after the systemreleased the prediction of system reliability can be dynam ically updated when the performance of the service compo nents is changed.
.
experiments .
experimental setup our real world web service performance dataset published at is employed for experiments.
this dataset inlcudes publicly available web services located in more than countries and distributed computers from planet lab .
the service users distributedcomputer from planet lab observe collect and contributethe failure data of the selected web services to our centralized server which is implemented by jdk eclipse axis2 apache tomcat apache http server and mysql.
each service user executes about invocations on each selected web service and the invocation failures are recorded.
the failure probability of a web service obtained by a serviceuser can thus be obtained.
failure probabilities by all the100 web services observed by all the service users canbe presented as a failure probability matrix.
to study the failure probability prediction performance we compare our prediction approach named as hybridfor ease of presentation with four other approaches user mean umean item mean imean user based approach us ing pcc upcc and item based approach using pcc ipcc .
umean employs the average failure probability of the current service user on other web services for the 39prediction while imean employs the average failure probability of the web service observed by other service usersfor the prediction.
upcc only employs similar users for the failure probability prediction while ipcc only employs similar web services for the prediction.
the service users are divided into training users and testing users in our experiments.
failure probabilities of the training users are stored in our centralized server to makeprediction for the testing users.
to make our experimentmore realistic we randomly remove entries of the trainingusers to make the training matrix sparser.
since the testingusers usually only employ a small number of web services we also randomly remove entries of the testing users.
dif ferent prediction approaches are employed for predicting the failure probabilities of the removed entries.
the original val ues of the removed entries are used as the expected valuesto study the prediction accuracy.
the well known mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse metrics are employed to measure the prediction accuracy of different approaches.
mae is defined as mae summationtext u i pu i hatwidepu i n wherepu idenotes the expected failure probability value of web service iobserved by service user u hatwidepu idenotes the predicted failure probability value and ndenotes the number of predicted values.
rmse is defined as rmse radicalbigg summationtext u i pu i hatwidepu i n where smaller rmse or mae values indicate better prediction accuracy.
.
comparison of prediction accuracy table shows both the mae and rmse results of different prediction approaches employing and density training matrix.
in the third row of table the numbers and represent different given numbers which are the number of failure probabilities provided by the testing users.
table shows that our prediction approach obtains better prediction accuracy smaller mae and rmse values in all the experimental settings.
table also shows that mae andrmse values of the hybridapproach become smaller with the increase of given number from to .
this observa tion indicates that the prediction accuracy can be improvedby providing more web service failure probabilities.
withthe increase of the training user number from to the prediction accuracy also has significant enhancement since larger training matrix provides more information forthe missing value prediction.
when the density of the train ing matrix is increased from to the predictionaccuracy is also enhanced since denser training matrix pro vides more information for the missing value prediction.
from table we also observe that the item based approaches imean ipcc outperform the user based ap proaches umean upcc in all the experimental settings.this observation indicates that similar web services providemore useful information than the similar users for the miss ing value prediction.

studies on parameters4.
.
given number given number indicates the number of web service failure probabilities given by the current testing user.
to study the impact of the given number on the prediction results we vary the given number from to with a step value of .
we set training user number top k training matrix density and in the experiments.
figure4showstheexperimentalresults wherefigure4 a and b employ the density training matrix for the missing value prediction while figure c and d employthe20 densitytrainingmatrix.
theexperimentalresultsoffigure4showthat thepredictionaccuracyofthe hybrid approach is enhanced slightly.
this observation indicatesthat by providing a small set of observed web service failureprobabilities the service user can obtain good prediction accuracy for the remanding web services the predictionperformance of the imean approach is not influenced by the change of given number since it does not employ the given failure probabilities for the missing value prediction and our hybridapproach outperforms other approaches consistently.
.
.
training matrix density the prediction accuracy is also influenced by the training matrix density.
to study the impact of the training matrix density on the prediction results we vary the density from5 to with a step value of .
we set training user number top k given number and in the experiments.
figure5showstheexperimentalresults wherefigure5 a and b employ given number of and figure c and d employgivennumberof20.
theexperimentalresultsoffigure show that the prediction accuracy of hybridis significantly enhanced when the matrix density is increasedfrom to .
with the increase of matrix density thespeed of accuracy enhancement slows down.
this observa tion indicates that the prediction accuracy will be enhanced by collecting more past failure data from different service users to make the training matrix denser especially whenthe matrix is sparse the performance of umean is not influenced by the density of training matrix since it doesnot employ the information of the training matrix for themissing value prediction and the hybridapproach still outperforms other approaches consistently.

training user number to study the impact of the training user number on the prediction results we vary the training user number from to with a step value of .
we set top k in the experiments.
figure shows the experimental results under different experimental settings where figure a employsgiven number matrix density figure b employs given number matrix density figure c employs given number matrix density and figure d employs given number matrix density .
the experimental results of figure show that the prediction accuracy of hybridis enhanced stably with the increase of training user number under all the experimental settings.
this observation indicates that by encouragingmore service users to contribute their web service past fail ure data the prediction accuracy can be improved stably.
on the other hand if we are able to provide accurate webservice failure probability prediction for the service users 40table prediction performance comparison training users training users matrix density matrix density matrix density matrix density metrics methods umean .

figure a and b show mae and rmse results under the experimentalsettings of training matrix density given number and train user number .

figure shows that the prediction accuracy stops to enhance when the top kis larger than a certain value e.g.

the prediction performance will not decrease with the increaseof the top kvalue since we exclude dissimilar users with negative pcc values from the top kset.
this observation indicates that by using our enhanced top kalgorithm we can simply set the value of top kto a large value for obtaining better prediction performance.

parameter the experimental results of table show that item based approaches outperform the user based approach in our web service failure probability dataset indicating that differentdatasets may inherit different data distribution and correla tioncharacteristics.

this observation indicates that the opti mal value is influenced by the given number .
the similar webservicesaremoreimportantthansimilaruserswhenthegiven number is small.
with the increasing of given number the similar users become more important.
this observationis reasonable since with limited user given web service fail ure values the umean prediction method which employthemeanoftheuser givenfailureprobabilitiestopredictthe failure probability of other web services has higher probability to be inaccurate.
this will influence the prediction performance of upcc which employs the umean valuefor the missing value prediction as shown in equation .

related work and discussion a great deal of software reliability prediction models have been proposed for stand alone software systems such as musa s execution time model putnam s model rome laboratory models jelinski s model littlewood s models and so on.
more and more reliabil ity prediction approaches are also proposed for component based systems and service oriented systems .
however most of these previous approaches focus on system level reliability compositional analysis and assumethat the component reliabilities are known.
different fromthese approaches our collaborative reliability prediction ap proach focuses not only on system level reliability aggrega tion but also on component level web service failure probability prediction.
a few approaches which consider componentlevel reliability prediction are mainly designed for traditional component based systems.
goseva popstojanova etal.
calculate reliability risk of a component by the com ponent complexity and the levels of its failures.
reussneret al.
compute component reliability by the reliabili ties of its services which are assumed to be known.
boththese approaches require internal information of the compo nents for making component reliability prediction.
cheunget al.
predict the component reliability at architecture de sign phase by exploiting behavioral models from sources ofinformationavailableatdesigntime.
differentfromwork which tries to predict reliability of a component which is not implemented yet our work targets at predicting reliabilities of remote web services which are implemented andprovided by other organizations.
moreover work doesnot need to consider the influence of communication linkssince the components are usually invoked locally in tradi tionally component based systems.
our approach addresses the influence of communication links by employing collaborative filtering for reliability prediction which significantly enhances the reliability prediction accuracy for the serviceoriented systems.
collaborative filtering is the process of filtering for information using techniques involving collaboration among multiple agents.
various collaborative filtering techniquesare widely adopted in recommender systems .
the most studied approaches include user based approaches and item based approaches .
in the environment of ser vice computing it is possible to collect and make use ofthe past failure data of web services from different serviceusers.
to take advantages of these collected data this paperapplies the collaborative filtering techniques to attack the challenging research problem of reliability prediction of service oriented systems.
as far as we know thecollaborative reliability approach of this paper is differentfrom all previous reliability prediction models.
in our current design the collaborative reliability prediction approach mainly focuses on service oriented systems since the web services are usually publicly accessible andare invoked by a lot of service users.
therefore it is possi ble to obtain the past failure data of web services from dif ferent service users.
our approach can further be extendedto component based systems other distributed computingplatforms and cloud computing platforms in case that thereusable components are employed by other users previously and the past failure data can be obtained from these users.
similartothedesignofbittorrent whereuserscanobtain faster download speed if the file e.g.
a movie is popularand a lot of users are collaborating on downloading it ourapproach can achieve better reliability prediction accuracy .

in our previous work the idea of user collaboration has been employed for web service reliability evaluation and web service recommendation .
in this paper similar idea is employed to collect data from service users and to make reliability prediction ofthe service oriented systems for the system designers.
by our approach the collected data from other users are em ployed for making reliability prediction for the current userwithout requiring real world web service invocations.
.
conclusion and future work inthispaper weproposeacollaborativereliabilityprediction approach for service oriented systems.
the main idea is to exploit the past failure data of the similar users for predicting web service failure probabilities for the current user.
the predicted failure probabilities of the elementary webservices are composed using different compositional struc tures to predict the reliability of the whole service orientedsystem.
the comprehensive experimental analysis shows the effectiveness of our collaborative reliability prediction ap proach.
when aggregating the failure probabilities of the service components we assume service component failures are independent in most cases this assumption is reasonable since web services are usually deployed on separate severs of dif ferent organizations.
the physical and electrical isolation ensures that web service failures are independent.
however in some special cases failures of web services may have cor relation e.g.
two web services running on the same server error propagation etc.
.
we will address this web servicefailure correlation problem in our future work.
our on going research also includes exploring failure correlation between different web services collecting more past failure data on more web services and investigating the op timal value in different experimental settings.
