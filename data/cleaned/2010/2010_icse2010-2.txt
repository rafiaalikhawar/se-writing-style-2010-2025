to better understand the natureof project landscapes and the integration process with a view to im proving the experience of both newcomers and the people responsi ble for orienting them we performed a grounded theory study with18 newcomers across projects.
we identified the main featuresthat characterize a project landscape together with key orientationaids and obstacles and we theorize that there are three primaryfactors that impact the integration experience of newcomers earlyexperimentation internalizing structures and cultures and progressvalidation.

introduction software developers working on a project effectively inhabit a project landscape .
they are familiar with its features such as the product architecture the team communication strategies and the de velopment process and they know the shortcuts and the commonly traveled paths.
newcomers are explorers who must orient them selves within an unfamiliar landscape.
as they gain experience they eventually settle in and create their own places within thelandscape.
like explorers of the natural landscape they encountermany obstacles such as culture shock or getting lost without help.
we conducted a qualitative study to better understand what project landscapes look like and how newcomers explore them.
think ing of a project as a landscape and integration of newcomers asthe process of settling into that landscape changes what we per ceive to be important and helps us see new ways of aiding new comers.

.cess of learning about a project and how that process unfolds over time.
from the perspective of someone helping newcomers set tle in the landscape metaphor reveals the need to show them thecommonly traversed routes to help them learn to interpret aspectsof the landscape unique to the project and to introduce them to thecustoms of the people who inhabit the landscape.
it also suggeststhat if the community wants to be welcoming to newcomers theyneed to be tolerant of cultural faux pas be sensitive to mis stepscaused by a newcomer s lack of understanding take the time tounderstand why newcomers get lost in their landscape add readily interpretable signposts and move them as things change.
such sign posts are especially important at cross roads places with choiceswhere others have tended to get lost.
identifying what counts as across roads and what characterizes the parts of a project that needsignposts can be aided by studies such as that presented here.
specifically we were interested in answering three main research questions what are the key prominent features in a project land scape what orientation obstacles do new team members face andwhat orientation aids can be provided?
we interviewed develop ers and team leaders across projects at ibm during the last yearto answer these questions.
following these interviews we theorized that there are three main factors that impact how newcomers settle into a project land scape early experimentation internalizing structures and cultures and progress validation.
we also identified the landscape features that newcomers learned while moving into new project landscapesand we observed how the features facilitated or hindered the new comers integration.
when we presented the results of our study toseven of the participants they all agreed that the factors accuratelyrepresented their experiences as newcomers and that application ofour findings would have eased their integration.
in the past studies on project integration have been performed with new employees joining their first software development proj ects .
because these studies were performed with junior andrecently hired developers many of the difficulties they encounteredrelated to the newness of the corporate culture and the differencebetween academic and industrial environments.
we were interestedin understanding specifically the project landscape independentlyof the circumstances related to the first time transition of personnelinto an industry environment.
to this end we focused this studyon developers with varying degrees of experience in the field andwithin their company who were joining on going projects in thecompany.
we reported preliminary results at a workshop .
the contributions of this paper include a theory grounded in empirical data of how newcomers integrate into a project landscape and a characterization of project landscapes as seen by newcomers.the landscape features identified are well known the contributionin this area is the empirical evidence of their impact on integration.
275we begin by summarizing the method we used to perform this study in section .
we characterize project landscapes by presenting the main features and their roles in the integration of newcomersin section and describe the three factors impacting the integra tion of newcomers in section .
we present how we evaluated thecredibility and quality of our results in section then cover therelated work in section and conclude in section .

method .
grounded theory we based our study on grounded theory as described by corbin and strauss .
grounded theory is a qualitative research approach that employs theoretical sampling and open coding to formulate a social theory grounded in the empirical data.
grounded theoryis well suited to an exploratory study like ours because it involvesstarting from general research questions and refining the questions and the instruments as the study progresses.
for example as op posed to traditional sampling techniques e.g.
random sampling grounded theory involves refining the sampling criteria through out the course of the study to ensure that the selected participantsare able to answer new questions that have been formulated.
inour study analysis of the data collected through interviews wasperformed using open coding we assigned codes to sentences orparagraphs and we defined them as the study progressed.
we thenused axial coding we went through the codes and linked them tocategories usually found in a grounded theory study fac tors context aids and obstacles in our study and consequences.finally the goal of a grounded theory study is to produce a the ory i.e.
a coherent set of hypotheses in the context of a process that originates from empirical data.
because the use of groundedtheory is relatively recent in software engineering we brieflyhighlight in section the criteria that are generally used in otherfields to evaluate the quality of such studies.
.
data collection we started this study by sending an informal survey to the ibm qse quality of software engineering mailing list.
we askedwhat mechanisms currently exist in ibm to introduce employeesto software projects.
nineteen managers directors and architectsresponded and mentioned a wide variety of mechanisms e.g.
men tor document repository wiki and problems e.g.
newcomers mustlearn on their own .
following this survey we focused our effortson experienced software developers joining ongoing projects.
we used three instruments to collect data about the integration experiences of newcomers.
first we sent a short questionnaire topotential participants asking about their projects e.g.
project ageand type when they joined the project frequency of team meetings and their level of experience e.g.
time at ibm programming expe rience .
the responses helped us select the participants who wouldbe most likely to provide answers to our questions as they becamemore precise.
we then asked each selected participant to draw asketch of their project such as could be used to introduce anotherdeveloper with similar skills to the key aspects of the participant sjob.
this sketch made the participant think about their project andprepared them for the third instrument a one hour semi structuredphone interview.
most of the questions were initially derived fromthe results of our informal survey.
at the end of the interview weasked the participant to describe their sketch effectively walkingus through their project landscape.
we also used the sketch to elicitspecific answers e.g.
why did you draw the release schedule?
.
in accordance with the grounded theory approach all instruments evolved as the study progressed.

and can you describe some spe cific examples that show how you found what you needed to getstarted on the project.
as we learned more about the various is sues participants encountered we modified the general questionsand appended more specific questions.
participants and projects.
most of our participants were experienced developers who had recently joined an ongoing project at least months old .
these selection criteria resulted from the firstfour interviews where we learned that developers new to ibm wereunsuitable for this study because they focused on organizationalrather than project specific issues and new projects were unsuit able for this study because they were in the process of formingtheir project landscapes.
the participants were recruited from awide variety of sources ensuring a broad spectrum of participants.the intent of this study was to look for similarities across the sam ple not differences between sub groups.
almost all the newcomerswe approached were eager to participate and were interested in theresults providing anecdotal evidence of the importance of projectintegration issues.
a benefit of the grounded theory approach is that by forming our selection criteria as we went we were able to focus on a nar rower set of research questions purposely leaving other importantquestions for future work.
in developing this focus we could thenensure that future interviews covered a wide variety of participantsand projects allowing us to uncover aspects of a project landscapethat were not specific to just one type of project or participant.
table shows that our participants women and men and projects exhibited great variability with respect to ibm experi ence project age and product type.
we focused on developers butalso interviewed two team leads and one test lead.
our participantshad all joined their projects in the prior to months except forone team lead who had joined his project two years earlier.
mostparticipants were in teams developing products but one worked onbuilding a custom application for a customer.
most team mem bers were collocated though almost all projects were distributed tosome degree.
participants came from eight countries on three con tinents north america europe and asia .
the numberof developers per team ranged from to .
all participants weretold that their answers would be reported only in aggregated form.
.
analysis each interview was transcribed and then coded several times by one author.
eventually the codes were associated with categoriesprescribed by grounded theory factors context consequences andemerging categories e.g.
the landscape features .
the results ofeach interview were discussed with the other authors who jointlyidentified the concepts worth investigating.
at the end of our study we also listed the landscape features drawn in each sketch.
wefound that the features drawn in the sketch were almost always 276the same as those mentioned in the interview the list of the most commonly drawn features thus confirmed our interview findings.
.
evaluation following our analysis we re interviewed some participants to validate our findings.
we checked whether our findings resonatedwith the participants experiences and whether they were helpfuland presented at the appropriate abstraction level not so specific asto match only one participant and not so general as to be useless anduninteresting.
due to time constraints we could only re interviewseven participants.
we randomly selected participants from threecategories of newcomers two junior year of ibm experience three senior year of ibm experience and two team leads.
thecategories ensured that we would validate our findings with a rep resentative sample of participants and the random sampling de creased potential investigator bias in the evaluation.
we sent a two page document presenting our findings to each participant and weasked open ended questions regarding their experiences with re spect to our findings.
the seven participants found our findings tobe helpful and representative of their experiences see section .
.
project landscape features interviewing newcomers whose integration experiences were still fresh in their minds allowed us to identify the key landscape fea tures they had to learn the key orientation aids they used and thekey obstacles they encountered.
features repeatedly encounteredby newcomers probably include the major features in the land scapes.
knowing the effect of these features on the newcomers integration experiences can also lead to the establishment of betterorientation aids and reduction of obstacles.
we summarize the importance of the landscape features aids and obstacles on the integration of newcomers in table .
features arelisted at the left grouped into categories discussed below.
for eachfeature the next two columns show the number of participants whodrew that feature in their sketches and who referred to it as im portant in their interviews.
because our questions evolved as thestudy progressed these numbers should not be interpreted as thefrequency with which these features were encountered by participants.
a quantitative study with a larger sample would be a naturalstep to evaluate the importance of the features aids and obstacles.
additional columns show orientation aids and obstacles grouped according to the integration factors described in section .
only themost important aids and obstacles we encountered are shown in thetable and discussed in the text.
the entries in these columns show which aids helped and which obstacles hindered learningabout features and conversely which features contributed toorientation aids facilitating the integration experience or con tributed to obstacles hindering the experience.
an example of is that the second aid walkthroughs helped newcomers learn aboutthe low level design and runtime behavior of their product amongother things.
an example of is that the development processesof some teams prescribed daily meetings which in turn helpednewcomers learn about the role and expertise of their colleagues among other things.
many of the interactions shown in the tableare described in the text but not all due to space constraints.
we briefly explain the role of each landscape feature in the integration of newcomers in the rest of this section and we providefurther insight into how the orientation aids and obstacles are re lated to the three integration factors in section .
.
product the product being produced is central to the project landscape.
interestingly however only a single feature of the product low level design and runtime behavior generally played a crucial rolein the integration of the newcomers the other aspects were learnedrelatively easily or did not significantly affect integration.
software architecture.
newcomers sought to understand the architecture mostly to get a broader view of their project rather than because their tasks impacted or were directly impacted by the ar chitecture.
without a good understanding of the architecture it washard for newcomers to determine where their tasks fitted in thebroader product and if their changes were compliant with the ex isting architecture.
teams tried to help participants understand thearchitecture by having a team member present an overview of thearchitecture within the first few days of their integration but it wasonly through exploration i.e.
questions technical meetings andexperimentation that newcomers finally understood this feature.
low level design and runtime behavior.
the majority of tasks given to newcomers dealt with the intricacies of the low level design and the runtime behavior of particular components of the prod uct.
newcomers had to learn this feature to ensure that they under stood the impact and correctness of changes they made.
unfor tunately this feature was often the least documented not even asimple overview was available so newcomers had to ask technicalquestions actively search for code examples and rely on trial anderror a time consuming activity.
design and implementation rationale.
newcomers who had to fix bugs or modify or use legacy code whose authors were no longer available sought to understand the rationale behind the code by ask ing questions.
for example a colleague of participant p14 1told him that the bug report he was working on was an intentional bug the feature had been implemented that way to comply with a stan dard.
the issue tracking system of teams having a strict procedurefor issue management was helpful for recovering design rationale.
product domain.
newcomers were usually able to do their tasks without a complete understanding of the requirements in the product s domain.
nonetheless newcomers who did not know the do main before joining their team reported that greater understandingled to feelings of comfort and confidence that they were theirjob efficiently and properly.
these newcomers sought to acquire adeeper understanding of the domain by reading documentation andsearching for learning material but did not always succeed.
technologies used.
newcomers learned about technologies used in their project e.g.
programming language libraries in a variety of ways such as reading books or reference manuals or browsingtutorials and code examples.
only one participant mentioned thathe needed a course to learn about a technology.
in general partic ipants did not encounter significant difficulties while learning newtechnologies thanks to their previous experience and education anobservation that corroborates begel and simon s findings .
.
processes and practices.
the processes and practices adopted by the team to build a product affect how newcomers explore the project landscape and deter mine the characteristics of the trails left by the team members.
development process.
all our participants belonged to agile teams with iterations consisting of activities such as planning coding and testing.
newcomers needed to learn the specifics of the process tobetter understand the expected outcomes e.g.
a beta release andhow they would achieve them e.g.
one day of planning a certainnumber of weeks on development and the last two weeks on test ing .
newcomers also needed to learn which step in the process 1identifiers are associated with quotes for traceability and to distinguish between participants.
to preserve anonymity identifiers and genders were assigned randomly and are not shown in table .

why are we test ing now?
.
although newcomers learned about the specifics of theprocess mostly by participating in or observing the planning ofcurrent and subsequent iterations newcomers like participant p12noted that for the process it would have been useful to have ahalf hour to just explain that up front... i learnedas i was going which is not as easy as i think having it initially.
task process.
each team has a particular way of performing coding tasks and some teams even have different coding processes and inter team dependencies for different parts of the product.
for ex ample p5 mentioned that the tools used for testing and issue man agement and the person performing the code review depended onthe parts of the system she was working on.
newcomers benefitedfrom their previous experience as software developers to learn theirway around the task process but as p5 said guided exploration wasoften the most efficient orientation aid they started me out small coaching ... you re going to make this change this ishow you re going to test it these are the tools that you re going toneed.
she sat down with me and she helped me work through.
development environment and tools.
installing and configuring the development environment often caused newcomers to get lost and it also slowed the progress of the newcomers in learningabout the product.
tools unique to the team posed particular is sues especially when there was little documentation or help avail able because the newcomers had to rely on trial and error to learnthem.
waiting time before getting a fully working development en vironment ranged from one week to two months and reasons variedwidely a long time to get purchase authorization or the proper cre dentials severely outdated and incomplete installation documenta tion and configuration problems.
i lost like a week or so but ithink it is the time that it takes when you don t know to dothe configuration.
... it was confusing but not difficult .
dif ficulties learning this feature were eased when a colleague servedas a guide to the installation of the tools or there were up to dateinstructions or the tools were already set up for the newcomers.
software configuration management.
source control was coupled with issue management in seven projects and newcomers had to learn both systems concurrently both how to use them and whatthe associated team policies were.
the amount of coupling var ied from informal conventions e.g.
provide the bug number in thecommit comment to tool supported coupling e.g.
every commitmust be associated with a documented issue through the develop ment environment .
tool supported coupling and strict issue man agement policies provided useful trails that contributed valuable in formation to help newcomers learn about the other features of thelandscape e.g.
implementation rationale of a method explained ina bug report .
newcomers benefited from their previous experiencefor the general usage of the scm systems and generally learned thespecifics for their projects during their first tasks.
.
team the inhabitants of a project landscape have various roles and communicate in ways that are specific to their project.
newcomers must learn about the inhabitants and discover the most efficient wayof getting information and help from them.
roles and expertise.
in the projects we studied newcomers sought to learn three dimensions of the roles and expertise of their colleagues seniority components for which responsible and technical fields in which expert e.g.
web client or modelingtechnologies .
understanding this feature is important as newcom ers need to determine who to ask and who to trust.
as p6 said itdepends who you ask and what you ask.
... for example if i willask something about the architecture of the project and i go withwith the guy that is experienced in java then i will have lost anhour trying to explain what i m asking ... what i need from him.
formal meetings.
the frequency and type of meetings held by the team is determined by the development process and the team culture.
for example the scrum agile methodology prescribes dailymeetings whereas p15 s team held only one way formal meetingswhere the team members would report their progress to the man ager to update the schedule.
five participants told us that it was intheir first team meetings that they learned more about the roles oftheir colleagues who answered what questions and the develop ment process.
the form of these meetings makes a big differenceto how helpful they are to newcomers meetings that consisted onlyof team members reporting on their progress or answering ques tions from the client without being allowed to answer questionsfrom other developers were unhelpful.
on the other hand scrummeetings where newcomers could ask questions and get proactivesuggestions based on their progress reports were very helpful.
communication strategies.
many communication strategies were used by teams including live or phone communication email and instant messaging.
each team favored one or more in particular.for example p12 asked most of his questions to his mentor in per son whereas p18 used mostly instant messaging for questions.
communication strategies influence the richness of the interaction between newcomers and their team members.
participants whoused live or phone communication reported in several instances thatthey received additional useful information beyond what they hadasked for.
p5 learned more by visiting her colleague s office thanby asking a question over instant messaging i just tried talking topeople visiting in their offices.
i alsotake a quick look to see what kind of
