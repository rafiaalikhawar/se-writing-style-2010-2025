personalized defect prediction by tian jiang a thesis presented to the university of waterloo in fulfillment of the thesis requirement for the degree of master of applied science in electrical and computer engineering waterloo ontario canada tian jiang brought to you by core view metadata citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk provided by university of waterloo s institutional repositoryi hereby declare that i am the sole author of this thesis.
this is a true copy of the thesis including any required final revisions as accepted by my examiners.
i understand that my thesis may be made electronically available to the public.
iiabstract academia and industry expend much effort to predict software defects.
researchers proposed many defect prediction algorithms and metrics.
while previous defect prediction techniques often take the author of the code into consideration none of these techniques build a separate prediction model for each developer.
different developers have different coding styles commit frequencies and experience levels which would result in different defect patterns.
when the defects of different developers are combined such differences are obscured hurting the prediction performance.
this thesis proposes two techniques to improve defect prediction performance personalized defect prediction andconfidence based hybrid defect prediction .
personalized defect prediction builds a separate prediction model for each developer to predict software defects.
confidencebased hybrid defect prediction combines different models by picking the prediction from the model with the highest confidence.
as a proof of concept we apply the two techniques to classify defects at the file change level.
we implement the state of the art change classification as the baseline and compare with the personalized defect prediction approach.
confidence based defect prediction combines these two models.
we evaluate on six large and popular software projects written in c and java the linux kernel postgresql xorg eclipse lucene and jackrabbit.
iiiacknowledgements i would like to take this opportunity to express my greatest gratitude to my supervisor prof. lin tan.
it is her that provided me with the chance to work at the frontier of the software reliability research.
during the past two years i received countless invaluable advice from her.
i am trained in every aspect such as research insights technical skills time management presentation skills and collaborations.
the two year experience working with her will benefit me in any position that i would take in the future.
i am extremely grateful to prof. sung kim from the hong kong university of science and technology who provided me with helpful insights during the development of my project.
i am very appreciated that the readers prof. patrick lam and prof. mahesh v .
tripunitara would spare the time from their very busy schedules to review my thesis and provide precious comments.
i am thankful to all of our research group members.
it is a pleasant time working and discussing with them.
i want to thank the university of waterloo and the department of electrical and computer engineering for providing the environment and back end supports.
lastly i would also like to thank my parents for supporting me through my education career.
their support made it possible to study in the first tier university.
this thesis and my graduate career are not possible without the help from any of these people.
