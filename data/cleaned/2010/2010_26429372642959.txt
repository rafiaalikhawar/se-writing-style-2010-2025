the high level deliverables and project roadmap release planning assigns deliverables into different releases sprint planning breaks down selected deliverables into technical tasks in each sprint e.g.
a day period software development tasks are to be completed by asd team members in sprint review retrospective team members demonstrate the product increments and reflect on experi ence gained from the last sprint and during releasethe working software is delivered to the customers .
the sprint planning phase is crucial for the success of a project.
task need to be allocated to team members whiletaking into account task precedence balancing team mem bers workload and ensuring quality.
compared to tradi tional methods of software development decision making byasd teams often exhibit different characteristics.
in the advantages for providing automated decision support toasd teams during the sprint planning phase to help themmake effective workload quality trade offs when allocatingtasks have been illustrated.
these systems can be especiallybeneficial for novice teams who are new to the agile practice.inordertobringsuchdecisionsupportsystemsintopractice understanding the decisions making tendencies exhibited byagile teams is important.
recently a number of studies have been conducted to investigate the decision making process of asd teams .
however these studies mostly gather data through in terviews and surveys.

tiondecisiontendencies.
nevertheless onerecenttrendasd project management has laid the foundation to significant ly improve researchers understanding of the task allocationdecision tendencies of asd teams.
an increasing percentageof asd teams are using agile project management apm tools such as scrumwise .
these software tools provide intuitive interfaces for decisions regarding each phase of theasd process be easily expressed by team members.
thedecisions together with their effects on asd team perfor mance can be recorded in detail to facilitate data drivenunderstanding of task allocation decision making.
in order to investigate how useful data from such tools can be for for studying the asd process we designed anonline apm tool the human centred agile software en gineering hase p l a t f o r m .
it helps asd teams manage their projects while unobtrusively tracking data generatedduring the asd process to support research in this domain.to understand how valuable data collected from apm toolscan be to studying asd task allocation decision tendencies we used the hase platform to conduct a study involving 20novice asd teams consisting of undergraduate softwareengineering students over a period of weeks.
to the bestof our knowledge this study is the first large scale studyof task allocation behaviors exhibited by novice asd team s. by analyzing task allocation decisions made for over 700software engineering tasks by the participants through theexploratory data analysis eda approach we demon strate the scientific research potential of apm tools by iden tifying three significant tendencies exhibited by novice asdteams when allocating tasks.
.
related work studies about the decision making process of asd teams started to emerge in recent years.
in the authorsinvestigated decisions related to software designs.
they em ployed content analysis and explanation building to extractqualitative and quantitative results from interviews with 25software designers.
the study finds that the structure ofthe design problem determines the designers choice betweenrational and naturalistic decision making.
thestudyin focusedondecision makingbyasdteams.
it examined decisions made across the four stages of thesprint cycle sprint planning sprint execution sprint reviewand sprint retrospective.
the authors employed the tech nique of focus group study with agile developers andmanagers to determine what decisions were made at differ ent points of the sprint cycle.
in another publication by thesame research group interviews with an additional 18professional agile practitioners from one global consultingorganization one multinational communications company two multinational software development companies and onelarge museum organization were analyze to identify six keyobstacles facing decision making in agile teams.
nevertheless thetechniquesusedbyexistingstudiesmainly involve interviews and surveys.
this limited the scaleof the study as well as the level of details of the collecteddata.
as a result the form of findings from such studiestend to be qualitative in nature.
for instance in someobstacles facing agile teams during sprint decision makingcan people are unwilling to commit to a decision lack of and lack of empowerment .
there is a lack ofquantitative results indicating the extent of each obstaclefacing agile team members with different competence levels.furthermore existing studies focused on asd teams whoare already proficient in applying agile development meth ods.
they did not provide insight into the decision makingtendencies exhibited by novice asd teams who are more inneed of automated decision support.

the hase platform hase is an online apm tool.
it provides five main features to support agile project management which cover thesprint planning sprint a n dsprint retrospective phasesshown in figure .registration in order to build user profiles hase requires registrants to specify their self assessed com petence levels in different areas of expertise such as fa miliarity with specific programming languages systemdesign methodologies and user interface ui designtools etc.
.team and role management hase supports the creation of teams the selection of product owners andstakeholders into the teams and the assignment of d ifferent roles within a team e.g.
programmers and uidesigners .
.task management task information including task description skills required for the task under whichdeliverable each task belongs to and the person whoproposed each task is displayed for all team membersto view.
the difficulty value diff o fe a c ht a s k is recorded using an point likert scale with 0denoting extremely easy and denoting extremelyhard .
team members can determine the difficultyvalue of each task together and input the value intothe hase platform.
.sprint planning hase records the teams decisions on which tasks are assigned to which team member.once assigned the status of the task becomes as signed .
the assignee iinputs his her confidence value conf i f o re a c ht a s k on an point likert scale with denoting not confident at all and denoting extremely confident .
the assignees also record the estimated required time test to complete each task i nn u m b e ro fd a y s .
.sprint retrospective once a task is completed the assignee changes its status in the hase platform to completed .
this action will trigger hase to record the actual number of days tact used to complete this task.
hase also provides functions for team membersto peer review the quality qual o fe a c hc o m p l e t e d task .t h eq u a l i t yo fac o m p l e t e dt a s ki sr e c o r d e di n the platform as either unsatisfactory or satis factory .
the input data to the hase platform required from asd teams are generated as a result of their activities followingthe scrum methodology.
in this way users of hase can be have as if they are using any apm tool without expendingadditional effort.
thus the data collection process remain s unobtrusive to the asd team members.
over time the 690user profile information task information task allocation decisions and the timeliness and quality of completed taskscan reveal insight into asd teams behavior patterns that isuseful for building automated task allocation decision sup port systems.
.
research design in order to demonstrate the potential for apm tools in providing new insight into the behavior patterns of as d teams we conducted a study involving undergrad uate software engineering students in the beihang univer sity buaa china in using the hase platform.
aspart of their curriculum they were required to complete asoftware engineering project using the scrum agile develop ment methodology over a period of weeks.
the studentswere introduced to the concept of agile software engineer ing during lecture sessions of the same course.
they hadno hands on experience with the scrum methodology beforethe coursework project.
the students were asked to form into teams of five to s e v e np e r s o n se a c hb yt h e i ro w nc h o i c e .
e a c ht e a mw a srequired to produce a working software system at the endof the project.
the project proposals were reviewed andapproved by the course instructor to ensure that they wereof similar scale and complexity across all teams.
the projectwasdividedinto8 sprints.
eachsprint lasted7 days.
duringa sprint each team analyzed their own proposed project toidentify tasks that need to be completed in order to producethe required software.
tasks were divided among the teammembersatthebeginningofeachsprintbasedondiscussionswithin each team.
each participant may be assigned ormultiple tasks during each sprint.
a total of tasks wereproposed by all the teams during this study.
the percentageof all tasks being rated as each of the difficulty values areshown in figure .
tasks with difficulty values from to 8forms the majority of all tasks i.e.

.
apart from these contextual data we use the task quality evaluation data and the task completion time data obtainedfrom the sprint retrospective phase to compute an estima tor for each team member s competence.
this estimator isreferred to as a team member s competence score comp i .
task difficulty of all tasks figure the distribution of task difficulty values.it is computed using the brsext method as follows comp i i i i where iand iare calculated as i summationdisplay i i summationdisplay i equals to if condition is true.
otherwise equals to .
in essence irepresents the total number of tasks that have been completed on time with sat isfactory quality by a team member i whereas irepresents the total number of tasks that have not been completed ontime or with unsatisfactory quality by the team member i. in this way comp ican be interpreted as the probability of icompleting a given task on time with satisfactory quality.comp i where indicates that iis completely incompetent and indicates that iis completely competent.

results and discussions with the dataset on participants task allocation decisions collected we adopt the exploratory data analysis eda approach to understand whether new insight into noviceagile teams task allocation behavior can be derived.
edais an approach to summarize the main characteristics of adataset.
specifically we investigate three aspects of task al location decision making which traditional interview surveybased studies have difficulty investigating.
they are how team members competence influences their workload how team members competence influences their confi dence on tasks with various difficulty values and howteam members competence influences the timeliness of com pleting tasks with different difficulty values.
in this section we discuss the analysis results.

competence and workload at the end of the study participants were asked to state the approaches adopted by their teams when determining how to distribute tasks among team members.
the teamscan be divided into those who adopted a competence based approach ca and those who adopted an equality based approach ea .
teams who reported that they allocated tasks evenly among team members are classified under theea group while those who reported that they attemptedto allocate more tasks to more capable team members areclassified under the ca group.
since the team members competence scores were computed after the study was fin ished participants in the ca group did not have access tothis information and relied on their own experience to de termine each others competence.
the ca group consists of58 people while the ea group consists of people.
thepercentage distributions of participants with different com petence scores for the ca and the ea groups are illustratedinfigure3.
itcanbeobservedthatthetwogroupsconsistofmembers with similar competence score distributions.
theca and ea approaches allow the teams to make relativelysimple trade offs between team members competence andthe fairness of task distribution.
this helped the teams tosimplify their discussions about task allocation during sprintplanning meetings.
figure a and figure c illustrate the total workload over the weeks for team members in the ca and eagroup respectively against their competence scores.
the to tal workload is measured by the number of tasks allocat ed to each individual.
the pearson correlation coefficient pcc between team members total workload values andcompetence scores under ca is .
indicating that morecompetent members tend to be assigned more task whilethat under ea is only .
indicating almost no correlationbetween team members competence and their workload.
the average number of tasks per individual with different competence scores during each week of the courseworkunder ca and ea are plotted in figure b and figure4 d respectively.
it can be observed from figure b thatinitially in week and week there were two prominentpeaks coinciding with participants with competence scoresaround .
and .
.
at this time when the team memberswere not yet familiar with each other they relied on teammembers self reported competence to direct task allocationdecisions.
as the team members became more familiar witheach other over the weeks especially with the help of sprintretrospective meetings during which team members perfor692mance were assessed more workload was being assigned to team members with higher competence.
as participants didnot use any systematic method to keep track of their com petence scores the workload distributions are not monoton ically increasing with competence scores.
from figure d it can be seen that for ea teams the task distributions re main relatively unchanged over the eight week period of thestudy.
the average number of tasks per person under ea is0.

in this fig ure the x axis represents the value of comp i diff .
in the dataset no task was rated by participants as having a difficulty valueof .
thus comp i diff .
ifcomp i diff it means that an asd team member iis assigned a task with a normalized difficulty value lower than i s competence score.

ifcomp i diff iis assigned a task with a normalized difficulty value higher than or equal toi s competence score.
in this case iis less likely to be able to complete this task on time with satisfactory quality.from figure a it can be observed that when comp i diff the pcc value between the estimated required time and comp i diff is .
which indicates a significant negative correlation.
the average estimated required time is .
days.the higher the value of comp i diff the shorter the estimated required time.
however whencomp i diff the pcc value between the estimated required time andcomp i diff is reduced significant to .

the average estimated required time also increases significantly to .
days.
to investigate the effect of thecomp i diff value on the timeliness of completing tasks i.e.
whether tasks are completedbefore the estimated required time we use another metric t h eearly completion days.
it is the difference between theestimated number of days required and the actual numberof days used to complete a given task i.e.

conclusions and future work as apm tools are increasingly adopted by asd teams they offer researchers a new source of unobtrusively collect ed behavior data that provide insight into the characteristic s and effects of decision making which cannot be extractedfrom traditional survey and interview based study methods.through a study involving student participants over 8weeks with the proposed hase apm tool we demonstratethe scientific research potential of apm tools.
this mannerof data collection occurs during normal usage of the apmtool and does not introduce additional overhead to the asdteams.
in addition as team members are not put into aformal situation in which they know they are being studied the behavior patterns captured by such data is more likelyto reflect their real behavior.
through this study we discov ered effects of novice asd team members competence andthe difficulty of the tasks assigned to them on their workloadvariation their confidence and the timeliness of completionof these tasks.
the findings based on unobtrusively collect ed behavior data from apm tools are quantitative in natureand can help future research construct computational taskallocationdecisionmodelsusefulforbuildingautomatedas d task allocation decision support systems.
in future we plan to enhance the hase platform to enable more detailed and larger scale studies about other im portant aspects of the asd process to be effectively carriedout.
with more in depth understanding of the characteris ticsanddynamicsoftaskallocationdecision makinginase we aim to design situation aware decision support system s to help asd teams make more efficiently task allocationdecisions with global consideration.
