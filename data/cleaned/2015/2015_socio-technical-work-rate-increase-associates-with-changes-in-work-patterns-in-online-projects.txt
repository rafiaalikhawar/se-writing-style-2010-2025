socio technical work rate increase associates with changes in work patterns in online projects farhana sarker university of california davis fasarker ucdavis.edubogdan v asilescu carnegie mellon university vasilescu cmu.edukelly blincoe university of auckland k.blincoe auckland.ac.nzvladimir filkov university of california davis vfilkov ucdavis.edu abstract software developers work on a variety of tasks ranging from the technical e.g.
writing code to the social e.g.
participating in issue resolution discussions.
the amount of work developers perform per week their work rate also varies and depends on project needs and developer schedules.
prior work has shown that while moderate levels of increased technical work and multitasking lead to higher productivity beyond a certain threshold they can lead to lowered performance.
here we study how increases in the short term work rate along both the technical and social dimensions are associated with changes in developers work patterns in particular communication sentiment technical productivity and social productivity.
we surveyed active and prolific developers on github to understand the causes and impacts of increased work rates.
guided by the responses we developed regression models to study how communication and committing patterns change with increased work rates and fit those models to large scale data gathered from traces left by thousands of github developers.
from our survey and models we find that most developers do experience work rate increase related changes in behavior .
most notably our models show that there is a sizable effect when developers comment much more than their average the negative sentiment in their comments increases suggesting an increased level of stress.
our models also show that committing patterns do not change with increased commenting and vice versa suggesting that technical and social activities tend not to be multitasked.
i. i ntroduction software developers who work in distributed online projects often work on a variety of tasks .
some of those are technical like coding testing and documenting code.
others are of the coordinating or social variety like commenting on issues agreeing on directions responding to calls for bug fixing etc.
both kinds of tasks are essential in healthy multi developer software projects and they both count toward the work done per unit of time or work rate of developers.
it is well known that if the developer work rate gets too high it can contribute to work related stress and lead to negative effects .

clearly the developer s contribution rates can frequently exceed standard deviation above the developer s average contribution rates in both commits and comments.
in general keeping the work rate in the safe zone can result in healthier work environments and happier individuals and teams.
awareness of historical work rates can help ensure work rates do not reach unsafe levels.

traditional lines per day measures of work aggregate to an extent the work rate of technical tasks.
while coordination tasks figure in there too by association it is not simple to unravel their contribution to those measures .
this is more so during some development stages especially at early stages in the development of a feature when coordination tasks may dominate a developer s time compared to at other stages where development and testing dominate.
in addition many developers work on multiple projects at a time and the tasks related to the context switching overhead incurred contribute to their aggregate work rates .
prior work has shown that multitasking has significant costs and may result in lowered technical performance if a work rate threshold is crossed mainly due to patterns in the task switching overhead .
that work did not consider the multiple components involved in one s work it only considered technical activity within multitasking developers projects.
thus the many different tasks and the number of projects in which developers are involved should all be considered when calculating their work rates.
knowing how the different work rate dimensions interact and associate with observable developer work behavior can aid in recognizing when the work rates indicate overload and or may affect others.
this knowledge can enable people to ameliorate or even preempt such situations.
so given that developers multitask on at least two types of tasks technical and coordination and experience varied rates of work in what observable ways does their behavior change as their work rates increase?
and how can we use such data to model work patterns indicative of workrate related overload in software developers?

here we study how developers communication and committing behaviors change with significant work rate increase.
given a large enough set of developers commit and communication traces the work rates should form a smooth distribution enabling analysis of its tails for any sizable sample of developers.
our thesis is that the effects of work rate changes over time may be identifiable from large amounts of longitudinal trace data of the variety of social and technical activities undertaken by developers.
while different developers may have different steady average work rates significant increases in the work rates compared to their average rates can observably modify their work behavior.
to show that we undertake a mixed methods qualitative and quantitative study.
first we conducted a survey of github developers to characterize the ways in which developers change their work behavior in response to increased technical and social work rates as well as the self identified determinants of those reactions.
the survey helped us identify relevant variables characterizing developers actions in both the technical and social dimensions.
those included weekly commit and comment numbers comment types discussion and code review comment text length and sentiment positive negative and neutral as well as measures of contextswitching overhead identified in prior studies .
then using a dataset of developer trace data from a large number of github projects we built regression models over the above variables to determine how communication and committing behaviors change in response to work rates that are higher than expected for each developer.
we found the following many developers responded that they experience workrate related stress and deal with it in various ways.
there is a long tail in both the normalized commit and comment rate distributions indicating that there are morethan expected number of weeks when developers have much higher than average work rates.
notably we find that when the number of comments increases significantly above a developer s average the developer s negative comments on average increase as well indicating an increased level of stress.
interestingly we found that committing activities are not affected by increases in communication work rate and vice versa for commenting activities suggesting mutual independence between them.
ii.
t heory and research questions in this section we review relevant theories and prior work on effects of high work rates and workload and the associated stress on developer performance and we develop our research questions.
our work fits in the broader context of behavioral software engineering .
a. social coding pressures developing software has always been a stressful activity e.g.
because of constantly changing requirements increasing user demands for agility market pressure unstable technology and breaking changes just to name a few.

social coding environment like github several additional factors may contribute to creating a more stressful environment.
social coding sites like github connect developers from around the world into a fast paced around the sun development environment enabling more online communication and coordination.
a plethora of online communication media including social media are being used by software developers in their daily work among the top channels for discussing development activities are code hosting sites e.g.
discussions on pull requests and issues private and public chats private discussions email and discussion groups .
still despite the benefit of instant communication regardless of distance or time such quick methods of communication can lead to communication overload which has been associated with stress and diminishing productivity .
communication load accumulates through the increasing number of messages sent and received over online communication tools like email and social media.
in social coding communication load increases still through the constant stream of pull requests and issues which generate additional discussion.
as social expectations often urge users to respond to messages within a socially acceptable timeframe to prevent negative feelings from communicating partners users may develop a sense of social pressure to be constantly available in order to respond to their messages on time .
in open source development unresponsiveness from project maintainers to pull requests by newcomers can negatively affect the latter s motivation and engagement with the project .
reinecke et al.
found that the social pressure to respond to online messages leads to high levels of internet multitasking users concurrently respond to online messages while engaging in other activities and communication overload both of which are associated with burnout and anxiety .
studies of communication overload in the workplace also show that people with stronger perceived notions of communication overload are likelier to experience burnout and to be less productive .
also related is the perception that contributing to opensource projects on github is like being onstage .
because of the high transparency of everyone s actions enabled by public github profiles active users experience a clear awareness of the audience for their actions which influences how they behave.
github profiles are also used as signaling authorized licensed use limited to lahore univ of management sciences.

mechanisms .
users contributors and maintainers of open source inside the platform and potential employers outside the platform all rely on signals extracted from github activity traces to make rich inferences about github participants and the quality of their work.
the signaling value of github activity traces to different stakeholders characteristic of social coding environments creates incentives for people to be more active than otherwise and potentially more stressed.
another dimension of social coding stress comes from the interconnected nature of modern oss work.
as more code becomes available and is being reused projects tend to form complex networks of interdependencies i.e.
ecosystems in which local changes can generate network effects and stress downstream.
e.g.
prior work has found that in such environments issue reports often get tangled and breaking changes induce costs on users downstream .
the signaling value of high levels of github activity and interconnected nature of modern day oss development create an environment ripe for people to multitask and switch focus often between different projects and activity types .
yet context switching between tasks incurs cognitive switching costs for interrupting one task and resuming another .
when switching costs are high multitasking leads to mental congestion and decreased productivity workers become overloaded increasingly slower and error prone .
past studies have found that work related stress is a growing problem for knowledge workers .
software developers are a subset of this population of people who think for a living .
kristensen identified six job characteristics that influence stress control or influence predictability social support meaning demands and reward .
the demands of a job are related to both the amount and difficulty of tasks which associate with the work rate of an employee.
galbraith argued that organizational culture also influences the stresslevels of employees .
mark et al.
also found that work interruptions lead to higher stress .
other studies considered the impact of stress on knowledge workers finding that stress can cause physical illnesses .
here we focus on work rate increase as a stressor in software developers.
b. our research questions the discussion above suggests that modern open source software development especially on social coding platforms like github is a high workload high work rate high stress environment.
high levels of activity may provide signaling benefits and opportunities to engage in multiple activities arise naturally and constantly as open source grows.
yet attending to high volumes of issues and pull requests can be overwhelming switching focus too much can be costly and being constantly onstage can be draining.
we adopt a socio technical view of open source software development on github to study how operating in a highworkload high work rate high stress environment impacts developer performance along two dimensions discussions around code and issues and commits to repositories.
while prior research on software development productivityhas focused mostly on technical contributions to projects the social aspects of development are just as important.
online communication is an essential part of software development and the frequency and social transparency that it imposes may cause social pressure as discussed above.
we hypothesize that high increases in work rate along both dimensions are associated with abnormal work patterns which could indicate stress.
in turn high stress could affect developers linguistic patterns and committing commenting behaviors on github.
first we examine the perceptions of developers on workrelated stress and social pressure rq what are the perceived causes and impacts of stress and social pressure?
guided by the rq1 results we investigate divergence from regular work patterns along both dimensions rq how prevalent are higher than average rates of commit and communication activities?
how prevalent are they per individual?
then we model the effects of increased workload on developers work patterns along each dimension rq what are the covariates of increased work activities that associate with negative or increased communication?
rq what are the covariates of increased work activities that associate with a higher number of commits?
iii.
m ethodology we used a mixed methods approach with a sequential exploratory strategy .
to inform our understanding of the causes of social pressure and stress on github we first surveyed a set of active and prolific developers on github.
based on the responses we analyzed github activity data via regression modeling to model changes in developers work patterns in terms of technical and social work rates.
a. github developer dataset for both our survey and trace data analysis we used the january 1st database dump provided by ghtorrent .
we first merged aliases of each existing developer into a single account using a set of heuristics such as merging aliases with the same email address .
we then chose to consider only active and prolific developers to ensure that the developers who we contacted for the survey were still active and experienced enough to give us reliable responses and also to ensure that we would have enough developer activity data to conduct a thorough and meaningful empirical analysis of the variance around developers mean levels of activity.
consequently we chose a subset of developers who have a span of at least years between their first and last commits and who made at least commits to at least distinct non forked existing repositories a definition of active and prolific developers that we adopted from prior work on data from ghtorrent .
to filter out rewritten commit histories with potentially incorrect timestamps we considered only commits made between the year github went online and january 1st the last date of the dump .
our final dataset consisted of developers.
.
of them had at least aliases and the maximum number of aliases for a single developer was .

b. qualitative analysis survey to develop our survey a pilot survey was sent to randomly selected developers from a set of prolific developers from a ghtorrent database dump.
we filtered the developers similarly as in section iii a. the pilot survey obtained responses a response rate .
it contained many open ended questions and some closed set questions where participants could also write in their own responses.
some sample open ended questions that we asked in the pilot survey include how do you become aware of the stress of others on your team?
in what ways are you impacted by the stress of others on your team?
what causes you work related stress?
what do you do to try to reduce your stress?
the closed set responses were developed from findings of previous work but we allowed participants to provide their own responses so that we could develop a more comprehensive survey.
using the responses to these open ended questions and the write in responses we used thematic content analysis to identify a closed set of options for each question in our final survey to allow participants to rate each item using a likert scale.
the thematic content analysis of the pilot survey data was done by one of the authors of this paper together with a clinical psychologist.
it allowed us to create a list of options for these questions in the final version of our survey.
for example one participant in the pilot survey said that a cause of work related stress was the feeling of being behind on work especially if i have verbally offered to do that work.
this and similar responses resulted in having time pressure as a response option to this question in our final survey.
the final set of options for each question is shown in the figures which summarize the results for each question in section iv.
for all questions with a closed set of responses we also allowed participants to select other and write in their own response.
we sent the final survey to github users randomly selected from the set of prolific developers described in sec.
iii a. we obtained responses a response rate .
all questions were optional.
the survey included multiplechoice and likert scale questions.
we asked the developers questions related to work related stress and work related social pressure.
respondents were asked to only consider the github projects they currently contribute to when answering all questions.
participants had an average of years of development experience and years of experience with github.
c. quantitative analysis online activity trace data we conducted a quantitative analysis on the technical and social trace activity of developers randomly selected from the set of developers described in section iii a. before selecting the developers we first searched for keywords like build auto exporter and bot within users names logins and emails in order to find and remove bots and their activity.
after manually inspecting the search results we removed users that were obviously bots.
the bots had contributed about comments and about commits.
measuring technical activity we consider commits as indicators and measures of technical contributions.
here weconsider commits made between and to non forked existing repositories.
the developers in our dataset contributed a total of commits to repositories.
measuring social activity social activity within repositories on github exists mainly in two forms discussion comments and code review comments .
discussion comments exist on issues and pull requests.
code review comments exist on commits which may be associated with pull requests or not.
code review comments differ from discussion comments in that a code review comment is made on specific lines of code within a git diff whereas a discussion comment is made within a single thread that is associated with either an issue or pull request.
code review comments made on individual commits not associated with pull requests have the additional option of being made on the entire commit rather than on specific lines within the git diff.
we consider all discussion and code review comments as developers social activity.
to retrieve comments we queried both ghtorrent s public mongodb database and the github api as some data was missing from the mongodb database .
from ghtorrent s mongodb database we retrieved about of all developers comments.
we then queried the github api using the pygithub python library to retrieve the remainder of the comments raising our percentage of retrieved comments to about .
.
the rest of the comments appeared to have been deleted.
furthermore we filtered the comments to take only those made between and to non forked existing repositories.
in total our final comment dataset consisted of comments made to repositories.
the distribution of comment types are as follows .
discussion comments made on issues .
discussion comments made on pull requests .
code review comments made on commits within pull requests and .
code review comments made on commits not associated with pull requests.
sentiment analysis of developers comments sentiment analysis has often been used to study the emotional polarity of pieces of text within the software engineering domain .
we use the sentiment of a comment as one method of measuring developers feelings potential stress.
well known sentiment analysis tools are often trained on social media corpora making them unsuited for classifying text within the software engineering domain .
comments made on social media outlets like twitter are not representative of developers technical conversations and tools that are built on top of such corpora are known to misclassify software engineering text.
in fact a study of the effects of common off the shelf tools like nltk sentistrength alchemy and stanford nlp on technical text show that their classifications of software engineering text tend to disagree with human labeled sentiments and also tend to disagree with each other .
further studies show that existing tools tend to have an unrepresentative negative bias when classifying technical texts since some technical phrases such as kill a process and create a patch have negative connotations in layman terms .
so we found it necessary to explore tools that are better suited to the software engineering domain.

there are few existing software engineering specific sentiment analysis tools .
out of those we chose to use senti4sd a post level sentiment classifier that is trained on a set of about stack overflow posts manuallyannotated by a group of trained computer science students.
to compute the sentiment of a post senti4sd extracts a series of features including lexicon based features number of tokens with positive negative polarity number of positive negative emoticons presence of exclamation marks etc.
keywordbased features number of uni grams and bi grams number of elongated words number of uppercase words number of slang expressions like lol that represent laughter etc.
and semantic based features cosine similarity between post and prototype polarity vectors .
these features were developed using polarity assignments within the sentistrength lexicon .
furthermore the semantic based features derive word meanings from a distributional semantic model built on million stack overflow comments questions and answers.
these extensive strategies for feature extraction allow senti4sd to significantly reduce the amount of text that is misclassified as negative compared to other tools .
senti4sd has a slight disadvantage in that long posts can be misclassified if they contain higher distributions of excessive words whose calculated polarities do not convey the overall sentiment of the post .
to combat the effect of comment length on sentiment classification we first preprocessed comments by removing portions that were not likely to contribute to the overall sentiment such as code snippets html tags and urls as well as non ascii characters.
we removed code snippets by using regular expressions to locate sections of comments surrounded by single or triple backticks which users can use to highlight code segments within their comments.
we also used regular expressions to locate and remove html tags and urls.
furthermore we removed inline
