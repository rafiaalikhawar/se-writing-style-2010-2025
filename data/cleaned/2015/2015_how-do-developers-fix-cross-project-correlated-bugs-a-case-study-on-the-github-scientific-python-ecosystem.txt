a case study on the github scientific python ecosystem wanwangying ma lin chen xiangyu zhang yuming zhou baowen xu state key laboratory for novel software t echnology department of computer science nanjing university china purdue university usa wwyma smail.nju.edu.cn lchen zhouyuming bwxu nju.edu.cn xyzhang cs.purdue.edu abstract github a popular social software development platform has fostered a variety of software ecosystems where projects depend on one another and practitioners interact with each other.
projects within an ecosystem often have complex inter dependencies that impose new challenges in bug reporting and fixing.
in this paper we conduct an empirical study on cross project correlated bugs i.e.
causally related bugs reported to different projects focusing on two aspects how developers track the root causes across projects and how the downstream developers coordinate to deal with upstream bugs.
through manual inspection of bug reports collected from the scientific python ecosystem and an online survey with developers this study reveals the common practices of developers and the various factors in fixing crossproject bugs.
these findings pr ovide implications for future software bug analysis in the scope of ecosystem as well as shed light on the requirements of issue trackers for such bugs.
keywords github ecosystems cr oss project correlated bugs root causes tracking coordinate i. i ntroduction github currently the largest c ode repository in the open source world provides a convenient way for software practitioners to collaborate and share code with one another .
benefiting from its social coding capabilities software development on github has evolved from a single project to socio technical ecosystems w ithin which complementary applications and services are co developed.
they also coevolve through the dependenci es between projects and the interactions between practitioners.
since github provides an issue tracking system for repositories to report and discuss bugs and other issues the relations within a github ecosystem are very likely to be reflected in the issues reported to various project s located in the ecosystem.
consider the following example.
a performance issue with id was reported to astropy .
after inspecting this issue an astropy developer found that the cause of the bug might root in its upstream project numpy .
then another developer who had contributed to both numpy and astropy pointed out that a numpy issue with id might be related.
the two developers then took part in the discussion of the numpy issue and sent a test case to numpy .
with the help of astropy developers the numpy bug was fixed and finally closed after confirming that the test passed and the astropy issue was resolved.
fig.
shows the fixing process of this pair of bugs.
we call the two causally related issues reported to different projects cross project correlated bugs .
figure .
the fixing process of cross project correlated bugs.
the above example is not uncommonly seen in practice.
with the popularity of github and the development of github ecosystems cross proj ect correlated bugs are increasingly important.
new projects and practitioners joining github often bring in new interactions within ecosystems which may cause th e ramifications of a bug to include more other projects resulting in more cross project correlated bugs.
this phenomenon is confirmed by the responses of an online survey which we have conducted to investigate how developers view and deal with cross project bugs described in section iii.c .
the results show that an average of .
of the bugs that the respondents have encountered are cross project ones.
compared with traditional i.e.
within project and isolated bugs over half of the participants believe that cross project bugs attract more concerns and cost more effort to deal with.
in addition though half of the respondents suggest that the severity of bug impact depends on multiple factors .
of the respondents still consider cross project bugs generally more severe than within project ones.

apart from the survey results we also used the wilcoxon rank sum test to statistically compare the fixing time number of comments and number of participants between cross project and within project bugs in seven python projects.
the results listed in table i show that the three values of cross project bugs are significantly higher in most cases implying that fixing cross project bugs requires more effort.
the survey responses and the statistical comparisons indicate that this emerging type of bug deserves more attention and investigation due to their significant quantity severe impact and difficulty in fixing.
the practices for repairing bugs have been studied for years.
aranda and venolia identified the common bug fixing coordination patterns guo et al.
investigated factors that affected which bug could be fix and characterized the bug reassignment process br eu et al.
highlighted the importance of effectively and efficiently engaging user community in bug fixing activities .
these researches focused on the fixing process of within project bugs.
however little work has investigated how developers fix cross project bugs especially what they do to deal with the following two challenges cross project root cause tracking as the bug carries over from one project to another it becomes harder to trace the b ug back to its root and fixing coordination while waiting for an upstream fix the downstream developers need to coordinate their project with the upstream one in order to minimize any undesirable impact of the upstream bug on their project.
the two challenges which are not encountered in fixing within project bugs lead to high complexity in cross project bug tracking and repair.
since there is a lack of empirical evidence in these asp ects this study aims to investigate how developers deal with cross project correlated bugs especially when facing the two challenges.
we base our study on the scientific python ecosystem one of the most prominent ecosystems on github .
combining the manual inspection of pairs of bugs and an online survey we have two main findings.
first stack traces communication with upstream developers and familiarity with the involving projects are three main factors helpful fo r cross project root cause tracking.
second in spite of the extra maintenance burden proposing a version dependent workaround i.e.
a temporary and local solution is the most common practice of the downstream developers while waiting for an upstream fix.
the rest of the paper is organized as follows.
section ii describes related work.
section iii presents our research methodology and section iv shows our empirical results.
we present further discussion on our findings in section v and examine threats to validity in section vi.
finally section vii concludes this paper.
ii.
r elated work a. practices for fixing bugs a number of literatures have investigated the developers practices for fixing bugs by analyzing bug reports.
aranda and venolia used a combination of case studies and a survey of software professionals to investigate coordination activities during bug fixing.
guo et al.
described how the chances of fixing a bug was influenced by people s reputations bug report edit activities and geographical and organizational relationships.
later guo et al.
continued to analyze the bug reassignment process in windows vista and classified five primary re asons for reassignment.
breu et al.
found that active and ongoing participation of reporters was beneficial for a quick bug fix.
zimmermann et al.
characterized the bug reopen process using a mixedmethod approach and quantitativel y assessed the impact of various factors.
these research es investigated how people communicated and coordinated to fix within project bugs.
our study is different from them since we focus on the fixing process of cross project bugs which is significantly different from repairing within project ones.
as for cross project bugs ca nfora et al.
investigated cross system bug fixings csbfs in freebsd and openbsd kernels and associated their occurrences to social characteristics of contributors using social network analysis.
their study paid attention to the identification of csbfs from commits and the comp arison of the roles of contributors involved and not involved in csbfs.
however our work aims at the developers common practices of fixing cross project bugs in github ecosystems which have not been analyzed in previous work.
b. e volution of software ecosystems software ecosystems are a new and rapidly evolving phenomenon in the field of software engineering.
early analysis on software ecosystems mainly focus on defining the field and its limits .
in this study we consider a software ecosystem as a coll ection of software projects which are developed and evolve together in the same environment .
recently a number of researchers have turned their eyes to the evolution of software ecosystems.
hora et al.
observed api evolution and its impact on pharo ecosystem as well as analyzed how developers reacted to api changes.
robbes et al.
investigated the ripple effects of api deprecations across a smalltalk ecosystem.
bavota et al.
analyzed the evolution of project inter dependencies in the java subset of the apache ecosystem.
decan et al.
studied the development of the r ecosystem on four repositories.
they then furt her concentrated on interrepository package dependency problems discussing how github influenced the r ecosystem .
though these studies help researchers and software practitioners to gain a deep understanding of software ecosystems few existing literatures have investigated the relationship between bugs in different projects which also reflects the evolution of a so ftware ecosystem.
our study makes a step towards this topic.
c. collaboration in github github as the most popular web based software repository has attracted increasing attention from researchers during the last th ree years.
due to its prominent feature of social coding and pull based model a large number of research works on github emphasize its social media and the collaboration between developers authorized licensed use limited to lahore univ of management sciences.

.
dabbish et al.
exam ined the collaborative utility of activity transparency based on a series of in depth interviews with central and peripheral github users.
tsay et al.
quantitatively analyzed how various technical and social measures were used to evaluate contributions in open source projects.
gousios et al.
studied the practices and challenges in pull based devel opment from the perspectives of the integrators and the contributors .
our study also pays attention to the collaboration between github developers.
however we concentrate on a specific aspect cross project bug fixing which inherently involves the coordination between projects.
iii.
r esearch methodology in this section we first describe the identification of cross project correlated bugs in github ecosystems.
then we introduce the ecosystem and main projects under investigation.
finally we present the research questions of our study and the corresponding research methods.
a. identification of cross project correlated bugs github provides an issue tracking system for projects to record and follow the progress of any problem that their developers and users encounter during development maintenance or use .
an issue could be a bug a requested feature a task a missing documentation or even a question.
in this study we only focus on bugs that are faults in computer programs or systems causing the programs systems to produce an incorrect or unexpected result or to behave in unintended ways.
most github projects use labels attached to an issue report to mark the different types of issues such as defect documentation and enhancement in scipy .
thus bugs in this paper only refer to the issues labeled with bug and its synonyms.
in this study we define cross project correlated bugs in github ecosystems as follows they are a pair of issues reported to two inter dependent projects located within the same ecosystem at least one of them is a bug an issue report refers to another report and one of the issues is the root cause of the other one.
in a github issue report there are two kinds of
