message from the workshop chairs of icse it is our great pleasure to welcome you to the workshops tra ck of the 41st international conference on software engineering!
the workshops at icse provide a forum for groups of participants to discus s topics in software engineering research and practi ce.
icse workshops serve as incu bators for scientific communities that form and share a particular research agen da.
icse workshops also provide opportunities for researchers to exchange and discuss scientific and engineering ideas at an early stage bef ore they have matured to warrant conference or journal publication.
this year we received works hop proposal submissions a re cord for the icse conferen ce series!
each proposal was reviewed by three members of our program committee and furt her assessed in the online discussion phase.
the program committee accepted one day and two day work shops which cover interesting and novel topics in software engineering and rela ted disciplines.
four of the ac cepted workshops have been formed by combining pairs of workshop proposals with significant overlap a proces s that strengthened the original proposals even further.
w e a r e e x c i t e d a t t h e v a r i e t y o f t o p i c s o f f e r e d r a n g i n g f r o m traditional to hot new trends and involving multidisciplinary aspects.
we ho pe that the workshop program wi ll help to advance the state of software engineering research and practice by stimulating new collaborations and for ging new research communities.
it has been a privilege working with the program committee and with each othe r across multiple time zones towards putting this program together.
