arcand westerdals.no abstract what is the impact of software engineering research on current practices in industry?
in this paper i report on my direct experience as a phd post doc working in software engineering research projects and then spending the following five years as an engineer in twodifferentcompanies thefirst onebeing thesame iworked in collaboration with during my post doc .
given a background in software engineering research what cutting edge techniques and toolsfromacademiadidiuseinmydailyworkwhendeveloping andtestingthesystems ofthesecompanies?regardingvalidation and verification my mainarea of research the answer israther short asfarasicantell onlyfindbugs.inthispaper ireporton whythiswasthecase anddiscussallthechallenging complexopen problems we face in industry and which somehow are neglected intheacademiccircles.inparticular iwillfirstdiscusswhatactual toolsicoulduseinmydailywork suchasjacocoandselenium.
