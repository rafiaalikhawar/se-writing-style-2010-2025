introduction intuitive elegant graphical user interfaces guis embodying effective user experience ux and user interface ui design principles are essential to the success of mobile apps.

giventheimportanceofaproperuser interfaceanduserexperience for mobile apps development usually begins with ui ux design experts creating highly detailed mock ups of app screens using one of several different prototyping techniques .
the most popular of these techniques and the focus of this paper isreferred to as mock up driven development where a designer or group of designers creates pixel perfect representations of app uisusing softwaresuch assketch or photoshop .once the designartifacts or mock ups arecompleted theyarehandedoff todevelopmentteamswhoareresponsibleforimplementingthe designsincodeforatargetplatform.inorderforthedesignenvisioned by the ui ux experts who carry domain knowledge that front end developers may lack to be properly transferred to users an accurate translation of the mock up to code is essential.

material design and iv the need for custom components and layouts to support complex design mock ups.
thus there is a practical need for effective automated support to improve the process of detecting and reporting design violations and providing developers with more accurate and actionable information.
the difficulty that developers experience in creating effective guis stems from the need to manually bridge a staggering abstractiongapthatinvolvesreasoningconciseandaccurateuicodefrom pixel based graphical representations of guis.
the gui errors that are introduced when attempting to bridge this gap are known in literatureas presentationfailures .presentationfailureshavebeen definedinthecontextofwebapplicationsinpreviousworkas a discrepancy betweenthe actual appearanceof a webpage or mobile app screen and its intended appearance .
we take previous innovative work that aims to detect presentation errors in web applications as motivation to design equally effective approaches in the domain of mobile apps.
presentation failures are typically comprised of several visual symptoms or specific mismatches between visual facets ofthe intended gui design and the implementation of those gui components in an app.
these visual symptoms can vary in type and frequency depending on the domain e.g.
webvs.mobile andinthecontextofmock updriven development we define them as design violations .
inthispaper wepresentanapproach calledgvt guiverification system developed in close collaboration with huawei.
our approach is capable of automated precise reporting of the design violations that induce presentation failures between an app mockupanditsimplementation.ourtechniquedecodesthehierarchal structure present in both mockups and dynamic representations ofappguis effectivelymatchingthecorrespondingcomponents.

second we conducted a user study to measure the usefulness of our tool comparing gvt s ability to detect and report design violations to the ability of developers while also measuring the perceived utility of gvt reports.
finally to measure the applicabilityof our approach in an industrial context we present the results of an industrial case study including i findings from a survey senttoindustrialdevelopersanddesignerswhousegvtintheir development workflow and ii semi structured interviews with bothdesignanddevelopmentteammanagersabouttheimpactof thetool.ourfindingsfromthis wide ranging evaluationinclude the following key points i in our study using synthetic violations gvt is able to detect design violations with an overall precision of and recall of ii gvt is able to outperform developerswith android developmentexperience in identifyingdesign violations while taking less time iii developers generally found gvt s reports useful for quickly identifying different types of design violations and iv gvt had a meaningful impact on the design and developmentofmobileappsforourindustrialpartner contributing to increased ui ux quality.

gui components screens.
there are two main logical constructs that define the concept of the gui of an app guicomponents or gui widgets and screens.agui component is a discrete object with a set of attributes such as size and locationamong others associated with a particular screenof an app.
a screenis an invisible canvas of size corresponding to the physicalscreendimensionsofamobiledevice.wedefinetwotypesof screens those createdbydesignersusing professional gradetools like sketch and those collected from implemented apps at runtime.
each of these two types of screens has an associated set of guicomponents or components .
each set of components associated with a screen is structured as a cumulative hierarchy comprising a treestructure startingwithasinglerootnode wherethespatial layout of parent always encompasses contained child components.

industrial problem origins atypicalindustrialmobiledevelopmentprocessincludesthefollowing steps as confirmed by our collaborators at huawei i first a team of designers creates highly detailed mockups of anapp s screens using the sketch or similar prototyping software.
these mock ups are typically pixel perfect representations of the app for a given screen dimension ii the mock ups are then handed off to developers in the form of exported images with designer added annotations stipulating spatial information and constraints.developersusethisinformationtoimplementrepresentations of the guis for android using a combination of javaand xml iii next after the initial version of the app has been implemented compiled android application package s i.e.
apks aresentbacktothedesignerswhotheninstalltheseappsontarget devices generate screenshots for the screens in question and manually search for discrepancies compared to the original mock ups iv once the set of violations are identified these are communicatedbacktothedevelopersviatextualdescriptionsandannotated screenshots at the cost of significant manual effort from the design teams.
developers must then identify and resolve the dvsusing thisinformation.theprocessisoftenrepeatedinseveraliterations causing substantial delays in the development process.
the goal of our work is to drastically improve this iterative process by i automating the identification of dvson the screens of mobile apps saving both the design and development teams timeandeffort and ii providinghighlyaccurateinformationto thedevelopersregardingthese dvsintheformofdetailedreportsin order to reduce their effort in resolving the problem.

the contextof this studyiscomprisedofasetof71representativemobileappmockup and implementation screen pairs from more than different internalapps annotatedbydesignteamsfromourindustrialpartner to highlight specific instances of resolved dvs .
this set of screen pairs was specifically selected by the industrial design team tobe representative both in terms of diversity and distribution of violations that typically occur during the development process.
inordertodevelopataxonomyanddistributionoftheviolations presentinthisdataset weimplementanopencodingmethodology consistent with constructivist grounded theory .
following the advice of recent work within the se community we stipulate our specific implementation of this type of grounded theory while discussing our deviations from the methods in the literature.

the study addressed the following research question what are the differenttypesanddistributionsofguidesignviolationsthatoccur during industrial mobile app development processes?
during the initial coding process three of the authors were sent the full set of screen pairs and were asked to code four pieces of informationforeachexample i ageneralcategoryfortheviolation ii aspecificdescriptionoftheviolation iii theseverityof the violation if applicable and iv the android gctypes affected e.g.

finally we performed a second round of coding that combined the concepts of focused and axial coding as described in .duringthisroundtwooftheauthorsmergedtheresponses from all three types of coding information where at least two of the three coders agreed.

.
.
grounded theory study results our study revealed three major categories of design violations each with several specific subtypes.
we forgo detailed descriptions and examples of violations due to space limitations but provide examples inour onlineappendix .

non leaf node components typically represent containers that form logical groupings of leaf node components and other containers.in certain cases ourapproximation of using mock up gcsto represent implementation gcsmay not hold.
for instance an icon which should be represented as a single gcmay consist of several mock up gcsrepresenting parts of the icon.
gvt handles such cases in the gui comprehension stage.
.
.
dynamic app gui collection.
in order to compare the the mock up of an app to its implementation gvt must extract gui related meta data from a running android app.
gvt is able to useandroid s uiautomator framework intendedforuitesting to capture xmlfiles and screenshots for a target screen of an app running on a physical device or emulator.
each uiautomator file containsinformationrelatedtotheruntimegui hierarchyofthe target app including the following attributes utilized by gvt i the android component type e.g.

unfortunately the gui hierarchies parsed from both the marketch and uiautomator filestend todifferdramatically dueto severalfactors making tree based gcmatching difficult.
first since the hierarchy constructedusingthemarketchfilesisgeneratedusinginformation from the sketch mock up of app it is using information derived from designers.
while designers have tremendous expertise in constructing visual representations of apps they typically do not take thetimetoconstructprogrammatically orientedgroupingsofcomponents.
furthermore designers are typically not aware of the correct android component types that should be attributed to differentobjectsinamock up.second the uiautomator representation of thegui hierarchy containsthe runtimehierarchal structureof gcsand correct gctypes.
this tree is typically far more complex containingseverallevelsofcontainersgrouping gcstogether which is required for the responsive layouts typical of mobile apps.

asthisinformationcanbeeasily extracted.
as we reported in sec.
the vast majority of dvsaffectsleaf nodecomponents.oncetheleafnodecomponentshave been extracted from each hierarchy gvt employs a k nearestneighbors knn algorithm utilizing a similarity function based onthelocationandsizeofthe gcsinordertoperformmatching.
in this setting an input leaf node component from the mock up wouldbematchedagainstitclosest e.g.

the result is a list of gcsthat should logically correspond to one another corresponding gcs .

.
stage design violation detection in thedesign violation detection stage of the gvt workflow the approach uses a combination of computer vision techniques and heuristiccheckinginordertoeffectivelydetectthedifferentcategories of dvsderived in our taxonomy presented in section .
.
.
perceptual image differencing.
in order to determine corresponding gcswith visual discrepancies gvt uses a technique called perceptual image differencing pid that operates upon the mock up and implementation screenshots.
pid utilizes a model of the human visual system to compare two images and detect visual differences and has been used to successfully identify visual discrepancies in web applications in previous work .
we use this algorithm in conjunction with the gcinformation derived in the previous steps of gvt to achieve accurate violation detection.
for a full description of the algorithm we refer readers to .
the pid algorithm uses several adjustable parameters including fwhichcorrespondstothevisualfieldofviewindegrees l which indicates the luminance or brightness of the image and c which adjusts sensitivity to color differences.
the values used in our implementation are stipulated in section .
.
the output of the pid algorithm is a single difference image fig.
containing differencepixels which arepixels consideredto be perceptuallydifferentbetweenthetwoimages.afterprocessingthe differenceimagegeneratedbypid gvtextractstheimplementationboundingboxforeachcorrespondingpairof gcs andoverlays the box on top of the generated difference image.
it then calculates the number of difference pixels contained within the bounding box where higher numbers of difference pixels indicate potential visual discrepancies.thus gvtcollectsall suspicious gcpairswitha of difference pixels higher than a difference threshold dt.
this set of suspicious components is then passed to the violation manager fig.
so that specific instances of dvscan be detected.
.
.
detecting layout violations.
the first general category of dvsthatgvtdetectsare layoutviolations .accordingthetaxonomy derived in sec.
there are six specific layout dvcategories that relatetotwocomponentproperties i screenlocation i.e.
x y position and ii size i.e.

ifthe width or height of the bounding boxes differ by more than the lt then a layout violation is reported.

.
detecting text violations.
the next general type of dv thatgvtdetectsare textviolations ofwhichtherearethreespecific types i font color ii font style and iii incorrect text content.
these detection strategies are only applied to pairs of text based components as determined by uiautomator information.
to detect font color violations gvt extracts cropped images for each pair of suspicious text components by cropping the mock up andimplementation screenshotsaccording tothe component srespective bounding boxes.
next color quantization cq is applied to accumulate instances of all unique rgb values expressed in the component specificimages.thisquantizationinformationisthen usedtoconstructa colorhistogram ch fig.

finally to detect incorrect text content gvt utilizes the textual information preprocessed to remove whitespace andnormalize letter cases and performs a string comparison.
if the stringsdonotmatch thenan incorrecttextcontent dv isreported.

to perform this analysis cropped images from the mock up and implementation screenshots according to corresponding gcsrespective bounding boxes are extracted.
thegoalofthisanalysisistodeterminewhenthecontentofimagebasedgcsdiffer as opposed to only the colors of the gcsdiffering.
to accomplish this gvt leverages pid applied to extracted gc images converted to a binary color space b pid in order to detect differences in contentand cq and ch analysis to determine differencesincolor sec.

theresultsofthisstudyindicateaweakagreementofdevelopers forthesestatements indicatingthatwhilegvtisgenerallyapplicable there are some drawbacks that prevented developers anddesigners from giving the tool unequivocal support.
we explore these drawbacks by conducting semi structured interviews.
in conducting the interviews one of the authors asked the questionspresentedinfigure7to3managers 2fromui uxteamsand from a front end development team .
when asked whether gvt contributed to an increased quality of mobile applications at the company allthree managerstendedto agreethatthis wasthecase.forinstance oneofthedesignmanagersstated certainlyyes.the tool is the industry s first and the other designer manager added when the page is more complicated the tool is more helpful .
when asked about the overall performance and accuracy of the tool in detecting dvs the manager fromthe implementation team admittedthatthecurrentdetectionperformanceofthetoolisgood but suggested that dynamic detection of some components may improveit stating canbedetectedprettywell... butthetool is not very flexible.
for example a switch component in the designis open but the switch is off in the implementation .
he suggested that properly handling cases such as this would make the tool more useful from a developers perspective.
one of the design team managers held a similar view stating that currently most errors arelayouterrors sotoolisaccurate.staticcomponentsarebasicallydetected maybe the next extension should focus on dynamic authorized licensed use limited to lahore univ of management sciences.

related work webpresentationfailures the work most closely related to our approachareapproachesthataimatdetecting classifyingandfixing presentationfailuresinwebapplications .incomparison to these approaches gvt also performs detection and localization of presentation failures but is the first to do so for mobile apps.
in addition to the engineering challenges associated with building anapproachtodetectpresentationfailuresinthemobiledomain e.g.
collection and processing of gui related data gvt is the first approach to leverage metadata from software mock up artifacts e.g.

these approaches are currently not directly applicable to mock up driven development for mobile apps.visualguitesting aconceptknownasvisualguitesting vgt aimstotestcertainvisualaspectsofasoftwareapplication sgui as well as the underlying functional properties.
to accomplish this visual gui testing usually executes actions on a target applications in order to exercise app functionality .
in contrast to these approaches gvt is designed to apply to mobile specific dvs is tailored for the mock up driven development practice and is aimedonlyat verifying visual properties of a mobile app s gui.
other approaches there are other approaches and techniques that related to identifying problems or differences with guis of mobileapps.xie etal.introducedguide atoolforguidifferencingbetweensuccessivereleasesofguisforanappbymatching componentsbetweengui hierarchies.gvtutilizesamatchingpro cedureforleafnodecomponentsasdirecttreecomparisonsarenot possible in the context of mock up driven development.
there has alsobeenbothcommercialandacademicworkrelatedtographical software built specifically for creating high fidelity mobile app mock ups or mockups that encode information for automated creation of code for a target platform .
however such tools tend to either impose too many restrictions on designers or do not allow for direct creation of code thus dvsstill persist in practice.
