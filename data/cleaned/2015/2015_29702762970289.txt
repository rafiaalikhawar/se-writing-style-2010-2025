the tool uses the stanford natural language parser to extract type dependencies tds and parts of speech tags pos tags of sentences from input use case speci cation ucs .
then it identi es sentence structures using a set of rules framed based on hornby s verb patterns.
with the information of the tds pos tags and the identi ed sentence structures the tool discovers domain elements viz.
domain objects including their attributes and operations and interactions between them it consolidates the domain information as a class diagram as well as a sequence diagram .
an experiment conducted on ucss with two industry experts as subjects showed that the analysis class diagrams generated byanmodeler were remarkably close to those generated by the two industry experts.
being lightweight and easy to use the tool can also be used to assist students and young developers in acquiring object oriented domain modeling skills quickly.

introduction software requirements are normally written in natural language nl to ensure easy communication between di erentstakeholders .
typically the rst step in the model driven development of software is to obtain analysis models i.e.
platform independent models pim by identifying domain objects including their attributes and operations and the relationships between these objects from software requirements.
this process generally requires manual analysis of typically several hundred pages of software speci cations which involves signi cant e ort and time.
moreover the chances of this transformation to be error prone are very high as it involves the understanding of user requirements documented as nl texts and mapping them to pim.
to help the human analysts in developing the domain models semi automated1as well as automated2tools have been proposed in literature .
however the existing semi automated tools are highly dependent on the user skills to identify the domain elements.
the analysis models generated from the existing automated tools are constrained by some serious issues such as i the presence of many incorrectly identi ed classes and relationships ii the absence of many relevant classes and relationships classes and relationships which can be identi ed from the speci cations if the speci cations are thoroughly analysed iii the presence of many redundant classes and relationships.
one may argue here that most of the issues encountered by the existing automated tools can be attributed to the di culties associated with nl processing task.
for instance english language has a variety of sentence types and structures which facilitate the expression of a similar concept in various ways.
accordingly the relevant information may be present at di erent places across multiple sentences.
to deal with such issues anmodeler uses i a rich language model based on hornby s verb patterns that can interpret almost all the simple sentences and a few complex sentences conditional sentences complex sentences involving that clause and conjunctive clause ii a set of domain element extraction rules i.e.
transformation rules which capture semantic relationships between the words of the sentences to correctly extract the relevant domain elements from di erent places in the sentences .

uses the stanford nl parser api to obtain type dependencies tds and parts of speech tags pos tags of each sentence in the speci cation.
it then identi es structures of the sentences.
the identi ed sentence structure and the semantic relationships between the words in the sentence obtained from the tds and pos tags are used by the tool to identify domain elements viz.
domain objects their attributes operations and interactions between the objects.
it nally realizes the identi ed domain objects and their interactions as analysis class diagram and sequence diagram.
an experimental study conducted with the help of subjects and ucss in showed that the analysis class diagrams generated by anmodeler were far more correct far more complete and less redundant than those generated by existing automated tools.
another experiment conducted on ucss with two industry experts as subjects showed that the analysis class diagrams generated by anmodeler were correct complete and redundant.

analysis modeler anmodeler anmodeler is a tool for generating analysis models from textual software requirements which is based on our approaches for generating analysis class diagrams and problem level sequence diagrams .
.
methodology anmodeler works in ve steps figure .
it rst reads the ucs and stores the elements of the ucs into an instance of ucs metamodel that we call ucs instance step .
it parses the sentences in the ucs instance using the stanford nl parser api to generate tds and pos tags step .
it then identi es the structures of the sentences using a comprehensive set of sentence structure rules which are based on hornby s verb patterns step .
then it identi es domain elements domain objects their attributes and operations and interactions between the objects from semantic relationships between the words obtained from tds step .
finally it realizes the identi ed domain elements into classes and relationships which are stored in an instance of a classdiagram metamodel called cd instance and visualizes the class diagram using graphviz step .
with the help of an illustrative example figure shows how anmodeler identi es the domain elements from a sentence in the input speci cation.
.
architecture of anmodeler anmodeler has six main components figure .
.the speci cationreader component provides input interfaces to read software speci cations written in various formats e.g.
ucss simple text etc.
it provides an output interface to store elements read from input speci cations in a common format i.e.
an instance of ucs metamodel shown in figure .
.the sentenceparser component provides an input interface to read the sentences from the ucs instance an instance of ucs metamodel it uses stanford nl parser api to obtain tds and pos tags of the sentence and provides tds and pos tags of the sentence as an output interface.

experimental study results the experimental study presented in which was conducted with the help of subjects and objects i.e.
analysis class diagrams generated by anmodeler for ucss showed that the analysis class diagrams generated by anmodeler were far more correct far more complete and less redundant than those generated by existing automated tools.
we replicated that study in another experiment with two industry experts as subjects.
the experts had more than three years of industry experience in analysis modeling.
the objects were the analysis class diagrams generated by anmodeler for ten ucss selected randomly from ucss used in the previous experiment which were taken from various software engineering books and research works .
we provided the following materials to each industry expert i ve ucss ii the analysis class diagrams generated by anmodeler for each ucs iii questionnaires which were based on the quality metrics for nding correctness completeness and redundancy of the analysis class diagrams presented in .
the data set obtained from the answers to the questionnaires and the quality metrics for correctness completeness and redundancy were then used to obtain the results which are shown in table .

features uses limitations in addition to the generation of analysis class diagrams from textual speci cations anmodeler can also generate other useful artifacts such as i problem level sequence diagrams ii java template code.
the java template code generated by anmodeler realizes the classes with constructors objects initializations and the method calls.
moreover the template code is also realized with branching and looping statements and their nesting identi ed from the objects interactions in the generated sequence diagram.
being lightweight and easy to use the tool can also be used to assist students and young developers in acquiring objectoriented domain modeling skills quickly.
for a given software requriements speci cation they can quickly see what are its domain elements objects attributes operations and interactions and relationships between the domain objects.
they can also cross check the models obtained by them with those generated by the tool for the given speci cations.
anmodeler accepts the input software requirements written in ucs as well as plain text.
along with the in place visualization of the output class diagram it provides facility to export the class diagram as xmi xml metadata interchange le which can be used as input in various design modeling tools such argouml visual paradigm etc.
having separate components to handle each of the sub tasks of analysis modeling it can easily be modi ed to accommodate changes and can easily be extended to add more features.
asanmodeler is the implementation of our approaches for generating analysis class diagrams and sequence diagrams presented in so it also has all the limitations of these approaches.
another limitaion is that its current implementation cannot generate sequence diagrams from the software requirements speci ed as plain text however it can generate the class diagrams from both the ucs as well as the plain text.

existing automated tools cm builder2 presented in obtains candidate classes from all the nouns in the text and candidate relationships from all non copular verbs.
it identi es attributes from possessive relationships and adjectives.
it discards the candidate classes obtained from nouns having low frequency in the requirements and those not participating in any relationships.
the class diagrams obtained from the tool do not contain class operations lack association relationships between many classes and the tool cannot identify generalization relationships.
ucda presented in processes the text based on classication of sentences as transitive intransitive ditransitive intensive complex transitive prepositional and non nite given in .
to identify domain classes it needs a glossary of domain speci c terms.
it is unable to identify aggregation and generalization relationships between entity classes.
the aim of dowser presented in is to be used to identify inconsistencies in requirement speci cations with the help of automatically generated analysis class diagrams.
it parses the requirements based on a constraining grammar to obtain link types which are used to identify the domain elements.
the obtained analysis class diagram can then be checked by human analysts to detect inconsistencies in the input speci cations.
the tool can interpret only the simple 831anmodeler sentenceinterperter domainelementextractor sentenceparser classdiagramrealizer specificationreader classdiagramviewer apachipoiapi stanfordnlparserapi graphvizapi input use case specification ucs ucs uses sentences tds pos tags sentence structures tds pos tags domain objects interactions b w them classes relationships dot commands for class diagram output class diagram text xmi file figure component diagram of anmodeler figure tool snapshots input and outputs 832sentences with ve patterns sv svdo svpo svtobepo and svdopo and ve keyword speci c sentences.
the analysis class diagrams obtained from the tool lacks relationships between many classes and many classes lacks operation.
atoucan presented in can interpret a large variety of sentences as compared to other existing tools.
the tool can identify domain entities entity classes and attributes of only one word single noun in length.
most of the classes obtained from the tool can be termed as uml smells as the tool assigns almost all the operations to a single control class.
also it cannot identify aggregation and generalization relationships from the text.
.
