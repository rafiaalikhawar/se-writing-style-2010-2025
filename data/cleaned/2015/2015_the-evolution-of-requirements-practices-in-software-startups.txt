introduction entrepreneurship and innovation is a hot topic reflected in the hugenumberofsoftwarestartupsaroundtheworld.

startupstakeadvantageofmodern software technologies that allow them to quickly build and release software.
they typically follow agile practices lean development continuous integration and devops as part of a largely unstructured approach to software engineering .
these startup companies are attempting to successfully identifyasetofuserrequirementsanddevelopeffectivebusiness modelsaroundinnovativeproductsandservices.
theyareunder significant time pressure to bring their products to market with limited resources and to find a business model that allows them to survive and grow.
many startups fail to achieve these goals and shut down within in their first two years .
we are interested in seeing how requirements practices affect their longer term success.
companiesthatmakeitthroughtheearlyphasesareinteresting from a software engineering perspective and are the focus of this work.
very little is known about how these emerging companies discover prioritise and manage information about requirementsovertime.
whiletheinitialrequirementsmayhavebeencreated informally from a largely unknown market or a niche market of users willing to take risks on a new product the informal approachoftendoesnotscalewellasthecompanygrows .
a startup s ecosystem is highly dynamic leading to challenges inadapting to the pressures given by the clients requests market pressure developer insights or changes in platform requirements.
whileapreviousstudydocumentedrequirementspracticesin small companies we are not aware of empirical evidence about how requirements practices evolve as these companies mature leading to several open questions how do requirements practices evolve over time in startups?
what are the frictions and drivers for changes in how they manage their product and user requirements?
we present a theory of requirements practice evolution in such emergingcompanies.

in the discovery and prioritisation of requirements the planning of requirements implementation and prioritisation the technical debt as related to handling new requirements and the product quality as driven by implementation of user driven requirements.
our theory also identifies propositions as relationships among dimensions.
our empirical data suggests clear trends towards more structured plan basedand documentation oriented practices.
thesechanges arereactive rather than planned suggesting an ongoing pragmatic lightness or flexibility in the startups evolution towards an engineering of requirements.
our research extends the empirical evidenceaboutsoftwareengineeringpracticesinearlystartups with an emphasis on the details of evolving requirements practices.
our theory provides both a conceptual framework to organise the knowledge pertinent to the evolution of requirements in maturing startups and a practical path for such startups to improve their practices in face of specific challenges in their own journeys.

this threat is mitigated as a resultof thetheoretical saturationconcept andbyselecting companies from different countries and at different phases on their evolutionjourney.

theory of requirements practice evolution in software startups fundamental to understanding startups evolving requirements practice is understanding how they decide and prioritise the fea tures to be included in successive versions of their product s .largely unique to startups is the speed at which the y make decisions on product features.
while the initial product vision is driven by the founders the discovery and prioritisation of features areongoing adaptiveprocessesthattakeplaceinacomplexand rapidlychangingenvironment.

a new version of ios .
these forces willdrivetheprioritisationofproductrequirementsandsometimes result in a pivot towards a complete new product or a redefinition of the user base and its associated requirements.
startups make these changes at a much faster pace than established firms.
but how do companies that survive longer in the market evolve to successfully respond to such pressures in their environment and how does their requirements practice evolve?
our study led usto define dimensions relevant to the evolution of requirements practice 1requirementsartefacts 2knowledgemanagement requirements related roles 4planning 5technical debt and6 product quality.

the post it notes and whiteboards can still be used butthe information that is available in the project management tools starts to become more complete in order to help new hires andremote workers as reported by p12 in our perspective the best way to support remote work is that everything must be written down noexceptions.
sowehaveconfluenceandjiraandeverything everytask iswelldetailed.
.
atthispoint andifitwasnotthecasebefore companiesmaybegincreating uidesignsanduxmodels andtesting them with users.
in fact the overall ux is important and drives some of the decisions concerning the product see section .
.
the growing number of clients increases input from clients tp suchasfeaturerequestsandbugreports.
that inturn increasesthe need for product support leading to both internal documentation forsupportstaffandtoexternaldocumentation suchasfaqs to helpuserswithcommonissues.

developers mayuse burndowncharts toidentify thefeatures that arebeingaddedinthecurrentiteration whileothersmayusemore general task tracking and project management tools.
tracking feature requests becomes important.
as p03 noted we had things that weren t actually getting recorded that information is now lost .
when a company enters the third phase requirements artefacts evolveinto richer traceabledescriptions .
totacklethegrowing numberoffeaturesorproducts theuseofthe projectmanagement toolis often improved and systematised each high level task is decomposed into small actionable tasks associated with effort and time estimates as confirmed by p08 we started assigning an effort level to it based on how much engineering may be involved in building this feature what clients it might land us priority levels like doweneedtodo rightnoworcanthiswaitlike9months .
tasksareorganisedintoprojectsorreleases prioritisedandthen assigned.
in the most advanced startups a feature request may include its rationale the source of the request an evaluation of its importancerelativetothecompanygoals itsacceptancecriteria taskdependenciesandotherassociatedinformation.
ascompanies refine their product management process some requests are discarded or given low priority as they do not fit company or product goals.
some companies create a new feature or product proposal documenting all the needed information.
quoting p07 we ll take an idea and build a product proposal.
requirements gathering andresearch is done in order to build that proposal which states that this new feature or this existing feature will take care of this customer sales will be affected in this way customer success will be affectedin this way here is what we expect the outcome of the product explains what we are and why .
traceability links support managingartefacts evolution.

knowledge management companiesaccumulateknowledgeastheygrow.
atfirst theknowledge isinformal and unstructured with the team using tacit knowledge and informal anytime anywhere discussions.
founders ofthestartupteam typically2 4people normallyknowandrely upon one another as confirmed by p16 i can rely on him to remember certain things and do things in a certain way and be veryprecise and specific and so forth.
and i assume he can rely on mein a similar way .
moreover the initial product only has a smallsetoffeatures whicharefairlyeasytomanage asstatedbyp18 our product was so simple ... it was really easy to keep track of everything without having a process or anything else but code .
theaccumulatedtacitknowledgeaboutfeatures productsand clients becomes harder to manage as the number of employees tp andremote workers tp increases and as early hires depart .
thisdifficultydrivesacompanytoenterthesecondphase where knowledgemanagementbecomes informalandsemi structured .
someknowledgeisvaluabletoeveryoneandcanbehandledthrough regularteamorcompanymeetings.
otherknowledgeisonlyrelevant to a subset of employees e.g.
developers and can be handled in meetings connected to their agile software development activity.
the informal discussions and ad hocverbal communication still exist but the meetings facilitate shared knowledge about the product and the features and are a more structured way to pass that information as declared by p08 ... regular meetings to formalise alittlebitmoreourcommunicationprocessandhavejusttheright amount of structure.
it helped us a ton keeping everyone in the loop .
inthisphase onlinecommunicationtools replace tosomeextent thead hocverbal communication.
tools like slack help in keeping the remote workers up to date and are also seen as a way to document decisions.
quoting p10 slack is nicebecauseit has a history.
onethingthatwearelearningisthatifihaveaconversation withsomeoneandidon twriteeverythingdown it sreallyhardto remembereverysinglepieceofinformation.

... wedo dailyscrums butwe dothem over slack ... because lotsof the people are out of the office .
although all content inside these tools issearchable includingfilesandpeople itisstillnotastructured waytodocumentknowledgeandsometimesitishardtoseparate useful information from off topic conversations and noise.
as companies grow they not only add staff but divide into separatedepartments suchassales marketing financeanddevelopment each with its own need to manage and preserve information.
departmentandcompanymeetingsareinadequate especiallyas thecompanyadds newproducts andnewfeatures tp toexisting products.
as confirmed by p03 you have too much information about your product in your mind.
and changes can happen everyday thisisacrazyenvironment.

possible even if you have a great mind .
at the same time the product is in the market and the company receives input from clients tp which can be conveyed through sales people bug reports or even requests for new features.
that information needs to be filtered and transmitted to the relevant employees in an efficient and timelymanner.
quoting p24 there wasno information about howto document information how to informthe restof thecompany which is not minor because every time you release a new feature the wholecompanyneedstoknow.
thecustomersuccessteamneedsto inform the customers marketing needs to promote that new feature .

theknowledgeisthendocumentedinamorestructuredway as discussedinsection4.
.
thisimprovementinthedocumentation helps in the knowledge distribution as pointed out by p06 i think right now we are pretty good at documentation for knowledge.
so there are parts of our product that i don t understand because i don t have the technical understanding.
but the team that is responsible for that part they build documentation that allows me to understand how it works and the value it provides .
of course using such tools effectivelyfromdayonecanhelppreventsomeofthefutureknowledgemanagementproblems whileallowingthecompanytostill maintain the agility and the fast paced development needed asreported by p25 it s possible to have good practices and improve the knowledge dissemination earlier because the tools are there early on.

requirements related roles in a company s first phase team roles may be general and multiple with everyone everything asneeded.

as p07 observed twoco founders everything.
customer support development sales marketing thewholeshebang .
theyareconstantlyswitching contexts shifting from one role to the next several times duringthe day.
as summarised by p24 at the very beginning when we are or we are seated all together we are talking we are fully committedto thecompany andto whatwe are wedon t have manyresources wearelikeanoctopus wedoeverything .
inmost cases one person becomes the ceo with overall responsibility for the business while another takes the lead in building the product.
afirstsignificanttriggerforchangeiswhenthefirstproducthas been released and has paying customers tp .
these customers may requestnewfeatures findbugs and oraskforsupportandtraining allofwhichplacegrowingdemandsontheexistingteam tp .these demands may affect the quality and predictability of the overall work.
p02reported iwas ... what i was wasn t scalable and the quality of the product wasstartingtogodown .
additionally thedevelopmentisslower thanitcouldbe becausedevelopersareperformingotheractivities not related with code as declared by p08 we had everyone on thedevelopmentteam engineering time because engineers were on chat all day live chat .
the company enters the second phase when the roles become semi specific and multiple but also with a clear emphasis on requirements relatedactivities.
newhiresaffordedbythehigher revenueorexternalfundinghavemorespecificroles oftenwitha customer facingrolein marketing sales orsupport.
p01observed that developmentandproducttogethershouldberoughlyaround ofthecompany.
it sverytempting especiallyintechnicallyled companies tomakeit60 ofthecompany butthetruthisif wearenotmarketing wearenotselling wearenotsupporting then what do we do?
.
in the majority of the studied companies whenthe numberofclients increased theyfounditnecessarytohire or to move an employee to a success support position as confirmed by p07 we hired success and support .
we were having more customers and they were e mailing us more often .
people in these roles not only help clients with the initial installation or use of the product but also identify necessary newfeatures based on their interactions with these customers.
salespeople often bring new feature requests especially when the ab sence of a particular feature in the product might be blocking a sale.
the marketing team perhaps a single person at first usually assumes responsibility for maintaining the product roadmap product management as well as identifying the target market crafting the marketing message and training the sales team product marketing .
taken together the increase in customers and the growth of customer facing staff brings added focus to the user experience.
while each employee wears fewer different hats than before they still have more than one responsibility.
quoting p10 we startedhiringmorepeopleforspecificroles.
wehaddevelopers we neededtohavemoreofthose ... wehiredaclientsuccessmanager to stay on track of all of our clients.
but we still need to be more specialised no one is responsible for only one thing .
if everything goes well and the company is successful the numberoffeaturesorproducts willincrease tp addingtotheimportance and complexity of product management.
also the number of employees will continue to grow tp leading to the third phase wheretherequirement relatedrolesare specific and single .th e company may split out quality assurance activities from development andhirequalityassurance qa specialistswhoensure thatthe productmeets therequired qualitystandards.
similarly a product manager or aproduct owner is responsible for creating and prioritisingtheproductbacklog.
companieswithmultipleproducts will eventually have a director of products to oversee the various product managers and determine product priorities.
in addition to thepreviouslynotedproductmarketingtasks thecompanymay addacommunitymanager whowillhaveakeyroleingathering product wishes fromtheusercommunity oftenthroughacompany forum and social media .
as this specialisation proceeds many day to day tasks are well covered giving the ceo and other senior executives more time to focus on strategic issues including the long term vision for the company as discussed in section .

the evolution of requirements practices in software startups icse may june gothenburg sweden productfeaturesmaychange onthefly basedonthewishesof a potential customer as much as on the founders concept.
in that situation the company is highly reactive leaving little room for long term planning.
the team s energy is primarily directed at buildinganddemonstratingtheinitialversionoftheproductinthe hope of attracting customers and possible investors .
positive reactions to the emerging product will often be accompanied by feature requests from early adopters and drive the next steps of product development.
negative reactions may cause thecompany to revise its thinking and pivotto a different idea.
as a consequence the feature set in the product is very fluid often responding to requests from potential early customers tp rather than focusing on the founding team s initial vision.
rather than creating a single product they would create custom developments oraddfeaturesasrequestedbyspecificcustomerstomakeasale.
as p08 observed we were much more hungry for clients before so we bent over backwards a lot more basically what they wantedustodo.

p24noted user experience is really important.
we work really closely with our customers we try to interview them and have case studies and ui tests ... they influence our feature prioritisation in a way .
competition is also an important factor in feature prioritisation.

technical debt technicaldebt referstotheaccumulatedbacklogofsoftwaredevelopment neededbecause developers favour a quick and dirty over a more complete solution usually to reduce the overall implementation time.

becomingawareoftechnicaldebt andthen tracking and recording it marks advancement to the second stage for the company.
at this point startups not only know that technical debt exists but also which features are affected by it and how.
nonetheless this does not mean that the company will start paying this debt immediately since first the startup needs to make a conscious decision to tackle it.
however with more people the company has the resources to do so as confirmed by p02 it probably was when wehiredmoredevelopers.

debt will continue to exist and even grow if it is not causing the producttofailanddoesnotsubstantiallyaffecttheclients.
quoting p18 it s a hard decision but if the debt is not causing the product to crash we ll not prioritise the payment .
when the technical debt affects the product quality perhaps causing it to malfunction or perform poorly companies begin to havenegativefeedback fromclients tp .withmodernpublicproductreviewmechanisms thisnegativefeedbackmaybewidelyseen.
in most ofthe studied companies the businessmodel followed asubscription plan which means that the startup would have a payingclientfortheentireperiodofthesubscription regardless of their satisfaction with the product.

this involves rewritingandrefactoringportionsofthecode.
mostimportantly this engineering work is integrated into the overall product release planning making it visible to the product manager and customers.
at this stage requirements practice is no longer focused exclusivelyonproductfeatures butalsoencompassesnfrsthatmustbe addressed by the development team to assure high product quality.
retirement of technical debt is just one piece of a maturing development organisation where code reviews automated tests and coding standards become standard practice.

our empirical data suggest that an action of the company to advance along one of the dimensions bringsalongadvancesinotherdimensions.
culturehasemerged as another strong determining factor affecting the evolution along all the dimensions in our theory so it deserves to be highlightedhere.
in fig.
we include the previously identified dimensionsalongside cultureand the propositions about the relationships among them.
we summarise them briefly next.

p7 improved ability to handle technical debt results in a higher ability to prioritise requirements with greatest customer impact.
p8 handling technical debt is enhanced by and increases the company s ability to prioritise product quality.
p9 all changes are influenced by a combination of company culture and the co founders backgrounds.
while details of these relationships might be apparent from the richer descriptions of the theory dimensions in section we illustrate some of them here.

the evolution of requirements related roles i.e.
adding more peopleand giving them specialised roles p2 means that the companyis better able to plan its product development and release schedule p3 as well as to assure the quality of the evolving product p6 .

is evolution along the six dimensions fundamental to the success of a startup?
whiledifferentintervieweeshadvaryingideasaboutwhatitmeans tobeasuccessful startup twokeyaspectsare survivalandlongevity.
long term success is not easily predictable and is affected by both internal and external factors including the type of product and itsmarket humanresources companyculture availablefunding processes and practices and even luck or serendipity.
while some of these factors cannot be controlled one that can be managed isthechoiceofprocessesandpracticesusedtooperateandsteer the startup on a daily basis and the conscious decision to make changes and evolve along the dimensions identified in this paper.
one question that arises from our work is whether maturity intermsoftheevolvingrequirementspracticeisnecessarytothe success of a startup.
although we would have liked to answer positively theshortansweris no .
thelongansweris however farmorecomplexandinteresting asshownbytwocompaniesfrom our study shown as c06 and c03 on our map in fig.
