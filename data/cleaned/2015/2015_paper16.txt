wehaveperformed agrounded theory study toclarify process variations and their rationales.
thestudy isbased onintervie wswith softw aredevelopment professionals from companies.
these intervie wsprovided insights intothereasons andinfluencing factors behind the adoption ornon adoption ofcode reviewsasawhole aswell asfordifferent process variations.
we havecondensed these findings intosixhypotheses andaclassification oftheinfluencing factors.

which part of these variations isaccidental andwhich factors influence thechoices takenbyindustrial practitioners?
toassess these andother questions weperformed agrounded theory study based onintervi ewswith24softw areengineering professionals from 19companies.
theydescribed 22different cases ofcode reviewuse.theintervie wswere semi structured using open ended questions.
thebroad research questions treated inthearticle are why are code reviewsused ornotused byindustrial softwar edevelopment teams?
