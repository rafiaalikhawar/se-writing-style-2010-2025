we leverage medical imaging and insights from the psychological notion of spatial ability to decode the neural representations of several fundamental data structures and their manipulations.
in a human study involving participants we examine list array tree and mental rotation tasks using both functional near infrared spectroscopy fnirs and functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri .
we find a nuanced relationship data structure and spatial operations use the same focal regions of the brain but to different degrees.
they are related but distinct neural tasks.
in addition more difficult computer science problems induce higher cognitive load than do problems of pure spatial reasoning.
finally while fnirs is less expensive and more permissive there are some computing relevant brain regions that only fmri can reach.
i. i ntroduction data structures are a fundamental element in computer science that affect the performance and cost of many systems .
data structure choice and usage influence many aspects of software engineering including maintainability fault tolerance reliability and scalability .
despite the importance of data structures in software development we have a limited understanding of the subjective cognitive processes underlying their employment.
understanding these processes is important to augment unreliable self reporting and inform pedagogy technology transfer and programming expertise section ii .
in this paper we present the first investigation that uses medical imaging to decode the neural representations of several classes of data structures and their manipulation.
we leverage two key insights to study the neurological bases associated with data structures.
first we investigate the relationship between data structures and spatial ability.
spatial ability is often measured via mental rotation tasks like illustrated in figure .
second we use two medical imaging techniques functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri and functional near infrared spectroscopy fnirs to provide objective measurements of active brain function and establish a grounded understanding of mental processes associated with data structure manipulation.
by comparing these neuroimaging modalities we develop best practices for imaging investigations of software engineering.
psychology research has shown spatial ability to be a major factor in proficiencies such as mathematics natural5 fig.

on the right a three dimensional object is rotated in space as shown in the bottom right.
we investigate how the brain represents these two activities using medical imaging techniques.
sciences engineering meteorology and map navigation .
there are many interpretations of spatial ability including the determination of spatial relationships between objects and the mental manipulation of spatiallypresented information.
despite spatial ability s influence in a wide range of disciplines it has rarely been studied within software engineering.
to the best of our knowledge only one previous study conducted by aharoni focused on the relationship between software engineering tasks and spatial ability .
this previous work relied on interviews with students to understand their thought processes and suggested that programmers use visual representations to reduce the level of abstraction of data structures.
however no quantitative relationship has been investigated.
drawing inspiration from previous work we consider spatial ability in the context of data structures to be the capacity to mentally represent remember and manipulate spatial relations between elements of data.
we conducted a human study in which participants mentally manipulated lists arrays and trees.
participants also completed mental rotation tasks involving the ability to determine if two perspective drawings portray the same threedimensional shapes.
in our study we use mental rotation tasks to provide a solid neurological basis for spatial ability against which the cognitive processes associated with data structure manipulation can be compared.

we carry out our study using fmri and fnirs two noninvasive in vivo neuroimaging techniques that have enabled new and complex studies of brain function.
by indirectly measuring changes in oxygen consumption these two imaging modalities can be used to isolate the brain regions recruited for specific tasks.
however they exhibit tradeoffs relevant to studying software engineering.
fmri allows for sampling across the whole head and offers excellent spatial resolution while requiring a restrictive experimental environment that limits its range of use cases.
by contrast fnirs is significantly less expensive and admits more freedom in the experimental environment and participant motion.
however fnirs provides inferior spatial resolution and weaker penetration power below the scalp.
both fmri and fnirs have been widely used in psychological and clinical research to develop a deeper understanding of brain functions such as sensory verbal and motor processing .
fmri and fnirs allow us to investigate the physical substrates underlying data structure manipulation and its relationship with spatial ability.
we note that the use of medical imaging in software engineering is still exploratory since only nine publications have studied its associated cognitive processes with either fmri or fnirs alone .
given the tradeoffs between these two neuroimaging techniques the community has not settled on the best option for studying software engineering tasks.
our work is the first to use both fmri and fnirs to study software engineering validating fnirs as an effective neuroimaging technique comparable to fmri for future research in this field.
the contributions of this paper are as follows we report on a human study involving participants and two medical imaging techniques the largest such study we are aware of for software engineering.
we find that data structure and spatial operations are related but distinct neural tasks they use the same focal regions of the brain but to different degrees.
we demonstrate that problem difficulty matters at a neural level in computer science with more complex stimuli inducing a relatively higher cognitive load in data structure tasks than in mental rotation.
we find that fmri and fnirs measurements broadly agree for the claims in this study.
however fnirs cannot distinguish some activities as clearly as can fmri.
on the other hand fmri may influence participant accuracy.
care is needed when using medical imaging for software engineering.
we present evidence from a qualitative investigation showing that imaging can find connections that subjective self perceptions may overlook.
this paper contributes to a fundamental understanding of cognitive processes in software engineering.
to the best of our knowledge this is the first paper to study data structures with neuroimaging study the relationship between data structure manipulation and spatial ability and compare fmri and fnirs in the context of software engineering.ii.
b ackground andmotiv ation we summarize results and techniques related to medical imaging and psychology for a computer science audience.
section ii a overviews the mechanism and research use of fmri and fnirs including their relative advantages and disadvantages for our experiment.
section ii b summarizes the study of mental rotation in psychology supporting our experimental use of it as a neurological basis for spatial ability.
a. medical imaging functional neuroimaging techniques are used to study brain activity.
over the past years non invasive in vivo functional neuroimaging techniques have emerged as important tools in understanding cognitive processes.
we discuss the most popular techniques fmri and its counterpart fnirs.
first as non invasive tools these two imaging modalities pose significantly less risk and can access a wider range of brain regions than previous invasive techniques e.g.
electrocorticography .
second fmri and fnirs provide a wider field of view and higher spatial resolution than other functional neuroimaging techniques e.g.
eeg meg enabling characterization of a brain region s contribution to a specific task.
third fmri and fnirs do not use ionizing radiation or radioactive elements common in many other neuroimaging modalities e.g.
ct pet .
instead both techniques rely on the hemodynamic response the metabolic changes e.g.
oxygen glucose in neuronal blood flow to active brain regions using oxygen consumption as an indirect measurement for brain activity .
as a result fmri and fnirs have experienced a dramatic rise in popularity in research.
in alone fmri was used in more than published articles .
among other examples fmri has been used to study face recognition decision making resting and vegetative states .
similarly the use of fnirs has grown significantly .
the applications of fnirs span many fields such as behavioral development psychiatric conditions and brain injury .
however fmri and fnirs also share limitations.
one limitation is hemodynamic lag the onset of changes in neuronal blood flow peaks several seconds after the onset of stimuli .
similarly the hemodynamic response saturates over time resulting in weaker signals for sustained tasks.
both characteristics enforce experimental restrictions such as limited task duration commonly seconds and require robust mathematical analysis .
in this study we follow best practices in neuroscience and psychology to analyze hemodynamic response signals section iv .
how fmri works fmri provides indirect measurements of brain activity by calculating the blood oxygen level dependent bold signal defined as the ratio of oxygenated to deoxygenated hemoglobin .
fmri captures bold signals via the application and removal of a series of magnetic fields.
as task related brain activity is mapped onto an anatomical scan of the participant s brain in the associated mathematical analysis participants must lie still in the fmri bore throughout the experiment with minimal head movement.

how fnirs works fnirs also measures the hemodynamic response to determine active brain regions.
it relies on differences in the absorption of chromophores groups of atoms that generate color through the absorption of light between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin.
light is emitted and detected through devices placed at specific locations on a scalp cap worn by the participant.
fnirs admits relative freedom of motion and has few environmental restrictions.
for example participants can sit in front of a computer and perform in a more realistic software development setting.
comparison of fmri and fnirs fmri provides excellent spatial resolution and penetrating power.
it is a precise neuroimaging modality that captures activations across the whole brain.
in contrast fnirs provides inferior spatial resolution and depth due to inconsistent photon paths and the limited penetration of near infrared light.
as a result fnirs also provides a noisier signal requiring careful considerations in experiment and analysis design.
likewise fnirs requires deciding in advance on the placement of light emitter detector devices.
the number of regions fnirs can measure simultaneously is limited by physical space on the scalp.
however fnirs is gaining traction as a neuroimaging technique due to its portability ease of administration ecological validity and lower cost.
in contrast the high cost restrictive environment and high sensitivity to participant motion of fmri limit its practicality for a broad spectrum of use cases.
in this paper we present recommendations for the use of fmri and fnirs to study software engineering.
motivating functional neuroimaging we outline the importance of using medial imaging to understand the mental processes associated with data structure manipulations discussed further in previous work unreliable self reporting.
previous software engineering and psychology studies demonstrate that humans self reporting are often unreliable.
medical imaging can give accurate objective explanations of subjective processes.
pedagogy and training.
we can take advantage of visual representations to help students learn programming .
additionally studies have found different patterns of activation across ages for other tasks.
knowing whether this occurs in software engineering could guide workforce retraining.
technology transfer .
better models of human judgments of software tools may help improve tool design.
programming expertise.
previous studies have shown how brain structures change with expertise for other tasks and suggested how fmri could be used to investigate expertise .
imaging may help us understand the reported productivity gap between experienced and novice programmers.
we hope medical imaging studies can help software engineering researchers to gain a better understanding and improvement of certain tasks.
b. mental rotation of objects mental rotation is defined as the capacity to quickly and accurately rotate two or three dimensional figures in imagination .
mental rotation tasks generally involve comparingtwo three dimensional objects rotated about an axis figure right and are a standard paradigm for testing spatial ability .
neuroimaging suggests that mental rotation involves the right parietal lobe a region believed to be responsible for spatial ability .
in our experiments we use mental rotation as a validated test case for spatial ability.
mental rotation tasks have a natural notion of difficulty angle of rotation.
shepard and metzler found that the time required to solve mental rotation tasks is a linearly increasing function of the angular difference between the orientations of the two objects .
gogos et al.
studied the difficulty of mental rotation using medical imaging.
they used fmri to examine differential activations in regions within the parietal lobe identifying rises in the bold signal with increased angles of rotation .
such findings support the use of mental rotation as a meaningful comparison for the investigation of difficulty in this neuroimaging study.
iii.
e xperimental setup andmethod we present our study protocol to decode the neurological bases of data structures and their relationship with spatial ability and difficulty.
materials e.g.
all stimuli and deidentified data are available at the project s website.
a. overview in this human study participants completed three blocks of tasks while being scanned by either fmri or fnirs.
stimuli consisted of data structure i.e.
list array tree and mental rotation tasks with varying levels of difficulty.
this setup permits the controlled investigation of the relationship between data structures and spatial ability through the lens of difficulty and the choice of medical imaging modality.

both fmri and fnirs experiments used the same set of stimuli.
stimuli were subdivided into three categories lists and arrays collectively referred to as sequences trees and mental rotation.
each task block consisted of stimuli from each category.
the stimuli order was chosen randomly per participant.
participants were directed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
after the scanning participants completed a post survey to provide verbal explanations of their choices and actions.
our experimental task protocol was designed to accommodate both fmri and fnirs.
for the fmri experiments participants lay in an fmri machine see section ii a1 holding mr compatible buttons and remained in the machine for the entire scan see figure .
in contrast fnirs participants sat in a chair wearing an fnirs device see section ii a2 using a standard keyboard and monitor see figure .
participants were asked to remain still but were permitted five minute breaks between each task block.
as mentioned in iii b data from individuals were removed due to difficulties presented when collecting fmri data e.g.
discomfort in the machine incomplete dataset or excessive head motion .
in the fnirs analyses data from all individuals could be used.
we now provide technical details suitable for conducting or replicating similar research.
section iii d continues with a discussion of the stimuli used in our experiment.
fmri acquisition in this experiment we used fmri to collect high resolution imaging data following best practices from neuroimaging .

we designed three head caps to accommodate different head sizes head circumference cm cm cm based on the international system see figure 3a .
to fit the fnirs cap to each participant we aligned the cap center with the point fpz above the bridge of the nose see .
the cap included light emitters and detectors spaced cm apart yielding data collection channels3deployed at different regions.
regions were chosen based on previous neuroimaging studies of program comprehension and mental rotation and consisted of brodmann4areas.
signals were sampled at hz and then resampled to hz for analysis.
d. materials and design as described in section iii c participants were presented with three categories of stimuli sequences trees and mental rotation.
each stimulus from the first and second categories included a starting data structure an operation to perform and two answer choices figure .
answers were either numerical values to describe the outcome of an operation or candidate data structures resulting from an operation.
a sequence appeared as either a linked list or an array.

iv .
a pproach in this section we present details on the mathematical analyses applied to fmri and fnirs data.
our goal is to localize brain activations from task related changes in the bold response fmri or light absorption fnirs .
such analyses pose complicated statistical challenges involving the interpretation of hemodynamic responses across anatomically and functionally diverse participants which themselves are indirect metabolic proxies for underlying neuronal i.e.
molecular cellular responses.
we used standard preprocessing techniques to identify and remove artifacts validate model assumptions and standardize locations of brain regions across participants.
we then used general linear models to obtain estimates of task related brain activations within voxels fmri or channels fnirs based on the canonical hemodynamic response function.
finally we performed statistical tests at both individual and group levels to test for significant brain activations including subsequent correction for false positives.
notation.
we use the neuroimaging notation a bto refer to the contrast or difference between two task conditions.
for example sequence tree refers to the comparison of brain activations during sequence vs. tree manipulation.
contrasts are directional tests the aforementioned sequence tree contrast will specifically attempt to identify regions in which 5a helmet like casing that surrounds the head and is essential for capturing high quality images .average sequence task activity is greater than tree manipulation.
critically this does notimply that the inverse contrast tree sequence will reveal regions in which tree activity is significantly greater than sequence activity as differences in the opposite direction may be too small to be statistically meaningful particularly with the conservative thresholds we use to guard against false positives .
a. fmri analysis approach preprocessing.
a critical first step in the analysis of fmri data is preprocessing which serves to correct systematic sources of noise and transform individual brains into a standard space for cross participant comparison.
we employed a number of standard preprocessing procedures using the statistical parametric mapping spm12 wellcome trust centre for neuroimaging london software in matlab.
first we computed voxel displacement maps vdms using images from the fieldmap sequence.
we then realigned the functional scans after accounting for head motion over time the vdms were used to unwarp geometric distortions from motion.
next the anatomical scans were segmented skull stripped and spatially coregistered to the functional data.
all images were then transformed into a standard space according to the montreal neurological institute mni152 template .
finally we computed a brain mask using gray and white matter segments of the anatomical scans this was applied in subsequent statistical analyses to prevent identification of false positive signals within ventricles or outside of brainspace.
first level analysis.
functional mri analyses are multilevel.
first level models are specified on individual participant data the results are then combined in a group level model to assess average task related changes in brain activity.
we specified two first level general linear models glms per participant.
briefly these analyses require us to predict the bold response to each condition voxels whose timeseries align with the predicted response are task sensitive .
in each glm we specified regressors for sequence tree and mental stimuli across all runs.
the duration of each event was curtailed to participant response times.
these were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function hrf and highpass filtered s to remove low frequency noise.
in one model we additionally specified a parametric modulator for each condition to determine whether the magnitude of the bold response scaled linearly with trial difficulty.
all models were fit using robust weighted least squares rwls authorized licensed use limited to lahore univ of management sciences.

which first obtains estimates of the error variance at each timepoint and reweights the images by a factor of varianceto reduce the influence of noisy scans e.g.
due to headmotion .
this procedure homogenizes the residual timeseriesand obtains optimal parameter estimates for each condition.
contrasts and group level analysis.
following first level model estimation we computed pairwise contrasts to deter mine mean differences in activity between conditions.
thesewere estimated on a within participant basis i.e.
on first levelmodels .
we applieda5m m 3full width at half maximum fwhm gaussian smoothing kernel to each contrast map andcarried them upward into group level random effects analyses.
a glm in this context allows us to assess average activityacross allparticipants accounting for inter individual variance to make some population level inference.
the end result isastatistical parametric map oft values describing clusters of significant activity for a given task related comparison.importantly all models and tests described here were donevoxelwise that is a glm was specified and estimated for each of nearly voxels in brainspace.
we thereforeapplied a false discovery rate fdr threshold at q .
05to control for false positives as a result of multiple comparisons.
b. fnirs analysis approach preprocessing.
the raw fnirs data are light signals transmitted through the channels between emitters and adjacent detectors on the fnirs cap.
the light signals were convertedto a measure of the optical density 6change over time that results from hemodynamic responses.
first level analysis.
statistical analyses for fnirs follow the same general principles as fmri.
we specified within subject first level glms to model fnirs optical densitymeasurements in all the channels that were statistically relatedto the timing of the hemodynamic responses as determinedby convolving timeseries of stimulus events with the canonicalhrf .
in fnirs systemic physiology and motion inducedartifacts are major sources of noise and false positives.
wetherefore fit our models using autoregressive whitened robustregression which controls for such confounds and affordsoptimal parameter estimation.
then we applied t tests to the regression coefficients describing the task related brainactivations modeled for every participant.
we additionallyseparated tasks into three difficulty levels and constructedglms to analyze the effect of task difficulty on neural activity.
contrasts and group level analysis.
as with the fmri analysis we computed pairwise contrasts to determine meandifferences in activity between conditions estimated on awithin participant basis.
next we conducted a group levelanalysis to summarize the first level regression coefficients.
amixed effects model was used to examine the average group level response with individual participants treated as randomeffects.
finally we applied an fdr threshold at q .
05to control for false positives from multiple comparisons.

v. r esults and analysis we present quantitative and qualitative analyses to address the following research questions rq1 do data structure manipulations involve spatial ability?
rq2 what is the role of task difficulty?rq3 do fmri and fnirs agree for software engineering?rq4 how do self reporting and neuroimaging compare?
for simplicity of presentation we use code to refer to sequence array and list and tree tasks collectively.
a. rq1 data structures spatial ability fmri we began with a broad examination of mental rotation vs. code tasks independent of task difficulty this would allow us to determine whether there were reliable differences betweenmental rotation and the two data structure tasks on average.a group level test of code mental yielded no significant activations after fdr thresholding i.e.
no regions showedconsistently stronger activations across both tree and sequencetasks relative to mental rotation .
however mental code revealed robust increases in activation fdr corrected ofseveral regions commonly associated with the brain s defaultmode network dmn .
most notably we observed bilat eral recruitment of wide swaths of posterior cingulate cortex pcc ba and medial prefrontal cortex mpfc ba including subgenual anterior cingulate cortex sgacc ba .on the lateral face there emerged a large cluster of activityin the left angular gyrus ag temporoparietal junction tpj ba with additional clusters extendingrostrally along the superior temporal sulcus psts and middletemporal gyrus mtg to the temporal pole ba .
theseanterior temporal cortex clusters were also largely bilateral.the dmn is heavily implicated in various types of mental simulation as required by the tasks performed here.
given that mental rotation reliably activated dmn regions more than the two code tasks we applied more focal contraststo determine whether there were specific differences betweenmental tree andmental sequence .
this revealed that themental code effect was primarily driven by mental tree figure .
while mental sequence yielded significant differential activations in midline dmn regions such as thepcc and mpfc these clusters had relatively minimal spatialextent.
patterns of activity related to mental tree however were nearly identical to those observed in the comprehensivemental code contrast pearson s r .

contrasts tree mental andsequence mental also had no voxels survive fdr thresholding.
fmri results suggest that there are more similarities than differences during mental rotation vs. software engineeringtasks.
a number of dmn regions involved in mental sim ulation were recruited more heavily during mental rotation nevertheless of voxels were statistically indistinguish able between mental andtree tasks.
b. rq1 data structures spatial ability fnirs table ii summarizes the fnirs results.
we first examined brain activations comparing each task to a rest condition.the columns sequence mental andtree show the brodmann areas that are significantly activated during the task categories p .
01andq .
.
the t values range from much stronger activation to much weaker .
we observe that the three categories of tasks all involve significant activations inexactly the same brain regions ba and .
in the frontal lobe the premotor cortex and supplementary motor cortex ba and the frontal eye field ba showedactivation.
in the parietal lobe the part which is associatedwith visuomotor coordination presented activation ba and part of wernicke s area showed activation ba .
wealso observed strong activation in the primary secondary andassociative visual cortex ba .
finally regions of thedorsolateral prefrontal cortex ba showed activationsfor all tasks.
all the brain areas listed in the table passed fdrcorrection q .
.
having established a broad similarity in how the three tasks each differ from a rest state we narrowed the investigation byexamining how the tasks differ from each other.
in table ii the column sequence mental shows the brain activation results when comparing sequence tasks and mental rotationtasks.
areas related to vision ba wernicke s area ba and the prefrontal cortext ba showed verydifferent patterns of activation between the data structure taskand mental rotation.
in addition areas related to languageprocessing ba and which include broca sarea strongly distinguish the two.
as we observe here an area e.g.
ba may not significantly distinguish sequence from a rest state or mental from a rest state but may significantly distinguish them from each other.
however the mental tree and sequence tree distinctions are far less compelling.
in a comparison t values near to either 8or are relevant.
while sequence mental features three areas that reach a magnitude of 5or more the other two contrasts never reach a magnitude of 5and involve fewer regions and channels.
in an fnirs analysis contrasts of that strength result in a conclusion that mental andtree as well as sequence andtree are similar tasks.
fnirs results demonstrate that mental rotation and datastructure tasks involve activations to the same brain regions.however while sequence mental may be a compelling contrast the fnirs evidence does not support the claim thatthe other tasks are distinct.
fig.
significant clusters of activity for sequence mental accounting for task difficulty.
hotter colors indicate regions showing a larger magnitude difference between the two tasks i.e.
more activityduring difficult sequence manipulation trials relative to difficultmental rotation trials .
c. rq2 task difficulty fmri when we considered the difficulty of each task we found a significant effect in sequence mental figure .
larger sequence tasks elicited stronger activations across a wide extent of the brain fdr corrected .
with the exception of pcc there was little to no overlap with dmn regions as seen in thecontrasts in section v a .
rather the largest clusters includedbilateral postcentral gyrus ba left inferior frontal gyrus ifg ba bilateral dorsomedial pfc dmpfc ba6 bilateral anterior insula ba and bilateral ventralprecuneus extending into visual association cortex ba .the heavy recruitment of frontoparietal regions particularly inthe left hemisphere suggests an increase in cognitive load scaling with the total size of the stimuli.
that is we found that the brain works measurably harder i.e.
there is a larger magnitude bold response for moredifficult problems.
because the relationship between mentalrotation difficulty and the bold signal is so well establishedin psychology and cognitive neuroscience it isparticularly compelling that we observe a significantly largereffect in terms of cognitive load and top down control risingwith more complex stimuli for sequence data structures insoftware engineering than for mental rotation.
a similar analysis with our fnirs data revealed no significant findings for the effect of task difficulty on neural activity.this is likely due to fnirs lacking the penetrative depth andspatial resolution of fmri.
the brain works measurably harder for more difficult soft ware engineering problems in terms of cognitive load .moreover the regions activated suggest a greater need foreffortful top down cognitive control when completing chal lenging sequence manipulation tasks.
d. rq3 fmri and fnirs agreement our fmri and fnirs measurements and analyses both support the claim that mental rotation and data structure tasksdifferentially recruit a number of brain regions.
however while fmri evidence supports a very robust mental tree contrast the fnirs evidence is insufficient to support thatsame claim.
this is sensible when we consider the regionsyielding the largest differences in fmri they largely corre spond to structures e.g.
the medial prefrontal cortex and pos terior cingulate that fnirs cannot measure.

manipulations are too far inside the skull for fnirs to see its near infrared light cannot penetrate deeply beyond regions near the cortical surface.
however while fmri is more spatially resolved its restrictive and alien environment can also be more daunting for participants.
we compared participant performance i.e.
whether or not they gave the correct answer and how long it took for fmri and fnirs such information was available for fmri and fnirs participants.
recall that the questions were identical and the participants were drawn from the same pool.

this could be a very relevant concern for medical imaging studies of productivity expertise accuracy or similar software engineering issues.
fmri and fnirs agreed that many areas similarly activate during data structure and mental rotation tasks.
however there were also differences between the tasks that fnirs was not able to observe.
in addition the fmri environment had a significant effect on participant accuracy.
e. rq4 self reporting neuroimaging qualitative we also conducted a qualitative analysis of survey data focusing on the correlation between explanations provided by participant and neuroimaging data.
data was available for of our participants.
at a high level we find that selfreporting often subtly contrasts with analyses from fmri and fnirs data.
complete de identified survey information is available with our other experimental materials and measurements for space we focus here on a single indicative question.
participants were asked to compare and contrast a mental rotation task with an bst rotation task.
of the responses reported no similarity between the two tasks.
the following quote is indicative i don t think those two kinds of tasks were similar.
tree rotation was an idea acquired from cs classroom but mental rotation was an action more natural to me and easier to perform.
however this subjective experience does not align with measured observation that the same brain regions are recruited to solve both tasks.
even if mentalrotation and tree rotation feel subjectively different changes to brain regions and brain region connectivity have been shown to correlate with learning rates and expertise .
it may be for example that exercises related to spatial ability can help improve student performance on certain data structure tasks e.g.
because mastering one changes a brain region recruited by the other .
speculatively this is one example of a research avenue that is encouraged by medical imaging data but entirely hidden if only self reporting data is used.
these findings reinforce a considerable body of work on unreliable self reporting both in psychology and in computer science including fields such as security human computer interaction and software maintenance .
as previous studies have relied on self reporting to study mental processes associated with data structures this evidence informs future research of the importance of neuroimaging or similar techniques when studying the cognitive processes underlying software engineering tasks.
while medical imaging data found a nuanced relationship between mental rotation and data structure tasks including the involvement of the same brain regions subjective selfreport only rarely mentioned any connections.

t hreats to validity in this section we describe threats to internal and external validity in our experiment.
one potential threat to internal validity concerns whether or not our data structure tasks measure what they claim to be measuring i.e.
data structure manipulation .
the thought processes each participant used when answering may not be identical indeed there is significant inter participant variance in the neural representation of this task.
in addition the particular data structures and tasks we chose are not representative of all of software engineering e.g.
we did not consider skip lists tries heaps maps etc.
.
while we mitigate this somewhat by considering fundamental structures linear sequential structures and branching trees it is important not to generalize our results far beyond what was directly measured.
our use of mental rotation tasks as a baseline for spatial ability is one potential threat to external validity as mental authorized licensed use limited to lahore univ of management sciences.

rotation and data structure manipulations differ in their rigidity.
rigid transformations are those where distances between every pair of points on an object is preserved .
when studying the relationship between data structure manipulation and spatial ability operations such as insertion tree rotation and merging may be more amenable to comparison with nonrigid transformations.
however we believe that mental rotation serves as a useful baseline section ii b for relating data structures to spatial ability.
mental rotation is a paradigm case of spatial ability that has been classified by difficulty both with and without medical imaging .
due to the inherent limitations of fmri and fnirs see section ii a we explicitly used stimuli that took no longer than seconds to finish.
thus our results may not generalize to real world software engineering tasks.
we mitigate this threat slightly by choosing stimuli from college level courses which commonly focus on associated fundamental skills.
however this emphasis on tasks that are much shorter than many of those performed by practicing developers is a limitation of the current use of imaging techniques in software engineering .
next the models used in our data analysis may threaten external validity.
to the best of our knowledge we followed best practices in neuroscience and psychology for our analyses.
finally we only recruited undergraduate and graduate students.
thus our results may only generalize to those with university level programming experience and education.

r elated work in this section we discuss previous work related to computer science and neuroscience as well as studies from other domains that have used both fmri and fnirs.
additionally we briefly discuss previous research on the cognitive processes underlying data structures and their manipulation.
a. computer science and neuroscience siegmund et al.
introduced the study of software engineering tasks with fmri focusing on code comprehension .
their analyses identified five brain regions with distinct activation patterns all of which are relevant to working memory attention and language processing.
their subsequent work presented more potential analyses of fmri data involving software programming finding evidence that data flow based code complexity metrics but not control flow based metrics rest on valid assumptions .
floyd et al.
used fmri to study code comprehension code review and prose review .
in addition to identifying brain regions associated with verbal processing their paper focused on expertise and classification.
newer work has explored the relationship between bug detection and brain activities code comprehension together with other techniques such as eye tracking and the effects of beacons semantic cues on code comprehension .
sato et al.
studied logic problem solving and diagrams with fmri .
our study applies siegmund et al.
s innovative use of neuroimaging and adopts these previouslyidentified brain regions as an established basis for verbalprocessing in software engineering.
unlike previous work we examine data structures and spatial ability.
similar to fmri fnirs has been used to study the relationship between program comprehension and brain activity.
nirs researchers found an increase in cerebral blood flow when analyzing obfuscated code and code that requires variable memorization .
subsequent work studied the effect of code readability on cognitive load .
the use of fnirs in these studies provides additional evidence for its application in understanding the cognitive processes in software engineering.
however the relatively small size of these studies participants each reinforces the need to validate fnirs as a viable technique in this field.
using participants with two modalities our study supports the feasibility of using fnirs to study software engineering.
besides fmri and fnirs researchers have tried other medical imaging tools to study software engineering.
crk et al.
used electroencephalography eeg to find that the brain s electrical activity can indicate both prior programming experience and self reported experience levels .
lee et al.
used eeg in a similar setting to floyd et al.
s work .
parnin used electromyography emg to explore the roles of subvocalization for different programming tasks .
researchers have linked programming tasks and cognitive load using eeg emg and eye tracking.
beyond neuroimaging parnin examined theories of how programmers work and the design of programming environments from a cognitive neuroscience perspective.
parnin proposed a model focused on how a programmer manages task memory specifically during multi tasking and interruptions .
similar to our study parnin s work investigates computer science from a neuroscience perspective.
of the previous studies combining neuroimaging or cognitive neuroscience with software engineering none have investigated the effect of data structures on brain activity or explicitly investigated the relationship between data structures and spatial ability.
in addition no previous study has compared fmri to fnirs in the domain of software engineering.
b. combining fmri and fnirs in psychology the trade offs presented by fmri and fnirs see section ii a have motivated researchers to conduct combined fmri and fnirs studies.
cui et al.
were the first to compare the two modalities through a suite of cognitive tasks .
their findings align with ours similar conclusions can be drawn but with inferior resolution in the nirs data.
liu et al.
measured fmri and fnirs signals from the prefrontal cortex at the same time during cognitive tasks.
their results showed fnirs measured cortical signals can be used to infer deep brain fmri measured signal but with lower prediction power.
others comparing fnirs and fmri report similar findings fmri and fnirs provide highly correlated neural responses and fnirs can be an appropriate substitute for fmri.
however fnirs studies must be carefully designed when involving activities in regions more distal from the scalp.

signal level correlations we found that the resulting models of the two modalities do not draw identical conclusions on lowlevel explorations in software engineering see section v d a relevant concern for future imaging research in this area.
c. data structures there are two main papers that have considered data structures at a cognitive level.
in a qualitative study involving nine computer science majors aharoni investigated student thought processes when dealing with data structures .
through semi structured interviews aharoni found a phenomenon termed the perception of a data structure as static or dynamic .
this work formally studied the notion that data structures could be subject to mental manipulation.
in a second study applying new analyses to the same data aharoni found evidence that visual representations influenced students perceptions of the overall properties of data structures suggesting that programmers use visual representations to reduce levels of abstraction.
while we draw inspiration from aharoni s investigation of data structure mental manipulations we use medical imaging to conduct a quantitative analysis that does not focus on self reporting or qualitative experiments.

c osts fmri fnirs and research medical imaging studies while still quite rare are becoming more common in the software engineering literature .
fmri and fnirs present tradeoffs between cost fidelity experimental convenience and experimental verisimilitude.
in this section we discuss their tangible and intangible costs including those associated with participant recruitment equipment cost and time.
as discussed in section ii a fmri poses higher monetary costs than fnirs.
in our study the cost of fmri was hour including the equipment and fmri technician etc.
.
by contrast in our institute the use of fnirs equipment was free.
in both cases participants required minutes for preparation up to minutes of scanning and two researchers present.
in addition each approach comes with recruitment restrictions.
for example fmri typically requires corrected tonormal vision because of the mirror projection setup and is not approved for certain populations e.g.
pregnant women or metalworkers .
in some cases participants may not be able to finish a fmri scanning due to claustrophobia.
on the other hand fnirs may place significant practical restrictions on the use of participants with dark thick hair.
in practice we found the fnirs restrictions to be less onerous resulting in unusable applicants compared to for fmri .
software engineering researchers must carefully weigh the costs and benefits.
at a high level both approaches provide broadly similar evidence.
fnirs requires the researcher to identify relevant brain areas in advance for cap construction section ii a3 and cannot penetrate some areas relevant to software engineering section v d .
while fmri is regarded as the gold standard for imaging accuracy it cost roughly more to acquire the fmri data than the fnirs data for this experiment and the environmental constraints of fmrimay influence participant accuracy section v d .
as a broad generalization researchers investigating a computer science topic for the first time may favor fmri once the relevant brain areas have been identified if those regions are accessible via fnirs a more cost effective and ecologically valid study can be conducted via fnirs.
if the proposed study requires more freedom of motion or a quiet environment involves more than one participant e.g.
pair programming face to face communication etc.
or uses metal equipment e.g.
a tablet or cellphone fmri is not an option without extra effort.
ix.
s ummary we investigated the neural representations of fundamental data structures and their manipulations.
we hypothesized that data structures are related to spatial ability.
our two key insights were the use of multiple medical imaging approaches and the use of the mental rotation paradigm to serve as a baseline for measuring spatial ability.
our study involved participants at least two times larger than previous studies investigating software engineering with medical imaging and is the first to investigate the neural representations of data structures .
we found that data structure and spatial ability operations are related both fmri and fnirs evidence demonstrates that they involve activations to the same brain regions e.g.
section v a and section v b p .
.
however the similarity relationship is nuanced spatial ability operations and tree operations admit a significant contrast and are characterized by differentiated activation magnitudes e.g.
section v a p .
.
further some regions relevant to data structures are not accessible to fnirs fnirs lacked the penetrating power to uncover the full evidence reported by fmri section v d and was unable to distinguish between two distinct tasks.
we also found that difficulty matters for data structure tasks more complicated stimuli result in greater neural activation and thus an increase in cognitive load section v c .
while a neural relationship between spatial ability and data structure manipulation may seem clear in retrospect it was not obvious to our participants of whom reported no subjective experience of similarity section v e .
since our direct comparison of fmri and fnirs is unique in software engineering we elaborate on both measurement and performance issues section v d as well as monetary protocol and recruitment issues section viii .
data structures are critical to many aspects of software engineering but no previous work has quantitatively investigated their neurological underpinnings.
using medical imaging to understand cognitive processes in software engineering is still very new this study is exploratory rather than definitive.
indeed from our perspective it may raise more questions than it answers as related to implications.
we hope that our concrete analysis of a lower cost medical imaging alternative and our direct analysis of a computing activity beyond the realm of code comprehension will encourage more researchers to investigate the cognitive aspects of software engineering.
