to attain competitiveness in complex tasks crowdsourced software developersoftenchoosetoworkwithotherscollaboratively.however existingcrowdsourcingplatformsgenerallyassumeindependent contributionsfromdevelopersanddonotprovideeffectivesupport for team formation.
prior studies on team recommendation aim at optimizingtaskoutcomesbyrecommendingthemostsuitableteam for a task instead of finding appropriate collaborators for a specific person.
in this work we are concerned with teammate recommendationfor crowdsourcingdevelopers.
first wepresent theresults of an empirical study of kaggle which shows that developers personal teammate preferences are mainly affected by three factors.second we give a collaboration willingness model to characterize developers teammate preferences and formulate the teammate recommendation problem as an optimization problem.
then we design an approximation algorithm to find suitable teammates for adeveloper.finally wehaveconductedasetofexperimentsona kaggle dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.

introduction asaprevalentdistributedproblem solvingmodel crowdsourcing has been widely applied to software development .
in recent years a number of crowdsourced software development csd platforms e.g.kaggle andtopcoder havebeenbuilttosolicit solutions to software development tasks.
in csd platforms task requestors publish tasks with detailed descriptions and a certain amount of monetary rewards.
then developers canchoose to participateindividuallyorcollaborativelyandonlyafewtopranked developers can obtain rewards according to the pre set rules.
differentfrommicro tasksincrowdsourcing e.g.datalabeling software development tasks are usually too complex for an individual thus developers prefer to join a team so as to ensure the productivityandqualityofsoftwaredevelopment .ourempirical studyonkagglerevealsthebenefitsofteamcollaboration.however today s csd platforms like kaggle provide no effective support for team formation.
as far as we know few efforts have been made to recommend teammates for crowdsourcing developers.
team recommendation problem has been extensively studied in various fields.

inourwork weaimatstudyingapersonalizedteammaterecommendation approach forcrowdsourcing developers.
first of all to verifytheimportanceofteammaterecommendation weconduct anempiricalstudyonkaggle.ourresultsshowthatdeveloperscan benefit from teamwork and they have great demand for teammate recommendationsupportincsdplatforms.ouranalysisalsoshows that developers teammate preferences is largely affected by three factors including the closeness with teammates expertise difference with teammates expertise gain through collaboration.
second we define the collaboration willingness of a developer as the weighted sum of the above three factors where the weights define the developer s personal teammate preferences.
then the personalized teammate recommendation problem is formulated as a problem of optimizing the collaboration willingness of a team.
third we further provide methods to quantify the three factors then present a linear programming based method to compute developers teammate preferences with their collaboration history.
finally based on developers personal teammate preferences we design a teammate recommendation approach with an approximation algorithm to maximize the collaboration willingness of candidate team.
the major contributions of this work are as follows we identify the personalized teammate recommendation problem for crowdsourced software development by empiricalstudyofkaggle.asfarasweknow feweffortshavebeen made to study this issue in csd.
we propose a metric called collaboration willingness of a teamtomeasurethepossibilityofsuccessfulteamformation by considering developers personal teammate preferences and provide methods to obtain the preferences and compute the collaboration willingness.
we further give an approach to personalized teammate recommendationfor crowdsourcingdevelopers basedon their personal teammate preferences and conduct a set of ex perimentstoevaluatetheperformanceofourapproachin comparison with other methods.
an empirical study of kaggle to verify the significance of our study we conducted an empirical study on kaggle.
we aim to answer the following three research questions rqs rq1 doesteamcollaborationmatterfordevelopersincsd?
rq2 is it common to see developers fail in teammateseeking without teammate recommendation?
rq3 which factors affect developers willingness of collaboration?
and do developers show personal preferences in choosing teammates in terms of those factors?details are available in google docs .
data preparation beyondthebasicsupportsforcompetitions kaggleprovidesonline communities including discussion community andkernel community where developers can discuss issues of various topics and share ideas.

phenomenon of failing to find teammates wecrawledthroughthediscussiontableinourdatasettoselectdiscussions with term team case insensitive in their titles.
discussions considered to be posted for teammate seeking purpose were selected.fromdiscussionpostersandcommenters weidentified developers who have intention to team up.
surprisingly only 825developersparticipateinthecompetitionsintheend among them merely developers work in teams.
we can infer that only .
of developers team up successfully and .
of developers give up participating which may be due to lack of teammates.
itiscommontoseedevelopers failinteammate seeking thusit is critical to provide teammate recommendation for developers.
.
affecting factors and personal teammate preferences we expended a further analysis into those discussions.
it turns out that of the posters clearly state that they hope to gain expertise improvement through team collaboration and of them call for teammates whose skill proficiency is similar to theirs.
we can draw the conclusion that expertise gain from collaboration and expertise difference between teammates can affect developers collaboration willingness.
we sorted the competitions in the dataset according to start date.
the first competitions about of the dataset are used as history data.
we selected developers who have collaborated both in history data and the remaining competitions to analyze theircollaborationrelationsandfoundthat75 ofthesedevelopers collaboratewiththeirformerteammates.theclosenessbetween developerscanbereflectedbycollaborationrelations soitisalso an important factor affecting developers collaboration willingness.
from above it can also be seen that developers put forward differentrequirementsforteammates.somediscussionposterscallfor someonewithsimilarskillproficiencytoteamup somewanttoget their expertise promoted through teamwork when some else want to collaborate with their former teammates.
therefore developers have their personal teammate preferences which our teammate recommendation approach should take into consideration.
problem formulation inspiredbytheaboveempiricalstudy weproposetoprovidepersonalizedteammaterecommendationfordevelopers.inthissection we first introduce several important concepts and then provide the formulation of our problem.
