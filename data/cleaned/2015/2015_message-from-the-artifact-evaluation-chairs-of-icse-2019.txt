message from the artifact ev aluation chairs of icse artifacts are digital objects created by researchers as part of their studies or generated by their experiments.
in the field of software engineering artifacts can be software systems and scripts used to run experiments input datasets raw data collected in the experiment or scripts used to analyz e results.
the review of artifacts provide d by authors of accepted tech nical papers increases the likelihood that research results can be independently replicated and reproduced by other researchers.
experience also shows that papers providing artifacts earn increase d citations and greater presti ge in the research community.
in this spirit and for the first time at icse the artifa ct evaluation track aims to promote share and catalog the research artifacts of paper s accepted to the technical trac k. authors of papers accepted to the technical track were invit ed to submit their artifact for evaluation.
we received submissions.
each artifact was reviewed by at least two memb ers of our evaluation committee and further assessed in the online discussion phase.
if satisfying the crit eria artifacts were awarded one or more badges which are shown on the front page of their paper and on the conferenc e website.
we thank the authors for preparing and submitting research a rtifacts.
it has been a privilege working with the members of our evalu ation committee and w ith each other across multiple time zones during the evaluation process.
