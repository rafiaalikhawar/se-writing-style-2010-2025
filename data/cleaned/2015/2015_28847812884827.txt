introduction software effort estimation see is an important step when establishing a new software projec t. accurate effort estimation will help project managers reasonably allocate the limited resource and help the marketers win the bid for external contracts.
in recent years several estimation methods have been presented .
some well known machine learning methods have also been employed for estimation such as classification and regression tree cart and neural networks nn .
menzies et al.
categorized effort estimation methods into two classes i.e.
expert based and model based methods.
literature classifies the effort estimation methods into eleven categories such as regression based anal ogy based and expert judgementbased methods.
dejaeger et al.
compared multiple estimation methods and classified them into tree rule based line model based and non line model based methods.
when there lacks historic project data in hand making use of effort data collected by other projects is probably a good idea.
however there may exist missing da ta in history data of other projects.
many factors contribute to the data missing.
the data collection requirements include consistence experience time cost and methodology for a company.
however the data collectors may lack of time cost commitment training.
besides problems applying counting rules to a particular situation especially where that situation has not been anticipated and political reasons refusal to release figures that look bad are also two reasons.
furthermore privacy issues may also cause data missing.
to solve the effort data missing problem the deletion ignoring or imputation stra tegies are usually used.
the imputation strategy was found to be more helpful for improving the estimation performance .
these imputation methods include mean imputation mei regression imputation ri multiple imputation m i maximum likelihood imputation mli and hot deck imputation hi techniques.
.
motivation organizations need to calibrate effort models with complete data if they wish to have more reliable estimates.
however in practice an organization may not have many projects to obtain such complete data and even if the obtained data from other projects is also incomplete.
the methods focusing on handling the missing data problem may offer some help in making full use of the data obtained.
although some methods have been presented to address the effort data missing problem there still exists much room for improvement.
specifically there exist the following three shortcomings the deletion and ignoring strategies will lead to loss of potential useful information current methods aiming to impute the incomplete effort data mainly focusing on the drive permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

ieee acm 38th ieee international conference on software engineering factors independent variables missing case while the effort labels dependent variables missing case is not considered current imputation methods utilize several classical imputation techniques to impute missing data yet these imputation techniques have their respective shortcomings.
mean imputation mei applies to the data that meets the normal distribution and when th e observed data does not satisfy the normal distribution mei will attenuate the variance .
regression imputation ri requires the data to be imputed has strong connection with other data yet there may not exist such strong connection between drive factors .
multiple imputation mi suffers from large influences of different data missing mechanisms .
maximum likelihood imputation mli depends on the probability relationship between variables and it is also affected by the data missing mechanisms.
hot deck imputation hi tends to work well when there are strong correlation between the covariates and the variable with missing values and thus it performs differently depending on the correlation structure among the vari ables.
hence how to develop an effective imputation approach according to the characteristics of effort data is an important research topic.
in practice the collected effort dataset may contain missing data at any locations including the missing of drive factors independent variables or effort labels dependent variables as shown in figure .
figure a refers to the case that only the drive factors are incomplete figure b refers to the case that only the effort labels are incomplete and figure c refers to the general missing case that both drive factors and effort labels are incomplete.
in this paper we aim to answer the following three questions rq for the drive factors missing case how to design an effective imputation strategy?
rq for the effort labels missing case how to provide an effective imputation strategy?
rq how to offer a unified solution for the general effort data missing problem namely the situa tion that missing data occurs in both drive factors and effort labels?
.
contribution the contributions of our work are summarized as three points according to the locations of missing values in an effort data matrix we consider that effort data missing includes the drive factor missing case and effort label missing case and design a novel imputation approach.
for the case that only the drive factors independent variables are incomplete we introduce the low rank recovery technique and design a data structurization strategy to structurize the effort data such that low rank recovery can be effectively utilized to impute the missing drive factors.
for the case that only the effort labels dependent variables are incomplete we consider the imputation under this situation as a semi supervised learning problem and employ the semi supervised regression technique for imputation.
for the general case of missing data namely both drive factors and effort labels are incomplete we firstly employ low rank recovery for imputing the drive factors and then use semi supervised regression for the imputation of effort labels.
we thus propose the low rank recovery and semi supervised regression imputation lrsri approach for this case.
we conduct experiments on commonly used datasets.
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can obtain better effort data imputation effects than other methods and the imputed data using our lrsri can apply to multiple estimators well.

solutions for missing data problem deletion ignoring and data imput ation with other complete data are three main strategies for solving the missing data problem.
and these strategies can be called missing data techniques mdts .
listwise deletion ld excludes the samples which contain some missing values .
for each variable pairwise deletion pd i.e.
the ignoring strategy removes the specific missing figure .

solutions for missing data problem in see most of current effort estimation methods aiming to solve the missing data problem mainly focus on the drive factors missing case.
some works employ ld or pd technique to tackle the missing data problem.

.
research methodology .
low rank recovery with structuralized data set for driving factors missing case in this section we aim to answer rq for the drive factors missing case how to design an effective imputation strategy?
.
one important reason for the success of cwm in the application of image data imputation is that it uses the median filter to help solve formula namely cwm considers the pixel wise structure of images.
however for software effort data samples are arranged randomly that is there is no explicit structure within an effort data set.
thus the cwm method cannot be used for imputing the incomplete effort data directly.
in this subsection we provide a data set structurization strategy to make the effort data structurized.
assume that mn m xx x x is an effort data set with missing values which only contains drive factors ixim denotes the thi sample and jxjn represents the thj column of x. here m is the number of samples and n is the number of drive factors.
suppose that j ix is a missing value located at the thj column of ix before structurizing we fill j ix with the mean of jx.
by this way we can obtain the initialized data matrix x corresponding to x. then we realize structurization as the following two steps determine the arrangement of samples with missing values in the final imputed matrix in order to make the key samples namely the samples with missing values to be structurized we need to sort these samples reasonably.
we require the adjacent structurized key samples have large correlation.
in other words the distance between two adjacent structurized key samples should be small.
and this scheduling problem can be solved by addressing the minimum spanning tree mst problem .
firstly we select samples actually containing missing values from x to form the subset ux.
next we regard the samples in ux as vertexes and the euclidean distance between any two vertexes in ux as the edge of these two vertexes.
then a fully connected graph ug can be built and the affinity matrix of the ug i.e.
ud can be defined as ... ... ... 0l l u lldd ddd dd where pqd is the distance between the thp and thq vertexes and l is the number of vertexes samples in ug ux .
based on ud we can solve the minimum spanning tree problem with prim or kruskal algorithm.
therefore we can obtain the structurized key samples and store them in x .
determine the arrangement of samples without missing values in the final imputed matrix after the key samples have been structurized we select the k nearest neighbors in x for the first structurized key sample 1ux namely the first line of x and insert the selected neighbors into the front of 1ux in x .
when the selected k nearest neighbors of 1ux are inserted into x these k nearest neighbors are removed from x. for the 2thp pl structurized key sample upx we select its nearest neighbors in the updated x and insert the selected neighbors into the front of upx in x .
by this manner we can achieve the structurized effort data set x .
it is noted that if there exist remaining samples after the neighbors of the last structurized key sample have been inserted into x we place these remaining samples into the bottom of x .
based on the structurized effort data matrix x we can realize missing data imputation column by column for the original effort data set x by using the cwm algorithm.

semi supervised regression imputation for effort labels missing case in practice the effort labels of training data may be also missing other than the drive factors yet current see methods aiming to deal with the missing data problem mainly focus on the drive factors missing case.
in fact the effort labels of training data are important for subsequent effort estimation.
in this section we answer rq for the effort labels missing case how to provide an effective imputation strategy?
.
in the effort labels missing case since only the effort labels of part of samples are missing the imputation problem can be considered as a semi supervised learning problem.
semi supervised learning is a popular machine learning manner which makes use of unlabeled training samples with a part of labeled samples for building the prediction model .
in addition the regression technique is a good choice for imputation in this case since there exists causality between effort labels and drive factors.
considering these two aspects the semi supervised regression is a suitable technique to be used for imputing the missing effort labels.
the coreg algorithm has broad applicability and achieves success in many other application fields .
in this paper we employ coreg for imputing the missing effort labels.
in the following we describe the process of using coreg for missing effort data imputation.
given a training effort data set mn tx with incomplete effort labels we divide the set into two subsets l and u where gn l l lg lg lx y x y is an subset of samples with effort labels and mg n u um gux x is an subset of samples without effort labels.
here m denotes the number of samples n denotes the number of drive factors the 1thn columns of tx and l denote the effort labels lix is the thi sample in l liy is the effort label of lix.
according to coreg we use two regressors i.e.
1h and 2h which are separately generated from 1l and 2l.
each of these two regressors is refined with the help of samples in u which are labeled by the latest version of the other regressor.
for each sample ujx u b nearest neighbors are selected from 2rlr and are stored in 2rr r r b r b xy xy r .
each regressor can provide an estimated result 2uj ujrxy r for ujx and then the training set of the other regressor can be updated as ss u j u j rllx y s s r .
here ujry represents the estimated label with rh.
then we can use rl to compute the following difference for samples in r ur rl rx rl r rl rl r rl xyh x yh x figure .

rlx and rh is the updated regressor of rh.
finally we can obtain the effort for ujx by using the estimated result of the regressor that produces the larger value of formula .
by performing semi supervised regression algorithm coreg on the effort data set with effort labels we can solve the effort labels missing case.
.
low rank recovery and semi supervised regression imputation lrsri approach for this part we answer rq how to offer a unified solution for the general effort data missing problem namely the situation that missing data occurs in both drive factors and effort labels?
.
in this general case of effort data incompletion we firstly employ the low rank recovery method cwm with structurized data set to impute the drive factors and then use the semi supervised regression method coreg for imputing the effort labels.
we name our effort data imputation solution as low rank recovery and semi supervised regression imputation lrsri approach.
the flowchart of lrsri is illustrated in figure .

experiments in this section we evaluate the proposed lrsri approach for solving the effort data missing problem empirically.
we firstly introduce seven benchmark datasets and two commonly used evaluation measures.
next we describe the experimental settings.
then we separately perform experiments to evaluate the imputation effects of our approach and the applicability of our imputation approach for different effort estimators.
.
data set in experiment we employ publicly available and commonly used datasets as the test data which includes albrecht china coc81 kemerer kitchenham maxwell and nasa93 .
the albrecht dataset consists of projects completed at ibm in the 1970s and the details can be found in .
it contains software projects that are developed by using third generation languages such as cobol pl1 etc.
the china dataset includes various software projects from multiple companies developed in china.
the standard cocomo datasets which contains the coc81 and nasa93 datasets was collected wi th the cocomo approach .
although the cocomo datasets have been established for several years it is still frequently used for validating various effort estimation methods.
the kemerer dataset is a relatively small dataset with software projects described by drive factors and effort label and the details can be found in .
the kitchenham dataset contains effort data from maintenance and development projects managed by a single outsourcing company.
the maxwell dataset comes from the finance domain and is composed of finnish banking software projects.
it is a relatively new dataset which contains projects described by attributes.
details of the maxwel l dataset are given in .
all these datasets are available in the promise repository .
considering the noisy redundant or unreliable information in dataset like in we employ the z score normalization to preprocess data.
for a variable x with mean and standard deviation the normalized variable using z score normalization can be represented as normxx .
.
evaluation measures in this paper we use three measures namely median magnitude of relative error mdmre pred and effect size which are commonly used for evaluate the effort estimation accuracy of estimators.
assume that ix is a sample its actual effort is iy the predicted effort is iy then the magnitude of relative error mre of ix can be calculated by ii i iyymrey .
then median mre mdmre of n samples can be computed as n mdmre median mre mre mre .
pred is defined as the percentage of pred ictions falling within percent of the actual values .
n i iif mrepredotherwise n .
for these two measures the lower of mdmre represents the better performance of imputation or estimation and the higher pred represents the prediction is more precise.
.
experimental settings in experiment we randomly select fifty percent of samples in the dataset to construct the training set and use the remaining samples for testing.
according to three missing data cases in figure we separately remove the values of a certain percentage of randomly selected locations for these three cases in the training set to get the training effort data with missing values.
the missing ratio is set as and .
the random selection may affect the predic tion performance.
we perform selection of training samples times for each time half of samples are randomly selected for training and the remaining half are used for testing and for the selected training samples per figure .
flowchart of lrsri.
611time we further conduct random data removing times at a certain missing ratio.
.
experimental results and analysis for this part we perform experi ments to evaluate the imputation effects of our approach and the applicability of our imputation approach for different effort estimators respectively.
.
.
comparison of imputation effects to validate the effectiveness of the proposed imputation approach we compare lrsri with five im putation methods including mei ri mi mli and hi .
the recently presented baseline effort estimation method atlm is used as estimator for reporting the estim ation results on two measures mdmre and pred .
we also use the method cart as a baseline estimator to evaluate these imputation methods.
due to limited space we report the results online .
we also report the estimation results using original complete data for comparison and the results are given by normal .
tables and separately tabulate the effort estimation results using atlm based on the imputed data with different imputation methods on seven datasets for the mdmre and pred measures.
in these two tables the estimation results of three cases are reported including only the drive factors are incomplete only the effort labels are incomplete and both drive factors and effort labels are incomplete.
we also provide the estimation results at different missing ratios in these two tables including and .
as can be seen from these two tables our lrsri approach outperforms other imputation methods especially for the case that both drive factors and effort labels are incomplete.
for the case that only the drive factors are incomplete lrsri can obtain better imputation results than other imputation methods which indicates the effectiveness of the low rank recovery technique with our designed data structurization strategy.
the low rank recovery with structurized data makes full use of the information of similar samples and the correlation of all the samples.
for the case that only the effort labels are incomplete we take advantage of the regression technique and conduct regression in a semi supervised manner such that the imputed samples i.e.
labeled samples can join in the training procedure of the regression model.
for the case that both drive factors and effort labels are incomplete lrsri firstly employs low rank recovery for imputing the drive factors and then uses semi supervised regression for the imputation of effort labels.
thus lrsri can achieve desirable imputation effects in this general case.
in addition we find that the pe rformance differences of different imputation methods are slight on small datasets like albrecht and kemerer.
when the missing ratio is large all the imputation methods will suffer performance degradation on large datasets.
the ri method can obtain good imputation results when the data to be imputed and other variables have strong connection that is the regression technique applies to the case that only the effort labels are incomplete.
for the case that only drive factors are incomplete em and mi perform better than ri which indicate that the probability based methods like em and mi can outperform regression or mean value based method in this case.
hi can achieve good imputation results when the missing ratio is low.
however the imputation performance of hi is unstable when the missing ratio increases.
to statistically analyze the results given in tables and we conduct a statistical test i.e.
wilcoxon test with percent confidence to get the so called win tie loss results.
assume that a and b are two methods and wilcoxon a b denotes the wilcoxon test between a and b. the detailed test process is described in figure .
in the figure the better function realizes the a statistic test .tables and give the statistical significance test results between lrsri and other compared methods on seven datasets for the mdmre and pred measures respectively.
we can see that the proposed approach makes a significant difference in comparison with other methods.
figure .
win tie loss test process of two methods.
to investigate the effects of our approach on model estimate variability and the relation to actual effort variability in tables and we conduct an effect size test cliffs test i.e.
cliff s delta or d .
here d is a measure of how often one the values in one distribution are larger than the values in a second distribution.
the sample estimate d is given by ij ijxxx xdmn where the two distributions are of size n and m with items ix and jx respectively and is defined as the number of times.
due to limited space we also report the variability results online1.
.
.
evaluation of applicability for different estimators in this subsection we specially design experiments to investigate whether the imputed data with our approach can apply to multiple estimators.
we select five estimators for experiment including classification and regression trees cart ordinary leastsquares ols regression ra dial basis function networks rbfn multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and robust regression ror .
we observe the general data missing case that both drive factors and effort labels are incomplete.
we take the missing ratio of as an example for experiment.
tables and report average effort estimation results of lrsri and other imputation methods using five estimators on seven datasets for the mdmre and pred measures respectively.
according to these two tables in the general missing data case the estimation results corresponding to our lrsri approach are better than those corresponding to other imputation methods which indicate that the imputed data by using our imputation approach can well apply to different estimators.
in addition the results in tables and are also consistent with results in tables and that is our imputati on approach outperforms other imputation methods on specific estimators.

threats to validity followings are several potential threats to the validity with respect to experiments bias of estimators.
a bias in this study is the estimators we used for effort estimation.
in experiments we select six commonly used estimators to evaluate our approach.
as to more other estimators experiments might need to be done to evaluate our approach.
bias of evaluation measures.
another bias is the mdmre and pred measures used to re port the imputati on or estimation performances.
other measures such as mean balanced relative error mbre the mean inverted balanced relative error mibre and cluster are not used.
in this work we employ the widely used mdmre and pred measures to show the empirical evaluation for the application of see.

conclusion and future work in this paper we study the general missing situation of effort data and consider that the incompletion of effort data comprises drive factors missing and effort labels missing.
for the specific case that only the drive factors are incomplete we structurize the effort data and employ the low rank reco very technique for imputation.
we consider the imputation in the specific case that only the effort labels are incomplete as a semi supervised learning problem and introduce the semi supervised regression technique for imputation such that the imputed samples can join in the training procedure of the regression model.
we then propose the lrsri approach for the general case of missing data namely both drive factors and effort labels are incomplete.
we firstly utilize lowrank recovery and the designed data structurization strategy jointly to impute the drive factors and then take advantage of the regression technique and conduct regression in a semi supervised manner for the imputation of effort labels.
the results demonstrate that our lrsri outperforms other imputation methods for missing effo rt data and the imputed data by using lrsri can well apply to multiple estimators.
for the future work we would like to utilize more effort datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach and study the applicability of our approach in effort data missing situation with higher missing rate.
