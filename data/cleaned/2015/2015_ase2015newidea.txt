tracking and analyzing cross cutting activities in developers daily work lingfeng bao1 zhenchang xing2 xinyu wang1 and bo zhou1 1college of computer science zhejiang university hangzhou china 2school of computer engineering nanyang technological university singapore lingfengbao wangxinyu bzhou zju.edu.cn zcxing ntu.edu.sg abstract developers use many software applications to process large amounts of diverse information in their daily work.
the information is usually meaningful beyond the context of an application that manages it.
however as different applications function independently developers have to manually track correlate and re find cross cutting information across separate applications.
we refer to this difficulty as information fragmentation problem.
in this paper we present activityspace an interapplication activity tracking and analysis framework for tackling information fragmentation problem in software development.
activityspace can monitor the developer s activity in many applications at a low enough level to obviate application specific support while accounting for the ways by which low level activity information can be effectively aggregated to reflect the developer s activity at higher level of abstraction.
a system prototype has been implemented on microsoft windows.
our preliminary user study showed that the activityspace system is promising in supporting interapplication information needs in developers daily work.
i. i ntroduction software developers are a typical example of knowledge workers .
their work produces consumes and communicates large amounts of diverse information.
integrated development environments ides have been designed to maximize developer productivity by integrating separate software development tools such as editor build tool debugger version control and project management.
however today s software development involves not only software development tools but also many other software applications specializing in different tasks.
for example developers use web browsers to search the web ask or answer questions in q a sites or communicate with other developers on social media.
the information associated with the work of developers is usually meaningful beyond the context of an application that manages it.
for example the developer encounters an unexpected error in the ide and then searches the web for solutions.
he reads some web pages and finds a solution on stack overflow.
this solution contains a code example shared on jsfiddle.net.
he tests the code example on jsfiddle and finds the code useful for his error.
he finally integrates the code example in his code.
in this example source code the developer works on program error he encounters search queries he uses web pages he visits and code example on jsfiddle are all correlated but they are managed in various desktop and web applications including ide web browser stack overflow jsfiddle respectively.
these applications function independently of one another.
this independence creates a problem of information fragmen tation forcing the developer to manually correlate and refind cross cutting information across separate applications.
for example during a task the developer may be interrupted by another task.
once he is done with the other task he needs to resume his working context across several applications for the previous task including not only source files but also stack overflow posts and code examples on jsfiddle.
as another example two week later the developer s colleague encounters a similar error.
the developer believes that one of the stack overflow posts he read before would be useful for his colleague.
web browsing history does not help much because there are too many browsing activities on stack overflow that are irrelevant to that particular error.
he recalls the source file involved in his previous task.
however the information fragmentation problem makes it difficult for him to re find the stack overflow posts that he visited while he worked on that source file two weeks ago.
today s software development practice calls for innovations to support interapplication information needs in software development going beyond tool integration e.g.
ibm jazz seahawk and information management within separate applications e.g.
mylyn context web history .
in this work we aim to develop mechanisms that unobtrusively track and effectively aggregate cross cutting activities in developer s daily work to ease the process of re finding cross cutting information across applications.
the challenge is to monitor the developer s activity in many applications at a low enough level to obviate applicationspecific support while accounting for the ways in which information at this low level fails to accurately reflect the developer s activity at higher level of abstraction.
to tackle this challenge we design activityspace system that supports interapplication activity tracking aggregation search and exploration.
we have implemented a activityspace prototype on microsoft windows.
we conducted a user study of the activityspace prototype in which we collected hours activity data from participants.
using this data we analyzed the information fragmentation problem in software development and showed that activityspace is promising in supporting interapplication information needs in developers daily work.
ii.
t heactivityspace system fig.
shows the architecture of our activityspace system.
activityspace is composed of three components activity tracker supports real time recording of the developer s activity in different applications using operating system os levelaction recordswindow informationfocused ui informationscreenshot software applications ...users action inferenceaction transcriptsdigest collecter activity aggregator recent activities digesthistory activitiesweb serveractivity analysisactivity interfacerecent activity digest viewercorrelated activity snippet vieweractivity history explorertimeline inspectortopic summary edit history inspectoros windowsapisaccessibility apisactivity trackerfig.
the architecture of the activityspace system instrumentation and computer vision techniques activity analysis identifies cross cutting activities and documents likely to be relevant based on temporal locality and activity interface provides episodic and semantic user interfaces uis to help the developer search and browse cross cutting activities and documents from various perspectives.
a. activity tracker the activitytracker component monitors the developer s actions in the applications being used.
it generates a sequence of time ordered action records stored in the action records database.
action records collect the low level humancomputer interaction hci data including window information focused ui information and screenshot.
three factors must be taken into account when designing theactivitytracker generality i.e.
easy to deploy to track the developer s actions in a wide range of commonly used software applications unobtrusiveness i.e.
do not disturb the developers normal work flow and efficiency i.e.
real time activity tracking and data collection .
at the same time the collected action data should be easy to aggregate to infer the developer s activity at higher level of abstraction.
to satisfy these design requirements the activitytracker component combines os level instrumentation and screen capture technique.
as the developer is using a software application os level instrumentation collects window and focused ui information that applications expose to operating system while screen capture technique records the screenshots which can be analyzed using computer vision techniques to infer the developer s actions.
these two techniques do not require application specific support and thus can be easily deployed in many applications and operating systems.
furthermore they can provide real time activity tracking with very little data collection overhead and will not disturb the developer s work.
os level instrumentation activitytracker uses a mouse hook to monitor mouse click actions.
the user can specify which application s he wants or does not want activitytracker to monitor.
once a mouse click occurs in a to be monitored t1 t2timelinewintitle java calendar google search mozilla firefox parentwintitle n a boundary mouse position process name firefox.exe ui name search ui type combo box ui value java calendar ui boundary parent ui name java calendar google search mozilla firefox parent ui type window wintitle n a parentwintitle java activitydisplayer src cn zju edu timeline timelineexample.java eclipse boundary mouse position process name eclipse.exe ui name n a ui type edit ui value file timelineexample.java... source code too long ui boundary parent ui name timelineexample.java parent ui type pane fig.
an example of action records application activitytracker uses os window apis and accessibility apis to extract two kinds of information window information and focused ui information.
the extracted information will be time stamped and stored as an action record in the action records database.
using os window apis activitytracker extracts the following window information the wintitle andboundary of the focused application window in which the mouse click occurs theposition of mouse click the parentwintitle of the root parent window of this application window and the process name of the application.
using accessibility apis activitytracker extracts the following information of the focused ui component ui name ui type ui value andui boundary of the focused ui component and the ui name andui type of the root parent ui component.
due to privacy reason the keyboard monitoring is disabled by default.
if keyboard monitoring is enabled activitytracker uses a keyboard hook to monitor keyboard actions in a same way as monitoring mouse click actions.
fig.
shows an example of two action records.
the first action occurs in firefox.
the developer searches java calendar on google.
the second action occurs in eclipse.
the developer works on timelineexample.java source file in code editor.
screen capture accessibility api provides a generic way to track the developer s actions in different software applications.
however it requires application developers toinvest additional engineering effort to properly expose the internal data of the application when developing the software.
as a result not all applications expose their internal data to accessibility api or not all the information is exposed1.
to deal with the variety of accessibility support and to capture the application context of the developer s actions activitytracker uses os window apis to record a screenshot of the application when a mouse click or keyboard action occurs in the application.
this screenshot provides a supplementary information for accessibility information.
the screenshots will be stored together with the corresponding action records in the action records database.
the screenshots will be used in two ways.
first it can be aggregated with the mouse position information to infer application specific actions that cannot be tracked using accessibility api for example setting breakpoint in eclipse code editor.
second replaying a time series of screenshots can help the developer recall when he did what by invoking episodic memory .
b. activity analysis as a new action record arrives on the server the actioninference component first infers an action transcript application being used developer action document involved and document content from the action record.
action transcript is stored in the action transcripts database.
then the digestcollector component updates application usage and document usage statistics for the most recent action transcripts in a fixed length time window.
these usage statistics are referred asrecent activities digest stored in recent activities digest database.
the activityaggregator component runs at a given time interval to periodically aggregates action transcripts into history activities stored in the history activities database.
an activity represents all the actions performed on a document within an application during a period of time.
further information such as correlated activities topics in documents used edit history of documents can be extracted from activities.
note that these activity analyses are time consuming and thus cannot be performed by the activitytracker .
otherwise theactivitytracker cannot satisfy the unobtrusiveness and efficiency requirements.
inferring developer actions theactioninference component first tries to infer action transcript from the window and focused ui information of the action record.
application being used can be determined from the process name attribute of the window information.
document involved in the action can be determined from the wintitle orparentwintitle attribute of the window information.
for example in fig.
at time t1the application being used is firefox.exe and the document involved is java calendar google search .
at time t2the application being used is eclipse.exe and the document involved is... timelineexample.java .
if the focused ui component supports accessibility api actioninference can use the ui name and or ui type attributes of the focused ui information to infer the developer action over the ui component.
furthermore the detailed document content can usually be extracted from the ui value attribute.
1visit for the results of our investigation of accessibility support in commonly used software applications on windows mac and linux operating systems.for example at time t1the developer action is search ui name and the document content is java calendar ui value .
at time t2the developer is in an edit component ui type the source file is timelineexample.java parent ui name and the file content can be extracted from the ui value attribute.
however not all ui components expose accessibility information to accessibility api.
this is especially the case for fine grained ui components such as buttons or ui decorators.
for example the breakpoint on the editor ruler in eclipse edit component cannot be accessed by accessibility api.
as another example the tab close button in firefox tabs cannot be accessed by accessibility api.
in such cases actioninference will use image template matching techniques to determine the ui component that the developer interacts with and to infer the developer s action.
actioninference uses two kinds of image template matching techniques for different situations as implemented in our video scraping tool scvripper .
the first technique is key point based template matching .
the second technique is template matching with alpha mask because some small icons may not have enough key points.
to detect the small icons in the screenshot the activityspace user needs to provide some template images of the icons that he wants the system to recognize and associate the template images with some actions.
once the icon is detected in the screenshot actioninference will examine the mouse position against the icon position in the screenshot to determine whether the mouse action is over the icon.
then based on the action definition associated with the icon actioninference can determine what action the developer performs in the action record.
for example actioninference can infer that the developer action is set breakpoint in code editor by recognizing the breakpoint icon and linking it to mouse action.
this computer vision based action recognition complements the accessibility information.
generating recent activity digest thedigestcollector component maintains a recent activity digest for the most recent actions in a fixed length time window.
once a new action transcript is added in the action transcripts database digestcollector finds the archived action transcripts within x minutes x by default from the latest action transcript.
it then collects the application usage and document usage statistics in these action transcripts including applications being used and the time spent on each application and document being used and the time spent on each document.
these application usage and document usage statistics constitute recent activity digest in the latest activity digest time window which will be updated in recent activity digest viewer .
aggregating history activities at a given time interval yminutes y by default the activityaggretator component will be launched to aggregate the action transcripts archived in a period of yminutes into history activities.
the new action transcripts can keep arriving after activityaggregator has been launched.
these new action transcripts will be processed in the next execution of activityaggregator .
activityaggregator assumes that the information used by the developer across separate applications exhibit temporal locality i.e.
actions which occur at closer points in time are more likely to be conceptually related.
temporal locality hasbeen applied with success in numerous settings involving user activity .
temporal locality allows activityaggregator to infer a likely relevance among different documents without knowledge of their contents or the purpose of the actions.
let a a2 .
.
.
a n be a sequence of action transcripts in the latest yminutes since the last execution of the activityaggregator .activityaggregator regards as an activity all the actions on a particular document within an application window that occur within the time interval threshold tclose minutes by default .
given the two actions aiandaj i j n aiandajare regarded as part of an activity if the time span between the two actions ai.time aj.time t close and the two actions have the same process name and the same window title.
if an application window is a sub window of the main application window e.g.
open a dialog window in an application window activityaggregator uses the title of the main application window for comparison.
if the time span of the two activities overlap activityaggregator considers the two activities as correlated activities and the documents involved in the two activities as correlated documents.
c. activity interface activityspace currently supports three semantic uis recent activity digest viewer correlated activity snappit viewer and topic summary and three episodic uis activity history explorer timeline inspector and edit history inspector .
semantic uis enable the developer to find information based on the documents i.e.
what he has used while episodic uis enable the developer to find information based on the time i.e.
when and place i.e.
where of his actions.
readers are referred to our tool website2for detailed description of these semantic and episodic uis.
iii.
e va l uat i o n we have implemented a activityspace prototype2on microsoft windows.
we invited volunteer graduate students in a user study of the activityspace prototype.
the participants installed the activityspace prototype on their working computer.
the system was configured to track user activity in web browsers firefox chrome internet explorer office software word excel powerpoint pdf reader adobe reader foxit reader text editors notepad notepad latex editor winedt and ides eclipse visual studio .
activity in all other applications are categorized as others.
in this section we analyze the collected activity data and report the post study survey results.
a. activity statistics the participants used the activityspace system for to days.
we collected in total hours activity data.
the total time of each participant is computed as the sum of the interval of adjacent action records but we discard long idle time between the two action records whose interval is longer than minutes.
table i summarizes the collected activity data in these hours.
the participants s1 s5 used the activityspace system for more than days and produced sufficient activity data for analysis.
they used the tracked 2visit for tool demonstration and installation information.applications on average more than hours per day and used large amounts of distinct documents.
table ii shows the document usage and application usage statistics by the participants s1 s5.
we can see that s1 s5 used many software applications in their work.
s1 s5 visited large amounts of distinct web pages.
distinct web pages visited by s1 s5 account for more than of all the documents used by s1 s5 while s1 s5 used a small number of distinct documents in other categories of applications.
however looking at application usage statistics s1 s5 spent only about of their working time in web browser.
this means that these participants usually spent very short time on a web page visited.
for example they often opened some web pages after search and then closed the page after a quick look.
in contrast the participants usually spent much longer time on a document in other categories of applications.

na na na b. document revisits as shown in fig.
3a about of the documents that each participant used were used in or more days.
fig.
shows the statistics of time intervals days of document revisits.
we can see that many documents revisits occur after a long time interval.
for example s2 revisited the web page user gmannickg stack overflow days after the first visit.
fig.
3b shows the percentage of revisited documents of the participants s1 s5 by different applications.
we can see that although the five participants visited thousands of distinct web pages there were only about of web pages that were visited in or more days.
in contrast in other categories of applications e.g.
latex editor and ides higher percentage of documents were revisited in or more days.
as shown in table iii the participants searched google with hundreds of distinct queries during the study.
a small percentage of queries were reused in or more days.
we find that the participants sometimes use google as a bookmark to revisit the relevant web information they visited before.

we conducted a post study using a questionnaire in which we asked the participants rate the usefulness of the semantic and episodic uis in points likert scales being least useful being most useful .
table v summarizes the participants feedbacks.
the participants found correlated activity snipper viewer useful because it supports context sensitive recall of documents previously used together with the current document s3 .
they also found activity history explorer useful because it not only provides a comprehensive overview of history activities but also supports effective ways to filter or search relevant activities documents s1 .
some participants found recent activity digest viewer useful because it allows them to quickly find recently used documents.
most participants did not find topic summary timeline inspector and edit history inspector very useful except s1 and s4.
s4 used topic summary to find the web pages he visited.
s1 made many code changes in eclipse and found edit history inspector useful to recall the intermediate code changes that were not committed in version control system.
iv.
r elated work tracking user activity .
software applications can be instrumented to log the user s activity within an application for example tasktracker mylyn and reverb .
software instrumentation usually requires sophisticated reflection apis provided by applications and gui toolkits which are not always available .
furthermore instrumenting many of today s software systems is considerably complex.
accessibility apis are standard interfaces built in modern operating systems.
they provide a generic way to access application information but what information an application exposes to the accessibility apis is determined by the application developers which vary greatly across applications and operating systems1.
furthermore it is usually problematic to derive user interest and activity from highly fine grained accessibility data without the information about application context.
to overcome this limitation our activitytracker complements accessibility information with screenshots of applications.
activity centric computing .
our activityspace system is inspired by the activity theory and the recent development of activity centric computing tools .
activity centric computing has been proposed as a computing paradigm that supports the users activities rather than the resources and tools used to perform such activities.
activity centric computing goes beyond tool integration and task centric management in separate applications.
however existing activity centric systems mainly focus on activity construction and activity resumption.
in contrast our activityspace system unobtrusively track developer activity in different applications and automatically infer high level activities and their correlations.
v. c onclusion and future work in this paper we presented our activityspace system that supports interapplication activity tracking aggregation search and exploration.
activityspace creates interapplication information scents to ease the process of correlating and re finding cross cutting activities and documents across applications in developers daily work.
a pilot study of participants demonstrated the usefulness of the activityspace prototype for supporting interapplication information needs in software development.
in the future we will investigate activity centric virtual workspace and community of practice for better supporting integrated knowledge work in today s software development practices which requires higher level information integration and management than current focus on tool integration and within application task management.acknowledgment this work was partially supported by the major state basic research development program of china programno.2015cb352201 and national key technology r d program of the ministry of science and technology of china no.
