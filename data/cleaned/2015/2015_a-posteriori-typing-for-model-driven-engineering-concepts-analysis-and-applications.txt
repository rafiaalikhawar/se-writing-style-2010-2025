a posteriori typing for model driven engineering concepts analysis and applications juan de lara modelling and software engineering group universidad aut noma de madrid spain juan.delara uam.esesther guerra modelling and software engineering group universidad aut noma de madrid spain esther.guerra uam.es abstract model driven engineering mde is a software engineering paradigm where models are actively used to specify test simulate analyse and maintain the systems to be built among other ac tivities.
models can be defined using general purpose modellinglanguages like the uml but for particular domains the use of domain specificlanguagesispervasive.eitherway modelsmust conform to a meta model which defines their abstract syntax.
inmde thedefinitionofmodelmanagementoperations often typedoverproject specificmeta models isrecurrent.however even if two operations are similar they must be developed from scratchwhenevertheyareappliedtoinstancesofdifferentmetamodels.
this is so as operations defined i.e.
typed over a metamodel cannot be directly reused for another.
part of this difficulty ofreuseisbecauseclassesinmeta modelsareusedintwoways as templates to create objects and as static classifiers for them.

a posteriori typing enhances flexibility because it allows models to be retyped with respect to other meta models.
hence we distinguish between creationmeta models used to construct models and rolemeta modelsintowhichmodelsareretyped.thispermitsunanticipatedreuse asamodelmanagementoperationdefinedforarole meta model can be reused as iswith models built using a different creation meta model once such models are reclassified.

the transformations definedas reclassifications have better performance than the equivalentones defined with traditional transformation languages because reclassification does not require creating new objects.
