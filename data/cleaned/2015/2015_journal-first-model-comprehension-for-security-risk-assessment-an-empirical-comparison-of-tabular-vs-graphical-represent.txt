vessey s cognitive fit theory predicts that graphs should be better because they capture spatial relationships.
method we report the results of two studies performedintwocountrieswith69and83participantsrespectively in which we assessed the effectiveness of tabular and graphical representations concerning the extraction of correct information about security risks.
results participants who applied tabular risk models gave more precise and complete answers to the comprehension questions when requested to find simple and complex information about threats vulnerabilities or other elements of the risk models.

risk modeling notation tabular or graphical is more effectiveinextractingcorrectinformationaboutsecurityrisks?
rq2what is the effect of task complexity on participants actual comprehension of information presented in risk models?
toanswer the research questions we design special comprehensibility tasks to measure the participant s ability to extract correct informationaboutsecurityrisksusingtabularandgraphicalmodels.
