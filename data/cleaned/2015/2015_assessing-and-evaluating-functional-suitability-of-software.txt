methodforevaluationoffunctionalsuitabilityofsoftware.
as the overall objective of this phd project is to contribute an applicable approach for measuring assessing and evaluating functional suitability of software based on a dedicated quality model the suitability of the approach is validated in an industrial setting.
the difference to existing approaches is that this approach utilizes a formalized reference task model and variability assessment oftask execution patterns for operationalization of quality factors.
this contribution provides an empirical validation of applicability and appropriateness of such a combined approach in an industrial setting.
these empirical findings are the prerequisite for the methods effectiveintegrationintothesoftwaredevelopmentlifecycle to facilitate evidence based software improvement and monitoring of functional suitability throughout the devops cycle.

threats to validity findingenoughdomainexpertsfortheexpertinterviewsandworkshops to gain enough evidence is one of the greatest challengesin this phd project.
this is also discussed in and relates to repeated measures design to describe a study design constrained by having only a limited number of participants.
