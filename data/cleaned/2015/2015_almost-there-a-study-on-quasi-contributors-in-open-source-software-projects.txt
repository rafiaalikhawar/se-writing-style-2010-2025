inthispaper weinvestigatehowandwhy quasi contributors externaldeveloperswhodidnotsucceedingettingtheircontributions accepted to an oss project fail.
to achieve our goal we collected data from popular non trivial github projects identified quasicontributors and analyzed their pull requests.
in addition we conductedsurveyswithquasi contributors andprojects integrators to understandtheirperceptionsaboutnonacceptance.wefound10 quasi contributors about70 ofthetotalactualcontributors thatsubmitted12 367nonacceptedpull requests.infiveprojects we found more quasi contributors than actual contributors.
about one third of the developers who took our survey disagreed withthe nonacceptance and around declared the nonacceptance demotivated or prevented them from placing another pull request.
themainreasonsforpull requestnonacceptancefromthequasicontributors perspectivewere superseded duplicatedpull request and mismatch between developer s and team s vision opinion.
a manual analysis of a representative sample of pull requestscorroborated with this finding.
we also found reasons related to the relationship with the community and lack of experience or commitmentfromthequasi contributors.thisempiricalstudyis particularly relevant to those interested in fostering developers participation and retention in oss communities.

icse may june gothenburg sweden igor steinmacher gustavo pinto igor scaliante wiese and marco a. gerosa we analyze projects that follow the pull request model since it is believed to offer a low barrier to entry for potential contrib utors and has been defined as the default model in wellknown social coding websites such as github and gitlab .
accordingtomcdonaldandgoggins thepull requestmodel leads to greater participation and more opportunities for review andfeedback fromthe community as wellas greatervisibilityfor potential contributors.
weinvestigate how common arequasi contributors and quasicontributions in oss projects that adopt the pull request model rq1 what are the reasons for nonacceptance rq2 and how quasi contributors perceive the nonacceptance rq3 .
to achieve thesegoals wecollectedandanalyzeddatafrom21active nontrivial and popular oss projects and we conducted two surveys one with355quasi contributors andanotherwith21projectintegrators i.e.
developers who are in charge of accepting contributions .
by analyzing this data we make the following contributions i we bring the attention to one relevant yet neglected oss developer the quasi contributor ii we provide evidence that quasicontributorsarerathercommoninpopularossprojects theyare about70 ofthenumberofactual contributors iii weelucidate 19reasonsregardingnonacceptancethroughasurveywithquasicontributors iv we corroborate these findings by cross validating the results with an additional survey with projects integrators and with a manual inspection of a representative sample of quasi contributions and v we show that nonacceptance might incurindemotivation potentiallypreventingfurthercontributions.
related work pull based development is an emerging paradigm for distributed software development that has been attracting open and closedsource projects which are migrating their code to this environment .accordingtogousios etal.
inpull baseddevelopment theworkisdistributedbetweenateam whichsubmits oftenoccasionally changestobeconsideredformerging andacore team which oversees the merging process provides feedback conducts tests requests changes and finally accepts the contributions.
previous studies on onboardingto oss e.g.
have a survivability bias focusing on who succeed or were retained.
quasi contributors show interest in participating and with proper support could become casual or regular contributors.
indeed oss communities are strongly interested in casual contributors casual contributorscreaterealvalueforthemozilla mozillacommunity wiki mostofthecodeiswrittenbycasualcontributors article about node.js .
looking only from the perspective of who survived the onboarding process may not necessarily cover the specificbarriersandperceptionsofthesealmostforgottenpotential contributors.
our results can orient oss communities on where to focus newcomers on what to expect and researchers on where to conduct subsequent studies.
previous research has studied pull based development for example gousios etal.
foundthatthedecisiontomergeapullrequest is related to recently modified the code.
they also found that of non merged pull requests are unmerged for reasonsrelated to the distributed nature of pull based development and only13 ofthepull requestsareunmergedfortechnicalreasons.they report that the decision to merge a pull request is mainly influenced by whether the pull request includes recently modified codeandthatthetimetomergeisinfluencedbythedeveloper sprevious track record the size of the project and its test coverage and the project s openness to external contributions.

from the integrator s perspective the authors reported social challenges that needed to be addressed for example how to motivate contributors to keep working on the project and how to explain the reasons for nonacceptance without discouraging them.

hellendoorn et al.
also confirm that code style is an important aspect.
a second signal that the integrators examine is whether the proposed pull request is in line with the project s goals and target which may be difficult for a newcomer to ascertain.
on the other hand integrators report that there is no difference in treatment of pull requests from the coreteamversusthosefromthecommunityandthattheypostpone the decision to merge in the case of technical factors.

almost there a study on quasi contributors in open source software projects icse may june gothenburg sweden contributors and why they fail.
our study is particularly relevant because newcomers face many challenges when they attempt to make their first contribution and understanding the problems related to quasi contributors can help researchers and practitionersthinkaboutnewguidelinesandtoolstoretaindevelopers attempting to contribute to software projects.
method the overreaching goal of this study is to gain an in depth understanding of quasi contributors.
we designed the following three research questions to guide our research rq1.how common are quasi contributors and quasicontributions?
this research question investigates how common quasicontributors and quasi contributions are in our set of selected projects.
this is an important direction that deserves investigation because ifseveralquasi contributionshaveattemptedmultiplecon tributionsandencounterednonacceptanceeachtime thismightin dicatethattheossprojectisunfriendlytoexternalcontributors orthatitscodingstandardistoohardtomeet.toanswerthisquestion after identifying our target projects we semi automaticallystudied their commit logs and pull requests.
to complement our overview of quasi contributions for each analyzed project we statistically studied the differences between unmerged and merged pull requests by analyzing the number of comments made on the pull request reviewcomments madeonthecommits commits changed files and line of codes added and deleted.
rq2.why were the quasi contributions not accepted?

identifying quasi contributors after curating our selection of oss projects we aimed to identifythequasi contributors.weconsiderquasi contributorsthose newcomers to a project who submitted pull request s but had no accepted contribution to that specific project.
we consider an accepted contribution any changes that passed the pull request cycle and therefore were merged to the project code base.
pull requests can either be open or closed and merged or unmerged.
in a first step we selected pull requests that were both closedandunmerged sincethisindicatesthatthecodereviewcycle was complete pull request closed and the contribution was not accepted pull request unmerged .
then for each one of the closed and unmerged pull requests we analyzed whether the contributor that proposed the pull request under investigation had already providedanyotherpull requests.whenconductingthisanalysis we observed that some contributors provided a significant numberofoldpull requests e.g.
before2012 thatwerenotclassified as merged.
digging into these old pull requests revealed that althoughtheyappearedasnotmerged someofthecommitsunder thepull requestswereindeedmerged butthroughthecommand lineinterface cli .

moreover weinvestigatedwhetherthecontributorcommitshad been directly merged to the main code base i.e.

we firstly analyzed the answers from quasi contributors.
afterwards we analyzed the answers from integrators and pull requests discussions to crossvalidate and enrich the results.
the analysis of the open ended questions of our quasicontributors survey was conducted in three steps.
in the first step three researchers analyzed two sets of answers with the goal of better defining and discussing the codes applied.
each cycle was followed by a discussion to reach consensus for the categorization of each item.
in the second step each researcher analyzed the rest of the answers independently followed once again by a discussion until reaching consensus for the categorization of each item.
in the third step the researchers analyzed the categories aiming to refine the classification and group related codes in more significant higherlevelcategories.inaddition wequantitatively analyzed closed ended questions rq3 to understand developers perceptions about nonacceptance.
to complement rq2 we analyzed the discussions of pullrequestsfromoursampleandintegrators answerstothesurvey.we madeuse ofthe previouslyidentified categoriesto checkwhether the quasi contributors perceptions would be confirmed.

rq2.
why were the quasi contributions not accepted?
tounderstandthereasonswhythepull requestswerenotaccepted we qualitatively analyzed the answers to an open question q5 from our first survey.
after analyzing and discussing the results we found different reasons mentioned by the quasi contributors.
theresultingreasons withthenumberofmentionsforeach are presentedintable3.toanalyzehowtheperceivedreasonaffects the developers degreeof agreement we also show thenumber of mentions for a given reason for those who disagreed with the pullrequest s nonacceptance in the thirdcolumn .
in thelast column wepresentthepercentageofmentionsofeachcategorygivenby developers who disagreed.
from the table it is possible to notice that the most common reason for nonacceptance from the quasi contributors perspective was that their pull requests were superseded duplicated .
in general therespondentsansweredthattherewasalreadysomethinginplace otherpull requestsfixedthesameissuesasmypull requests or that someone else made a similar pull request which was accepted.
an example was brought by a respondent who said the fix i submitted remained unmerged until someone else submitted the exact same fix ...the integrators accepted their identical fix and closed mine.
although respondents mentioned this reason only of them .
disagreed with the nonacceptance.
themismatch between developer s and team s vision opinionwas the second most mentioned reason for nonacceptance mentions .
in this case a high number of quasi contributors of them or disagreed with the decision.
this reason includes the cases in which quasi contributors thought something wouldbe good useful or needed to be changed while the integrators disagreed.therewerecasesinwhichtheauthorofthepull request agreed with the project members positions as reported by one respondent whenyouaddanewfeaturetotheproject yourvision can be out of tune with the vision of the project s team and this is natural.
however in cases this tag was associated with an answerfromdeveloperswhodisagreedwiththenonacceptance for example one of them mentioned that the project decided that was notabugtheywantedtoprovideafixfor andanother alittlemore nonconformist answered that because one person was skeptical.
we could also observe that lack of interest from integrators was presented as the reason for nonacceptance in cases.
in cases the developers did not agree with the way the decision about the pull request was made.
many of them had been simplyignored anddidnotreceiveanswersorreviews e.g.
itwas ignoredmaybebecauseitwasaveryminorfix and ididnotreceive answers and some of them became upset like the respondentwho stated that specific maintainer often ignores people s pullrequests and closes them without justification.
in other cases quasicontributors perceived that the community was not supportive enough to help them get their pull request accepted as reported byarespondent themaintainerwasunabletoreproducethebug ...agreater effort to reproduce the issue could have been made.
it was interesting to find bureaucracy as a perceived reason fornonacceptance withahighdisagreementwiththenonacceptance .
.regardingbureaucracy onerespondentmentioned the process is too onerous and bureaucratic.
quasi contributors mentionedthatsomerequiredstepsintheprocesshinderedtheir pull requestacceptance forexample specialtypesofsign off as mentioned by two developers introducing new features is problematicbecausethewholeteamneedstoacceptit.
inthiscase the developermentionedthatthepull requestsmatchedprojectrequirements passed tests and still were not merged because of these sign off specificities.
another interesting finding relates to license issues.
six quasi contributors mentioned signing an agreement or the impossibility of providing the proprietary code to reproduce the bug as the reason to nonacceptance.

by analyzing table we observe that respondentsdidnotagreewiththepull requestnonacceptance and .

this can indicate that not accepting a pull request can be a driving force in demotivating newcomers confirming what was stated by karl fogel if a project doesn t make a good first impression newcomers may wait a long timebeforegivingitasecondchance .thisfindingmightalso explain why most of the quasi contributors placed just a single quasi contribution.
interestingly some integrators are aware of such side effect.
four respondents mentioned that dealing with personalities and opinions is one of the main challenges that they face asoneofthemhighlighted wewanttoencouragecontributions and refusing one even for very good reasons can be discouraging to new contributors.

almost there a study on quasi contributors in open source software projects icse may june gothenburg sweden discussion in this section we provide additional discussion on the data presented in the previous section.
quasi contributorsshouldstandfortheircontributions.
we foundcasesinwhichthequasi contributordisappearedshortlyafter proposing the pull request.
even if a proposed pull request had arobustimplementation integratorswereunabletoacceptsince the proposed changeswere not addressed duringthe code review process.
we observed this by manually analyzing pull requests and it was confirmed by the quasi contributors who reported they didnotmaketherequestedchange category quasi contributor s lack of experience commitment in table .
theeagernesstocontributeisnotalwayshelpful.
wenoticed that some contributions were not accepted because the quasicontributor failed to understand the contribution process adopted by the project e.g.
contributions style or internal implementation details e.g.
do not know the difference between two variables6 .
if quasi contributorsplacedadditionalcareinunderstandingsuchdetails their contributions might have higher chances of acceptance.
the fast development cycle hinders external contributions.

further complicating this matter is that outdating can happen in a matter of days as we noticed in one review thx for the pr but this change is not valid.

typosaresometimeshardtofix.
wefoundcasesinwhichquasicontributionsproposedsimpletypofixesthatwerenotacceptedby integrators.
as one extreme example one quasi contributor added one single comma to the documentation7 but integrators found that it was better to keep the current wording than to accept additionalcontributions category mismatchbetweendeveloper s and team s vision opinion .
yet in our survey two integrators mentioned that such small contributions are noisy.
some prs were not accepted but were implemented.
we found cases where the proposed pull request was not accepted by the integrators although integrators got inspired and implementedthe proposed solution themselves .
this was also mentioned by quasi contributors who answered our survey.
it is important to highlight that out of these disagreed with nonacceptance.
no tests no fun.
in some projects e.g.
bootstrap if the proposed contribution does not come with tests the pull request is immediately closed no questions asked category lackof tests .
althoughnewcomersareencouragedtofileadditionalpull requests containing tests we observed that few of them do so.
integrators are not always kind.
although integrators mentionedinoursurveythat wetrytobeaskindaspossible wefound examples of impolite tone while dealing with quasi contributors e.g.
notcrazyaboutaddinganoptionforthis.
.thecategory lack of interest from integrators was also recurrent in our survey tone and lack of interest may demotivate quasi contributors.
truckfactordoesnotconsiderthenumberofdeveloperswill ingtocontribute.
thetruckfactor tf calculates thenumberof peopleonyourteamthathavetobehitbyatruck orquit beforetheprojectisinserioustrouble .whenempiricallyevaluated some authors observed that some highly popular projects have indeed a really small truck factor which places a strong dependency on specific contributors .
for instance the project d3has tf of which means that a single contributor is responsible for managing most of the tasks related to the project.
notwithstanding d3has quasi contributors.
that is this low tf is not related to the numberofexternalcontributorswillingtocontributetotheproject.
scratching itches plays a role.
in our first survey we asked quasi contributorswhatmotivatedthemtocontributetotheoss project.
the four most common motivations are i fixing a bug 102occurrences ii scratchingownitch 71occurrences iii improvingtheproject 52occurrences and iv altruism givingback occurrences .
this result shows that a great part of the respondents was attempting to fix a bug andscratch their own itch .
we observed that the results align with those presented by pinto et al.
who analyzed the motivation behind casual contributions.
implications this research has implications for different stakeholders.
oss integrators since both integrators and quasi contributors agree that pull requests that do not follow the guidelines are more likelytoberejected e.g.

finally a clear roadmap describing the future plans of the project might avoid pr not needed relevant .
newcomers to oss project our surveys and our manual analysis showed evidence regarding a lack of commitment of quasicontributors rq1 rq2 .therefore itisimportantfornewcomers toworkcloselywithintegrators and whennecessary standandar gue for their contributions.
newcomers should also take a moment toinvestigatewhetherthereareexistingpull requestsproposing thesamecontribution and thus avoidduplication.newcomersnot onlyshouldbackuptheircontributionswithtestsbutalsomake sure that their contributions do not introduce side effects .
cs educators some oss projects do not even review contributionsthatdonotcomewithtests section5 .still sometestsarehard to implement as one integrator stated typical case is contributor figure out a way to implement the change but not how to implement the tests.

icse may june gothenburg sweden igor steinmacher gustavo pinto igor scaliante wiese and marco a. gerosa researchers we found quasi contributors pointing a lack of interestfromintegrators.still twointegratorsalsopointedouta lack of integrators available to review.

threats to validity in an empirical study there are always limitations.
first our results only apply to developers who attempted to contribute to oss projects hosted on github.
they do not cover software developers inothersourcecodehostingwebsites.ourresultsarelimitedbyour selectionofossprojects whichonemightargueissmallornonrepresentative.
however we argue that the selected projects are diverseintermsof domain popularity andactivity section3.1provide greaterdetails .
moreover quasi contributorsare particularly relevant to oss projects in proprietary projects although developers may have similar challenges to contribute they are required to contribute.thisdistinctionmadeproprietaryprojectsunsuitable for this study.
moreover we likely did not discover all possible characteristics of quasi contributions.
with our methodology and infrastructure9 we expect similar analysis to be conducted in the futurewhensuchcharacteristicsbecomerelevant.wealsoexpectto understandthe integrators and communities perspectives about the quasi contributions.
still comparing the quasi contributors unmerged pull requests to the actual contributors unmerged pullrequests can shed additional light to the phenomenon.
whenquantitativelyanalyzingdatafromtheselectedproject we usedstatisticalmethodstomitigatethethreatsofgeneralizingdata based on our personal hypothesis.
moreover since we leveraged qualitativeresearchmethodstocategorizetheopen endedanswers to our surveys as well as unmerged pull requests we may have introduced categorization bias.
to mitigate this bias we conducted this process in pairs and carefully discussed categorization among theauthors.stillregardingoursurveys theorderthatthequestions werepresentedmayhaveinfluencedthewaytheyanswered.instead ofrandomizingthequestions wetriedtoorderthequestionsbased on the natural sequence of actions to help respondents understand thequestions context.moreover wemadeoursurveyasshortas possible noneofthequestionsweremandatory theresponseswere anonymous and participation was voluntary.
we also employed well known survey principles .
by conducting this study it was possible to observe that git andgithubdata canbemismatching whichcan leadtomisinterpretation.wenoticedthat evenwiththefacilitiesintroducedby the pull based model some projects still do not use this approach preferring to merge the contributions via git command line interface cli .
even using the cli this can be done in several ways whichcanleadtolosingtrace ofacontribution asreportedbya survey respondent eventually they copy the related code and inject inourstudy weidentified false positives in two ways.
first we compared whether the commitshashthatappearsatthepull requestexistinthegitrepository.
also we queried github users api to double check whether thequasi contributorauthoredanycommitinagivenrepository.
thisapilistscommitsthatwereauthoredbyacontributorunder differentshaidentifiers.weremovedanyduplication.second our survey asked whether we correctly identified the developer as aquasi contributor.
some respondents said that we did not.
we asked the respondents to help us by telling why they believe this happened and a summary of their answers is presented in table .
we removed these cases from the analysis and implemented heuristics to catch similar cases when possible.
table participants perception on why mistakenly identified their pull requests as unmerged reason answers no answer do not know did not give a reason amended in another commit squashed manual merge done outside github workflow self closed pr done during migration and merged outside github pr went to another repo branch conclusion forossprojectsremainsustainableandevolve itisimportantthat new contributors onboard the project fixing bugs and proposing newfeatures.however thepathtobecominganosscontributorisnotalwaysflowery.inthispaper weinvestigatequasi contributors that is osscontributors that triedto contribute but did notsucceed.
through quantitative and qualitative analysis from software repositories and two surveys with quasi contributors and integrators wefoundthatquasi contributorsarerathercommon although the majority of them only tried once.
the most common reason for nonacceptance was mismatch between developer s and team s vision opinion followed byreasons relatedto arelationship with the community while others attributed fault to the developers either quasi contributors or integrators .
still about one third ofthe developers disagreed with their nonacceptance and declaredthe nonacceptance demotivated or prevented them from placinganother pull request.
our results can be relevant for developersinterested in contributing to oss projects by bringing common issues that can lead to pull request nonacceptance.
in addition theoutcomescanbenefitthoseinterestedinbuildingsustainable communities and fostering contributions since our results include reasons that can potentially scare external members away.
for future work we plan to propose and evaluate a virtual assistant which will be in charge of helping newcomers to join a community.suchvirtualassistant whileofferingguidancefornewcomers to overcome their first barriers would lower the effort required on the integrators side.
