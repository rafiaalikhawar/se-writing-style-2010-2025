crust a bounded verifier for rust john toman stuart pernsteiner and emina torlak department of computer science and engineering university of washington seattle washington fjtoman spernste emina g cs.washington.edu abstract rust is a modern systems language that provides guaranteed memory safety through static analysis.
however rust includes an escape hatch in the form of unsafe code which the compiler assumes to be memory safe and to preserve crucial pointer aliasing invariants.
unsafe code appears in many data structure implementations and other essential libraries and bugs in this code can lead to memory safety violations in parts of the program that the compiler otherwise proved safe.
we present crust a tool combining exhaustive test generation and bounded model checking to detect memory safety errors as well as violations of rust s pointer aliasing invariants within unsafe library code.
crust requires no programmer annotations only an indication of the modules to check.
we evaluate crust on data structures from the rust standard library.
it detects memory safety bugs that arose during the library s development and remained undetected for several months.

for these programs runtime performance is critical and using safe languages with managed runtimes is not an option.
the price of using unsafe languages however is code with dangling pointers buffer overflows and other memory errors that cause not only crashes but security vulnerabilities .
rust is a new systems programming language that provides memory safety without relying on a managed runtime.
instead it employs an advanced type system that restricts the use of object
