empirical study on the discrepancy between performance testing results from virtual and physical environments an extended abstract of an empirical software engineering journal paper muhammad moiz arif weiyi shang emad shihab concordia university department of computer science and software engineering montreal quebec canada mo ari shang eshihab encs.concordia.ca abstract large software systems often undergo performance tests to ensure their capability to handle expected loads.
these performance tests often consume large amounts of computing resources and time sinceheavyloadsneedtobegenerated.makingitworse theever evolving field requires frequent updates to the performance testing environment.
in practice virtual machines vms are widely exploitedtoprovideflexibleandlesscostlyenvironmentsforperformance tests.
however the use of vms may introduce confounding overhead e.g.
a higher than expected memory utilization withunstable i o traffic to the testing environment and lead to unrealisticperformancetestingresults.yet littleresearchhasstudied the impact on test results of using vms in performance testing activities.
to evaluate the discrepancy between the performance testing results from virtual and physical environments we perform a case study on two open source systems namely dell dvd store ds2 and cloudstore.
we conduct the same performance tests in both virtualandphysicalenvironmentsandcomparetheperformance testingresultsbasedonthethreeaspectsthataretypicallyexamined for performance testing results single performance metric e.g.
cpu time from virtual environment vs. cpu time from physical environment the relationship among performance metrics e.g.
correlation between cpu and i o and performance models that are built to predict system performance.
our results show that asinglemetricfromvirtualandphysicalenvironmentsdonot follow the same distribution hence practitioners cannot simplyuse a scaling factor to compare the performance between environments correlations among performance metrics in virtual environments are different from those in physical environments statistical models built based on the performance metrics from virtualenvironmentsaredifferentfromthemodelsbuiltfromphysical environmentssuggestingthatpractitionerscannotusetheperformance testing results across virtual and physical environments.
