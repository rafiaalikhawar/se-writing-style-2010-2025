the advent of software ecosystems like github has enabled something new the ability to easily switch between projects.
developersalsohavesocialincentivestocontributetomanyprojects prolific contributors gain social recognition and eventually economic rewards.
multitasking however comes at a cognitive cost frequent context switches can lead to distraction sub standard work and even greater stress.
in this paper we gather ecosystem level data on a group of programmersworking on a large collection of projects.
we develop models and methods for measuring the rate and breadth of a developers context switching behavior and we study howcontext switching affects their productivity.
we also surveydevelopers to understand the reasons for and perceptions of multitasking.
we find that the most common reason for multitasking is interrelationships and dependencies betweenprojects.
notably we find that the rate of switching and breadth number of projects of a developer s work matter.
developers who work on many projects have higher productivity if they focus on few projects per day.
developers that switch projects too much during the course of a day havelowerproductivity as they work on more projects overall.
despite these findings developers perceptions of the benefits of multitasking are varied.

introduction multitasking is a staple of high performing professionals programmers included.
it is the ability to stop working on a task switch to another and return eventually to the first one as needed or as scheduled.
the goal is to optimize hu man resource allocation while reprioritizing tasks dynami cally .
when done well or at least in a disciplined way multitasking can yield dividends .
clearly if a task in the queue has a higher priority than the current one switch ing them can improve performance.
for example program mers encounter this when starting a new coding task whiletheirprevious urgentlyneededfixundergoestesting.
iftesting uncovers bugs the urgent fix will require attention and the new coding task will be put on the back burner.
multitasking comes at a cost though .
humans programmers included have a certain limited amount of cognitive flexibility the mental ability to switch from thinkingabout one concept to thinking about another.
limitationsapply to both the number of concepts we can juggle as wellas to the difficulty in switching between them.
for example coding simultaneously simple functions is easier than coding of them.
likewise switching between two small matrix multiplication problems is more difficult than switchingbetween two small integer additions.
as we can imagine reaching our innate limitations can result in decreased performance on all tasks and perhaps even diminished quality.
it is unknown how far multitasking can be pushed safely although some anecdotal evidence is available.
software developers have long been pushing the limits on multitasking because of the innate modularity of the development process and the independence of module processing e.g.
one can code while tests are being executed .
inopen source software developers also commonly contributeto multiple projects in the same time period bridging differ ent communities .
with the advent of social coding tools like github this has intensified.
it is not uncommon to find prolific developers contributing code to github projects in the same week.
in fact contributing to as many github projects as possible is an accomplishment valued by peers and employers alike .
there are various reasons why developers are more prolific ongithub compared to other platforms.
the features and usability provided by github play a big role .
it is one example of how novel technology benefits programmers and it empowers them github s platform is responsible for the inception of many projects that otherwise wouldn t have existed .
and the payoffs are also substantial .
with ieee acm 38th ieee international conference on software engineering so many drivers for multitasking it is easy to see how one couldcrossthelimitsfromsafe productivemultitaskingintoan overloaded mode where code output falls and bugs start to multiply.
the question really becomes where are those limits and what are their determinants?
multitasking is a complex phenomenon with costs along different dimensions.
this paper reports on a mixed meth ods study of multitasking and focus switching.
through analysis of longitudinal data we investigate how productiv ity i.e.
outputs produced per unit time of prolific github programmers is determined by the number of projects they work on how much they focus on each relative to the others and how diverse the projects they contribute to are in terms of programming languages.
notably the very plat form github that has introduced this multi project multitasking phenomenon also gives us all the tools we need tounderstand when programmers are at risk to approach their limits because of it.
further a survey of of these prolific developers was used to better understand the reasonsfor and perceptions of multitasking.
the highlights of ourfindings are that of prolific programmers have contributed to mul tiple projects per day at least once but the patternsare nuanced and the reasons vary.
within limits multitasking is associated with higherproductivity but developers perception is mixed.
productivity does not decrease so long as developerswork on or fewer projects per week.
yet developers often want to contribute to more projects regardless of their current workload.

background multitasking and performance.
multitaskinghas become increasingly common among knowledge workers .
while there is some disagreement between studies it is generally believed that multitasking has non monotonic concave effectsonindividualproductivity withplenty of theoretical evidence from psychology management andorganizational behavior e.g.
.
positive effects are attributed to several factors.
first multitasking may increase productivity since inevitable lulls in one project e.g.
waiting for information from customers and colleagues waiting for the build process to finish can be filled with tasks related to other projects .
bykeeping multiple projects active at the same time one can switch focus between those projects during periods of relative down time enabling them to utilize their time moreefficiently therefore increasing their productivity.
second multitasking may increase productivity through cross fertilisation and learning.
if knowledge and skills requiredtoworkonaprojectaretransferrabletootherprojects as well one may experience decreasing costs of contribut ing to multiple projects simultaneously as they are able torealize such knowledge transfers .
similarly exposure to more projects brings about exposure to different environments providing opportunities to develop transferrableskills.
we have found evidence for such positive effects ofknowledge transfers on productivity past experience with aprogramming language during prior work on github .on the other hand several theories explain the cognitive processes that account for decreased performance in multi tasking conditions e.g.
memory for goals .
performing a task may require maintaining some information mentally.this information is stored in the central part of the work ing memory an area of the brain with high access speed but single task capacity .
memory for goals explains how initiating a task requires strengthening its goal a mentalrepresentation of an intention to accomplish a task inmemory to the extent to which its activation rises aboveother competing goals .
therefore in a multitasking context switching to another task involves first retrievingits goal from memory especially if multiple tasks require storing state which is not uncommon for programming and this takes time.
with more multitasking one starts to incur cognitive switching costs for interrupting one task and resuming another .
ultimately too much multitask ing leads to mental congestion which negatively affects pro ductivity.
as a result workers start to experience projectoverload and become increasingly slower and more error prone .
the duration of the interruption its complexity and the moment when it occurs all play animportant role in how disruptive task switching is .
in addition to potential multitasking e.g.
when the technological context changes switching between projects on github also involves a social component different projects may involve different social contexts and different teams all of which require adjusting to.
research has found thatthe more diverse the working spheres associated with each teamare themoredisruptiveswitchingbetweenthoseteams becomes and the more it hinders productivity .
github is known to be a particularly diverse social ecosys tem wherein many social attributes become salient andcan impact impression formation and collaboration .
in summary we expect productivity benefits for those who engage in multitasking we focus on multitasking acrossgithub projects in this paper through load balancing moreefficientworkpractices learning andcross fertilisation.
however there will be a point of diminishing returns after which these benefits will be offset by cognitive overload.
focus switching in software engineering.
multitasking in software engineering is prevalent to the extent that rules of thumb have been proposed to discourage contributing to multiple projects at a time .
perhaps more sothan in other pursuits in life multitasking for programmersamounts to switching away from one well defined technical task e.g.
coding before it has been finished and onto another.
coming back to such unfinished tasks necessitates some retention of precise technical detail then refocusingon a new task and later a recall of the previous one.
developers switch focus frequently due to interruptions either external or self inflicted .
for example technicaldependenciesmayexistbetweentasks andthiscancause developers to interrupt one another for coordinationpurposes .
developers focus switching patternswithin a project are complex .
focus switches occur when changing from one task to another or when stopping work to coordinate or talk to someone else on the team .
when developers resume atask after an interruption they must reconstruct the task s context .
cues and tools can help developers pick up where they left off making it easier to remember task details but even sothere is considerable overhead involved when switching.
for 995example editing many files concurrently is found to negatively impact software quality .
similarly fragmentedwithin projectworkdrivesdowndeveloperproductivity .
in this paper we look beyond individual projects and investigate focus switching patterns and their impact on produc tivity when developers contribute acrossmultiple projects.
furthermore a recent study found that developers associateminimalinterruptionsandcontextswitcheswithhigherproductivity however they also reportedly feel productivewhen significant task switching occurs .
a possible ex planation for this disparity is that software developers arenot always able to provide an accurate retrospective report on the amount of interruptions they face in a day .
our study continues this investigation of perceived effects of multitasking on productivity.
research questions.
we frame our study in the context of multitasking across github projects i.e.
switching back and forth between multiple projects that one contributes to withinashortperiodoftime ouroperationalizationbelowis one week .
our study was guided by two research questions.first we seek a deeper understanding of multitasking andits effects for software developers active on github.
rq1.
what are the trends of reasons for and ef fects of multitasking and focus switching on devel oper productivity in github?
second having identified the important multitasking and focus switching effectors on programmer productivity we proceed to investigate how these dimensions interact and which tradeoffs between them exist.
rq2.
are there limits on multitasking and what are they before productivity is impacted?
.
methods to answer our research questions we followed a mixedmethods approach characterized by a sequential explana tory strategy .
we analyzed development activity andperceptions of prolific github developers.
we combined an analysis and regression modeling of repository data to quantitatively examine the effects of multitasking and fo cus switching on productivity and a user survey to gar ner additional qualitative insight into the developers per ceptions of multitasking focus switching and their effects.
.
data set prolific developers.
we utilized a github dataset collectedduringpriorworkthatcontainsinformationonprolificdevelopers with a long and active contribution history .such developers were identified using ghtorrent as those with at least years between their earliest and latest recorded commits and at least commits in total madeto at least different non fork repositories.
the datasetcontains details about the date size loc added removed and contents of all commits authored by developers across public repositories accessible on github at the time of mining.
commit data was obtained by cloning each repository locally and parsing its git logs and was usedfor our repository analysis.
multiple aliases used by a singledeveloper were resolved using a series of heuristics we found developers or .
with two or more aliases the maximum number of aliases per developer was eight .the languages of source code files were determined usingfilename extensions and some contextual information .groonga gcs.groonga.orggroonga groongagroonga gcstest unit test unittest unit test unit railsmroonga homebrewclear code cuttergroonga grntestgroonga groonga.org 123456groonga test unit mroonga clear code figure left sample from one developer s daily contributions during a week in .
right aggregation of the data into projects.
the x axis is the day index.
in addition we invited developers in the most active threequartiles by total count of days active for the user survey.
conceptualization of a project.
since our analysis focuses on multitasking across projects we need to conceptualizehowwedefinetheboundariesofasoftwareproject.
thenaive approach would be to consider each github repository as its own separate project.
however we observed that in some cases software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on github.
1such repositories are conceptually and technically related or even interde pendent .
it is arguably less costly to switch between such related repositories in terms of context switches than other less related repositories on github.
to account for this technicality we conservatively group all repositories owned by the same github user or having exactly the same name 2into sets of repositories which we hereafter refer to as projects.
all data about individual contributions to these repositories is then correspondinglyaggregated at project level.
this transformation ensuresthat we do not overestimate the number of focus switchesduring short time intervals.
for example the left part of figure depicts a sample from a developer s daily activity across different repositories in a week in a day repository cell is highlighted if the developerhas contributed commits to that repository that day days without any activity have been omitted .
in total the developer has contributed commits to different repositories overthe course of that week.
on the busiest day she contributedto of these.
the resulting aggregation of this data usingour conceptualization of a project depicted in the right part of figure shows contributions to only projects.
note that our definition of projectas a collection of repositories owned by the same github user is broader than the definition of project as a main repository together with allits forks proposed in the literature .
.
multi project multitasking productivity for the quantitative analysis we developed a model to investigate the relationship between outputs produced per unit time as a proxy for productivity and a multitude offactors relating to multitasking and focus switching.
herewe describe the factors and the model itself.

left s e q u e n t i a l l y right multitasking.
of employment major release a developer may experiencemany focus switches without her necessarily also juggling many tasks over a shorter interval e.g.
hour day working session .
for example suppose alice and bob both work on four different projects in a given week and are free to sched ule their tasks on each of the projects.
they both interleavetheir tasks but in different ways.
each day alice only inter leaves tasks on a single project so she never works on morethanoneprojectinaday.
bobinterleaveshistaskssuchthathe contributes to multiple projects each day.
when viewed atthisresolution bothswitchcontexts focus betweentheirfour projects over the course of a week.
we modeled the interplay between focus switching at two temporal resolutions daily and weekly 3and using different measures as described next.
.
.
multitasking dimensions projects per day.
at the finest temporal resolution day we measured multitasking activity using the number of dif ferent projects contributed to that day.
contributions are measuredbycommits.
clearly thisrepresentsalowerbound on the number of switches per day a developer contributingtokprojects in one day has to switch focus at least ktimes that day.
4similar count based metrics are used in other studies to represent task switching .
at the coarsest temporal resolution week we used the average number of projects per day avgprojectsperday as an aggregate measure of multitasking as per inactivedays excluded .
for example if alice was active for days during a particular week with the distribution of projects day different projects day d a y d a y d a y and day then we say that alice contributed to projects per day on average that week.
avgprojectsperday captures the distinction between developers who over the course of a week tend to work onprojects sequentially day to day avgprojectsperday infigure left and those who interleave contributions tomultiple projects each day i.e.
multitask avgprojectsperday .
in figure right .
weekly focus.
while effective at identifying periods of sequential and interleaved contributions the avgprojectsperday measure is not useful to distinguish how evenly develop ers divide their attention among their projects.
this differentiation is important because it has been found that morenarrowly focused developers have less cognitive burden resulting in higher productivity and quality .
for ex ample alice and bob both contributed to projects one 3one week is considered a relevant period in software development .
for convenience our two temporal resolutions both use objective time intervals subjective time intervals cannot be directly inferred from repository data.
4we assume that going from a neutral state before contributing to any projects that day to a state of focus im posed by the day s first project also counts as one switch.

fromaninformationtheoreticpointofview alice sweekly focus switching behavior is predictable knowing the historical distribution of her commits to different projects one canaccurately predict the object of alice s next focus her next contribution is more likely to be in a project to which she contributes frequently.
stated differently alice is less likelyto switch focus between projects since she spends most ofher time contributing to a single project.
in contrast there is more uncertainty in bob s behavior since he contributes more uniformly to his projects he is approximately equallylikely to contribute to any one of them in the next timeperiod.
bob is more likely to switch focus than alice.
wemeasuredtheuncertaintyinadeveloper sfocusswitching behavior or the diversity of focus switches in a givenweek using the teachman shannon entropy index a com monlyuseddiversitymeasureinmanyscientificdisciplines .
we denote this measure s focus defined as sfocus n summationdisplay i 1pilog2pi wherepiisthefractionofthedeveloper scommitsthisweek5 in project i a n dnis the total number of projects this week.
sfocusranges between when a developer contributes to a single project that week and log2n when a developer contributes equally i.e.
pi n t oa l ln projects.
similarly we measured a developer s language entropy slanguage defined analogously over the ldifferent programming languages of the files touched that week slanguage l summationdisplay i 1pilog2pi slanguage is a proxy for the overall complexity of one s contributions to different projects when writing code in multiple programming languages in addition to switching focus between different projects which involves restoring project specific contexts one also must switch focus between dif ferent languages which may involve different skills .
day to day focus.
to capture the diversity of focus switchesalsoatafinertemporalresolution day weadapted the focus shifting networks fsns developed by xuan et al.
for file level focus.
in our case for a developer contributing to nprojects in a given week her fsn is a weighted directed graph over all projects.

edges point from the earlier commit projectto the later.
the weight of the edge is the number of times the switch from itojoccurred.
for example recall the activity of the developer in figure right.
her corresponding fsn is depicted in figure .
there are nodes corresponding to the different projectsshe contributed to over the active days that week clearcode groonga test unit mroonga .
the day today switch from clear code togroonga occurred once day day the switch from groonga togroonga is also recorded since it occurred times all subsequent daysexcept the last other edges are constructed similarly.
fsns capture additional information about a developer s day to day multitasking and focus switching behavior rela tive to avgprojectsperday and s focus since they are based on time series of commits rather than just aggregate counts.
to illustrate this consider the two scenarios in figure .
alice and bob both contribute equally to two projects a and b commits to each s focus and they never multitask avgprojectsperday .
however inthefirstscenarioal ice finishes all her tasks on project a before starting work on project b while in the second scenario bob alternates between days focused on a and days focused on b. while neither avgprojectsperday nor s focusdistinguish between these scenarios the corresponding fsns shown on the right in figure capture the two behaviors.
toleveragethis weconsideredfocusswitchingasamarkov process the next state is completely determined by the current one and we measured the diversity of a developer s dayto dayfocus switches as opposed to aggregated at weeklevel with sfocus using markov entropy .
we refer to the measure as sswitch defined as sswitch n summationdisplay i bracketleftbigg pi summationdisplay j ip j i log2p j i bracketrightbigg where iis the set of outgoing neighbors of node i e.g.

amount of multitasking do developers multitask?
weexamineddevelopers commit activity and also asked survey participants to report the number of projects they contribute to in an average dayand week.
from the repository analysis we found thatmultitasking across projects over the course of a week isnot uncommon developers contributed to multiple projects in of the developer weeks in our dataset or out of .
the answer is not quite as clear for dailymultitasking.
consider the distribution of developers me dian avgprojectsperday figure for each developer the median is computed across all weeks when they contributed to multiple projects.
for example a developer withmedian contributes to a single project per day on av erage at least half of the weeks since avgprojectsperdaycannot be smaller than by construction i.e.
she has a tendency to work sequentially.
the distribution is right skewed .
.
even when contributing to multiple projects during a week some developers still frequently fo cus on only few projects each day out of had median out of did not contribute on average to more than .

still almost all developers out of contributed tomultiple projects per day at least once.

does within day multitasking scale with the number of projects per week?
we investigated whether contributing to more projects each week is also associated with contributing to more projects daily therefore with morewithin day focus switches as one would expect.

reasons for multitasking our survey investigated reasons for working on multiple projects.
we asked the respondents to indicate using afive point likert type scale their agreement to a number of statements about how the projects they contribute to are related.
as shown in figure interdependencies personalinterest and social relationships were all stated as strongreasons for contributing to multiple projects.
participantswere also able to provide other ways the projects they contribute to are related common responses were that they are an end user of the software tool and want to fix bugs im pacting it and that they contribute to a mix of projects dueto their job as well as their personal interests.
wealsoaskedaboutreasonsforswitchingbetweenprojects when working on multiple projects.
the strongest were allrelated to a need being identified in another project ei ther because of dependencies newly created issues or a re quest from another developer.
the summarized responses are shown in figure .
again there was space for partic ipants to describe other ways they schedule their work on multiple projects.
the most common write in answer men tioned by five respondents was that they simply liked to change focus for the sake of working on something different.
for example one participant said i find it easier to producequality code if i break up long stretches working on a singlecodebase with time spent on a completely different problem.it freshens up the mind.
this response indicates that increased motivation could be a positive reason to multitask.

as expected projects and languages have significant positive effects.
developers who contribute to more projects and who use more programming languages are associated with more lines of code added per week.
together these two effects explain about of the variance explained.
more interestingly s focushas a strong negative effect accounting for of the variance explained.
recall thats focuscaptures a developer s overall project focus at week level the lower the value the more of one s time goes intoa single project the higher the value the more evenly one divides their attention across projects .
developers keeping fewer projects as their focus rather than spreading themselves thin are associated with more loc added per week.s language paints a similar picture focusing on fewer languages requires less context switching between them and is associated with more loc added per week.

day to dayfocusswitching s switch alsohasastrong significant effect of the variance explained .
recall that sswitchcaptures the diversity of day to day focus switches higher values indicate more repetitive behavior .
the positive coefficient suggests that repetitive predictable day today switches are associated with more loc added per week.
psychology research suggests that repetitive work is asso ciated with lower levels of arousal and decreased pro ductivity with switching tasks being one source of stimulation to counteract this effect .
our result suggests that switching between projects on consecutive days is more expensive than it is stimulating a more repetitive day today work pattern is associated with more outputs produced.

.
perceived impacts of f ocus switching while our repository analysis is limited to locadded per week our survey responses touch also on other impacts.
positive impacts.
we asked developers about the impacts of contributing to multiple projects in parallel responses summarized in figure .
the impact with the highest level of agreement was that contributing to multiple projects increases the chances of each project succeed ing.
there was a weak correlation between the number ofprojects a developer reported contributing to each week and their perceived impact of this behavior on project success rho .

.
this shows that the more crossproject focus switching a developer does the more they be lieve this will increase the project s success.
this could in dicate that some developers especially those who do multitask frequently are aware of the knowledge transfer benefits .
in fact many respondents described this bene fit e.g.
working on different projects especially when the ecosystem programming language runtime environment varies greatly increases the chance to take advantage of things learned from one project in another.
ofrespondentsalsoagreedthatwhenworkingonmultiple projects they are able to resolve more issues.
respon dents noted several reasons for this such as the reduced wait timewhenworkingonmultipleprojects.

other positive impacts noted in the open ended responses include an increased social network and reduced overall effort for example due to fixing abug in the correct location rather than implementing multi ple workarounds in many dependent projects.
negative impacts.
however participants were not very positive about the effects of multitasking on the quality of their code only agreed that they introduce fewerbugs when switching focus.
in the open ended responses themost commonly cited negative impact was related to thecost of context switches e.g.
one participant stated working on multiple projects also requires more context switch ing mentally which can be a drag on productivity.
confusion.
for three of the statements relating to the impact on productivity contribute more code the response variable we studied also quantitatively review more pull requests and feel more productive there was a high amount of variance in the responses some believe they aremore productive while working on multiple projects whilenearly as many believe that they are not.
we did observea difference in responses based on how many projects developers reportedly contribute to.
comparing the responses of those who switch focus across many projects with thosethat do not project per day or projects per week wefind that the more frequent focus switchers are more likely to report positive benefits from this multitasking .

quantitative analysis while the discussion above paints a general picture of the directionality of the various multitasking effects on outputs produced per unit time the model in table also yields in teresting two way interactions.
we illustrate the interpreta tion of such interaction terms with the example projects avgprojectsperdaylog locadded projects 4 .04min projects .24max projects 9 .
figure13 interactionprojects week avgprojectsperday avgprojectsperday.
keeping all other variables constant the interaction can be described by locadded 1 projects 2 avgprojectsperday 3 projects avgprojectsperday where 1 2 a n d 3are the coefficients in the model.
to understand this interaction we follow the standard practice of varying one term while holding the other con stant and vice versa.
for example fixing projects allows us to examine the effects of increasing avgprojectsperday ont h er e s p o n s e what happens to loc added per week as there is more daily multitasking?
for different levels of projects.
we illustrate this process in figure where the two re gression lines shown in black correspond to the extremes ofprojects and in our data set .
when projects is atits lowest increasing avgprojectsperday is always associated with an increase in the response since the slope is positive .
.
in other words more daily multitasking is associated with more loc added per week for developersthatonlytakeon2projectsperweek.
attheotherendofthescale whenprojects avgprojectsperdayisalwaysassociated with a decrease in the response since the slope is negative.
in other words the more daily multitasking the fewerloc added per week if developers take on too many differ entprojectsthatweek.
resolving 3projects 0allows us to estimate the point of diminishing return i.e.
projects horizontal regression line shown in gray .
combiningthe two findings we conclude higher average daily multitasking is associated with more outputs produced per week albeit with diminishing returns as long as developers don t take on more than projects per week.
similarly we express tradeoffs between the other dimensions of multitasking and focus switching by investigating theinteractionbetweentwootherpairs avgprojectsperday and sswitchand projects and sswitch.
the interaction between avgprojectsperday and sswitch reveals that higher average daily multitasking is associated with more loc added per week when one s day to day focus switching is more repetitive .
this suggests that one can handle more complexity each day as long as one doesn t haveto also handle more complexity day to day.
the interaction between projects and s switchshows that increasing the weekly total number of projects is associatedwith increases in outputs produced when developers don t follow too repetitive day to day patterns .
this suggests that taking on manyprojects canpreventboredomand bebeneficial however if switching between them becomes too repet itive productivity decreases.
8we find a similar result at month level increases in avgprojectsperday are associated with increases in locadded per week below projects per month in total.

this could imply that developers do not have a good sense ofwhen to stop multitasking despite the negative effects toproductivityoutlinedbytheoryandconfirmedbyourmodel.

the exception is the impact to code quality bugs introduced to which all participants respondedequally negatively.

discussion .
implications for software practice we found that developers do a significant amount of multitasking across projects over the course of a week.
devel1002opers indicated that the most common reason for this multitasking is the interrelationships between projects.
focusswitches often occur because of a need identified on another project indicating that such focus switching is not planned but occurs because of necessity.
multitasking is beneficial.
yet we found that despite these unplanned interruptions developers who switch focusacross projects generate more outputs than those who do not.
switching projects allows developers to make more ef ficient use of their time when one project reaches a lull and providesthemwithopportunitiesforlearningandknowledgetransfer as discussed in the background section.
however perceptions towards multitasking and its effect on productivity are varied.
those who do multitask are more likely tobelieve multitasking can be beneficial.
software teams couldbenefit from practices and tools that support team work as signment that account multitasking.
there are limits on multitasking.
however we found that limits exist on the amount of focus switching one canparticipate in before their productivity begins to decline.yet developers lack a good sense of when to stop multitasking.
nearly half of all survey participants would prefer to contribute to more than their current number of projects.we saw no differences in response based on the number ofprojects a developer already contributes to indicating theydonotseemtobe awareof thelimitsofmultitasking.
hence developers could benefit from tools which predict and notify of approaching such limits based on their work patterns.
.
research agenda whileourinvestigationresultedinsignificantnewinsights on multitasking and focus switching across projects thereare still many unanswered research questions opening some interesting avenues for future research.
predicting productivity impacts.
o u rm o d e lc a ni d e n tify the effects of various features of multitasking on developer productivity.
a logical next step would be to use thesemodels to predict the productivity of individual developers based on their past contribution patterns.
a predictive model could be the foundation of a tool that can monitordeveloper focus switching behavior and provide warnings todevelopers or their managers when risky patterns emergethatcouldindicateproductivity willbenegativelyimpacted.
further investigation of non multitaskers.
our survey participants who reported no or very little multitasking were more pessimistic about the impacts of multitasking ontheir productivity and project success.
future work can in vestigate why developers choose not to multitask.
do nonmultitaskers contribute to projects with fewer dependencies to other projects resulting in a reduced need for multitask ing?
if the projects do not have fewer dependencies howdo non multitaskers avoid switching focus when these de pendencies necessitate changes in another project?
do they simply create an issue on that project and wait for someone else to make the change resulting in reduced productivity?the answers to these questions can result in the conceptual ization of methods and tools designed to change the perceptions and habits of these developers to promote an increase in multitasking to reap the associated productivity benefits.
further investigation of reasons for focus switches.
we identified limits to multitasking.
contributing to moreprojects per week is associated with more outputs produced as long as developers do not work on too many projects in asingle day.
future work can investigate reasons for this find ing.
perhaps the reasons for focus switching is different for those who contribute to many projects per day compared to those who contribute to only a small number of projects perday.
the differences between these two groups may provideadditional insight revealing which focus switching reasons are more likely to result in increased productivity.
with a greater understanding of the beneficial focus switches toolscan be devised to help developers distinguish between thevarious interruptions they face.

threats to validity alldevelopersinourstudyarehighlyprolificcontributors and our survey respondents were self selected.
thus ourresults may not generalize beyond this research setting.
the thematic analysis of the survey was performed by only one person introducing a possible risk of unreliable results.
we define projects by aggregating repositories related by name.
given the ease with which different projects candepend on each other on github determining the exact boundaries of a project is difficult.
our definition mayoverly combine repositories but we believe it makes contextswitches more likely to be between distinct entities.
the re sults may be different if a coarser or finer grained definitionof project were to be used.
the aliased user identities refer to the original author of the commit while the dates chosen are from the committerfields which mark when the change was finally added to themain repository.
these fields can be different if the commit was originally created in a fork.
we found the author and committer to be different in only .
of commits so wedo not believe this will significantly affect the results.
weconsideredcontributionsascommitsonly.
othertypes of contributions could also be considered in future work.
theprojectsweextractedwerebasedondatafrom github and ghtorrent which limits the generalizability.
finally measuring productivity as loc added per week or any other count of user interaction with the artifact is certainly somewhat naive and incomplete.
however it is neitherunprecedentednorunjustifiedbypriorresearch .
.
conclusions programmingismulti faceted inherentlyinvolvingcontextswitching.
with the advent of ecosystems like github a n other tier of context switching becomes possible switchingbetween projects.
using a mixed methods approach sur vey quantitative analysis of mined data we study this phenomenon.
we find that up to a certain point switching between projects is associated with productivity increases butbeyond that it appears that overall output of developersdeclines.
yet the survey responses indicate that develop ers seem to believe it s always better to work on ever more projects regardless of how many they already work on!
our work isactionable managersanddeveloperscantakeadvantage of our findings to manage both the number of projectsthey work on and the intensity of their context switching.
