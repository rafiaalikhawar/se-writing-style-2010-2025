we investigate which qualities maintainers intend to signal and how well badges correlate with those qualities.

in short .
introduction contemporary software development is characterized by increased reuse and speed.
open source software forges like githubhost millions of repositories of libraries and tools which developersreuse liberally creating complex often fragile networks of interdependencies .
thishas earned githuba reputationas a one stop shop for software development and as an influencer of practices in both open source and industry .
the devops culture alsocontributestothisacceleration withitsemphasis on automation and rapid deployment.
as a result developers areexpectedtomakemor edecisionsat higherspeed e.g.
finding which libraries to depend on and which projects to contribute to.
akeyenablerofthisdecisionmakingprocessisthe transparency provided by social coding platforms like github .
the development history of open source githubprojects is archived and publicly accessible in a standardized format and user pages dis play aggregate information about one s contributions and social standing in the community e.g.
through starsandwatchers .

using visible cues known in the literature as signals collected from personalprofileandrepositorypages developerscanbettermanage their projects and dependencies communicate more efficiently becomeinformedaboutactionitemsrequiringtheirattention learn socialize andformimpressionsabouteachother scodingability personal characteristics and interpersonal skills .
however open source ecosystems are also competitive.
in order to survive and thrive projects must successfully attract and retain contributors and fend off competitors .
in a social coding environment the visible signals enabled by transparency can therefore beseenasasurvivalmechanism withhighprofile signalers benefiting the most.
for example more popular and famous projects attract more contributors coding rock stars collect thousands of followers and visible traces of developer actionsandinteractionsareusedinrecruitmentandhiring .
here we focus on repository badges images such as embeddedintoaproject sreadme oftengeneratedon demand reflecting the current status of online services the project is using e.g.
continuous integration and dependency management.
from a signaling theory perspective badges can be seen as easily observable signals used by maintainers to convey underlying qualitiesoftheirprojects e.g.
codequalityandadherencetobest practices.
the resulting increased transparency hard to observe qualities become salient may impact users and contributors decision making and the project s chances of survival.
badges can also beseenasa gamificationmechanism i.e.
agame likeincentive designed to engage participants e.g.
a badge with real time codecoverageinformationmayactasanincentiveforcontributorsto improve the project s test suite.
in summary badges are a potentially impactful feature in transparent social coding environments.
however the value and effects of badges are not well understood.
in this paper we explore two main research questions regarding badges.first weexplorethephenomenonquantitativelyandquali tatively andask rq whatarethemostcommonbadgesandwhat does displaying them intend to signal?

in summary we contribute a survey among npmdevelopers a large scale analysis of npmpackages and their history and an in depth analysis using multiple regression models andtime seriesregressiondiscontinuitydesigns of8hypotheses regarding the effect of badges on various qualities showing many badges are indeed reasonably reliable signals.
furthermore we frameourdiscussioninthecontextofsignalingtheoryandconfirm that badges based on assessment signals are more reliable.
theoretical framework wearguethatbadgeareintendedtosignalanunderlyingquality abouttheprojecttopotentialusersandcontributors.inaddition certainbadges e.g.
codecoverage mayencouragecertainkinds ofpractices orattemptstoimprovevisiblescores.therefore we frameourstudyinthecontextofsignalingtheoryandgamification.
signalingtheory.
signalingtheoryiswidelyappliedto selection scenarios in a range of disciplines from economics to biology .inthesescenarios the signalerbenefitsfromactionstaken bythereceiver e.g.
beingselectedoversomealternative which wouldnothaveoccurredintheabsenceofthe signal.signalsare observablepiecesofinformationthatindicateahiddenqualityof the signaler.
receivercost to interpret the signaltends to outweigh signal accuracy with less reliable but more easily obtainable signals being preferred by receivers over more reliable signals that are costlier to observe or assess .
the classical example in economics is job market candidates signaling their quality through education holding a degree from a prestigious institution is easily observable and communicates to potential employers the candidate sability whichisotherwiselessreadilyobservable .selection scenarios occur routinely in open source e.g.
choosing which librariestodependon repositoriestowatch developersto follow o rh i r e and projects to contribute to .
the phenomenon underlying signaling theory is information asymmetry whichoccursbetweenthosehavingalltheinformation and those who could potentially make better decisions if they had all the information.
to reduce information asymmetry actorsrelyonobservablesignals e.g.
informationincvs .information asymmetry also occurs in the open source selection scenarios above.
evenif activitytracesare typicallypublicly accessible not allinformationisequallyaccessible withsomerequiringspecialized mining e.g.
of git histories and issue trackers.
for example to avoid outdated possibly vulnerable dependencies developers mayadoptadependencymanager e.g.
gemnasium david to receive notifications when a dependency is updated however to potential users of the package this practice is very difficult to recognizeunlessitismadeobvious.abadgereportingtheresultof the same analysis e.g.
david s indicates publicly that the tool is not only enabled but also used regularly.
that is weargue that repositorybadges are signals bymaking certain information about the project s code base or practices transparent badges contribute to reducing information asymmetry between maintainers insiders and users and contributors outsiders .
researchhas confirmed thatintransparent socialcodingenvironments observablesignalsinonlineprofilesareusedasindicationsofexpertiseandcommitment e.g.
stack overflow reputationscore githubfollowersandlongestactivity streak.
we expect that repository badges may have a similar effect.
assessmentsignals.
theliteraturedistinguishesbetween conventional signals andassessment signals .
both are used but the formerarenotinherentlyreliable thequalitytheyindicateisestablishedbyconventionandthesignalistypicallycheaptoproduce thereforeeasytofake.thelatterareconsideredmorereliable because thequalitytheysignalis wasted intheproductionofthe signal and the signal tends to be more expensive to produce for anindividualwithlessofthequality .therefore forasignal to be effective it must be both i observable i.e.
readily noticeablebyoutsiders otherwiseitmightgounnoticed and ii costly toproduce suchthatonlyhigherqualitysignalerscanabsorbthe costtoproduceit .thereisa greatdiversityofbadgeswhich despite being equally observable on readmes vary widely in productioncost.some e.g.
david s indicate relativelydeeptechnicalqualitiesthatareachievedwithspecific arguably costly practices.
others indicate technical or non technical butrelativelyshallowqualitiesthat areeasytolookupelsewhere e.g.
and andothersstillaremere statementsofintentionswithoutanyautomatedvalidationandthus withoutanyassociatedcosts e.g.
and .
our goal is to evaluate the reliability of badges as signals by assessingsignalfit i.e.
theextenttowhichsignalscorrespondto the desirable unobservable quality of the signaler described by the strength of the statistical association between public information the signal and private information the unobservable quality.
gamification.
using game design elements in non gaming contexts ismainstreamin socialprogramming environments e.g.
onq asiteslike stackoverflow.thesegamification elementsareknowntomotivateexistingusers aswellas attract new users at the detriment of other platforms .
despite being voluntarily displayed on project readmes by maintainers and not earned based on performance and automatically displayed by the platform we argue that repository badges arealsogamificationmechanisms.sincebadgestypicallyrepresent best practices and tools e.g.
continuous integration code coverage dependency freshness there is little incentive for maintainers todisplay badges indicativeof bad practices e.g.

3r q badges on npm we study the adoption and effects of badges in the npmecosystem.
npmis a package manager and corresponding repository launched in currently hosting package releases for distinct packages.itwasoriginallydesignedfor node.jsdevelopers butis usedmorebroadlybymanywebdeveloperstoday.asinotherpackage managers and repositories e.g.
mavenandrubygems a nnpm package bundles files typically javascript with a readme and metadata package.json which includes the unique release version and dependencies toother packages.
a clientinstalls and updates dependenciesfromthecentral npmrepository.the npmcommunity is generally considered innovation friendly frequently adopts external packages values making it easy to contribute and publishpackages andshowsahealthycompetitionbetweenmultiple equivalent packages to solve any single problem .
we chose npmbecause it provides api access to all package releasesandmetadata includingdownloadcounts most npm packages point to a githubrepository the npmregistry and githubbothprominentlyshowthepackage sreadmefile providing a common place where badges are displayed and the npmcommunity is innovation friendly and broadly experiments with and adopts developer services including cloud based continuous integration dependency managers and badges.
.
research methods toexplorewhichbadgesarecommonandwhattheyintendtosignal rq we conducted a survey and mined repositories at scale.
survey design.
to gauge perceptions and anticipated effects we designedtwoonlinesurveystargeting npmpackagemaintainers and corresponding githubcontributors the former focused on what maintainers intend to signal about their packages by displaying badges and what effects if any they expect badges would have ontheirusersandcontributors whilethelatterfocusedonwhat inferences contributors make about a package given its badges for the specific questions see appendix .
both groups were asked to namespecificbadgeswhenanswering.weusedmostlyopen ended questions with free text answers and we piloted the survey first.

we analyzed the textual responses using standard open coding techniques.

we started mining all npmpackagesonjuly11 thenkeptonly346 369that hadmetadataondownloads releases dependencies dependents andmaintainersand linkedtoa githubrepository.in11 cases when multiple packages linked to the same githubrepository 1we kept only the most downloaded one which further reducedthesizeofoursampleto322 .next weattemptedtoclone allgithubrepositorieslocally andsucceededfor294 941packages the others repositories were either private or missing.
toidentifybadgesandtheirevolution weusedthegithistoryof eachrepository sreadmefile.2thiswasiterative webeganby matchingthemarkdownexpressiontypicallyusedtoinsertansvgbadge i.e.
image url service url butdiscovered packages with badges added as plain html markdownreference links and png.
consequently we converted the markdown to html and matched imgtags.
to reduce false positives not all images are badges we curated a list of services frequently associatedwithbadges e.g.
travisandcoveralls anddevised regular expressions for classification.
we then split all images into other badge orother images anditerativelyrefinedtheclassification rulestodefinebadgeclassesforspecificservices suchas travis.
to support the iterative process we generated web pages showing allfoundbadgesperclasstoinspectthemmanuallyforaccuracy.
as needed we refined our classification until we reached stability very few false positives in each class and until the other badge category comprised only obscure badges and non badge images.
overall we identified kinds of badges examples in table .
by analyzing readmes longitudinally following only first parents in the commit history so as not to detect temporary discrepancies betweenthemainlineandotherbranches wecouldidentifythedates whenbadges wereintroducedorremoved.
notethatwe analyzed badges on github not npm.githubprovides a finer temporal granularity of commits whereas npmtypically shows the same readme files but only updates them with each new release.

.
data and methods data analysis.
to evaluate the badges signaling reliability we proceed in three complementary steps per hypothesis.
step1 correlation.

aligning the history on the intervention date we can compare9 monthtrendsbefore afteraninterventionacrossmanypackages lookingforsuddenjumpsattheinterventionandlong term differences in trends.

to account for projects that adopt multiple badges .
we align on the first badge adoption but add controls for the adoption of other badges if they occur within days of the first badge adoption.
as usual the controls allow us to isolate the effects of individual badges.
the intuition is that given the resolution of our analysis interventionswithin15dayscanbeconsideredassimultaneous.lateradoptionsarenotconsidered existingonlyin17 packages but also do not systematically bias any specific month.
repository mining and operationalization.
using the same dataset packages .
we collected besides badge adoption datafromthreesources bothforacurrentsnapshotforsteps1 and2 july2017 andlongitudinallyforstep3 monthly january july package metadata on npmusing the npmapi e.g.
downloads releases dependencies githubprojectdata using the githubapi andghtorrent e.g.
contributors issues pullrequests and thepackage sgitrepository cloned locally e.g.
code size badges tests .specifically wecollected the following data.
representing readily available signals of an npm package we collected download statistics npm the number of stars and issues github commit counts git and the size of the readme file in bytes git .
as further controls we collected the package s age npm the size of the code base in bytes git thenumber of dependencies per package npm and the number of dependents i.e.
other packages depending on the package npm .
weoperationalizethequalitiesinourhypotheseswiththefollowing metrics for which we collect both current and historic values indicator of code quality h1 we measure the relative size of the test suite by identifying files and directories that referto test code reusing the detector maintained by the package searchservice npms.io.wemeasuresizeinbytes asitisrobust to different test frameworks and file formats.
indicator of contribution quality h3 we measure how many pull requests contain test code github using the same mechanism to identify test related files.
indicator of users and popularity h2 h6 h5 h8 we collect download counts from npm.

theaveragedistancebetweenthe specified version and the most recent release.
assuming that larger version changes require more effort to update we assign a distanceof 1for eachchange ofa patchversion 5per minor version change and per major version change.
an up to date dependency has distance .
details of the metric including how version ranges are handled are described in the appendix.
indicatorofsupport h7 wecollecttheaveragetimebetween whenanissueisfirstpostedandwhenitisclosed forall github issues closed in july as the package s average issue latency.
threats tovalidity.
imperfect measures.
our operationalized measures can only capture some aspect of the underlying quality indicatedinthesurvey.forexample largetestsuitesareanindicator ofgoodtesting practices butneither theonly northe mostreliable indicator.
however while individual packages may vary in their practices thelargesizeofthedatasetswestudyimpliesareduction to the mean in terms of individual behavior.
therefore we expect that by averaging over thousands of packages in our regressionmodels our imperfect measureswillmeaningfullyreflectthe intensity and directionality of underlying relationships between badges and project qualities.
to ensure internal validity in our analysis steps and we removeoutliersandexploredifferentoperationalizations whenever practical to improve robustness.
we further account for manycovariates especially otherreadilyavailable signals but wemaymiss other confounds easily observable by humans but hard to assess automatically e.g.
the quality of the documentation beyond our proxy of readme file size.
consequently one must be careful when generalizing our results beyond the studied measures.

research questions.
weansweredtworesearch questions.first exploring the most common types of badges and their intended signals rq we found a diversity of badges and signals some are merely static displays of existing information others aggregate information that is otherwise much harder to observe e.g.
reflecting build status up to dateness of dependencies andtest coverage.
as predicted by signaling theory our survey revealedthatpackagemaintainersdisplayingbadgeshaveclearsig nalingintentions when evaluating packages.
second exploring the fit of the signals to underlying qualities hypothesized by our survey participants rq we found that packages with badges tend to skew towards having more of the quality they signal with stronger effects for the non trivial quality assurance and dependency manager badges.
moreover the presence of badges consistently adds explanatory power albeitlittle toreadily availablesignals.time seriesanalysis further revealed thatthe introduction of quality assurance badges tendstocorrelatewithpositive intervention effects theunderlying qualities they signal tend to improve immediately especially improved dependency freshness and more tests in pull requests.
gamification effects.
our results also revealed gamification effects clear examples are the quality assurance badges displayingtestcoveragepercentages .
whichwefoundtocorrelate withdevelopersincreasingthesizeand arguably qualityoftheir testsuites.dependency managementbadges .
couldalsobe seenasagamificationmechanism bymakingtheup to dateness of dependencies noticeable they create an incentive for developers to make the most out of their dependency management tools by stayinguptodate.onecanimagineotherbadgeswithgamification value e.g.
aroundbugfixing beingusedinthefuturetoencourage desirablepractices.however weadv ocatecautioninimplementinggamificationandacknowledgetheriskofcreatingthewrong incentives e.g.
writing tests only to maximize coverage.
the power of assessment signals.
as discussed in signaling theory makes an interesting distinction between conventional signalsandassessmentsignals wherethelatterrequirethatthesignaleractuallypossessesthesignaledquality.althoughafewsurveyparticipantssuggestedintendedsignalsforinformationbadgesand supportbadges .
the theory predictsthat withoutanassociatedcostoranalysis theyarelessreliablesignals.ourresultsseem toconfirmthatqualityassurance dependencymanager andpopularity badges mostly assessment signals provide more reliable signals than information badges mostly conventional signals .
for example theeffectonfreshnessisstrongerandlongerlastingfor theassessmentsignal.interestingly informationbadgesoftendo signalsomething evenoutsidetheirdomainofcost infact indata exploration we often also found other small effects of other badges onvariousqualities .wespeculatethatbadgesareoftenadopted during a general maintenance phase in which also test suites ordependencies are improved but we expect that only assessment signals correlate with lasting change .
.theresultsencouragemorebadgestobedesignedasassessment signals.forexample severalbadgesthatcurrentlyonlystateinten tions suchas or couldberedesigned toreportanalysisresultfortheunderlyingquality suchaspastconformancetocodingstandardsorresponsivenesstosupportrequests.
such badges may encourage stronger conformance and even accruegamificationbenefits.interestingly slackoffersmultiplekinds ofbadges includingoneinvitinguserstojoin andone that shows the number of currently active and registered users .
in practice though most package maintainers with aslackbadgeadopttheformer conventionalsignal ratherthan thelatter assessmentsignal .ourresultsindicatethatmaintainers when they have the choice and are serious about signaling their dedication should adopt the assessment signal badge.
badges vs practices.
weemphasizethatinmostcaseseffectsassociatedwithnon trivialbadgesareinextricablylinkedtoeffects associatedwiththebadges correspondingtoolsorpractices.for many kinds of badges the badge is the only easily externally observable indicator of the tool s use e.g.
.
while effects associated with adopting continuous integration static analysis and dependencymanagement tools on software development practices have beenstudiedbypriorwork ourapproachisuniqueinthatwefocus on thesignaling dimension added by repository badges to these and other tools previously overlooked in the software engineering signaling literature e.g.
.
further delineating effects associated with badges from effects associated with thetools themselves goes beyond the scope of this work but some preliminaryexperimentswiththecontinuousintegrationservice travis whichisdetectableindependentlyofitsbadgethrougha travis.yml configurationfileintherepository suggestthatwhile theobservedeffectsofadoptingthetoolaresimilartotheeffectsatthebadgeadoptiontime badgesseemtohaveasmallamplifyingeffect.pendingfurthervalidation thisisencouragingforresearchers in that badges might be a reliable indicator for longitudinal studies of practices that are hard to detect otherwise because there are no clear traces of the practice in the repository beyond the badge.
implicationsforpractitioners.
ourresultsprovideguidanceon which qualities are usually signaled with badges and which signals tend to be more reliable.
therefore package maintainers can make moredeliberatechoicesaboutbadges e.g.
limitingconventional signals servicedevelopers candesignbadgesmorecarefully e.g.
providing an assessment signal based on some analysis of past conformance and packageusersandcontributors candecidewhich badges to use as indicators of underlying practices and as starting points to investigate deeper qualities.
