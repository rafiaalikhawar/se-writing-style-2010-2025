software teams increasingly analyze data to inform their engineering and business decisions andto build data solutions that deploy data in software products.
the people behind the data gathering and analysis are called data scientists a term coined by dj patiland jeff hammerbacher in to define their jobs at linkedin andfacebook.themissionofadatascientististotransformdata into insights that guide the teams actions.
previous studies on datascientists in software teams are based on a relatively small number of people and therefore do not provide a broader perspective on data science work.
