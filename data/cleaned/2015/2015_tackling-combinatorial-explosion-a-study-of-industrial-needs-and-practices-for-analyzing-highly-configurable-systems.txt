tackling combinatorial explosion a study of industrial needs... ase september montpellier france .
analysis techniques and tools analysis techniques for highly configurable systems have been studied for almost two decades by now.
dynamicanalyses .aswewillshow oneofthemostpopulardynamicanalysisforhighlyconfigurablesystemsinindustrialpractice is testing .
several testing techniques for configurable systems are summarized by engstrom et al.
with rather few that have been evaluated through experiments or industrial case studies includingtechniquesforintegrationandsystemtesting as well as performance testing .
testing is always specific to one configuration since it is often impossible to test all configurations configuration sampling strategies have been proposed including random sampling or more systematic sampling strategies that try to enable each option or certain option combinations e.g.
n wise feature interaction sampling .
static analyses .
in order to effectively analyze all possible configurations a class of static analyses called variability aware analyses hasbeendevelopedoverthelastdecade typicallybylifting single system analyses such as dataflow analysis model checking or deductive verification .
also defect prediction usingmachinelearningwasproposed .accordingtoth met al ssurvey theseanalysescancheckpropertiesofthewhole system family based analysis or of individual options in isolation feature based analysis .examplesofpropertiesaretype safety performance temporalproperties orabsenceofunwanted featureinteractions .unliketh metal.

variabilitymodelanalyses .avastnumberofanalyseshasbeen proposed for variability models especially feature models as well as analyses to check consistencies between variability models and implementationartifacts.recallbenavidesetal.

methodology ourstudydesignaimedatobtaininginsightsaboutanalysesthat areappliedinpracticeandabouttheneedsofpractitioners.thereby we also strive to obtain insights about the relevance of analyses that have been proposed in the literature.
recall that most of these proposed analyses are automated yet we do not narrow our scope totheseonly butalsoconsidermanualanalyses.tothisend we studiedliteraturesurveys specificallychasteketal.
benavides et al.
and th m et al.
.
we designed a structure both for the survey questionnaire and the interview guide based on a classification of analysis techniques for product lines largely inspired bychasteketal.
andthearchitectureofhighlyconfigurable systems as we illustrated in figure .
this structure comprised i analysisofgeneralsystemproperties ii testingpracticesand challenges iii analysisofthevariabilitymodel iv consistency analysis between variability model and implementation artifacts e.g.
code v analysis of implementation artifacts.
the typical properties analyses tools andchallengesidentifiedintheliterature were distributed in these categories.
specifically instead ofasking about particular analysis techniques which are likely unknownto theparticipants ourfocus wasonproperties regarding thefivecategories.forinstance weextractedeight inouropinion most relevant properties of variability models explained shortly insection4.
forwhichanalyseshadbeenproposed frombenavides et al.
s literature survey .
fromexperience weexpectedmanytermsfromtheliterature to be unknown to industrial participants so we developed the questionnaireandinterviewguideiterativelywithfiveindustrial test participants.
figure 2shows our methodology.
first we designedaninterviewguidebasedonthecategoriesandconducted a pilot interview.
the experiences led to the first version of the survey questionnaire which we then tested with four industrial authorized licensed use limited to lahore univ of management sciences.

we then continued refining the terminology and slightly adjusting the scope.
for instance we replaced product line terminologywithmorecommonterms e.g.
productline became highly configurable system variability model became configuration specification .
furthermore we added testing and configuration sampling as the most frequently expressed analysis technique by thepilotparticipants.weconductedfurtherpilotinterviewswith these participants learning that a survey questionnaire before the interviewhelpstofamiliarizeintervieweeswiththeterminology and structure and so allowed going deeper into certain aspects reducing unnecessary clarifications.
.
survey questionnaire design.
we designed the survey questionnaire to take no more than25minutestocomplete.itfirstelicitedbriefrespondentethnographics e.g.
professionalbackgroundorexperience thengeneralcharacteristicsoftheconfigurablesubjectsystem e.g.
size domain and architecture and then covered the five analysis categories in detail.
finally we asked about general challenges.
the whole questionnaire is available in our online appendix .
all questions were optional to allow respondents to leave out thosequestionstheydidnothavetherighttechnicalbackground in or did not know sufficient details about.
most questions were closed ended forsomeweaskedforadditionalelaborations.the questions about the importance of analyzing specific properties usedafour pointscaleaskingparticipantstoratetheimportanceof analyzing the property not necessary nice to have but not critical critical anddon t know.
this was followed by questions on which property is assured and how.

we received responses response rate .
.
were complete responses and were partial.
from the latter we disqualified for the lack of responses to any of the analysis sections even whenethnographics system characteristics and challenges were filled in so only of the respondents were considered.
this indicates that many developers who work on highly configurablesystems arenotfamiliarwithrespectiveanalysesat all.
excluding these enhances the confidence in our results.
in the remainder we refer to individual respondents as s1 s2 and so on.
.
interviews design.
the follow up semi structured interviews relied on an interviewguidelargelyfollowingthequestionnairestructure.we first verified basic ethnographics with the interviewee and characteristics of the subject system which helped getting into theinterview.
for the main part our strategy was to first briefly an alyze the survey responses for each section and then going into depthaboutcertainpropertiesperceivedimportantorotheraspects we foundrelevant.
the sectionsand our preliminaryanalysis provided a structure but we let the interview flow freely.
this way we obtained additional insights into analysis needs practices andchallenges.
for instance we asked why a certain property was perceivedascritical whyitwasanalyzedornot andwhatwouldbe needed to do so e.g.
presentation or scalability requirements .
we also engaged the interviewee to discuss the feasibility of applying existing analyses she might not be aware of.

tackling combinatorial explosion a study of industrial needs... ase september montpellier france binations automatedtests butusuallysomecombinationsarenot possible due to large variability therefore we often prio some tests to automate and that is usually based on experience.
feature and family based analyses are used but in a very limited way .
different strategies are employed to avoid sophisticated analyses.
modularization of features was stated by of survey respondents as one such strategy.
three interviewees i1 i6 i11 use unit testing for individual modules and integration testingfor integrated modules.
i1 we have two approaches.
one is to cover feature by feature that we make sure that it works as intended.
and then we have what we call confident testing where we more look at the applications where you have bundles of featuresthatareworkingtogether.
notnecessarilycoveringall the requirements of every feature but covering the interplay between the features based on the classification of analysis strategiesbyth metal.

this is often challengingbecauseteststhemselvesarerarelyconfigurable i2 .
traceability is relevant for understanding which configuration options were selected when a concrete test case failed i3 i5 .
thiscan be addressed by using a database snapshot of configurationsand their values to identify which configurations are affected by bugs reported under a specific customer configuration i5 .
.
variability model analyses satisfiability of a variability model and validity of a config uration are perceived as the most critical properties .
recall thatweelicitedtheeightmostrelevantvariability modelproperties cf.section forwhichanalyseshavebeenconceivedinthe literature .
as figure 4shows only two properties are perceived as critical by the median of respondents validity of a configuration an existing configuration adheres to the variability model and satisfiability of the model at least one configuration exists for the model .
we asked interviewees why these two properties are deemed more critical despite them being available in many configuratortools.theystated thatthese twoproperties are mostcritical dueto quick fixes or one off changes made to the variability model for some customers i2 .
such changes have the potential to easily invalidate the model resulting in the system not working at all i5 .
consequently expensive and time consuming and reportedly sometimes financially risky rework has to be done to ensure that the configurable system works i5 i7 .the properties of the variability model are mostly assured through manual reviews .
thesurvey responsesshow thatonly four of the properties from figure excluding those related to edits are assured i validity of a configuration and ii satisfiability of a specification both assured by of the respondents iii number of possible configurations by and iv list of all possible configurations by .
the validity of variability model edits is assured by of the respondents.
the majority assures thesepropertiesthrough manualreviews use scripts e.g.
to collect statistics on configuration options and their
