each of these techniques however face inherent challenges such as insufficient capability when handling memory aliases.
recent works have used hypothesis testing to address this drawback albeit with high computational complexity making them impractical for real world applications.
to address this issue we propose a new deep neural architecture which could significantly improve memory alias resolution.
at the high level our approach employs a recurrent neural network rnn to learn the binary code pattern pertaining to memory accesses.
it then infers the memory region accessed by memory
