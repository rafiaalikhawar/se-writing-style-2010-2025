previous work by fucci et al.
engaged in laboratory studies ofdevelopers actively engagedin test driven development practices.
fucci et al.
found little difference between test first behaviour of tdd and test later behaviour.
to that end we opted to conductastudyabouttddbehavioursinthe wild ratherthanin the laboratory.
thus we have conducted a comparative analysis of githubrepositoriesthatadoptstddtoalesserorgreaterextent in order to determine how tdd affects software development productivityandsoftwarequality.weclassifiedgithubrepositories archived in 2015in terms of how rigorously they practiced tdd thuscreatingatddspectrum.wethenmatchedandcomparedvarioussubsetsoftheserepositoriesonthistddspectrumwithcontrol setsofequalsize.thecontrolsetsweresamplesfromallgithub repositoriesthatmatchedcertaincharacteristics andthatcontained at least one test file.
we compared how the tdd sets differed from the control sets on the following characteristics number of test files averagecommitvelocity numberofbug referencingcommits numberofissuesrecorded usageofcontinuousintegration number of pull requests and distribution of commits per author.
we foundthatjavatddprojectswererelativelyrare.inaddition there were very few significant differences in any of the metrics we used to compare tdd like and non tdd projects therefore our results do not reveal any observable benefits from using tdd.

test driven development within the java github ecosystem is quite rare.
projects that engaged in test driven development did not show any significant differences in terms of quality over those projects that simply engaged in testing.
