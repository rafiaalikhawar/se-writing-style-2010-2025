the making of cloud applications an empirical study on software development for the cloud j rgen cito philipp leitner thomas fritz harald gall university of zurich switzerland lastname ifi.uzh.ch abstract cloud computing is gaining more and more traction as a deployment and provisioning model for software.
while a large body of research already covers how to optimally operate a cloud system we still lack insights into how professional software engineers actually use clouds and how the cloud impacts development practices.
this paper reports on the rst systematic study on how software developers build applications in the cloud.
we conducted a mixed method study consisting of qualitative interviews of professional developers and a quantitative survey with responses.
our results show that adopting the cloud has a profound impact throughout the software development process as well as on how developers utilize tools and data in their daily work.
among other things we found that developers need better means to anticipate runtime problems and rigorously dene metrics for improved fault localization and the cloud o ers an abundance of operational data however developers still often rely on their experience and intuition rather than utilizing metrics.
from our ndings we extracted a set of guidelines for cloud development and identi ed challenges for researchers and tool vendors.
.
introduction since its emergence the cloud has been a rapidly growing area of interest .
several cloud platforms such as amazon s ec2 microsoft azure google s app engine or ibm s bluemix are already gaining mainstream adoption.
developing applications on top of cloud services is becoming common practice.
due to the cloud s exible provisioning of resources and the ease of o ering services online for anyone the cloud also in uences software development practices.
for instance cloud development is often associated with the concept of devops which promotes the convergence of the development and operation of applications .
there is currently signi cant research interest in how to efciently manage cloud infrastructures for instance in terms of energy e ciency or maximized server utilization .

.another core area of interest in cloud computing research is its use for high performance computing in lieu of an expensive computer grid .
however so far there is little systematic research on the consumer side of cloud computing i.e.
how software developers actually develop applications in and for the cloud.
only recently barker et al.
voiced this concern in a position paper stating that the academic community ought to conduct more user driven research .
in this vein this paper presents a systematic study on how professional software engineers develop applications on top of cloud infrastructures or platforms.
we deliberately cover a broad scope and analyze how applications are designed built and deployed as well as what technical tools are used for cloud development.
we conducted a mixed method study consisting of an initial interview study with professional cloud developers a quantitative survey with respondents and a second round of interviews with additional professionals to dive deeper into some questions raised by the survey.
all interview participants work at international companies of widely varying size from small start ups to large enterprises and have diverse backgrounds with professional experience ranging from to years.
in particular we addressed the following two research questions rq how does the development and operation of applications change in a cloud environment?
in the cloud servers are volatile .
they are regularly terminated and re created often without direct in uence of the cloud developer.
our study has shown that the concept of api driven infrastructure at scale and this cloud instance volatility have ripple e ects throughout the entire application development and operations process.
they restrict the design of cloud applications and force developers to heavily rely on infrastructure automation log management and metrics centralization.
while these concepts are also useful in non cloud environments they are mandatory for successful application development and operation in the cloud.
rq what kind of tools and data do developers utilize for building cloud software?
based on our research more data and more types of data are utilized in the cloud for instance business metrics e.g.
conversion rates in addition to system level data e.g.
cpu utilization .
however developers struggle to directly interpret and make use of this additional data as current metrics are often not actionable for them.
similarly cloud developers are in the abstract aware that their design and implementation decisions have monetary consequences but inarxiv .6502v2 mar 2015their daily work they do not currently think much about the costs of operating their application in the cloud.
our research has important implications for cloud developers researchers and vendors of cloud related tooling.
primarily due to the volatility of cloud instances developers need to accustom themselves to not being able to directly touch the running application any longer.
that is quick xes of production con guration are equally impossible as logging into a server for debugging.
as a research community we need to investigate how to best support developers in this task as well as analyze how code artefacts related to cloud instance management evolve.
finally we have seen that more types of metrics get more and more important but they are still not directly actionable for developers.
hence we need to research better tooling that brings this data into the daily work ow of cloud developers.
the remainder of the paper is structured as follows.
first we provide some background on cloud computing terminology section followed by a discussion of related work in section .
we then present the study design section followed by an in depth summary of our ndings section and a discussion of the implications resulting from those ndings section .
we detail the major threats to validity of our research in section and conclude the paper in section .
.
background while the term cloud computing is commonly ill de ned1 the research community has widely gravitated towards the nist de nition .
as illustrated in figure this de nition considers three levels each de ned by the responsibilities of it operations provided by the cloud vendor.
in aninfrastructure as a service iaas cloud resources e.g computing power storage networking are acquired and released dynamically typically in the form of virtual machines.
iaas customers do not need to operate physical servers but are still required to administer their virtual servers and manage installed software.
platform as a service paas clouds represent a higher level of abstraction and provide entire application runtimes as a service.
the paas provider manages the hosting environment and customers only submit their application bundles.
they typically do not have access to the physical or virtual servers on which the applications are running.
finally in software as a service saas complete applications are provided as cloud services to end customers.
the entire stack including the application is handled by the provider.
the client is only a user of the service.
paas clouds are particularly interesting for software engineers as they allow them to solely focus on developing software applications.
they typically relieve the developer from having to care about any operations tasks and handle varying system load transparently via auto scaling.
this ability to adapt to workload changes is referred to as elasticity .
however in order to do so these platforms impose severe restrictions.
for instance they typically only support rather narrowly de ned application models e.g.
three tier web applications and require the developer to program against provided apis.
this often also leads to vendor lockin .
1oracle s ceo larry ellison once noted jokingly that he cannot think of a single thing oracle does that is not cloud .
hardware virtualizationdatabaseapp serverapplication runtimedataapplicationiaaspaassaas managed by client managed by cloud vendorhigher abstractionless restrictions hardware virtualization database app server application runtimedataapplication hardware virtualization database app server application runtime data applicationfigure basic models of cloud computing following with iaas the idea of infrastructure as code iac has also started to gain momentum.
iac allows users to de ne and provision operation environments in version controlled source code.
essentially in an iac project the entire runtime environment of the application e.g.
iaas resources required software packages con guration is de ned using scripts which can then be executed by tools such as opscode chef2.
these scripts allow entire test staging or production environments to be started without manual interaction.
the move towards iac with its reproducible provisioning has become necessary since cloud applications often consist of a large number of machines that have to be con gured automatically to scale horizontally.
another concept commonly associated with cloud development is devops .
devops describes the convergence of the previously mostly separated tasks of developing an application and its deployment and operation.
in devops software development and operation activities are often handled by the same team or even by the same engineer.
by aligning the goals of development and operations devops aims at improving agility and cooperation.
.
related work there has been a multitude of empirical research on the development of general software applications.
for instance singer et al.
have recently researched how developers use twitter .
murphy hill et al.
have looked at how bugs are xed .
however so far very little empirical research has been conducted in the cloud computing domain even though there are several calls for more research on software development for the cloud.
barker et al.
recently named user driven research as one of the major opportunities for high impact cloud research.
khajeh hosseini et al.
stated that the organizational and process oriented changes implied by adopting the cloud is currently not sufciently researched.
while mei et al.
did not consider software engineering a major challenge for cloud computing in they later on provided a whole list of software engineering issues to be tackled by research .
so far research in cloud computing has mainly focused on provider side issues e.g.
relating to server management or performance measurement .
on the client side some research has been conducted on concrete programming mod2 a large part of this research deals with data analysis typically using the map reduce paradigm e.g.
.
while interesting these works do not cover the professional software development environment that we address with our study.
research on cloud programming models for nonscienti c contexts is more limited.
one example is the jcloudscale framework proposed in .
jcloudscale is a javabased middleware that aims to simplify the development of iaas applications.
a similar goal also motivated the research presented in which investigated an extension of java rmi for simplifying the development of elastic cloud based applications.
one aspect that is already reasonably well understood in literature is how and when companies choose to adopt cloud computing and for which reasons.
a large scale survey on this topic has been presented in .
the authors conclude that improved business agility is a larger factor for companies to adopt the cloud than reduced costs.
in a second study on cloud adoption in small and medium sized enterprises the authors conclude that ease of use and convenience is a more important reason for adoption than both reduced costs and improved business agility.
however both of these studies are concerned primarily with saas adoption.
that is they target cloud adoption by end users more than by professional software developers.
this is not the case in a related industry study dubbed the devops report .
this survey garnered over respondents praising the devops idea as a key enabler of pro table and agile companies.
given that the source of this report is also a major player in the devops business independent scienti c evaluation to support these results would be valuable.
none of the work discussed so far has empirically evaluated how cloud software is actually developed in practice.
the only work we are aware of that goes into this direction is a not peer reviewed white paper on enterprise software development in the cloud .
this report is based on a survey with respondents.
the report concludes that enterprise developers are largely not yet adopting the cloud but if they do they are able to improve time to market.
.
research method to investigate how the cloud in uences software development practices we conducted a study based on techniques found in grounded theory .
following the recommendations in we used a mixed methodology consisting of three steps of data collection and iterative phases of data analysis.
first we de ned a set of open ended questions from our research questions and conducted qualitative interviews with participants.
second to further substantiate our ndings we ran a quantitative survey and gathered responses from professional software developers.
using open coding we identi ed topics of high interest.
to gain a better understanding and more details on these topics we then conducted a second round of qualitative deep dive interviews with professional developers.
all interview materials and survey questions can be found on our web site3.
qualitative interview study interview .
protocol.
we conducted semi structured interviews with software developers that previously already deployed soft3 .uzh.ch seal people cito cloud developerstudy.htmlware in the cloud in a professional context.
for these interviews we de ned a set of questions based on our research questions.
in the interviews we covered all questions with each participant but the concrete order of questions followed the ow of the interview.
interviews were conducted by the rst author either face to face on site of the interviewee or via skype.
interviews lasted between and minutes were conducted in either german or english and were audio recorded.
participants.
interview participants were recruited from industry partners and our personal network.
to cover a broad range of cloud development experiences we recruited participants from both smaller companies employees and larger enterprises employees .
participants had to either deploy on iaas or paas as well as in public and private clouds.
furthermore we also made sure to recruit some participants that delivered saas applications.
overall we recruited participants p1 to p16 all male software developers with professional development experience between and years average of years standard deviation and from di erent countries and two continents.
our participants came from di erent companies participants worked in larger enterprises in smaller companies.
analysis.
after the interviews we transcribed all audio recordings.
the rst two authors then used an open coding technique to iteratively code and categorize participants statements resulting in a set of ndings.
all ndings are supported by statements of multiple interview participants.
quantitative study survey .
protocol.
in the second step of our study we designed a survey with questions most of which map to our initial ndings.
the questions were primarily formulated as statements asking participants to state their agreement on a ve point likert scale examples of these questions can be seen in figure .
to target developers with experience in cloud technologies we gathered email addresses of github4 users that follow a repository of a number of popular cloud platforms including amazon web services heroku google cloud platform cloudfoundry and openstack.
we then discarded all users without a public email address in their pro le and contacted the remaining users with a description and link to our online survey.
to motivate developers to participate in the survey we held a ra e for all participants to win one of two usd amazon gift vouchers.

protocol.
through the examination of open ended survey questions we identi ed topics of high interest fault localization monitoring and performance troubleshooting cost of operation and design for scalability .
in order to get more profound insights into these topics we de ned an overall set of questions for these topics and conducted another round of semi structured interviews.
we followed the same protocol as in the rst round of qualitative interviews.
interviews lasted between and minutes and were audio recorded.

after the interviews and based on the topics and categories identi ed in the previous two steps we used open coding to categorize interview statements and gather more profound insights into the di erence between cloud and non cloud development.
.
findings in the following we present the ndings of our study.
we rst give a high level overview of our ndings in section .
and then provide more detailed results relating to rq1 section .
and rq2 section .
.
.
overview for our study we were primarily interested in examining what makes software development for the cloud unique i.e.
what di ers in terms of processes tools and implementation choices to other development projects.
however early on in our interviews it became clear that the cloud does not exist for practitioners.
hence we asked our survey respondents to list the main characteristics that dene cloud computing for them and gathered answers from developers multiple answers were allowed .
we categorized and quanti ed the most common themes and present them in figure .
note that the last three entries in the chart automation ease of infrastructure maintenance and elasticity are all strongly related as are the rst entries in the chart focus on product faster time to market.
the majority of developers thinks about the cloud mostly percentages0 30focus on product productivity faster delivery time to market lower costs tco total cost of ownership automation deployment pipelines easier infrastructure setup and maintenance scalability elasiticity figure main di erences in cloud development as a deployment and hosting technology following either the iaas or paas model.
for these developers the ability to easily scale applications and the ease of infrastructure maintenance is what makes the cloud unique.
while productivity and faster time to market has been named as a distinguishing feature in our interviews these were only relevant to about every tenth survey respondent.
finally it is interesting to note that reduced total costs of ownership tco are also only a distinguishing factor for a minority of cloud developers.
our interviews further revealed that there is a large mindset gap between developers who think of the cloud as either iaas or paas and those who think of it mostly in terms of saas.
for developers where cloud is seen more as a delivery model i.e.
saas how the application is actually hosted tends to be opaque in cloud and non cloud environments alike and not much changed when adopting cloud computing.
this was however di erent for interview participants working on iaas and paas services.
these participants consistently commented on a range of di erences.
the analysis of our interview transcripts and the survey data shows that the changes when adopting cloud computing for iaas and paas developers fall into the following broad categories changes to how applications are provisioned and deployed deployment automation changes in how applications are actually built design implementation changes in how problems can be debugged troubleshooting maintenance and cultural changes devops communication .
we were also interested in investigating the role of data and operational metrics as it plays an important role in software development .
indeed the analysis of our study showed that it plays a major role in cloud development.

strongly disagreedisagree neutr al agreestrongly agree devops design monitoring figure results from our quantitative survey that developers currently struggle to fully utilize this additional data usage of runtime data .
in the following we will discuss our detailed ndings based on these broad groups of changes.
in figure we summarize the quantitative results for the likert type scale questions from our survey that relate to our core research questions.
all detailed results of the survey can be found on our website5.
we grouped the results in figure according to our subtopics.
the insights from deployment automation andtroubleshooting maintenance resulted primarily from our interviews rather than the survey.
in general we saw a high level of agreement with our interview ndings.
however a few individual questions showed some disagreement as well requiring more detailed study.
these aspects are discussed in more detail in the remainder of the paper.
in the following we present the main themes of our study.
where applicable we provide quantitative results from our survey in the presentation of our ndings.
.
application development and operation in this section we report on how cloud computing has a ected application development and operation and on the main drivers api driven infrastructure at scale and cloud instance volatility for these changes.
.
.
deployment automation our interviews have shown that elasticity ease of infrastructure maintenance and automation can be broken down into two fundamental aspects that drive most changes of software development in the cloud api driven infrastructureat scale and volatility of cloud instances .
both these aspects have ripple e ects on almost every aspect of cloud development.
api driven infrastructure at scale .
infrastructureat scale refers to the ability to quickly spawn up and discard many compute instances using an api.
this ability requires more automation on many levels including infrastructure environment and test.
in iaas clouds automation happens by de ning your infrastructure as a set of software artifacts see iac in section .
this allows for automatic provisioning of newly created instances for di erent purposes .uzh.ch seal people cito cloud developerstudy.html e.g.
scaling up setting up a test environment .
in paas clouds applications are required to be packaged in a way to be easily reproducible e.g.
containers buildpacks to manage this automation behind the scenes.
all interviewees deploying on iaas agreed that the use of iac tools e.g.
chef puppet or other means of automation e..g shell scripts for all automated provisioning of their infrastructure has become essential in the cloud.
volatility of cloud instances .
cloud instances can be started up and shut down for various reasons.
this volatility happens either through the cloud provider shutting down instances the load balancer spawning or shutting down instances and the application itself shutting down a dynamically allocated instance that nished its work.
one implication of instance volatility is that all infrastructure de nition and server con guration has to be implemented in code.
if provisioning and con guration is not automated it is bound to be lost when instances are discarded.
this means that every change in infrastructure results in a new deployment of the system.
four of the interviewees that deploy in iaas referred to this practice as immutable infrastructure we have now moved to strict immutable infrastructure in our deployment.
we don t even put ssh keys into instances anymore making changes to existing infrastructure impossible p12 iaas in paas the infrastructure is managed by the cloud provider.
hence the infrastructure is immutable for developers by default.
infrastructure transparency .
all interviewees deploying on iaas mentioned the use of either iac tools or shell scripts for all automated provisioning of their infrastructure.
they argue that this brings them transparency regarding their infrastructure what happens in our infrastructure is a lot more obvious.
everything we do on that level is over code .
.
.
so i don t need ask my colleague what he did to get that process running i just look at the code and maybe the commit history p9 iaas virtual containers for automation .
furthermore three interviewees describe a push in virtualization from vir tual machines towards virtual containers e.g.
lxc6 docker7 for their automation virtual machines are too slow in a large scale .
.
.
speed matters also in integration testing.
when i can make a build take minutes instead of that s a huge win p13 iaas traditional virtual machines impose a large performance overhead due to the additional virtualization layer.
containers allow for much faster start up times and are therefore also increasingly used as a base for paas .
infrastructure provisioning and application deployment in the cloud are largely automated.
servers are not seen as durable entities.
hence any changes to infrastructure need to be de ned in code.
this also leads to more transparency concerning infrastructure changes.
.
.
design implementation in this section we report on how restrictions in the cloud in uence how developers design and implement their applications.
design restrictions .
as part of our survey we asked whether the survey respondents face limitations in application architecture and design speci c to the cloud.
results to this question were non conclusive with of respondents disagreeing and agreeing see q5 in figure .
however respondents have still in a free form eld in the survey stated multiple restrictions which we categorized and quanti ed in figure .
percentages0 50distributed architecture stateless high availability design technology services programming language frameworks libraries development environment sdk apis ec2 api heroku toolbelt appengine sdk ... data storage persistence ephemeral storage dbaas ... figure most signi cant restrictions developers have encountered on cloud platforms it is not surprising that there are technical restrictions regarding the supported sdks libraries and frameworks.
however to our interview participants these restrictions were not all negative.
some developers feel that technological restrictions allow them to focus more on delivering business value instead of tinkering with low level technology choices but i don t wanna make those decisions anyway.
... the cool thing from a product design point of view is that you know what works on appengine and what doesn t p11 paas more interesting is that close to a third of all respondents also consider the cloud to restrict them in the way actually architect and design their applications.
these restrictions in design and architecture are primarily caused by api driven infrastructure at scale and volatility of cloud instances as discussed in section .
.
.
design for failure .
volatility of cloud instances naturally forces developers to build highly fault tolerant applications as iaas providers reserve the right to shut down any resources at any time on short or without any prior notice one interesting thing that is very cloud speci c and in uenced our architecture is that the cloud provider tells you we can kill your machine any time we want.
p9iaas well known cloud users have already adopted this mindset.
net ix for instance has stated that they use an application called chaos monkey8to randomly terminate cloud instances in production to force application design that can tolerate such failures when they happen unintentionally.
design for scalability .
scalability is the most named di erence in cloud development for survey participants see figure .
in our deep dive interviews we asked participants to explain how scalability considerations in uenced them during design and implementation.
all interviewees stated that they always have scalability in mind even when designing very simple cloud applications even if the customer needs only server we have an elb elastic load balancer anyway because we expect everything to grow d3 iaas the twelve factor app9design has become the de facto standard when it comes to best practices when building cloud applications.
a few of the interview and survey participants referred particularly to this manifesto while others often referenced similar practices for implementing scalability under a di erent name.
an alternative approach to implement fault tolerant and scalable cloud applications that was mentioned are microservices we have divided our application into many services.
for one speci c service we kill o and start new instances all the time also to have proper redundancy.
p9iaas however in our interviews only ve participants mentioned either currently using or having plans to move to a more service oriented system design in the near future.
the cloud imposes some restrictions on how applications can be built in technological and software architectural terms.
speci cally applications need to be designed for scalability and fault tolerance.
these restrictions are also seen as positive as they enforce the best practices and foster business value.
.
.
troubleshooting maintenance activities that happen after the application has been deployed i.e.
troubleshooting and maintenance have probably seen the biggest change in cloud development.
servers chaos monkey released into wild.html not seen as durable entities anymore.
therefore infrastructure maintenance has become an activity that now has to deal with adapting infrastructure code les rather than tweaking on live server instances.
fault localization .
fault localization the activity of discovering the exact locations of program faults cannot be done through ad hoc inspection on for instance log les memory dumps or system metrics on live production servers anymore.
this means that every information that is of interest in the maintenance phase of the development life cycle must be speci ed before deployment and collected at a central repository otherwise information runs the risk of being lost due to cloud instance volatility.
these techniques are not necessarily bound to the cloud.
however in the cloud these best practices are seen as mandatory in the cloud you are forced to use best practices you are forced to use automation.
you are forced on not relying to having root access to jump onto a machine and search logs by hand.
you are forced to use better practices like aggregation.
d6 paas reproducing issues .
in terms of reproducibility of issues in a local environment for fault localization our interviewees were somewhat divided.
on the one hand this task has become more di cult as cloud applications are inherently distributed and reproducing a distributed environment locally is generally a di cult task.
on the other hand deployment automation makes it easier and faster to spin up a staging or testing environment in the cloud to reproduce issues.
however our interview partners also mentioned the additional cost involved of spinning up environments as a reason for rst attempting to reproduce issues locally.
some interviewees also stated that proper end toend monitoring and request tracing needs to be in place to be able to reproduce issues correctly if you missed some logs and the instance is already gone have fun reproducing your environment d8 paas especially with public cloud providers hardware characteristics also need to be tracked as you never know what speci c hardware con guration will be served.
troubleshooting has changed as problematic cloud instances are often not accessible or already discarded rendering hot xes or searching for logs in production impossible.
instead relevant logs must be de ned beforehand and collected in a central repository.
these best practices are not exclusive to the cloud but instance volatility makes their usage in cloud computing mandatory.
.
.
devops communication as already discussed in section it is often argued that cloud computing goes hand in hand with a devops style of communication which leads to higher collaboration between software developers and operations engineers.
in our interviews this notion was not undisputed.
while of the interviewees have agreed with the devops vision the remaining participants mostly from enterprise companies have argued that there are still dedicated development and operations teams that more or less work as silos.
even companies that self identi ed as following a devops approachstill seem to generally have a separation between engineers that solely implement functional features and engineers that mostly develop infrastructure code we have our server devops guy.
.
.
.
he handles the whole monitoring and tools thing p9 iaas in our survey there was a general agreement with these observations see figure .
the survey responses show that especially in large companies communication and interaction has increased between application developers and operations engineers .
contrary to our interview study the di erence between the responses of developers working in smaller or larger companies in terms of collaboration between development and operations is not large.
for smaller companies tend to agree that their operations and development are now handled by the same sta versus in larger companies.
this data suggests that even in larger companies the gap between development and operations activities converges.
there is more collabor ation betw een application de velopers and oper ations engineers oper ations and application d evelopment is handled by the same staff1 to to to 1000over to to to 1000over 100since mo ving to the cloud... of employees strongly disagree disagree neutr al agree strongly agree figure results regarding team communication grouped by company size close to of developers across companies of all sizes build applications following the devops notion of converging development and operations teams.
however even in a devops team there are still dedicated engineers that are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure code.
.
changes in tools and metrics usage in our research we were particularly interested in how the usage of tools and production data has changed in cloud development projects.
we report on how tooling has evolved in the cloud what kind of metrics are available now and how these metrics are utilized.
.
.
cloud tooling tooling for the cloud .
in the survey we asked what tools developers speci cally use in development for the cloud which they have not used before.
people responded to the question with multiple tools which we categorized and quanti ed in figure .
we also asked whether cloudbased tool usage has generally increased.
of respondents agreed with this statement while disagreed see q6 in figure .
performance and log management top the list of tools survey respondents use speci cally for cloud development.
this can again be attributed to the notions of api driven infrastructure at scale and cloud instance volatility which we have already discussed extensively in section .
.percentages0 60other analytics usage cost tracking .. cloud provider sdk ec2 api heroku toolbelt ... performance management apm tools new relic pingdom ... log management analytics splunk loggly librato ... configuration management chef vagrant docker ... figure tools used speci cally for cloud development tooling in the cloud .
we also observe an increase in the usage of tooling that is itself cloud based.
however we cannot di erentiate whether this rise has to do with development on cloud platforms or with the fact that more and more tooling is moving to a saas model in general.
interviewees agreed that when building cloud applications many of the tools previously installed in the local infrastructure or on the developer machine are now also in the cloud.
this includes tools for monitoring analytics and con guration management.
four of the interviewees even used an entirely web based ide for most of their development tasks.
all others moved at least part of their supporting tooling into the cloud.
the interviewees developing entirely in the cloud i.e.
through a cloud based ide expressed the overall relief of not having to maintain or con gure a local development environment i don t need to take care of backups or updates of the ide.
i can use the same setup everywhere.
... also there s no hassle about that missing plugin and that wrong con guration.
p1 paas however cloud based ides were not mentioned by survey respondents at all as part of their tooling.
hence we conclude that cloud based ides have unlike indicated by our interview study not yet found mainstream adoption.
cloud based tool usage has generally increased.
performance log management and analytics tools are most used speci cally for cloud development.
many of these tools are themselves cloud based.
however despite some advantages cloud based ides have not yet found mainstream usage.
.
.
monitoring production data metric awareness .
all interview participants have mentioned using solutions for log aggregation and central operational metric collection for cloud development.
the survey supports these claims with performance metric and log management tools being deemed the most important.
what we have also observed is that the enforcement of these practices has led to more awareness for metrics software developers have not until recently seen metrics as very important.
they saw that stu as an operations thing d5 paas in our survey of cloud developers agree that they look at more metrics on production systems than before see q8 in figure .metric availability .
in general interviewees expressed that they now they have a much richer set of monitoring metrics on production systems available especially now in the cloud with heroku or amazon they provide so much data.
putting this data in a graphing tool and looking at it once in a while has become increasingly easier.
p12 iaas from the survey we see that of respondents agree that they actually have more operational metrics available than before see q7 in figure .
when asked whether access to production data has become easier survey participants were divided disagreed were neutral and agreed with the statement see q9 in figure .
we investigated this claim further and found that metric utilization has increased both in quantity and dimension.
in addition to technical system level metrics e.g.
cpu utilization cache hits more teams now look also at business metrics e.g.
customer retention number of logins to guide their decisions.
however system performance metrics are deemed to be the most interesting by our survey participants.
state that they look at performance metrics on a regular basis see q10 in figure .
cloud developers look at more production metrics.
in addition to system level metrics business metrics are becoming more relevant.
however application performance is most often still measured via system level metrics.
.
.
usage of runtime data an increase of tooling to acquire data more metric awareness and availability made us interested in how developers use metrics in their work.
through analysis of our initial interviews and the open questions in our survey we identi ed that performance and cost were the metrics of high interest to cloud developers.
in the following we describe how our interview participants utilize this data in their regular development work.
performance troubleshooting .
in our deep dive interviews we investigated how our study participants approach a particular performance problem by utilizing data from production systems to solve the problem.
a common theme is that developers follow a more reactive approach to metrics i.e.
they act on alerts or reports on the issue tracker provided by someone who is concerned with running the application in production i.e.
devops engineers operations engineers or system administrators .
metrics are typically provided in dashboards accessible to everyone in the team but mostly used by operations.
however when actively debugging a known performance issue all interview participants would rst go by intuition and reproduce the issue in their own development environment before inspecting how metrics have evolved in production in the provided dashboards.
only if the local inspection does not yield any results they would dig deeper into production data.
interviewees stated that they choose to ignore the data at rst because it is rather cumbersome to navigate performance dashboards while at the same time navigating through code i try to reproduce and solve the issue locally.
looking for the particular issue in the dashboard and jump ing back and forth between the code is rather tedious d2iaas costs of deployment .
to most of our interviewees the costs of deployment in the cloud were generally deemed as important.
however developers seem to only in the abstract be aware that their design and implementation decisions have an in uence on deployment costs.
when confronted on how the costs of deployment especially of speci c code changes are used in their daily work it became clear that costs are not a tangible factor for developers.
some interviewees argued that having this information more wide spread and accessible would be interesting to them but does not fall into their responsibilities i have no idea about the costs.
i can just read it in the logs sometimes that in production we spawned servers.
it would be interesting to know but it s not really important for application development p5 paas not developers but software architects or the cto are concerned with the overall costs of operation.
however even for these roles costs were considered in a post design phase and currently do not in uence their design decisions directly.
currently developers struggle to use the abundance of available runtime metrics.
rather they often solve performance problems by intuition in a local environment.
more detailed inspection of metrics is only used when this approach does not lead to a solution.
cloud costs are deemed as important but are not tangible to developers.
.
discussion we now present in a condensed form the implications of our study results for practitioners as well as the main challenges that cloud developers face.
these form open problems that academic research and vendors of cloud related tooling need to address to improve the experience of developers.
.
implications for practitioners our study has shown that there are a number of bestpractices for building useful applications on top of iaas and paas systems.
these practices are not necessarily bound only to cloud development but the nature of cloud infrastructures make these practices central for successfully deploying in a cloud.
in the following we present a set of guidelines for software development in the cloud resulting from the ndings of our study.
cloud instances are volatile .
never assume that any instance will exist forever.
in both iaas and paas cloud systems backend instances come and go.
logs con guration changes or hot xes stored only on a cloud instance are bound to be lost.
as we have seen in section .
.
cloud developers should treat cloud instances as immutable black boxes which they in general cannot x and in some cases cannot even log into.
this requires a change in mindset for engineers used to having full control over their infrastructure.
anticipate runtime problems and de ne relevant logs and operational metrics for fault localization before deployment.
use log management tools tocentrally collect this data.
related to the volatility of cloud instances developers need to start thinking about how to localize and debug runtime faults already during development.
this includes de ning useful debugging statements logs and operational metrics prior to deployment as well as setting up and using tools to centrally collect persist and analyse these metrics outside of volatile instances.
as discussed in section .
.
cloud instances are black boxes drilling into unanticipated problems after deployment is often impossible.
hence cloud developers should be aggressive in what they log and what operational metrics they trace.
it is easier to lter out data that turns out to be unnecessary than to debug problems for which the relevant logs and metrics have not been collected.
scalability and fault tolerance need to be rstclass citizens in application design.
while most distributed and web based applications have historically striven to be scalable and fault tolerant at least to some degree these concepts have become even more central in cloud projects.
api driven infrastructure at scale means that essentially any application or component can scale up dynamically e.g.
to react to increased load .
instance volatility means that runtime faults are bound to happen.
as such scalability and fault tolerance need to be rst class citizens when designing applications see section .
.
.
best practices for cloud application design e.g.
the factor app take this into account and should not be compromised by cloud developers.
paas systems often enforce such application design through restrictions e.g.
in terms of statelessness .
developers should not aim to circumvent but rather embrace those restrictions.
for iaas automate server provisioning and conguration for instance using iac tools.
api driven infrastructure at scale requires that the process of instance provisioning and con guration is fully automated.
besides being able to scale up quickly this also has the additional advantage that knowledge about how servers are con gured is explicitly documented in scripts or iac code and versioned in the project s version control system.
this allows developers to revert for instance erroneous changes in the con guration of a cloud instance just like they would revert a broken application code change.
it also makes infrastructure con guration and evolution explicit for other developers and devops engineers leading to more transparency as discussed in section .
.
.
while some cloud developers currently use scripting e.g.
bash for this purpose the usage of dedicated iac tools has additional advantages.
most importantly iac allows for reuse of existing open source provisioning and conguration code and supports unit testing well.
embrace the tools and data the cloud provides you.
as elaborated in section .
we have seen that cloud developers have access to more tools and data.
however we have also seen that many developers still rather go by intuition when debugging problems rather than analyzing provided operational metrics.
we argue that besides better tooling see section .
a change in mindset is required for cloud developers to fully embrace the additional options for debugging and maintaining applications that the cloud environment provides them.
.
challenges for cloud development in addition to the best practices and guidelines outlined in section .
which cloud developers can already implementtoday we have also seen that there are a number of areas in which academic research and tool vendors should provide better techniques approaches and tools to support cloud developers.
academic research on infrastructure evolution.
in iaas clouds software developers make use of scripting or iac tools to formally specify and track infrastructure conguration.
this means that infrastructure evolution is now tracked in version control systems the same way the evolution of regular code artifacts is.
we argue that this provides new opportunities for academic research on software repository mining to investigate how infrastructure code evolves over the lifetime of a project compared to the overall application code.
this will allow us to for instance discover anti patterns in infrastructure provisioning code.
improved log and metrics management.
cloud developers need to anticipate problems prior to deployment and de ne relevant logs and operational metrics.
while this is largely already possible today there is little support to guide developers what and how they should be logging exactly.
some study participants have reported that this results in rather excruciating trial and error.
we argue that correct tracing and metric de nition has to be introduced as part of the development work ow.
methods and tooling should be improved to support the process of de ning and evolving useful logs and metrics for cloud applications.
local reproducibility through containers.
cloud applications are distributed by default.
our study participants reported that trying to reproduce faults locally can be a tedious and time consuming task.
it involves knowing the exact state of when the fault occurred in production i.e.
infrastructure and data state as well as the capability to replicate the environment and its state locally.
we envision methods and tools that have the ability to recreate a distributed environment in a local development environment from a snapshot of when the fault occurred utilizing containerization technology e.g.
using docker .
tools for developer targeted analytics.
in the cloud more metrics are available both in quantity and dimension.
however in our study we have observed that developers before utilizing existing metrics much rather rely on their experience and intuition to solve problems.
besides a required change in mindset as discussed in section .
we attribute this to the fact that most monitoring tools are built to be used by operations teams rather than software developers.
currently the existing way of delivering metrics is di cult to leverage for developers as it is not actionable in the development process .
existing tools need to expose better apis for data extraction and integration.
future research needs to address how the abundance of data in the cloud can become more actionable for developers and integrate it into their daily work ows.
possible solutions could include integration of data in code views through ide plugins or within issue tracking systems.
.
threats to validity while we have designed our research as a mixed mode study to reduce threats to validity as far as possible there are still a number of limitations inherent in our research design.
primarily the question arises to what extent the cloud developers we interviewed are representative external validity .
however to mitigate this threat we have made sure to recruit interview participants that are approximatelyevenly distributed between smaller companies and larger enterprises as well as between iaas and paas clouds.
there still are a little more interviewees that deploy on paas than on iaas.
we think to have mitigated this concern by having more iaas particpants in the survey balancing the overall results.
further our interview participants cover a broad range of experience levels and work with various kinds of cloud systems on various kinds of applications.
a similar threat also exists for the external validity of our survey.
we recruited our participants almost exclusively via github meaning that we are likely to have attracted mostly software engineers who are actively interested in open source development and who are also following the progress of at least one big open source cloud product.
further responses were necessarily voluntary hence we are likely to have attracted a crowd with higher than average interest in the topic of cloud computing.
in terms of internal validity it is possible that we have biased our interview partners through the pre selection of questions and topics and that we missed entirely unanticpiated di erences and implications of software development in the cloud.
also our themes focused on how software development in the cloud is di erent than in non cloud environments.
thus interview participants may have been inclined to overstate di erences leaving out similarities.
however given that no major undiscovered di erences and implications were mentioned during the survey either we judge this threat to be low.
another threat to internal validity is that we had to translate a subset of our interviews to english for analysis o ering the possibility that subtle semantics have changed during translation.
we strived to minimize this threat by carefully checking all quotes and translations against the original transcripts to make sure that the original meaning remained unchanged.
.
conclusions we report on the rst systematic study on how professional software developers build applications and utilize specialized tools and data on top of cloud infrastructures and platforms.
these insights provided by our study help to better understand how cloud computing has made an impact throughout the software development life cycle.
our ndings suggest among others things two major developments developers need better means to anticipate runtime problems in the cloud and rigorously de ne and collect metrics for better fault localization and the cloud offers an abundance of operational data however developers still often rely on their experience and intuition rather than utilizing metrics to solve problems.
methods and tools for developers will therefore need to adapt to these required changes in the cloud.
from our ndings we extracted a set of guidelines for cloud development and identi ed challenges for researchers and tool vendors to support developers in these e orts by developing new approaches for managing metrics and making operational data more actionable.
