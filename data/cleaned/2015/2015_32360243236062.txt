consideredinthe software industry ossinfrastructure today is ubiquitous 1powering applications in virtually everydomain.economistsrefertoossas digitaldarkmatter to signify both its invisibility and importance.
they also report valuationsofoss in thebillions of dollarsper year interms ofboth directreuse valueandboostedproductivityandefficiency.
giventheimportanceofossdigitalinfrastructuretosomuch of the economy one might expect that it is adequately staffed and maintained i.e.
sustainable.
yet this is often not the case.
as a recentfordfoundationreportinvestigatingthesustainabilityofoss digital infrastructure notes most users of oss infrastructure takeitforgranted andsocietyatlargeisunawareoftherisks.a vivid example is openssl the oss project critical to the secure operation of the majority of websites recently in the spotlight for the heartbleed securitybug atthattime opensslwasseverely understaffed.
another notable example is leftpad the trivial loc javascript package that when deleted by its author from the npm2registry caused cascading disruption in thousands ofotherprojectsthat reliedonitbeing accessible onnpm.
besides emphasizing the importance of oss sustainability issues both examples illustrate a challenge with modern code reuse.
indeed withvastamountsofhigh qualityosscodeavailablefor reuse one can declare dependencies on others code instead of copying it into their own taking advantage of the functionality without assuming the burden of maintenance.
this leadsto the formationoflargecodeinterdependencynetworks.however thisalso meansthatlocalsustainabilityissuesaroundindividualprojectscan have widespread network effects.
for example breaking changes changesthatarenotbackwardscompatible areasignificantsource of instability causing negative consequences for dependents downstream .anotherexampleisdeveloperturnover.contributors toandmaintainersofossareoftenoverworkedvolunteers who can decide to stop contributing at any time .
consequently oss projects risk knowledge loss quality degradation oreven extinction again withreverberations downstream.
these challenges are particularly visible in oss package ecosystemslikenpm pypi 3andcran 4wherepackagesformcomplex andoftenbrittledependencychains .withreusesoenticing andso much oss code available howcan one make informed decisions about which packages to use?

to develop our hypotheses we start by reviewing the literature on factors impacting the survival of oss projects defined here asthestateofbeingactivelymaintained.wedistinguishbetween project level factors of which having an appropriate supply of contributor effort is arguably most important and ecosystem level factors inducedbyprojects positioninanecosystemandtheirrelationship with other projects up and downstream.

inordertosurviveandthrive ossprojects typically require a steady supply of contributor effort and projects with more contributors tend to have higher survival rates .

for example comino et al.

oss ecosystems have been an active researchtopic for a review see franco bedoya et al.
anddifferentdefinitionsexist .herewefollowlungu sbroad definition ofossecosystemsascollectionsofrelatedsoftware projects that co evolve in the same environment.
python packagespublishedonpypifitthisdefinition theycoexistinthepypi environmentand asweshowbelow theyareofteninterdependent.
withinanossecosystem developersfrequentlycontributeto multiple projects often at the same time .
in addition to building social capital bridging sub communities also creates connections between projects which can impact project sustainability.
for example casalnuovo et al.
found thatgithub contributors aremorelikelytojoinprojectswithwhichtheyhavepriorsocial connections.
singh et al.
showed usinga longitudinal panel of sourceforge projects that social network ties between developers impactossproject survival.finally wang analyzed sourceforge projects to model survival factors at various project lifecycle stages.
the author found that member social connectionswithotherprojectsandactiveengagementofcontributors present survival advantages at any stage while permissive licenses andlarge contributor baseshelpespeciallyearly on.
a significant missing puzzle piece in prior research on oss sustainabilityis theimpactofaproject sposition independencynetworks on survival or extinction though the heartbleed and leftpad incidents discussed above suggest this might be significant.
indeed ecosystemconnectionsbetweenprojectsextendwellbeyondthe social with complex dependency networks being formed i.e.
one projectreusingfunctionalityfrom another .
wearguethatthesurvivalofanossprojectinanecosystem in addition to all the factors reviewed above depends also on the survival of its dependencies upstream i.e.
other packages the current package depends on and downstream i.e.
packages depending on thecurrent package .specifically whilethebenefitsofdepending on others code in an ecosystem reusing functionality without assumingtheresponsibilityofmaintenance areclear weexpectthat ingeneralhavingmoreupstreamdependenciesmaycreatemore pointsoffailure becauseofthecostsassociatedwithresponding to breaking i.e.
backward incompatible changes.
indeed while different oss ecosystem communities have different practices in planning and deploying breaking changes it is clear that in all ecosystems developers must constantly make dependency managementdecisions.
we expectthat h1.the number of upstream dependencies is related to a lower probabilityofprojectsurvival.
however dependingonanupstreampackagemayalsocreatean incentivetostepuptomakechangesthatbenefityouasauseror to help more generally because an ill maintained upstream project couldincreasemaintenanceeffortdownstream.therefore themore downstreams thelargerthepoolofpotentialresourcesavailable upstream if needed.
this may help explain how the original issues were resolvedwithin hoursfor leftpad anddays for openssl h2.thenumberofdownstreamdependenciesisrelatedtoagreater probability ofprojectsurvival.
inaddition inbothincidents acatalysttothemassivedisruption isalsothefactthatamongimmediatelyaffecteddependencieswere importantnetworkactors.foropensslthesewerepopularwebservers while leftpad was used by babel a core javascript package.
the number of direct dependents may not fully reflect a package s importance.consequently we posit h3.structuralpropertiesindicatingmoreindirectconnectivitythrough transitivedependenciesarerelatedtoagreaterprobabilityofsurvival.

dormant projects.
we consider project as dormant if it is no longerbeingmaintained i.e.
whenit stopsdevelopment commit activity inlinewithpriorwork .thissuggestsastraightforwardapproachtodetectdormantprojects lookforalongperiod ofinactivityinthegithistory andconsiderthetimestampofthe latest commit as the dormant date.
however this is not always accurate e.g.
there are instances when a seemingly dormant project with an activity gap of one year or more is revived by a few commits to officially indicate that the project has been deprecated dormant projects may have also had little activity to begin with thus long gaps are not unusual changed owner or were not as much abandoned as they were completed i.e.
they continue todelivertheintendedvaluewithoutactivemaintenance of developers interviewedbycoelho andvalente reportedthis .
to increase robustness to residual development activity i.e.
fewer false positives we instead only label a project as dormant if ithadlessthanonecommitpermonthonaverageinthe12months prior to its most recent commit.
this fits well with our manual inspections of small samples of the data tens of packages though we do acknowledgethis definitionas apotentialthreatto validity.

recallthatourdatasetislongitudinal organizedinmonthlywindows.measuresderivedfromossdata e.g.
numberofcommits tendtobequitenoisy withhighvariation from one observation e.g.
month to the next.
to increase the robustnessofourmodelstopotentiallyhighwindow to window variance we first smoothed out all numerical variables using a six months sliding window where each value was replaced by the averageoftheprevioussix.11then wesplitprojectdataintosixmonth periods taking only the last observationfrom eachperiod.
as expected we also observed during initial exploration of ourdatathatmanypackagesbecomedormantearly seefigure which shows the probability of survival i.e.
non dormant over time across all pypi packages in our sample.
to model how the different factors contribute to explaining the variability in package survival rates differently early stage compared to later on we split the data set into two parts early stage shutdowns i.e.
stopping or nearlystoppingdevelopmentinthefirstsixmonths whichmatches well our sliding windowsmoothing approach andthe rest.
the early stage shutdowns bydefinitiongivenour smoothing only contribute one observation each while the other packages contribute more.
therefore we model this group using logistic regression glminr withtheresponsevariablebeingthelikelihood of a project becoming dormant.
for the remaining packages the data contains monthly observations.
a package s dormant variable istruein the last month if we labeled the package as having stopped activity see above and falseotherwise surviving packages have therefore dormant falsein all windows.
to model these we estimate a cox proportional hazards model coxphin r .

maintainer interviews qualitative to triangulate and enhance our modeling results we conducted semistructured interviewswithpackagemaintainers.recruitment was done by soliciting via email using addresses collected from github profiles or personal websites.
we used stratified sampling to identify potential interviewees packages with extreme feature values largesize 2projectsthatrecentlybecameinactive 4randomlyselectedtostratifythesamplebyprojectsize and1highly productive individual contributing to many projects of different sizes.
for each project the most active person in the last two years wassolicitedviaemail.wesent32emails received12responses and conducted interviews we reached theoretical saturation meaning roughlythat subsequentdataallfitwithin thecategories derivedfrom the previous interviews around the sixthinterview.
the interview protocol was centered around the model features asking about the predictive power of these features their expected effect and comments on the effects discovered by the model.
interviews also included several open ended questions about the definition of sustainability in oss project context and missing factors that should be incorporatedintothe model.

upstreams.
upstream dependencies were expected to increase the chances of projects becoming dormant.
the modeling effects are nuanced.
in the first six months a higher number of upstreams correlates with higher chances of dormancy as hypothesized althoughthepresenceofa dormantupstreamreducesthis risk.
later on a higher number of upstreams correlates with lower chances of dormancy but the presence of a dormant upstream increasesthis risk.
the interviews with utility library project maintainers offer a potentialexplanation.suchprojectsareconsidereddormantperour definition while in fact they are feature complete.
reusing feature completelibrariescanboostdevelopmentofanewproject hence thereduceddormancyriskinthefirstsixmonths.inthelong term however projects may start to incur higher costs of maintaining compatibilitywithdormantupstreams hence the increasedrisk.
at the same time having more upstreams overall in the long term enables more reuse compensating for increased dormancy risks.
still interviewees were cautious stressing that it is better tolimitupstreamdependenciesinthelong termtothosethatare really necessary as there is a trade off between development effort lower with more reuse and potential compatibility issues later on.
the mention of as few as possible within reason suggested a non lineareffect whichweaddedtothethirdmodelasa quadratic term of the number of upstreams however this term did not have a statisticallysignificant effect.we further illustrate this trade off.
on the one hand the positive effect of dependency adoption comes from saving resources on implementation.
a striking example comes from an interview with a project maintainer who wasabletoreuseadomain specificlibraryfromasimilarproject.
the maintainer claimed that most projects in this domain die in an attempt to implement this very expensive piece of functionality so adoption ofthis dependency wasessentialfor the projectsuccess.

these explanations together withmodeling results mostly support h2.
h3.structuralproperties.relativepositioninthedependency network was only relevant for four projects in the interview pool having transitive downstream dependencies and even for those the dependency network was not directly observable.
due to these constraints therole of therelative position in the dependencynetwork was mostlydiscussed from a theoretical perspective rather thanpersonal experience.
in most cases transitive downstreams were interpreted in the same way as direct ones as a user base.
two participants stated that projects higher in the dependency chain need to put more resources into sustainability because of their special position.

organizational support.
university involvement has a special role in the python community.
many signature python projects are related to traditionally academic domains data science machinelearning artificialintelligence naturallanguage processing etc.
our expectation was that university projects have extra risks such asstudents leavingaftergraduation end offunding cycles etc.
however modeling results indicated that university involvement is not a significant dormancy risk factor in the first sixmonths butinlater stagesurvivalmodelsitreducesthechance ofbecoming dormantbyapproximately25 .
in our interview sample fourparticipants were university affiliates.
overall all four indicated that their oss work is currently funded through a university through a grant or contract and their contributionsarerelatedtotheirpositioninacademia.twoofthem started their projects as students one joined an existing project and the last project was created as a practical tool to support existingresearch.
two intervieweestransitioned into facultypositions during their projects and thus had an extended perspective on the evolution of an academic project.
they commented on three survivalchallengesinthelifecycleofauniversityproject surviving thestudentgraduationcycle survivingtheacademicfundingcycle andgrowingoutsideacademia.twooutoffouruniversityaffiliates we interviewed assumed that the diversity of institutions involved might also be used as an indicator of sustainability where projects with multiple institutions involved are expected to be truly owned bytheresearchcommunity incontrasttolocalresearchprojects.
it was also suggested thatthe university involvement effect might vary dependingonthe area ofscience.
the explanation above and the modeling results partially supporth5.however increasedsustainabilityofuniversityprojects might be specific to the python ecosystem due to its high share of academic projects and should be further tested in different ecosystems byfuture work.
commercialinvolvement was expected to have a positive effect on sustainability lower risk of dormancy but the modelssuggest otherwise the feature also elicited somewhat controversial interview explanations.
a shared opinion about commercial involvement among interviewees was that companies bring resourcestotheproject butthissupportisnotsustainablelongterm.
common concerns include misalignment of companies priories withtheprojectgoalsandsustainabilityissuescausedbycompanies withdrawingfrom aproject.
the overall extent of commercial involvement in pypi seems small.

oursurvivalmodelsshowthatinadditiontoknownproject level factorsimpactingsustainability suchasthenumberofcontributors and the number of users a project s chances of becoming dormant havinglimitedactivity isinfluencedbyaseriesofecosystem level factors such as its position in the ecosystem dependency network.
theseresults have several implications.
first these results may be actionable for oss researchers and platformdesigners .
the ecosystem level variables we foundto correlate with a project s risk of becoming dormant despite being aggregations of publicly accessible data are not readily observable on platforms like github.
one of the defining features of github istransparency developersrelyon signals displayedon githubrepository and user pages e.g.
counts of stars and followers repositorybadges toformimpressionsabouteachotherand theirwork .ourapproachshowshownewsignalstodisplay theseotherwiseunobservableecosystem levelqualities suchasa project s position in the ecosystem interdependency network or its level oforganizational support could be developed.
in turn displaying these signals may help developers identify sustainable projects and projects at risk steer developers and organizationstowardscontributingtocentralprojectsmostinneed of support and overall help nudge the ecosystem towards more efficientallocationofcontributoreffort.recalltheopenssland leftpad examples discussed in the introduction.
in these and other similarcases arguablythecentralityoftheseprojectsforthehealth oftherestoftheecosystemwasnotasclearbeforetheirrespective prominentincidentsasithasbecomeafterthefact.newlydevelopedsignals suchastheonesourapproachcaninform couldhave been used to reduce the information asymmetry.
therefore it is not surprising that recently both githuband pypi have started displaying informationon dependents anddependencies forsome osspackageshostedorpublishedthere.weexpectothersignals willbecome available inthe future.
our results may also be actionable for oss practitioners .
if future research confirms that there is a causal relationship not just the correlation we demonstrated in our work between the variables we identified and a project s risk of becoming inactive that may providemeansforsuggestinghowtoextendthelifeofprojectsthat become inactive withoutbeing feature complete.
still we emphasize that the response variable in this study dormancy or low development activity is not always indicative of projectabandonment anditthereforerequirescarefulinterpretationandshouldbeadjustedtoprojectcontext.whileallabandoned projects are dormant not alldormant projects are abandoned.
for example utilitylibrarieswithawelldefinedscopedonotrequire furthermaintenanceandthuswillalsoberenderedasdormant even thoughtheyarenotabandoned.oneintervieweeusedsmtplibtoillustratetheissue.thislibraryimplementsastandardunchangedfor 30yearsanddoesnotrequiremaintenance.thisclaimissupported bypriorresearchonreasonsforossprojectfailure indicatingthat ofseeminglyabandonedprojectsarejustconsideredfeaturecomplete by their authors .
this suggests that when interpretingsustainabilityindicators oneshouldadjustatleasttoproject classandsize.
e.g.
existingdependentprojectsearlyinthelifecycle might indicate a chipoff from another project feature complete frombirth whichisnotanegativesustainabilityindicator.likely a dormant upstream project might not be an issue if it is feature complete but can be a problem if it requires constant maintenance.
in practice it means that the presented survival model does not fully apply to feature complete projects and one should consider qualitative methodsinstead.
future research should try to further distinguish feature complete projects from abandoned ones.
suggested ways to determine if a dormant project is complete rather than abandoned may include looking at maintainers activity outside the project nondevelopment activity mailing lists issue trackers and community forum discussions and dynamics of the project user base some anecdotalevidence alsosuggeststhatprojectsabandoned bytheir maintainerscontinuetobeusedbyexistingadopters butarerarely adoptedbynewprojects incontrasttofeaturecompleteprojects whichcontinue to be adoptedas dependencies innewprojects.
conclusions priorworkrevealedanumberofprojectcharacteristicsrelatedto thesustainabilityofopen sourceprojects.inthismixed methods study we have extended those results to include ecosystem factors.
we theorized about expected effects and used survival analysis on a large set of pypi projects hosted on github modeling risk of dormancy early in their life cycle and later on.
we then triangulated the models through interviews with project maintainers and modeledinteraction effectsinformedbythe qualitative analysis.
