debugging software failures is still a painful time consuming and expensive process.
for instance recent studies showed that debugging activities often account for about of the overall development cost of software products .
there are many factors contributing to the cost of debugging but the most impacting one istheextensivemanualeffortthatisstillrequiredtoidentifyand remove faults.
so far the automation of debugging activities es sentially resulted in the development of techniques that provideuseful insights about the possible locations of faults the inputsand states of the application responsible for the failures as wellas the anomalous operations executed during failures.
however developers must still put a relevant effort on the analysis of thefailedexecutionstoexactlyidentifythefaultsthatmustbefixed.

recently researchers focused on a new class of approaches namelyprogramrepairtechniques whosekeyideaistotry toautomaticallyrepairsoftwaresystemsbyproducinganactualfix thatcan bevalidatedbythe testersbeforeit isfinallyaccepted or that can be adapted to properly fit the system.
the benefit of using these techniques is that the fix both explains the reason of the failureandprovidesapossiblesolutiontotheproblem thusalleviating theeffortnecessarytoidentifyandcorrectfaults.sinceprogramrepair techniques have the potential to dramatically reduce thedebuggingeffort theyattractedtheinterestofmanyresearchers who produced several approaches for repairing different classes of faults under different conditions and hypotheses.

interest in program repair techniques greatly increased in the last few years as shown in figure our tse paper contributes to the research on such techniques by surveying a body of papers about automatic software repair techniques illustrating the algorithms and the approaches comparing them on representative examples criticallyanalyzingtheircapabilitiesinrepairingfaulty programs surveyingtheresultsachievedsofarandsummarizing them into a set of key facts that show the trade offs and factors influencing the effectiveness of these approaches and identifying the key open challenges that we believe are the most important and that can influence the future research in the area.
