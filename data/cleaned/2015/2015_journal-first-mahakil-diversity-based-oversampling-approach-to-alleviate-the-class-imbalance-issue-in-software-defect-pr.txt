exploiting this theory mahakil interprets two distinct sub classes as parents and generates anewinstancethatinheritsdifferenttraitsfromeachparentand contributes to the diversity within the data distribution.
we extensively compare mahakil with five other sampling approaches using20releasesofdefectdatasetsfromthepromiserepository and five prediction models.
our experiments indicate that mahakil improves the prediction performance for all the models and achieves better and moresignificant pfvalues than the other oversampling approaches based on robust statistical tests.

techniques address this concern by creating new minoritydefectivemodulestobalancetheminorityandmajorityclass distribution.
notwithstanding the successes attained by these techniques theysometimesgenerateerroneousdatainstances which lead to high false positives.
they also tend to generate less diverse data points and data points very similar to existing samples because they consider only nearest neighbor samples.
we proposea novel oversampling technique that generates diverse synthetic data restricted within the minority class region.

the proposed approach named mahakil oversampling based on the theory of inheritance and the mahalanobis distance increases the diversitywithintheminorityclassbyuniquelycreatingnewsynthetic minority instances based on a typical case having a small diversity measure distance value and an atypical case havingalargediversitymeasuredistancevalue sothattheresultantinstance becomes not too typical and not too atypical.
new samples are generated by computing the average between two instances merged together based on the mahalanobis distance disparity.
