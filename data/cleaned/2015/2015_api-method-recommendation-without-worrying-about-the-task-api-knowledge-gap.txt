introduction application programming interfaces apis in software libraries e.g.
java sdk play an important role in modern software development.withthehelpofapis developerscancompletetheir programmingtasksmoreefficiently.however itisnoteasytobe familiarwithallapisinalargelibrary.thus developersoftenneed to check the api documentation to learn how to use an unfamiliar api for a programming task and the prerequisite is that they already know which api to use but are just unfamiliar with the api.
this situation can be referred to as known unknowns .
however a more practical scenario is that developers only have the requirement of a programming task while they do not even know which api is worth learning i.e.
unknown unknowns .
a possiblesolutionistousethenaturallanguagedescriptionofthe programming task as a query and use information retrieval ir approachestoobtainsomecandidateapiswhosedocumentationis similartothequery.however thissolutionmaynotworkwelldue tothelexicalgapbetweenthequeryandtheapidocumentation.
for example given the query how to initialize all values in anarraytofalse?
thedescriptionofthemostappropriatejavaapi methodarrays.fill is assigns the specified boolean value to each element of the specified array of booleans.
which does not contain any important keywords like initialize orfalsein the query.
recently a neural network based approach called word embedding has been proposed to capture the semantic meaning of different words.
it represents each word by a low dimensional vector and semantically similar words e.g.

ye et al.
leveraged word embedding to bridge the lexical gap between the query of programming task and java api documentation.
however by replicatingtheirstudy weobservetwomajorproblems aslisted below.
the first problem is that they investigated api recommendation at class level only.
given the above query example their approach recommendsonlythe arraysclassanddevelopersstillhavetocheck about methods to locate arrays.fill if they check the methods onebyoneinthedefaultorderinthe arraysdocumentation.while theirapproachcanbeappliedformethod levelrecommendation its effectiveness is unknown.
the second problem is that even if their approach could bridge the lexical gap it is still difficult to find the relevant api whose description does not share semantically similar words with the query.
forexample given thequery how tocheck whether a class exists?
the most relevant java api method recommended by ye et al.
s approach is org.omg.corba.object.
is a whose description is checks whether this object is an instance of a class that implementsthegiveninterface.
andthesimilarityscorebetween this description and the query is .
since the two sentences havesemanticallysimilarwords e.g.
classandobject orexactly thesamewords.however thetrulyrelevantapiforthequeryis java.lang.class.forname whose description is returns the class object associated with the class with the given string name.
its similarity score with the query is only .

developers expectations on api recommendation to gain insights into how developers search for apis to resolve programming tasks and the developers expectations on automatic api recommendation techniques weconducteda survey with javadevelopersfromtwoitcompanies bothareoutsourcingcompanies with more than employees and received replies.
our survey includes the following questions do you often need to search for appropriate apis for your programming tasks?
what tools and or resources do you usually use to search apis?
and why do you prefer these tools and or resources?
do you feel searching apis on the internet is a time consuming task?

according to the responses we have the following findings oftherespondentsagreedorstronglyagreedthattheyoftenneed to search for appropriate apis to resolve different programming tasks during development.

building language models for similarity calculation to measure a query s similarity to a so post or an api description weneedtobuilddomain specificlanguagemodels.wefirst build a text corpus by extracting the text content from so posts in htmlpages.weremovelongcodesnippetsenclosedinhtmltag angbracketleftpre angbracketright but keep short code fragments in angbracketleftcode angbracketrightin natural language sentences.
we use nltk package to tokenize the sentence.

java .usingthesocorpus wetrainawordembeddingmodelusing word2vec .wordembeddingmodelprovidesthebasicmodelto measure word similarity.
then we build the word idf inverse document frequency vocabulary.
a word s idf represents the inverse of thenumber ofso poststhat containthe word.wereduce each wordinthecorpustoitsrootform aka.stemming usingthenltk package .thus thewordswiththesamerootformwillhavethe same idf value.
the more posts in which a word appears the less likelythewordcarriesimportantsemanticinformation andthus its idf is lower.
we use idf as a weight on top of word embedding similarity.
finally the words in api documentation would directly use this word embedding model and idf vocabulary since the text volume of so posts is much larger than api documentation.

biker first transforms the text of a question s title and the query into two bags of words denoted as tandq respectively.

detectingapientities.
afterretrievingthetop ksimilarquestions bikerusesseveralheuristicrulestoextractapientitiesfrom eachquestion sanswers.theseapisareconsideredascandidate apis for recommendation.
if an api is not mentioned in any of the top ksimilarquestions itislesslikelytobetherightapiforthe query.thus wedonotconsiderallapisofalanguageorlibrary for recommendation.
in this way a lot of irrelevant apis would be filtered out.
todetectapientities wefirstmanuallycheckedalargenumber of api related questions.
we observe that an important api mentionedbydevelopers isoftenhighlightedwith thehtmltag angbracketleftcode angbracketrightor referenced by a hyperlink to the api s corresponding documentation page.
thus biker detects api entities using the following two heuristics bikercheckseveryhyperlinkineachanswerandusesregular expressions to identify the hyperlink to a library s official api documentationsite forexample forjava apidocumentation.thenitusesregularexpressionstodetectthe fullnameofthecorrespondingapimethodfromthehyperlink andmarkthismethodasacandidateapi.forexample giventhe hyperlink lass.html forname java.lang.string it extracts the api method java.lang.class.forname.
bikerfirstbuildsadictionarythatstoresthenamesofallapisof a language or library crawled from the language or library s officialdocumentationsite.thenitcheckstheplaintextcontainedin every html tag angbracketleftcode angbracketrightin each answer.
if the text fully matches any api method in the dictionary it is marked as a candidate api.note thatin mostcases developers wouldomit thepackage name of an api.
for example java.lang.class.forname is usually written as class.forname.
thus our dictionary only stores the partially qualified name of an api for string matching.
.
.
calculating similarity score for ranking candidate apis.
afterobtainingalistofcandidateapisfromthetop ksimilarquestions bikercalculatesthesimilarityscorebetweeneachcandidate api and the query.
given an api and a query q their similarity scoreisacombinationoftwoscores namely simsoandsimdoc.
specifically simsomeasures the similarity between the query and the question title tof a top k similar question in which the api is mentioned and simdocmeasuresthesimilaritybetweenthequery and the api s description in official api documentation.
supposethatamongallthetop ksimilarquestions theapiis mentioned in nquestions then simsois computed as simso api q min summationtext.1n i 1sim ti q n log2n wheresim ti q represents the similarity score between the query andthetitleofthe i thquestionthatmentionstheapi and sim ti q is calculated based on equation .simsoconsiders two aspects.
first the score should be related to the similarity between each question and the query.
thus it calculates the average of the similarity score between each question s title and the query.
second if theapiismentionedinmultiplequestions itismorelikelytobe therightapiforthequery.thus thescoreisfurtherboostedbased on the number of questions.
we add a logarithm transformation log2ntocontrolthescaleofboosting.forexample thescorewould be boosted by if the api is detected in questions.
we also restrict that the boosted score should not exceed .
thesimdocis also calculated based on equation 2given the queryqand the api description d. finally the similarity score between the query and the api is the harmonic mean of the corresponding simsoandsimdoc.

unable to execute unix command through java codecode snippets code snippet process p runtime.getruntime .exec command code snippet runtime.exec whatever cmd command you need to execute code snippet string command1 mv filename bgw feeds ibs incoming runtime.getruntime .exec command1 this because our survey responses and interviews with developers suggest that developers usually need to check more information about api description and api usage examples to decide which apishouldbechosenfortheirtasks.thus thesupplementaryinformation summarized by biker considers three aspects as listed below official api description it presents the api designer s official description of an api so that api users can quickly check the api s functionality.
title of similar questions based on the top k similar questions it extracts the title of all the questions whose answers mention the api.
then it ranks these questions by their titles similarity scores with the query in descending order and presentthesequestionstitles withhyperlinkstothecorrespondingwebpage .
to reduce information overloading it only presents thetop questions.
thus developers can compare question titles with their tasks.
code snippets based on the top k similar questions it checks each question s answersand extracts the code snippets containing the api.
specifically given an api e.g.

thus developers can check these code snippets to understand how to use the api.

.
adapting biker for class level recommendation by default biker recommends apis at method level.
however it can be easily adapted to support class level recommendation.first we need to revise the heuristic rules for detecting api en tities.
specifically we change the regular expressions so that itonly extracts the api s class name with full path of its package from the hyperlink to an api documentation page.
we also change the dictionary to store all apis class names for string matching.second we need to change the way of calculating simdocin the stepofsimilarityscorecalculation.althoughanapiclasshasits own description like an api method we do not use it since weobserve that the description of an api class is rather long in most cases and it usually does not contain much useful information for specific task requirements.
thus biker calculates the similarity score between the query and the description of each method in the class andchoosesthemaximumscoreastheresultof simdocfor this api class.

table5presents the model training time and the average query processing time of biker and the two baseline methods.
as reported by deepapi s authors their approach takes hours of model training since their approach is based on rnn i.e.
adeepneuralnetwork whichiscomputationallyexpensive duringtraining .thetrainingtimecostofrackisunknown sinceit isnotreported bytheauthorsand itisnot easytoreplicate the training process without rack s source code.
biker takes minutes to train which is also relatively slow and almost the whole time cost is due to training word embedding model.

the major computation cost of biker for query processing is due to thestepofsimilarquestionsretrieval whereweneedtocompare thequerywiththetitlesofabout120thousandquestions.toimprove the time efficiency we can reduce the size of questions to be compared with some heuristic rules e.g.

for example bigdecimal.setscale ormath.round are also the correct answers for q10.
thus we manually check each participants answers to make sure the correctnessisalso1iftheysubmittedthecorrectbutnotgroundtruth apis.
completion time this metric evaluates how fast a participant can answer the question.
one problem is that in some cases the recordedcompletiontimemaynotreflectthetrueeffortneededto answer the question.
for example for the deepapi group while 6participantsneededatleast30secondstoanswerq9 thereis1 participantwhoonlyspent12seconds.byconsultingwiththis participant wefoundthatheisaseniorjavadeveloperandhecan directly answer this question without any tool s support.
on the other hand we recorded more than minutes completion time for a single question for a few participants.

.
participants comments we encouraged the participants in biker full group to write their comments and suggestions for biker after the experiment.
forthe participants in the other three groups we also showed them the results recommended by the full version of biker after they finished their tasks and invited them to provide comments and feedbackstoo.amongallthe28participants 13participantsprovided some comments and suggestions.
based on these comments we summarized several major aspects of biker that are liked or disliked by participants as shown below positive opinions giventhejavadocandcodesnippets icaneasilydecidewhetherthisapiisuseful .idon t need to google for more information in most cases this saves me a lot of time.
since the tool recommended apis there must be some apis not helpful to solve the question.
however i especially appreciate the fact that some of these unrelated apis also inspired me a lot.
for example in q2 it also recommended the api for unmodifiable list and map whichwould be useful if the scenario or requirement is broadened.
thecodesnippets isveryuseful.itgivesme moreconfidence tomakethefinalchoiceand shows me how to use the api.
negative opinions although i can easily judge which api is correct with the information like javadoc provided sometimesistilldon tknowhowtouseit.yes yourtoolcanprovidecodesnippetsformostapis butsomeapisarenotandsometimestheyarejusttheexactapisiwanttofurthercheck!is this a bug?
for example in q6 you recommended bufferedreader.readline as the first result butno code snippet provided and thejavadoc is also too simple... the layout is not ideal.
sometimes it just looks like a mess especially when every recom mended api has multiple code snippets with many lines.
sometimestheapinameisalreadyenoughformetojudge.whydon tyou makeadditional information folded up and let me to decide read it or not by myself?
fromthesecomments wecanseethat participantscanbenefit from the supplementary information provided for each api.
however sometimesbikermayfailtoextractcodesnippetsforsome apis because we only scanned the top k similar questions.
we could improve this component by building a mapping database which stores the api and its code snippets extracted from more questions.
finally as pointed out by the participants we need to carefullydesignthelayout orthewaywepresentthesupplementaryinformationtomaketheusefulinformationmoreusable which is an important aspect of user experience to be improved.
threats to validity threats to internal validity relates to the errors in the implementation of biker and the baseline methods.
we have double checkedourcodetomakesurethatthequestionsintestingdataset arenotincludedinthequestionbase.forthebaselinemethods wedirectlyusedtheir publishedtools.thus thereis littlethreattothe approach implementation.
the degree of participants carefulness andeffortspentinouruserstudymayalsoaffectsthevalidityofour user studyresults.
to reducethis threat werecruited participants whoexpressinterestsinourresearchandmadetheaverageyears of development experience in each group as uniform as possible.
threats to external validity relates to the quality of our dataset and generalizability of our results.
to ensure the quality of ourdataset we had two labelers to label the data and we relied on the accepted answer to label the ground truth apis.

another threat is that biker only supports java api recommendation.
but this is an implementation limitation rather than a methodological threat.
it would not be difficult to adapt biker to support api recommendation for other programming languages as long as we can obtain related so questions and api documentation.
