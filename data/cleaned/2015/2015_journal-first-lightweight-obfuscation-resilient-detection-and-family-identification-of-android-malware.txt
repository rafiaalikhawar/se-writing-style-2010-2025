lightweight obfuscation resilient detection and family identification of android malware joshua garcia mahmoud hammad and sam malek department of informatics university of california irvine irvine california usa joshug4 hammadm malek uci.edu abstract the number of malicious android apps has been and continues toincreaserapidly.thesemalwarecan damageoralterotherfiles or settings install additional applications obfuscate their behaviors propagate quickly and so on.
to identify and handle such malware a security analyst can significantly benefit from identifyingthefamilytowhichamaliciousappbelongsratherthanonly detecting if an app is malicious.
to address these challenges wepresent a novel machine learning based android malware detec tion and family identification approach revealdroid that oper ates without the need to perform complex program analyses or extract large sets of features.

in this paper we introduce revealdroid a lightweight machine learning based approach for detecting malicious android apps and identifyingtheirfamilies.revealdroidleveragesasetoffeatures selected to achieve obfuscation resiliency efficiency of analysis permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed forprofitorcommercialadvantageandthatcopiesbearthisnoticeandthefullcitation onthefirstpage.copyrightsforthird partycomponentsofthisworkmustbehonored.

data flow analysis or large sets of features e.g.
hundreds of thousands of features which can lead to scalability problems.
more specifically our selected machine learning features are based on android api usage including resolution of apis invoked using reflection and function calls e.g.
system calls made by native binaries within an android app.
no previous work has included native codefeatureextractiontodetectmalware.includingfeatures based on reflection and native code significantly aids revealdroid with achieving obfuscation resiliency.
revealdroid is capable of accurately detecting malicious apps witha98 accuracy andidentifyingtheirfamilieswitha95 accuracy in under seconds on average.
revealdroid can maintain highaccuracyevenforobfuscatedapps.weevaluaterevealdroid s detection and family identification accuracy by comparing its abilitytocorrectlyidentifymalwareandclassifyitsfamilyonadataset of over benign apps and over malicious apps from two different malware repositories.
we further compare revealdroid s detection and family identification accuracy against stateof the researchapproaches adagio drebin andmudflow all ofwhich areapproachesformalware detection anddendroid an approach for malware family identification.
revealdroid has an overall greater accuracy by about and mislabels fewer benign apps as malicious than mudflow revealdroidachieves up to greater accuracy than adagio and up to greateraccuracythandrebin.additionally revealdroidachievesa higher classification rate than dendroid.
this paper makes the following contributions revealdroid demonstrates that highly lightweight analyses that extractapi basedfeatures including thosebasedon reflection andnativecodefeaturescombinedwithmachinelearning can achieve high accuracy scalability and obfuscation resiliency.
we construct an updated dataset of over malware apps labeledwiththeir447malwarefamiliesandassessrevealdroid s family identification accuracy on that dataset.
we make this updateddatasetavailableonlineforresearchersandpractitioners.
toevaluaterevealdroid sobfuscationresiliency weapplyseveral transformations to malware apps in order to obfuscate them and assess its ability to detect and identify families of thosetransformed apps.
using these transformed apps we compare revealdroid saccuracyfordetectionagainstadagio drebin and mudflow and for family identification against dendroid.
we also make the transformed dataset available online.
we assess the efficiency of revealdroid s feature extraction and machine learning classification.
we show that revealdroid s featurescanbeextracted onaverage inunder90seconds while stillexhibitingobfuscationresiliencyandaccuracy.wefurther demonstrate that revealdroid can produce classifiers efficiently as compared to other state of the research tools.
