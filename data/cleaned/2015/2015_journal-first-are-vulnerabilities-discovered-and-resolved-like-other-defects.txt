if security defects i.e.

objective thegoalofthisresearchistosupporttechnicalleadersin making security specific software development process improvements by analyzingthe differencesbetween thediscovery andresolution of defects versus that of vulnerabilities.method we extend orthogonal defect classification odc a schemeforclassifyingsoftwaredefectstosupportsoftwaredevelopment process improvement to study process related differences betweenvulnerabilitiesanddefects creatingodc vulnerabilities odc v .weappliedodc vtoclassify583vulnerabilitiesand583 defectsacross133releasesofthreeopen sourceprojects firefox phpmyadmin and chrome .results compared with defects vulnerabilities are found later in the development cycle andare more likely to be resolvedthrough changestoconditionallogic.infirefox vulnerabilitiesareresolved morequicklythandefects.fromaprocessimprovementperspective these results indicate opportunities may exist for more efficient vulnerability detection and resolution.
