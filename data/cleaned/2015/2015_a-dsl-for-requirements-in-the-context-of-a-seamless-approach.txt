however the use of a formal approach to express requirements shall lead to validate the systems in a rigorous way.
to overcome the difficulty of formal methods adoption traceability is often used.
this can help to detect which requirements aresatisfied providingacoverageinformation butgiventhat traceabilitylinksarenotsemanticallydefined theselinkscannot be automatically analyzed.
there is so a main question to address how to link requirements and other artifacts such as requirements or even system parts to automaticallyvalidateasystem?
thisquestionalsoraisestheproblem thatincomplex systems stakeholderswithdifferentbackgrounds are involved and often use heterogeneous tools.
incose emphasizesthisneedtoconciliatetheseveralviewsofasystem and address it as a major challenge.
these questions are critical.
indeed a lack of consistency betweenrequirementsandsystemscanleadtodramaticfailures such as some of the one listed in .
previous works aswestatedin twoworldscanbedistinguishedinre1.formal methods are by definition the more mathematically rigorous and approaches like event b or vdm have been successfully used among years.
as mentioned in section the major issues of these approaches is linked to their main advantage there are formal and so discouraging to non experts.
that is why the most used tools industrial ones rely on natural language.
ibm rational doors or reqtify thus allow to create traceability links between requirements expressed in a microsoft word document for example with a part of the system e.g.
someccode.sysml alsoproposesarequirementsdiagram that allows users to link requirements to other parts of systems such as blocks .

for example relax or stimulus propose to express requirements in a constrained nl allowing users to express requirements as they usually do.
their approaches arehoweversemanticallydefined infuzzybranchingtemporal logic forrelaxandonaprogramminglanguagebasedonlucid synchrone and lutin for stimulus.
this helps the user to check requirements while using an easy to handle tool.

this driver controls the validation of the requirement after being allocated an ambulance shall be mobilized within two time units .
the mobilize ambulance feature is the controlled one i.e.

to make explicit the relationships linked to requirements expressed through specification drivers we modify this mechanism2.

moreover we add semantics to these links defined in table .

thus byaddingsemanticsonlinksbetweenrequirementsand artifacts wegetamorepreciseinformationonthevalidityofthe system.
besides we plan to explore the inverse relationships to detect patterns that can be used to generate relationships between requirements.
this can also help to detect relationships between requirements coming from several stakeholders.

addressing the several stakeholders addressing the several stakeholders is a quite difficult problem since they used several kinds of representations.

we called this language requirement specific modeling language rsml .
it is a dsl with a concrete syntax in a nl style such as stimulus or relax semantically defined in eiffel.

this should lead to reduce the gap between require ments specifications and implementation.
we also expect to use autoprooftofindsomeinconsistenciesbetweenrequirementsinan earlystage inacomplementarywaytomodel checkingapproaches such as stimulus.
evaluations to evaluate the proposed approach we are currently exploring different ways of implementation.
first we want to consider different activity domains.
so we applied the approach on two case studies one is the embedded systemofthelgs andtheotheroneisthereactivesystem las alreadyseeninthispaper.weintendtoapplyitalsoon authorized licensed use limited to lahore univ of management sciences.

ase september montpellier france florian galinier an information system a banking system for example.
it will so be clear that rsml can apply on a large panel of activity domains.
secondly throughtheseapplications wewillconsiderseveral typesofrequirements e.g.
timingconstraints temporalrequirements ... .
for now the enactment of this approach on the lgs andthelasallowedustwicetohighlightissues.inthefirstcase we identified it in a set of ltl rules formalizing the lgs temporal requirements .
in the second case the failure of the autoproofsessionwaslinkedtoamisinterpretationofoneofthetiming las requirements.
supporting all these types of requirements our approach could prove efficient to express reactive systems requirements.
thirdly wearecurrentlyimplementingtheapproachonaprototypethatwillbetestinthescopeofaprocessinvolvingseveral stakeholders.atfirst weintendtoproposeasubjectofpractical classestostudents intheframeworkofrecourse.themainideais tosplittheclassinthreegroups.weshallsupplythreecasestudies.
each of the groups will have a specific case study to be handledand so a set of requirements expressed in a msword document.
every group will first supply its own rsml code then propose the correspondingeiffelcodewiththetraceabilitylinkstothereference document and endly run it with autoproof to check the validity ofitssystem.wewillsoprovetheusefulnessoftheapproachfor both novices and advanced stakeholders alike.
finally and border line we would also like to make an experimentation to see if from the rsml code of the lgs we can deduce avalidsetofltlconstraints.actually webelievethatiffroman rsml system we can not only deduce eiffel systems benefiting fromitspowerfulenvironment eis autoproof ... butalsoltl formulae therewouldbepossibleto obtainevent bsystems and so on.
we will so enforce the usefulness of rsml being able to use it to exploit others formal verification languages and tools.
conclusion and perspective wepresentinthispapersomesolutionstoleadtheuserstoformally express requirements without any specific knowledge while being able to validate them.
weproposeforthispurposeaseamlessapproachofdevelopment.
it will reduce the gap between requirements and system usinga unique language to express both of them eiffel.
to ease theanalysis of the whole requirements we define the semantics of relationshipsthatexistbetweenrequirementsandotherartifacts.
we also present rsml a modeling language providing a canvas to expressrequirementsinasyntaxthatisnearfromnaturallanguage and so easy to handle.
since we automatically translate rsmlrequirements in eiffel code we are able to use an eiffel solver to validate the provided system.
this should also help users to detect errors in requirements or in the system that have to meet theserequirements as early as possible.
this is an ongoing work and proposed solutions are still to improve e.g.
we are extending the syntax of rsml and adding new relationships.
the first experiments give us some encouraging results and we plantoapplyourapproachtomorecomplexcasestudy withmore requirements coming from diverse domains.
