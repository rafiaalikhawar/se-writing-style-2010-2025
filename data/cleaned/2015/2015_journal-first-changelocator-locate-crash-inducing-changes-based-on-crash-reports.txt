understanding software changes that induce a crashing bug can provide useful contextualinformationforbugfixingandishighlydemandedby developers.
locating the bug inducing changes is also useful for automatic program repair since it narrows down the root causes andreducesthesearchspaceofbugfixlocation.however currentlytherearenosystematicstudiesonlocatingthesoftwarechangesto a source code repository that induce a crashing bug reflected by a bucket of crash reports.
to tackle this problem we first conducted an empirical study on characterizing the bug inducing changes for crashingbugs denotedas crash inducing changes .wealsopropose changelocator amethodtoautomaticallylocatecrash inducing changes for a given bucket of crash reports.
we base our approach onalearningmodelthatusesfeaturesoriginatedfromourempirical study and train the model using the data from the historicalfixed crashes.
