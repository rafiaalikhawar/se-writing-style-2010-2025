one fundamental task in spl is to select features that meet the requirements of customers avoid possible feature conflicts and meanwhile optimize design goals in productconfiguration.hence givencustomerrequirements itis greatlyhelpfultoguidethevendorstomakeautomateddecision on selecting optimal features.
in practice as real world spls contain thousands of features manual feature selection for product configuration according to the given requirements and constraints is extremely difficult if not impossible.forexample linuxx86kernelcontains6888features and constraints as reported in .

non guarantee of finding evenly distributed solutions whileretainingthecorrectnessofsolutions e.g.

all these drawbacks are inherent in the nature of heuristic algorithms.
to circumvent them is it feasible to solve the optimal feature selection problem from a different perspective?
let us revisit the nature of this sbse problem decision variables are binary andallconstraintsandobjectivesarelinear see .2and .hence integerprogramming ip morespecificallyintegerlinearprogramming isapplicableforthisproblemaslongasmultipleobjectives can be reduced to one.

the operation procedure has several iterations each increases ordecreases theright handsideoftheconstrained objectiveby a step and runs ip method.
the constraint method and its improvement cwmoip constraint weighted multi objective integer programming are elaborated in .
during the evaluation we find that the brute force iteration of all objectives ranges will call ip too many times make solving running forever.
this indicates existing moip methods constraint and cwmoip are capable on small systems from splot but not on large ones technical innovation.
for large problem it is practical and meaningfultogenerateagoodrepresentationoftheparetofront.
therefore we propose to combine the hit and run h r method withnormalconstraints nc method .ncmethod was originally proposed for generating pareto front representation for continuous optimization problem.
h r is efficient in randomly generatinguniformly distributedpointsinsideanyboundedregion.due to the high dimensionality and complex boundaries of the utopia plane see definition in we propose to improve nc method by using h r. the essential idea is to use uniformly distributedreference points on the utopia plane to generate representativepareto optimalsolutions .theadvantagesofourmethodarethree fold .

theory of converting logical formulae to inequalities convertinglogicalformulae lf intoinequalitiesisatypicalproblem of or.
by bip upon the inequalities it can be rapidly decided whether the original given lfs can be satisfied and how to be satisfiedifso.in hookerproposed andproved thatthesatisfiability problem of a conjunctive normal form cnf can be directly reducedtoabipproblem.thoughdetailedstepsarenotformalizedin the basic idea of conversion was explained.
generally two ways can convert an arbitrary lf as a cnf.
except for each atomic proposition if no extra variables are introduced for operations on several atomic propositions the running time and length of the resulting cnf can increase exponentially with the number of atomic propositions in the original formula in the worse case .

given its np hardness it is neither practical nor necessarytofindtheentiretrueparetofront .instead obtaininga set of solutions that evenly distributed over the true pareto front is representative pragmatic and computationally referrable.
the normal constraint nc method is an effective method intheliteraturethatguaranteesgeneratingevenlydistributedsolutionsovertheentireparetofront.themainideaofncmethodis tousethe utopiaplane toapproximatethetrueparetofrontsuch that a set of evenly distributed reference points on utopia plane wouldresulttoasetofevenlydistributedsolutionsonparetofront after theprojection alongthe normalvector of utopia plane.
here utopia plane refers to the hyper plane determined by all the anchor points each of which individually optimizes a single objective e.g.
y 1fory1 axisand y 2fory2 axisinfig3.a .however theoriginal nc method was developed on continuous solution space.
in the case of ip it can generate dominated solutions see fig .a where point a is a solution generated by nc but there exists a point b outsidetheshadedfeasibleregion dominatinga.so weproposeto combine the idea of utopia plane and the constraint method such that all solutions are guaranteed to be non dominated see fig .c .
our proposed method consists of four main steps determine theutopiaplane generateuniformlydistributedreferencepoints on the utopia plane for each reference point use its k coordinates to constrain the k objectives optimize the k th objectivewithinthereducedsolutionspace.repeatsteps2 to4 to achieve the representative pareto front.

comparing cwmoip with ibed in table we see ibed cannotfindallnon dominatedsolutionswith30executionsin most cases exceptjcs2that has only non dominated solutions .
in most cases ibed s results are unsatisfactory covering averagelyabout70 ofthetrueparetofronton4attributesetsof jcs andabout20 ofthetrueparetofronton webportal.also we find na nb a which proves the completeness of a .

in contrast one medium execution of ibed i.e.
the one with the medium size of a in executions on jcs takes about .5s to find correct solutions.
actually on jcs executions just brings several more solutions than executions as the search space is small and eas can converge fast.
similarly one medium execution of ibed on web portal takes about .4s to find 35correctsolutions while30executionsjustproduce232correct solutions as many executions also share solutions.

intable5and solreptakeslesstimethanexecutingibed30times butfind more non dominated solutions in most cases.
we study how the number of rps affects the execution time.

as executions of eas may share common solutions we comparesolrepusing50rpswiththemediumexecutionofibed in terms of time and solution number.
on linux x86 solrep using rps finds non dominated solutions in 2150s.
it is better than themediumexecutionofibedwith3seeds among30executions which takes 2534s to find correct solutions only are nondominated .

hence on lvat systems solrep using rps finds more non dominated solutions than the mediumexecution of ibed using similar or less time.

of attributes for each model.
due to the page limit we just report or representative attribute sets in the evaluation.
according to and our observation impact of attribute values is minor to the results if on two sets of attributes a method is better then in general likeontensets thismethodisbetter.thesecondthreat is about the systems chosen.
in future the ec2feature model and thedrupalmodel needto beevaluated.
the lastthreat is about the parameters of the eas used as baseline tools.
the best parameter setting of ibed and also ibea reported by is used.
moip or ibea with constraint solving or others?
in this study we discuss the general theme whether methods other than moeas could be applied to this sbse problem.
as illustra ted in we show that solrep the ip method has been proven tobecapableforthisoptimalfeatureselectionproblem.onlarge systems solrep takes similar time and finds significantly more non dominated solutions than ibea or ibed alone.
the next step is to conduct the detailed comparison on solrepandtheibeawithconstraintsolving i.e.
satibea and smtibea .
however as ip methods and ibea with constraint solvingaredesignedfordifferentpurposes weneedtobecarefulin selecting the evaluation metrics ip methods are designed for finding more non dominated solutions that are as evenly distributed as possible while ibeawith constraint solving is designed touse sat orsmt basedrepairingoperatortofindmorevalidsolutions.
valid solutions are not necessary in most case they are not to be global optimal i.e.
non dominated by any other solutions insolution space .
now we are working on finding proper metrics and setting up the benchmark to compare them fairly.
actually apartfrommoea basedandip basedapproaches other attempts have been made to resolve the moo problems in the sbse.inrecenttwoyears therearethreepioneerstudiesonthis directions.

it will be interestingtoconductathroughoutempiricalstudyoninvestigating eachapproach smeritsanddrawbacksinsolvingthesbseproblem.
thetheoreticlimitationofsolrep.
asexplainedin moeabasedapproaches asaheuristicandnon deterministicalgorithm face the four drawbacks on algorithm convergence solution set completeness theglobaloptimalityofsolutions andthesolution set diversity or evenly distributiveness .
in contrast solrep as a analytic and mostly deterministic algorithm in theory does nothave the problem of algorithm convergence and the global opti mality of solutions.
for solution set completeness solrep is not designed for solution set completeness constraint and cwmoip are designed for this goal on small systems .
currently the solu tion set diversity of solrep is guaranteed by random sampling and random walkmechanisms.
thetime complexityof solrep is o n see algorithm fig.
and .
.
as long as the time for one time ip solving in cplex has a constant upper limit.
hence solrep is a mostly deterministic algorithm as it resorts to random sampling.thetheoreticlimitof solrepisthatitmayfailifmostnon dominated solutions are gathered in a small zone and h r method cannot hit that zone.
however we did not find this case in our evaluated systems.generalityof solrep.

as reported ibea yields the best results among the seven tested eas in terms of time correctness and satisfaction to user preferences.in theyfurtherusedstaticmethodtoprunefeaturesbefore execution of ibea for reducing search space.
they also introduced a seeding method by pre computing a correct solution which was later implanted the initial population of ibea.
