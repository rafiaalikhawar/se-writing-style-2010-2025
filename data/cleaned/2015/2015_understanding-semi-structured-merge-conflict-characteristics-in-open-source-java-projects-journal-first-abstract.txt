however despite the existing evidence in the literature the structure of changes that lead to conflicts has not been studied yet.understandingtheunderlyingstructureofconflicts andtheinvolved syntactic language elements might shed light on howto better avoid them.
for example awareness tools that informusers about ongoing parallel changes such as syde and palant rcan benefit from knowing the most common conflict patterns tobecome more efficient.
with that aim in this paper we focus on understanding the underlying structure of mergeconflicts.

to this end in this paper we derivea catalog of conflict patterns expressed in terms of the structure of code changes that lead to merge conflicts.

finally we discuss how our results reveal the need for new research studies and suggest potential improvements to tools supporting collaborative software development.
