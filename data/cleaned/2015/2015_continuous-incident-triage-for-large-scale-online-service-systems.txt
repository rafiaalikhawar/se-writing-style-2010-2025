incidents of these systems could cause significant economic loss and customer dissatisfaction.
incident triage which is the process of assigning a new incident to the responsible team is vitally important for quick recovery of theaffected service.
our industry experience shows that in practice incident triage is not conducted only once in the beginning but is a continuous process in which engineers from different teams have to discuss intensively among themselves about an incident and continuously refine the incident triage result until the correctassignment is reached.
in particular our empirical study on real online service systems shows that the percentage of incidents that were reassigned ranges from .
to .
and the number of discussion items before achieving the correct assignment is up to .
on average.
to improve the existing incident triage process in this paper we propose deepct a deep learning based approach to automated continuous incident triage.
deepctincorporates a novel gru based gated recurrent unit model with an attention based mask strategy and a revised loss function which can incrementally learn knowledge from discussions and update incident triage results.
using deepct the correct incident assignment can be achieved with fewer discussions.
we conductedan extensive evaluation of deepct on large scale online service systems in microsoft.
the results show that deepct is able to achieve more accurate and efficient incident triage e.g.
the average accuracy identifying the responsible team precisely is .
.
with the number of discussion items increasing from to .
also deepct statistically significantly outperforms the state of the art bug triage approach.
index t erms incident triage online service systems deep learning i. i ntroduction online service systems have become increasingly popular in recent years .
for example microsoft office has about millions of monthly active users in october .

thiswork was mainly done when junjie chen was visiting microsoft research.qingwei lin is the corresponding author.
business users .quality of online service systems these systems still encounter many incidents i.e.
unplanned interruptions and outages ofthe service which cause huge economic loss or dramatically decrease user satisfaction.
for example a study conducted on data center organizations in the u.s. shows that the average cost of service downtime has steadily increased from in to in .
also the one hour downtime foramazon.com on prime day last year its biggest sale event of the year leads to the loss of up to million3.
once an incident occurs to an online service system it should be mitigated as soon as possible in order to minimize the service downtime and ensure high availability of the provided service.
one important step of incident handling isincident triage which is the assignment of a new incident to the responsible team.
incident triage is critical if an incident is assigned to a wrong team the mitigation of the incidentcould be delayed and more loss could be incurred.
however accurate and efficient incident triage is very challenging for large scale online service systems.
one majorreason is that unlike traditional software bugs a large portion of incidents are automatically reported by monitors rather than people.
for example the existing study demon strated that more than incidents are automatically reported by monitors for online service systems in microsoft .
these automatically reported incidents are created based oncertain simple templates and do not contain detailed textual descriptions about the incidents.
that is an incident reportusually provides limited textual information for engineers tounderstand the incident and thus it is difficult for them to accurately and efficiently assign the incident to the responsibleteam.
our industry experience shows that in practice engineers have to discuss intensively among themselves about an incident and continuously refine the incident triage result during discussions until the correct assignment is reached.
during this t it millions in lost sales .

process more engineers from different teams could join the discussions and more information could be provided leadingto gradually approach the correct triage.
that is incident triagein practice is not conducted only once in the beginning but isa continuous process.
to better understand the incident triagepractice we conducted an empirical study on real onlineservice systems in microsoft section ii .
the results showthat the percentage of incidents that were reassigned assignedat least twice ranges from .
to .
for the onlineservice systems.
for these incidents the number of discussionitems before achieving the correct assignment is up to .32on average.
that is in practice many incidents are indeedincorrectly assigned in the beginning and engineers have tospend significant efforts on discussions to refine incidenttriage.
in this paper we call this scenario continuous incident triage .
to address the problem of continuous incident triage in this paper we propose the first automated approach called deepct deep learning based continuous incident triage .
deepct incorporates a novel gru based gated recurrent unit model with an attention based mask strategy and a revised loss function which can incrementally learn knowledge fromdiscussions and update incident triage results.
since discussions are conducted by engineers manually like conversations it tends to introduce noise during actual discussions.
theattention based mask strategy can help reduce the impact of noise by automatically assigning them quite small weights.
furthermore we propose a domain specific text encoding method to conduct semantic understanding for textual information by considering the text characteristics of online servicesystems.
using deepct the correct incident assignment can be achieved with as few rounds of discussions as possible.
to evaluate the effectiveness of deepct we conducted an extensive study on industrial large scale online service systems in microsoft.
these studied systems have millions or even hundreds of millions of users around the world.
the experimental results demonstrate that deepct is able to achieve more accurate and efficient incident triage in the real world scenario of continuous incident triage.
more specifically deepct achieves the average accuracy identifying the responsible team precisely of .
.
when the number of discussion items increases from to .
also deepct statis tically significantly outperforms the state of the art bug triageapproach which has been demonstrated to be the most effective approach in the incident triage context before .
furthermore the results also show that each component i.e.
the attention based mask strategy and the revised loss function indeed contributes to deepct.
to sum up our work has the following major contributions we are the first to identify continuous incident triage a common scenario of incident triage for large scale online service systems in practice.
we have conducted an empirical study to investigate this scenario.
we propose deepct the first automated approach tosolving the problem of continuous incident triage based on deep learning.
we conduct an extensive study based on industriallarge scale online service systems in microsoft.
the re sults demonstrate the effectiveness of deepct.
this paper is organized as follows section ii presents an empirical study that motivates our work section iii describesthe details of deepct section iv reports the experiments and corresponding results section v discusses the lessons learned from our industry experience the generality of deepct andthreats to validity section vi presents the related work section vii concludes the paper.
ii.
a nempirical study on incident triage since it is the first time to systematically investigate continuous incident triage for large scale online service systems we conducted an empirical study on this scenario based on industrial large scale online service systems in microsoft.
in particular we collected six months of incident data forthe studied systems.
please note that we collected only the incidents that have been resolved in the study.
due to the company policy we have to hide some details of theseincidents and report relatively rough data instead.
in this study we focus on the following two aspects circlecopyrtthe accuracy of incident triage in the beginning circlecopyrtthe engineers efforts on refining incident triage .
a. accuracy of incident triage in the beginning incident triage in the beginning tends to be manually conducted by on call engineers oces who have rich experience and domain knowledge.
they manually assign incidents to the responsible team based on the information providedby incident reports.
therefore it is interesting to investigate how such manual incident triage performs in practice i.e.
the accuracy of incident triage in the beginning.

mistakes during incident triage in the beginning.
one major reason is that the incident reports often provide them verylimited information.
b. engineers efforts on refining incident triage when oces make a mistake for incident triage in the beginning engineers from various product teams conduct intensive discussions about the incident to revise the assignment of the incident.
in this study we also analyzed the engineers efforts on refining incident triage.
here we used two complementarymetrics to measure engineers efforts namely the number of discussion items and the time spent on discussions forachieving correct triage.
we first investigated the number of discussion items before achieving correct triage for the incidents that are incorrectlyassigned in the beginning.
the goal is to understand howintensively the discussions are conducted among engineers inorder to achieve correct triage.
here we regard the discussionitems occurred before the final triage i.e.
correct triage ismade as the triage stage discussion items.

the second row in table i presents the average number of triage stage discussion items for each online service system.
we find that engineers usually need to conduct .
.
discussion items before achieving correct triage.
the averagenumber of triage stage discussion items for the systems is .
.
that is the discussions among engineers for refining incident triage are indeed intensive indicating that engineersspend non trivial efforts on refining incident triage for largescale online service systems.
besides discussions for refining incident triage engineers also conduct follow up discussions to determine how to mitigate incidents.
therefore it is also interesting to learn whatpercentage of triage stage discussion items in all discussion items about the incidents.
the last row in table i presents the percentage for each online service system.
we find that around38.
.
discussion items are conducted for incident triage.
the average percentage of them is .
.
that is more than half of discussion items are conducted to refine incident triage indicating that the efforts on refining incident triage are no less than those on follow up incident mitigation.
we then investigated the percentage of the time spent on triage stage discussions among the time spent on overall discussions about the incidents i.e.
the time from incident creation to incident mitigation call ttm .
here each discussion item is created along with a timestamp and each activity such as incident triage mitigation and resolution is also recorded along with a timestamp in the incident management system.
we calculated the above two types of time based onthese timestamps.
this calculation method may be a threat .

nevertheless thepercentage is still able to complement the analysis on thenumber of discussion items to some degree.
figure shows the percentage of discussion time for incident triage within the overall ttm.
in this figure the number above each bar represents the percentage for each studied system.
from this figure the percentage of discussion timeon incident triage ranges from .
to .
within the overall ttm.
their average percentage is .
.
that is the discussion time spent on incident triage is indeed non trivialcompared with that spent on the whole incident mitigation process from incident creation to incident mitigation .
this result further supports the conclusion made based on the number of discussion items for incident triage.
c. summary based on the empirical study we obtain the following two main findings many incidents are actually incorrectly assigned in thebeginning due to the limited information provided by theincident reports.
engineers indeed have to spend significant amount of efforts on discussions about incident triage.
these findings support the scenario of incident triage for large scale online service systems i.e.
continuous incidenttriage.
therefore it is necessary to propose an effectiveincident triage approach which can continuously refine incident assignments based on incrementally provided discussions.
iii.
a pproach a. overview in this work we target at the problem of continuous incident triage.
as described in previous sections in practice discussions are incrementally created by engineers.
however existing bug triage approaches for traditional software systems either ignore discussions or simply treat all discussions asa whole without considering their characteristics i.e.
incremental creation.
therefore these existing approaches cannot work well in this real world scenario.

overview of deepct continuous incident triage one major challenge is how to learn knowledge from incremental discussions to fit the scenario of continuous incident triage.
moreover since discussions are conducted by engineers manually like conversations it tends to introduce noise during actual discussions.
therefore how to reduce the impact of noise on incident triage is anotherchallenge.
to solve the problem of continuous incident triage we propose the first automated approach deepct a deep learning based approach that can incrementally learn knowledge fromincident reports.
the goal is to achieve correct incident triage results with as few discussions as possible.
more specifically to solve the first challenge we design a gru based model with a revised loss function in deepct to effectively utilize incremental discussions by considering their temporal relations so that correct incident triage results can be achieved as earlyas possible.
to solve the second challenge we propose an attention based mask strategy in the model to bypass noise.
in this way different weights can be automatically assigned todifferent discussion information where noise can be maskedby assigning them quite small weights.
furthermore sincedeepct is mainly based on textual information such as textual discussions we propose a domain specific text encoding method to process textual information by considering the textcharacteristics of online service systems.
the overview of deepct is shown in figure .
in the following we first introduce the input data used in deepct in section iii b. then we introduce our domain specific text encoding method in section iii c. next we introduce our designed gru based model including our attention based mask strategy in section iii d. finally we introduce the usage of deepct in section iii e. b. input data we consider three types of input data in deepct for continuous incident triage.
the first type of input data usedin deepct is the title and summary of an incident report which is widely used in traditional bug triage.
the title and summary of an incident report are the textual description aboutthe symptom when an incident is reported.
engineers usuallyconduct incident triage manually in the beginning based onthis type of information.
the second type of input data used in deepct is the incremental discussions about an incident .
the discussions are textual information which are manually written by engineersincrementally like conversations.
as presented in section ii engineers tend to spend significant efforts on discussions forrefining incident triage in practice.
that is this type of input data is the core information for continuous incident triage.
in particular different from existing bug triage approaches i.e.
ignoring discussions or simply treating all discussions as a whole deepct utilizes the type of input data incrementally to effectively fit the scenario of continuous incident triage.
the third type of input data used in deepct is the incidentoccurring environment information .
an incident tends to be reported with the incident occurring environment information including the monitor id reporting the incident the incidentoccurring device and the incident type how to report theincident such as monitor reporting or human reporting .
engineers also utilize this type of information to facilitate incidentmanagement.
c. domain specific text encoding since the first and second types of information are textual descriptions deepct encodes them into vectors to conduct semantic understanding.
however there are many specialterms about online service systems in textual descriptions such as api names and component names which are helpful to conduct incident triage but cannot be well handled bytraditional text encoding methods due to the small occurrence frequency of each special term.
more specifically traditional text encoding methods either ignore these special terms ortreat them as unknown word uniformly .
therefore we propose a domain specific text encoding method in deepct by considering the text characteristics of online service systems.
the domain specific text encoding method first uses the fasttext algorithm to build pre trained subword vectors based on external corpus and then conducts fine tuning based on historical incident data to incorporate the domain knowledge of online service systems.
finally based on thepre trained subword vectors the representation of each special term can be learned by integrating the representations of the subwords of the special term.
in this way the title summaryor each discussion item is transformed into a matrix in which the number of rows is equal to the number of words in the corresponding textual description.
next the method encodes a matrix into a vector using a cnn based neural language model which has been demon strated to be able to encode more complex patterns and focus on word level knowledge to produce better performance .
more specifically it first uses an average pooling layer and a convolution layer to merge adjacent words i.e.
rows in the matrix and then produces feature maps from the authorized licensed use limited to lahore univ of management sciences.

cnn based text encoder matrix which is called low level feature maps in this paper.
to capture the correlations among words with farther distances itfurther uses a convolution layer to produce high level feature maps based on these low level ones.
since both low level feature maps and high level feature maps can provide useful information it then uses two global max pooling layers to produce feature vectors for low level feature maps and highlevel feature maps respectively in order to extract the mostimportant words.
finally based on these produced vectors it uses a fully connected layer to generate a vector for the textualdescription.
in this way the title summary or each discussionitem of an incident is encoded into a vector.
we denote thevector of the title summary as t t t2 ... t r and the vector of the ithdiscussion item as di di1 di2 ... d ir whereris the dimension of the fully connected layer.
figure shows the cnn based text encoder in deepct.
in addition since the values of each input datum in the third type is a finite set of discrete values we conduct feature embedding for it.
here we adopt the representation learning to embed each input datum value into a vector in deepct which is able to embed a value to a fixed dimension vector and gradually updates the vector during the training process.
in this way each input datum in the third type is embedded into a fixed dimension vector.
we denote the kthfeature vector asek ek1 ek2 ... e ks wheresrefers to the pre defined fixed dimension in representation learning for the third type of input data.
here we concatenate all the feature vectors forthe third type into a vector e e e2 ... ez where zis the total number of feature vectors for the third type of input data and is the concatenation operator.
d. designed gru based model to conduct continuous incident triage we design a grubased model which is able to enhance the learning for the knowledge from earlier discussions so that correct assignmentscan be achieved with fewer discussions.
since there exist temporal relations among discussion items our designed model is built on the gru gated recurrent unit network which is presented in section iii d1.
we also propose an attentionbased mask strategy in our designed model to reduce theimpact of noise which is presented in section iii d2.
to helpachieve the goal of correct incident triage results with as few discussions as possible we further propose a continuous lossfunction in our model which is presented in section iii d3.
gru network gru is one of the most widely used network to solve the problem involving temporal relations .
in our context discussions are incrementally created by engineersin chronological order and thus we adopt the gru network tobuild our model.
more specifically gru has two gates updategate and reset gate.
the former is to determine how much pastinformation from previous discussion items to pass along tothe future while the latter is to determine how much pastinformation to forget.
for an incident the input of gru at the t thtime step is the vector of the tthdiscussion item denoted as dt where t nandnrefers to the total number of discussion items.
givendtand the hidden state from the t thtime step denoted as ht gru calculates the update gate and reset gate by formula where rtandztare the update gate and reset gate at the tthtime step respectively.
here the hidden stateht 1contains the retained information from previous t 1discussion items at the t thtime step.
please note thath0is a zero vector since there is no discussion at the 0th time step.
rt wr zt wz after acquiring them gru uses the reset gate to forget some past information and then combine the retained past information with new information which is calculated by formula .
then gru uses the update gate to decide what to collect from the combined information and what to collectfrom past information at the current time step which is calculated by formula .
that is the output of gru at the t th time step is the hidden state ht which contains the retained information from previous tdiscussion items at the tthtime step.
please note that wr wz andw hare parameters that are learned during the training process.
ht tanh w h ht zt ht zt ht attention based mask strategy at thetthtime step receiving the tthdiscussion item thidden states are produced from the gru network i.e.
h1 ... h t. since noise may be introduced during discussions we incorporate an attention mechanism to automatically learn the weights of h1 ... h t. in particular the title summary of an incident report describesthe incident with relative high relevance.
therefore if thecorrelation between the title summary and the discussioninformation h i i t is larger the weight of hishould be larger indicating that hicontains less noise.
in this way noise can be masked by assigning them quite small weights.

more specifically tiis calculated by the softmax function which is shown in formula .
in this formula f t h i v latticetopmlp t hi is the concatenation operator and vis a parameter learned in mlp .
please note that the weights are recalculated at a new time step.
that is the same hiddenstate has different weights at different time steps.

tande to predict the incident triage result.
more specifically deepct uses mlp with a softmaxlayer for classification where the input of mlp is a ...a l tande.
the output is the predicted probability that each team is the responsible one.
since our goal is to achieve the correctincident triage result as much as possible at each time step we propose a continuous loss function.
instead of calculating the loss i.e.
cross entropy at the last time step this functioncalculates the sum of the loss at each time step from the stto lthtime steps .
in this way the cumulative prediction results at each time step can be optimized when calculating gradient during back propagation.
more specifically the continuous loss function is shown in formula .
loss t n summationdisplay k l summationdisplay j parenleftbigg m summationdisplay i 1cilog c k i parenrightbigg where ciis the predicted probability that the ithteam is the responsible one at the jthtime step mis the total number of teams and nis the total number of incidents.
e. usage of deepct we first use deepct to build a classification model based on historical incident data and then use the model to predict the responsible team for each new incident.
more specifically for each new incident deepct first constructs tande and takes them as input of the model to predict the responsible team which is the incident triage in the beginning.
then when anew triage stage discussion item the i thdiscussion item is created deepct constructs diand incrementally passes it to the model to predict the responsible team.
that is deepct conducts incident triage continuously when the discussions aregoing on.
in particular the model at each triage can predict the probability to be responsible for each team and its output is the team with the largest probability.iv .
e v alua tion in the study we address the following research questions rq1 how does deepct perform in continuous incident triage for large scale online service systems?
rq2 does each main component contribute to deepct?
rq3 what is the time efficiency of deepct?
a. study data in the study we applied deepct to industrial online service systems in microsoft to sufficiently evaluate the effectiveness of deepct.
these systems are large and complexonline service systems which have been widely used by millions of users around the world.
all the systems are in different application areas and developed by different product groups indicating the diversity of these systems.
we collected six months of incident data for each studied system and thetotal size of the incident reports is over 90gb.
the total number of teams is about 2k.
therefore it is challenging toassign an incident to the correct team.
please note that in our experiments we only consider the incidents that have been resolved since the correct assignments of these incidents have been achieved and thus they can help evaluate the effectivenessof incident triage.
in particular we used the incident data from the former four months as training data and used the incident data from the latter two months as testing data to evaluate deepct.
b. compared approaches baselines according to the existing study which investigated how existing bug triage approaches for traditional software perform in the incident triage context for online service systems the deep learning based bug triage approach performs the best in the context outperforming the machinelearning based and information retrieval based bug triage approaches .
therefore in this study we used this approach as therepresentative for comparison.
more specifically this approach first converts each word in the textual description of an incident report to a vector representation using word2v ec and then adopts convolutional neural network cnn to train a classifier for recommending responsible teams of new incidents.
based on the way of dealing with discussions during training this approach can have two forms.
the first one ignores discussions and only considers title summary asthe textual description in each incident report during training.
we call it dl noin this paper.
the second one treats all discussions as a whole and considers them and title summary as the textual description during training.
we call it dl allin this paper.
in summary there are two baselines in the study i.e.
dl noand dl all.
in particular we also adapted them to refine incident triage i.e.
conduct a new triage when a newdiscussion item is created.
v ariants of deepct in rq2 we aim to investigate the contributions of two main components in deepct i.e.
the attention based mask strategy and the continuous loss function.to investigate the contribution of the first component we constructed a variant of deepct by removing the attention based authorized licensed use limited to lahore univ of management sciences.

mask strategy from deepct which is called deepctmask no .
that is after acquiring h1 ... h t deepctmask no directly takes them and tandeas input of mlp for classification.
to investigate the contribution of the second component we constructed another variant of deepct by replacing thecontinuous loss function with directly calculating the loss atthe last time step.
this variant is called deepct loss ori.
c. implementation our approach deepct and the compared approaches are implemented based on apache mxnet4 a scalable deep learning framework.
for the hyperparameters in these approaches we tuned them through grid search following the existing work .
more specifically for the hyperparameters in cnn we set them as follows the word embedding size is thepool size and stride of the average pooling layer are and respectively the kernel size and number of the convolution layer producing low level feature maps are and respectively the kernel size and number of the convolution layerproducing high level feature maps are and respectively and the hidden size of the fully connected layer is .
forthe hyperparameters in the gru based model we set them asfollows the hidden size of gru is the hidden size of two fully connected layers in the attention network is and respectively.
during training we used the adam optimizerwith the learning rate of .
and the number of epochs is .
we set the same hyperparameters for all the systems.
also we find that the final results are insensitive to hyperparameters within a small range.
our study is conducted on ubuntu .
with core intel xeon e5 v3 cpu .60ghz gbmemory bit operating system and a single nvidia tesla k80 gpu accelerator.
d. evaluation metrics following the existing work we adopted the widely used metric i.e.
accuracy to measure the effectiveness of incident triage approaches.
this metric means that theresponsible team is identified as the one with the largest probability predicted by an incident triage approach among all the teams.
since the incident triage result is refined when a new discussion item is created by engineers in the scenario of continuous incident triage we measured accuracy when eachnew discussion item is created.
in particular in this scenario we hope to achieve correct triage with as few discussions as possible and thus we measured accuracy when each of thefirst discussion items is created.
we also measured the efficiency of each approach.
for each approach we recorded the time spent on the training stage which is to build a classification model for incident triage and the average time spent on the recommending stage which is to recommend the responsible team for a new incident.
forthe ease of presentation we call the former training time and the latter recommendation time .

overall effectiveness of deepct figure shows the effectiveness of deepct in continuous incident triage compared with dl noand dl all.
each graph in figure presents the comparison results for each studied online service system.from figure for out of studied online service systems the red line representing the effectiveness of deepct is always higher than the blue line representing the effectivenessof dl no and the green line representing the effectiveness of dlall when the number of discussion items increases from to .
the results demonstrate that deepct performs better than dlnoand dl allfor continuous incident triage in most cases.
that deepct outperforming dl noindicates that discussions indeed provide important information for incident triage.
thatdeepct outperforming dl allindicates that considering the characteristics of discussions i.e.
incremental creation duringlearning is important for incident triage.
more specifically compared with dl all deepct enhances the learning for the knowledge from earlier discussions so that the correct assignments can be achieved as early as possible.
from theresults deepct indeed is able to achieve correct incidenttriage results with fewer discussions.
there are three systems at the row column row2 column and row column in figure in whichdeepct sometimes performs worse than dl no dl all but the differences in accuracy are very small.
more specifically for the three systems the largest difference in accuracy between dlalland deepct is only .
while the largest difference in accuracy between dl noand deepct is only .
.
furthermore we find that the cases dl noperforming better than deepct occur when the number of discussion items is small e.g.
for the system at the row column while the cases that dl allperforming better than deepct occur when the number of discussion items is large e.g.
for the system at the row column .
the reason is that when the number of discussion items is small the title summary has a larger impact on prediction and thus dl no which ignores discussions during learning may be more suitable at this timethan later when the number of discussion items becomeslarger the impact of discussions also increases and thus dl all which treats all discussions as a whole during learning maybe more suitable at this time than before.

effectiveness comparison among deepct dl no and dl allfor each studied online service system the x axis represents the number of discussion items and the y axis presents the accuracy of incident triage we further conducted statistical analysis for the effectiveness of deepct on all the studied online service systems whose results are shown in table ii.
in this table rows present the average accuracy on all the studied systems fordeepct dl no and dl all respectively.
rows present the improved rate of accuracy for deepct compared with dlnoand dl all respectively.
from these rows the average accuracy that the responsible team is identified as the one with the largest probability predicted by deepct is .
.
with the number of discussion items increasing from to5 demonstrating the effectiveness of deepct.
the average accuracy of deepct is always larger than that of dl noand dlallno matter how many discussion items there are.
in particular in terms of average accuracy deepct improves dlnoby .
.
and deepct improves dl allby .
.
.
moreover we find that with the number of discussion items increasing the improved rate compared with dl noincreases while the improved rate compared with dlalldecreases.
this is as expected due to the characteristics of dl noand dl all.
as discussed above dl noignores discussions and thus it performs better when the number of discussion items is smaller while dl alltreats all discussions as a whole and thus it performs better when the number ofdiscussion items is larger.
here we do not compare them when there is no discussion since at that time deepct performs close to dl no.
also with the discussions going on till the end the effectiveness of deepct becomes closer to that ofdl all.
that highlights that the main contribution of deepct is to achieve correct incident triage results as early as possible i.e.
with fewer discussions .to investigate whether deepct significantly outperforms dlnoand dl all we conducted wilcoxon signed rank test at the significant level of .
between them whose results are shown in the last two rows in table ii.
here the bold values mean that deepct statistically significantly outperforms dlno dl all.
the results demonstrate that deepct indeed statistically significantly outperforms dl noand dl allin all the cases.
in summary deepct is able to effectively relieve the problem of continuous incident triage for large scale online service systems by achieving the average accuracy of .
.
with the number of discussion items increasing from to .moreover deepct performs better than the two compared approaches i.e.
dl noand dl all for most of the studied systems and the former significantly outperforms the lattertwo in statistics.

components are useful and indeed contribute to deepct.
furthermore from figure when the number of discussion items is small i.e.
and deepctmask no performs better than deepctloss ori in median accuracy while when the number of discussion items is large i.e.
deepctloss ori performs better than deepctmask no .
that is the continuous loss function makes more contributions to deepct when the number of discussion items is small while the attention based mask strat egy makes more contributions to deepct when the number of discussion items is large.
the reason is that the continuous loss function aims to optimize the prediction result at each timestep so that the correct assignment can be achieved as early as possible and thus its impact is larger when the number of discussion items is smaller.
with the discussions going on itseffect would be gradually closer to that of directly calculating the loss at the last time step.
efficiency comparison we further investigated the time efficiency of deepct whose results are shown in table iii.in this table the second row presents the average training time on all the studied systems and the last row presents theaverage recommending time for each new incident on all thestudied systems.
for all the three approaches their averagerecommending time is very small in milliseconds .
that is it is very efficient for deepct to conduct each triage for an incident.
besides the average training time for the three approaches is also similar in minutes and that of deepct isslightly larger than that of the other two.
however since thetraining process is offline the time cost of them is actuallyacceptable.
overall deepct has acceptable offline trainingtime and negligible online recommending time indicating that deepct is a practical approach.v.
l essons and discussion a. lessons learned we summarize some of the lessons learned from our industrial experience.
for microsoft s online service systemswe worked on they are all of very large scale.
they containmany sub systems each of which consists of many intercon nected components.
each component has its own monitorsthat regularly check the runtime status of the component.
signals from the components reflect different aspects of system health status such as computing resource traffic volume response latency etc.
many fault tolerant techniques such asthe failover mechanism are designed to ensure reliability and resiliency of the systems.
therefore an incident to an individual component may not affect the overall system andan incident to the overall system may be reflected by many components.
although on call engineers oces have rich experience and domain knowledge they cannot fully under stand the entire system and are often confused by the actual causes of an incident resulting in incorrect initial assignments.
similarly product teams that are responsible for maintaining individual components may not understand the details about other components and the entire system which causes manyreassignments of incidents and prolonged discussions and mttr the mean time from incident creation to incident resolution .
the online service systems we studied operate on basis and receive a large number of incident reports.
our experience shows that many of these incident reports reported by different channels or monitors have the same root cause and are actually duplicated or linked.
the ability to identifythe duplicate linked incident reports could significantly reduce the amount of discussion time.
this would be investigated on our future work.
b. generality of deepct we discussed the generality of deepct from three aspects.
first all the online service systems used in our study are indifferent application areas and developed by different product groups.
that is the diversity of these studied systems is large.
second the whole framework of deepct is applicable to online service systems from other companies since the input data used in deepct are general and common.
that is deepct is easy to apply as long as there exist historicalincident data for a system.
in the future we will further explorethe possibility of cross company prediction.
third it is also interesting to investigate whether deepct can be generalized to traditional software systems besides online service systems.
here we used the open source traditionalsoftware system eclipse as the studied subject which has been widely used in traditional bug triage studies .
we used the widely used public eclipse dataset including 47k bug reports and developers.
we first investigated the average number of discussion items before achievingcorrect assignments and find that of eclipse is .

indicates discussions are also conducted for refining bug triage results in the traditional software system but their discussionsare conducted less intensively than those for online servicesystems due to the large scale and complexity of the latter.in particular deepct achieves the accuracy i.e.
the correctdeveloper is identified as the one with the largest predictedprobability among all the developers of .

.

the results demonstrate that deepct also performs better than the state of the art bug triage approaches i.e.
dl noand dl all for the open source traditional software in the practical scenario of continuous triage indicating the generality of deepct to some degree.
c. threats to v alidity the internal threat to validity mainly lies in the implementations of our approach deepct and compared approaches.
to reduce this threat two authors have carefully checked the code.
in particular we implemented them based on a maturedframework which has been presented in section iv c. the external threat to validity mainly lies in the subjects.
in our study we used large scale online service systems in microsoft.
all these used data are real in industry.
even so the used subjects may not represent the online service systemsin other companies.
we discussed the generality of deepct in section v b. in the future we will apply deepct to more online service systems from different companies.
the construct threat to validity mainly lies in the used hyperparameters and metrics.
to reduce the threat from hyperparameters we tuned the hyperparameters in deepct and the compared approaches through grid search following theexisting work whose specific settings have been presented in section iv c. to reduce the threat from metrics we usedthe most widely used accuracy and time cost as the metrics inour study.
in the future we will use more metrics e.g.
false positive rate and re training frequency to more sufficientlyevaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of deepct.
vi.
r ela ted work a. incident management our work aims to solve the problem of continuous incident triage in practice.
currently there is no existing approach thatis proposed to solve the same problem.
the most related work to ours is the empirical study on incident triage conducted by chen et al.
which investigated whether bug triage approaches for traditional software systems can effectively handle incident triage for online service systems.
their results demonstrated that traditional bug triage approaches cannotperform well for incidents especially the incidents that aremanually assigned incorrectly in the beginning.
different fromtheir work this work proposes the first approach to solving the problem of continuous incident triage for large scale online service systems.
besides incident triage there are also some work on incident management.
most of research on incident managementfocuses on the identification of incident beacons which are formed based on a combination of system metricswith unusual values produced by the incidents.
for example cohen et al.
proposed a tree augmented network tan approach to deducing a tan model and then used the modelto predict system slo service level objective states basedon some system metrics.
here their approach regards the sys tem metrics used by the tan model as service issue beacons.later cohen et al.
extended the work by proposing a signature approach.
besides some work aims to associatea new incident with a previously known incident .
for example duan and babu proposed an active learning based approach to improving the overall accuracy based onboth labeled and unlabeled data.
it maximizes the benefits gained from newly diagnosed unknown instances to facilitate manual labeling efforts.
furthermore lou et al.
conducted an experience report on applying software analytics to incident management of online service systems including incident diagnosis and mitigation.
different from the above work our work targets at incident triage and proposes deepct to improve incident triage in a real world scenario.
b. bug triage in the literature there are a lot of research on bug triage for traditional software .
there are two main categories of bug triage approaches i.e.
learning based bug triage and information retrieval based bug triage.
learning based bug triage regards the problem as a supervised classification problem and then uses machine learningor deep learning methods to solve it.
for example anvik et al.
proposed a machine learning based bug triage approach which first transforms the text i.e.
summary anddescription in bug reports to feature vectors and then uses support v ector machines svm to train a classifier for bug triage.
jonsson et al.
proposed to apply an ensemble learning method to integrate several machine learning algorithms for bug triage.
lee et al.
proposed a deep learning based bug triage approach which first converts each word ina bug report to a vector using word2v ec and then adopts convolutional neural network cnn to train a classifier for bug triage.
xuan et al.
proposed a machine learning based bug triage approach by using data reduction techniques which conducts the instance selection and feature selection forreducing training data before training a classifier.
many bug triage approaches are based on informationretrieval methods.
for example naguib et al.
proposed to retrieve the responsible developer based on developers expertise relevant to the topic of a bug report through latent dirichlet allocation lda .
xia et al.
proposed a specialized topic model based approach for bug triage which considers the product and component information of bugreports to construct the mapping between term space and topicspace.
hu et al.
proposed to utilize historical bug fix information for bug triage which models the relationship betweendevelopers and source code components and the relationship between source code components and the associated bugs.

different from them our work targets at incident triage for large scale online service systems rather than bug triage fortraditional software.
also our work targets at a real worldincident triage scenario i.e.
continuous triage which is dif ferent from the traditional bug triage scenario i.e.
conductingtriage only once in the beginning.
although our approach isalso based on deep learning our deep neural network modelis different from that used by the existing work .
vii.
c onclusion this paper reports our experience on incident triage for real world large scale online service systems.
through an empirical study on industrial online service systems weshow that in practice incident triage is a continuous process in which engineers from different teams have to discuss intensively among themselves about an incident and con tinuously refine the incident triage result until the correct assignment is achieved.
to reduce the service downtime and improve system availability we propose deepct a deep learning based approach to automated continuous incident triage.
deepct incorporates a novel gru based model with an attention based mask strategy and a revised loss function to address the problem of continuous incident triage.
our experimental results on large scale online service systemsin microsoft show that deepct achieves the average accuracy of .
.
when the number of discussion items increases from to and significantly outperforms the twocompared approaches i.e.
dl noand dl all in statistics.
that demonstrates the effectiveness of deepct.
in the future we will improve the proposed approach by identifying the duplicate linked incidents.
we will also explore the integration of deepct with service diagnosis and resolution systems to achieve more intelligent incidentmanagement.
