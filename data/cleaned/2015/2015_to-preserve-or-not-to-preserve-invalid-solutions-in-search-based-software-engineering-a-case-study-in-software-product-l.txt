algorithms moeas usually produce invalidsolutions that violate the constraints predefined since they do not embodyconstraintcheckingandtheirembeddedoperators e.g.
mutation may break the validity of solutions.
however many softwareengineeringproblemsarehighlyconstrained .invalid solutionsaresimply unbuildable andthus uselessinpractice.
hence a central research question is rq1 should we preserve invalid solutions during the search?
to answer the question we conduct a case study in software product lines spls .
recently the area of sbse for spls is gaining anupsurgeininterestandactivity .ansplisacollectionof related software products all of which share some core functionality yeteachofwhichdiffersinsomespecificfeatures .akey taskinsplengineeringistoderiveanoptimalsolution i.e.
software product by feature selection to meet specific requirements of stakeholders which we call the spl optimization problem.i ti s non trivial to address this problem because the high variability of different products expressed by feature combinatorics gives rise to a huge search space there are usually a set of predefined constraintsthatdeterminewhetherornotasolutioncanbefeasibly implemented and3 theproblemofteninvolvesmultiplecompeting objectives and generallyno single solution excels inall objectives.
many metaheuristics have been used to address the spl optimization problem .
sayyad et al.

they incorporated the sat solving into the mutation operatorofibeatoreplacesomerandomly mutatedsolutionswith validones.theirempiricalresultsonlargereal worldsplsshowed that satibea significantly outperforms the original ibea which established the current state of the art.
all of these previous moeas for the spl optimization problempermit invalidsolutions.
specifically invalid solutions either randomly generated or randomly mutated ones can be preserved both in the initial population and at each iteration of moeas.
this tendstobeacommonsenseinthecommunity andnobodyquestions it.
to the best of our knowledge there is no systematic study that debates the preservation of invalid solutions.
inthispaper byempiricalstudyonsevenreal worldspls we identifythreepotentiallimitationsofpreservinginvalidsolutions when using previous moeas for the spl optimization problem.
firstly previousmethodsproducevalidsolutionswithoutguarantee andintheworstcase theyfailtofindanyvalidsolutions which makes the costly search effort all in vain.
secondly the performance evaluation of different moeas depends mainly on a number of metrics e.g.

our aim is not only to make the community aware of the potential limitationsof preserving invalid solutions butalso to provide guidance on how to preserve valid solutions.
we use the state of the art satibea as a baseline and design five algorithm variants that incorporate sat solving into the initial population generation and the mutation operator of ibea in different ways.moreover one algorithm designed to preserve valid solutions all along the way further incorporates a subroutine that resolves nonboolean constraints over integer or real number variables together witharithmeticorrelationaloperators whichcannotbestraightforwardly addressed by the state of the art relying on sat solving.
we compare the performance of different algorithms by experimentsandthenprovideempiricalguidance.inparticular we answer the following research questions rq2 should we keep valid solutions in the initial population?
rq3 should we fix invalid solutions after mutation?
rq4 should we preserve valid solutions all along the way?
in summary we make the following contributions we conduct the first study on the preservation of invalid solutionsinsbseforspls.byempiricalstudy weidentify three potential limitations of preserving invalid solutions which were usually ignored in the past.

ratio of invalid solutions.
to motivate our study we first perform state of the art approaches on the five large spls andcalculatetheratioofinvalidsolutionsinthefinalpopulation produced by each algorithm for each spl.
in table the dataof column ibea were reported by sayyad et al.
while thecolumn satibea recordsourexperimentalresults pleaserefer tosection4.1forourexperimentalsetup .asdepictedintable2 ibea produces less invalid solutions for three smaller spls ecos freebsd and fiasco while satibea works better for two larger spls uclinux and linux .
however both approaches produce valid solutions without guarantee.
for the largest subject linux both approaches have a high probability above to produce invalid solutions in the worst case ibea fails to produce any valid solutions which makes the search effort all in vain.
this indicates the need for the methods that handle constraints more effectively.
.

realistic attribute constraints.
in practice the predefined constraints may exist not only among features but also among thequalityattributesoffeatures.inthepast moststudiesonthe spl optimization problem augment feature models with quality attributesinasimpleway eachfeaturehasthesamesetofquality attributes each attribute of a feature has a fixed value and the fitnessofasolutioniscalculatedbysimplyaggregatingthequality attributesofallselectedfeatures.forexample thesyntheticattribute values of the five large spls in table were generated in this way.
inthiscase evenifasolutionproducedisinvalid themoeastill works becausethefitnessofthesolutioncanbecalculatedanyway.
different from all other spl subjects as shown in figure amazonec2 illustrates a more realistic and more challenging case each feature has a different set of attributes each attribute of a feature does not have a fixed value and the fitness of a solution is derived from the selected features using a number of attribute con straints.
for example the calculation of the total cost of an ec2 instance inst conformstoasetofattributeconstraints apartof which is illustrated as follows blocksindicates block storage ec2.totalcost ec2.costmonth purchase .period ec2.upfrontcost ec2.costmonth inst.costhour inst.dedicatedfee purchase .si nedusa e blocks.costmonth blocks.costmonth blocks.extraspace blocks.costgb note that these attribute constraints are non boolean over integer or real number variables together with arithmetic or relationaloperators which cannot be straightforwardly addressed by the state of the art .
in such a case an invalid solution that violates either cross tree constraints or attribute constraints breakspreviousmoeas becausethefitnessofthesolution cannot be acquired by simple aggregation.
this indicates the need for a new adaption of moeas to meet the complex constraints and to calculate the fitness of solutions.

drupal has quality attributes of features and the values of these qualityattributes are realistic.
we use the same optimization objectives as designed by hierons et al.
for drupal as follows correctness we seek to minimize the number of constraints that were not satisfied.
richness of features we seek to minimize the number of deselected features in a solution.

again we believe that invalid solutions are useless in practice and might bring misleading results of performance metrics.
hence in this experiment we consider only the evaluation results after excluding invalid solutions from the final population.

finalpopulationofsolutionsproduced butthepopulationincluding invalid solutions may lead to misleading evaluation results and thusmayrecommendaninappropriatealgorithm.asdemonstrated in section .
we conduct a controlled experiment that includes andexcludesinvalidsolutionsforperformanceevaluation.from table5 includinginvalidsolutions weprefersatibeav1because it outperforms the other two algorithms on hv for two subjects with a large effect size.
in contrast from table excluding invalid solutions the superiority of satibeav1 disappears and it is hard tostatisticallydistinguishsatibeaandsatibeav1intermsofany qualitymetric.thedifferentresultsofthecontrolledexperiment demonstratetheimpactofinvalidsolutionsonthecalculationof performancemetrics.again sinceinvalidsolutionsareunbuildable in practice we recommend excluding invalid solutions at least i n the final population for pragmatic performance evaluation.
thirdly as illustrated in section .
amazonec2 brings a more realistic and more challenging case each feature attribute does not have a fixed value and the fitness of a solution is derived from the selectedfeatures usinga numberof attributeconstraints.
this breaksallpreviousmoeasthatpermitinvalidsolutions because the fitness of an invalid solution cannot be calculated by simpleaggregation.
as demonstrated in table only satibeav5 that preserves valid solutions all along the way works for amazonec2.
.
research questions and perspectives we first answerthe research questions rq2torq4 andthen we getbacktothecentralquestion rq1.regarding rq2 asexplained in section .
invalid solutions influence the calculation of performance metrics and we recommend a pragmatic performance evaluation that considers only valid solutions at least in the final population.
hence as shown in table excluding invalid solutions wecannotstatisticallydistinguishthreealgorithmsadopting different initial populations in terms of any quality metric.
how ever in terms of the effort of generating the initial population satibea is the least and the easiest to build because it simply uses randomly generated solutions.
therefore we recommend the random strategy to generate the initial population.
regarding rq3 asshownintable7 ourexperimentalresultson six subjectsdemonstrate the superiorityof satibeaamong three algorithms adopting different mutation operators.
we recommend themutationoperatorthathasalowermutationrateof0.001anda lower probability of .

this indicates that preserving valid solutions all along the way might not always be necessary.
as highlighted insection2.
thekeydifferencebetweenamazonec2andother subjects liesin thecharacteristics regarding featureattributes and constraints which can be used for decision making.
regarding rq1 it is a big question for the entire sbse community.
this paper conducts only a case study in the area of sbse for spls.
our aim is not to answer the big question completely in this paper but to make the community pay more attention to the question.
in particular by our empirical study we demonstrate that whether or not to preserve invalid solutions deserves moreattentionandmorestudyinsbse.insomecases asanalyzedfor amazonec2 we have to preserve valid solutions all along the way during the search of sbse.
