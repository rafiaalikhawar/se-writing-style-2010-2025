automated requirements engineering challenges with examples from small unmanned aerial systems keynote jane cleland huang university of notre dame usa abstract requirements engineering includes various activities aimed at discovering analyzing validating evolving andmanagingsoftware and systems requirements.
many of these activities are human facing effortintensive andsometimeserrorprone.theycouldbenefit greatly from cutting edge advances in automation.
