order to achieve this we designed and conducted a systematicmappingstudy oncollaborativemdse.startingfrom over potentially relevant studies we applied a rigorous selectionprocedure resultingin106selectedpapers furtherclustered into48primarystudies alongatimespanofnineteenyears.asuitable classification framework has been empirically defined and rigorously applied for extracting key information from each selectedstudy.wecollated summarized andanalyzedextracteddata by applying scientifically sound data synthesis techniques.
results in addition to a number of specific insights our analysis revealed the following key findings i there is a growing scientific interest on collaborative mdse in the last years ii multi view modeling validation support reuse and branching are more rarely covered withrespecttootheraspectsaboutcollaborativemdse iii different primary studies focus differently on individual dimensionsofcollaborativemdse i.e.
modelmanagement collaboration andcommunication iv mostapproachesarelanguage specific with aprominence ofuml based approaches v few approaches support the interplay between synchronous and asynchronous collaboration.
