our contributions are as follows the first study to show that semantics based apr can produce patches that overfit.
wefindthat insomecases resultsareinterestinglyinconsistent with that of heuristic approaches.
we substantiate that using multiple synthesis engines could be onepossibleapproachtohelpsemantics basedaprgenerate correct patches for a larger number of bugs.
we present implications and observations for how to improve semantics apr.
