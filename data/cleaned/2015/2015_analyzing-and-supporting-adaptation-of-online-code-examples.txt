analyzing and supporting adaptation of online code examples tianyi zhang di yang crista lopes miryung kim university of california los angeles university of california irvine tianyi.zhang miryung cs.ucla.edu diy4 lopes uci.edu abstract developers often resort to online q a forums such as stack overflow so for filling their programming needs.
although code examples on those forums are good starting points they are often incomplete and inadequate for developers local program contexts adaptation of those examples is necessary tointegrate them to production code.
as a consequence the process of adapting online code examples is done over and over again by multiple developers independently.
our work extensively studiesthese adaptations and variations serving as the basis for a tool that helps integrate these online code examples in a target context in an interactive manner.
we perform a large scale empirical study about the nature and extent of adaptations and variations of so snippets.
we construct a comprehensive dataset linking so posts to github counterparts based on clone detection time stamp analysis and explicit url
