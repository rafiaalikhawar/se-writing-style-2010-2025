change impact analysis cia is a technique that identifies impact sets i.e.
thesetofclassesthatrequirecorrectionasaresultofachangemade to a class or artefact.
these sets can also be considered as ripple effectsandtypicallynon local changespropagatetodifferentparts of a system.
two classes are considered logically coupled if they have cochanged in the past past research has shown that the precision of cia techniques increases if logical and semantic coupling i.e.
the extenttowhichthelexicalcontentoftwoclassesisrelated areboth considered.however therelationshipbetweensemanticandlogicalcouplingofsoftwareartefactshasnotbeenextensivelystudiedand no dependencies established between thesetwo types of coupling.

are two semantically similar artefacts boundtoco changeinthefuture?answeringthosequestionswould help increase the precision of cia.
it would also help software maintainers to focus on a smaller subset of artefacts more likely to co evolve in the future.

based on our findings we conclude that identifying more efficient methods of semantic coupling computation as well as a directionalrelationshipbetweensemanticandchangedependencies could help to improve cia methods that integrate semantic coupling information.
this may also help to reveal implicit dependencies not captured by static source code analysis.
