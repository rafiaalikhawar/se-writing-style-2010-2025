as software development today is done in teams managers are essential to organize the effort of creating good software and manage the people that carry it out.

ourresearchgoalwasto understand how software engineering managers function and what is perceived to make them great.
great managerspositivelyimpactmotivationandengagement weaim to raise awareness of these aspects as they can affect software engineering outcomes even if in a second order manner.

thestudywereportedinthepaper usedamixedmethods approach.we conducted37semi structured interviewswithengineers and managers of varied demographics at microsoft.
we then usedtheirinputtocreateanddeployasurveyto3 646engineersand managers using a questionnaire grounded on contextualized information.wefoundthattheengineeringmanagerguidesengineers to make decisions motivates them and mediates their presence in the organization.
to that end a sufficient level of technical knowledge is necessary but people management skills are critical for great software engineering managers.
comparing the perceptions ofmanagerstoengineersinouranalysis wefoundgeneralalignment but also identified specific differences that can help tailor management approaches.
through a separate survey we reviewed how the perceptions in software engineering relate to those in other knowledge worker groups.

the paper contributes a conceptual framework of fifteen attributes that characterize great engineering managers as well as contextualexamplesoftheattributesinaction.itprovidesquantitative evidence about how the attributes rank in importance what demographic differences exist and how the findings from software engineering compare to other knowledge work domains.
