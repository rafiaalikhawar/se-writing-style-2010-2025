we surveyed developers from companies and mailing lists about their reasons for using and not using security tools.
the resultin g thirty nine predictors of security tool use provide both ex pected and unexpected insights.
as we expected developers who perceive security to be important are more likely to use security tools than those who do not.
but that was not the strongest predictor of security tool use it was instead dev elopers ability to observe their peers using security tools.
categories andsubject descriptors d. software engineering keywords security tools adoption developers .
introduction in a buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the x server part of the widely used xwindow system .
developers found that a bdf font file containing a longer than expected string could overflow the buffer on the stack .
this vulnerability was found with the static analysis tool cppcheck which warned developers of a call to scanf without field width limits.
this scanfbug could lead to an unprivileged user acquiring root privileges in some system s according to the announcement from x.org .
this vulnerability was introduced in .
we wonder why it took developers a full years to use tools to find and repair this vulnerability.
even prior to cppcheck s int roduction in several security tools could have found thi s error.
nonetheless it seems developers did not use them when working with x. we define security tools as analysis tools that help developers find and fix vulnerabilities.
some security tools such as klokwork and coverity are designed specifically to find vulnerabilities.
our definition also encompass es general purpose analysis tools for finding programming errors such as static analysis tools like findbugs and dy namic analysis tools like some valgrind plugins .
tools like cppcheck and findbugs are free to use yet as demonstrated by the x vulnerability the mere existence and avail ability of these tools does not make software more secure.
developers must use them or will leave many vulnerabilitie s in code when they could be quickly found and fixed.
we aim to help practitioners find ways to increase adoption of security tools so developers find more vulnerabiliti es early.
the use of security tools is an important part of secure software development methodologies such as the microsoftsecuredevelopmentlifecycle andmcgraw s rec ommendations for secure development .
thus our work focuses on security tools because increasing their adoptio n could have great impact on developers and software users whose data and computing resources would be more secure.
we also focus on security tools because unlike most other software development tools they are a preventative innovation this class of innovations is especially challenging to adopt because the payoff for adopting them tends to be a non event that is something bad not happening .
the main contribution of this paper is a quantification of the relative importance of factors that predict security to ol adoption.
we collected quantitative data on the factors relative importance with an online survey of software devel opers working in companies as well as developers on mailing lists.
surprisingly we found developers percept ions of the importance of security may not be the most important factor in their adoption of security tools.
social and cultural factors like the perceived prestige of security t ool users and the frequency of interaction with security expert s may be a more important influence.
our results can help practitioners choose areas of focus when attempting to promote security tool adoption and help researchers prioriti ze areas of study for understanding security tool adoption.

adoption the theory for our work is drawn from diffusion of innovations research .
one reason we chose because it has proven versatile in its long history.
rogers originally developed the theory to explain the adoption of new breeds of corn among farmers but it has also been used to analyze adoption of such innovations as dance moves and personal digital workstations.
a rich field of adoption study that accounts for many aspects of adoption.
for instance account for temporal aspects of the diffusion of new technologies such as the patterns in which innovations spread through populations and the processes by which individuals make decisions about trying and adopting new innovations .
in our approach we focus on factors that foster or inhibit adoption so we can recommend particular practices that promote security tool adoption.
we also chose we could analyze social aspects of tool adoption.
our previous work investigated how developers learn about new tools and found developers can learn about tools from their peers .
where some of our other previous work identifies usability concerns and technical f actors in tool use this research investigates social fac tors as well.
weaim tocreate amore comprehensiveunderstanding of security tool adoption.
ourresearchinsecuritytooladoptionisnotthefirsttouse a theoretical foundation.
for instance meyerovich andrabkin applied they found social factors and socially driven factor s like theavailability of free andopen source libraries aff ected developers decisions when choosing to adopt or not adopt a programming language.
also helped singer develop persuasive interventions to increase the use of git among student developers .
our research is novel in that we are the first to apply security tool adoption.
.
quantifying influences onadoption other researchers have quantified influences on adoption through the use of surveys.
in meyerovich and rabkin s previously mentioned work they surveyed open sourc e developers about what factors influence their choices when choosing a programming language for a new project.
the survey presented here is largely inspired by surveys outsid e computer science research.
for example tan and teo used a survey to develop a regression model describing the relationship between intent to adopt online banking and various variables such as experience with the internet and perceived risk.
baaren used a survey study to quantify the importance of factors in the technology acceptance model in hdtv adoption.
we apply similar techniques to quantify security tool adoption.
.
security tooladoption in previous qualitative work we built on diffusion of innovations theory to qualitatively interview profession al developers .
based on those interviews we organize d adoption factors into four high level factor groups innovation factors describe how the properties of the innovations themselves the security tools affect developer adoption.
social system factors describe how the company or community in which developers write software can affect their adoption of security tools.
communication channel factors describe how different ways of communicating about security tools such as through advertisements social media or faceto face communication affect developers adoption decisions.
potential adopter factors describe how qualities of the individual developers themselves affect their adoption decisions.although we derived factors in these groups in our interviews the results were not very actionable.
for example should a manager who wants to improve tool adoption focus on promoting a more usable security tool a property of the innovation or should they focus on implementing company standards regarding security a property of the social system ?
our aim in the present study is to provide a justification for policy makers and toolsmiths to focus their efforts by quantifyingadoption factors relative importance.
to o ur knowledge the present paper is the first to study security tool adoption quantitatively.
.
methodology as in other adoption research we conducted a survey1.
we first discuss the design and development of the survey instrument section .
.
we then discuss and compare two iterations of the survey with different participant selection strategies sections .
and .
.
we close this s ection with a description of the data analysis section .
an d respondent characterization section .
.
.
instrument development we began the development of our survey by adapting an existing survey instrument originally developed by moore and benbasat .
their survey concerned personal digital workstations we altered it to concern security tools in stead.
we added questions to quantify the findings from our interviews and to help collaborating managers in industry evaluate the state of security awareness in their companies .
for instance since our interviewees indicated that develo pers who believe insecure software would cause problems for customers are more likely to use security tools we added questions about these beliefs.
we refined the survey based on piloting and feedback from colleagues industry partner s and industry developers.
the initial survey consisted of likert scale questions aboutfactorsthatinfluencedrespondents securitytoolad option decisions questions about respondents experience and role in development and free response questions to elicit factors not presentin the surveyand general comment s aboutadoption.
forthelikertscaleweusedstronglyagree agree neither agree nor disagree disagree strongly disagree and included a don t know option.
each survey began with a page defining security and security tools in the same way as for our interview study .
we measured security tool usage by asking respondents what we call the usage question which of the following statements describes you best?
i usually use security tools when i develop software or security tools automatically analyze the code i develop when i check in or build my code.
i use security tools only occasionally or when i am performing specific tasks like looking for vulnerabilities.
i never or almost never use security tools.
we chose the points in a way that ensured each scale point had a concrete meaning avoidingpotentially ambiguou s scale points such as fairly often and often .
1an empty survey can be found at .
to obtain as credible survey responses as possible we assured respondents that only summary data would be publically disclosed thus raw survey data is not availabl e.table distributions of security tool use frequent occasional never iteration iteration .
firstsurvey iteration we distributed the survey through a convenience sample of our contacts in software development companies.
such non probabilistic sampling reduces our ability to draw gen eralizable conclusions about the population of developers as a whole but is reasonable when no practical way to randomly sample from the entire population exists.
we distributed the survey in one of two ways depending on privacy concerns in the companies surveyed.
in the first way for nine companies we distributed the survey directly to respondents after obtaining their email addresses from managers.
weaskedthesemanagers torandomlyselectaset of developers at their company including testers and other managers then inform the developers that they would be contacted for the survey.
we then emailed developers with a link to the online survey.
during the following week we emailed developerswhohadnotparticipatedtoremindthem about the survey.
in the second way for five companies we were unable to obtain developers email addresses due to privacy concerns.
in these companies we asked our contact in the company to again select developers then send a form email to these developers containing a link to the survey as well as a reminder email in the week following.
to incentivize participation we offered a drawing for two amazon gift cards.
the survey was open to each group of developers for one to two weeks.
of the developers to whom we directly distributed the survey those in the nine companies where we could obtain developers emails completed it.
this is a .
completion rate which is at the high end of typical response rates for surveys of softwar e developers .
the rest of the respondents were contacted about the survey by our industry contacts completed it.
in total completed the first iteration of the survey.
however because incomplete surveys contained some usable data where possible we analyzed data from such surveys.
to mitigate the negative effects that the survey s length would have on participation and completion we used a split survey design .
all respondents were asked about their knowledge of secure development practices and their experience and role in software development.
we grouped the remaining questions by topic then grouped these topics int o four pages with roughly equal numbers of questions.
each respondent was presented with two of the four pages.
we used the qualtrics online survey platform which randomly assigned pages of the survey to respondents in a way that ensured approximately equal numbers of respondents were presented with each page.
as a result each page of the survey was presented to the same number of respondents plus or minus four respondents.
the distribution of responses to this question for the first iteration of the survey are shown in the first row of table iteration .
what stands out about this distribution is how many non users of security tools responded compared to how few users of security tools did.
while the perspective of non users is important to meaningfully draw conclusion sabout the differences between users and non users we aimed to collect more responses from security tool users.
.
second survey iteration we ran a second iteration of our survey compensating for the lack of tool users in the first sample by using a different sampling method.
additionally we reduced the size of the surveysothateveryrespondentcouldanswereveryquestion .
.
.
samplingmethod to sample developers who were more likely to use security tools we distributed this survey to mailing lists for user s of different security tools.
the first participants from each mailing list received a amazon gift card for participating.
there was evidence that many surveys were completed programatically so we cleaned the data by removing all participants who took less than minutes to complete the survey.
we chose minutes because there was a clear discontinuity in the distribution between participants wh o took less than minutes and those who took more than minutes.
this removed responses and left .
the distribution of responses to the question about security to ol use for this iteration are shown in the second row of table which shows that this sample of respondents complements the first sample in terms of frequency of tool use.
.
.
surveysizereduction another disadvantage of the first iteration of the survey was that due to our split survey design most adoption factor questions were answered by only about half of respondents.
this reduces statistical power .
for this iterat ion we compensatedbyreducingthenumberofquestionssothat every participant could answer every question.
we shortened the survey by including only the questions that significantly correlated with usage in the first iterati on.
we analyzed of the questions which asked about factors that encourage or discourage adoption by finding spearman s rank correlation between responses to the questions and respondents self reported security tool use frequenc y. when we computed spearman s correlation using sas statistical software we treated the usage question as an ordin al response with three levels.
using r our initial analysis found out of questions correlated significantly .
with respondents self reported security tool use.
when conducting so many independent statistical tests there is a high probability of false discovery.
we accounted for this chance of false disco very using a benjamini hochberg adjustment .
on the basis of this adjustment correlations with p valuesabove .
were treated as insignificant.
atthis level responses to of questions correlated significantly with respondents se lfreported security tool use.
we used these questions on the second iteration of the survey.
.
data analysis we analyzed the results by combining the responses of both survey iterations analyzing just the questions that t he two iterations had in common.
this has two advantages.
first combining results enables increased statistical po wer compared to analyzing each iteration separately.
second combining results compensates for the usage skew fewer securitytool users inthefirstiterationandmoreinthesecond that would make it difficult to detect effects when analyz ing the iterations separately.
from a sampling standpoint combining results is reasonable in two aspects.
first both samples are drawn from the same population of interest software developers as a whole.
second our survey should capture any differences between the two populations to the extent that our prior interviews rigorously exposed all the factors that contribute to tool adoption.
nonetheless we cannot rule out the possibility of such differences.
like all empirical study designs ours entail tradeoffs and we judge that the benefits are worth the potential risks.
we discuss these tradeoffs further in section .
.
.
individuallogistic regressionmodels the aim of our first analysis is to determine which factors predict security tool usage.
we first coded security tool adoption dichotomously by converting the three poin t scale used in the usage question by mapping the never response to no adoption and occasionally and frequently to adoption .
for each question we performed a logistic regression analysis using r to determine the extent to which each factor predicted the adoption of security tools.
we again used a benjamini hochberg correction to control the false discovery rate the adjusted p value for significance was .
.
additionally we calculated odds ratios to estima te effect size using spss .
in the first iteration four questions concerned developers trust of different sources of information about security too ls.
these were qualitatively different from the other questions and are not meant to predict tool use.
thus we compare them to one another as described in section .
.
for both individual and combined regression models we assume that if a respondent did not know the answer to a question their lack of knowledge did not affect the respondent s adoption decisions.
this assumption was supported by fisher exact value tests which found no significant differences in security tool adoption between the responses with missing and the responses without missing values in the first survey iteration.
thus we treated all don t know responses to likert scale questions as though they were missing at random mar .
treating such responses as mar is considered a reasonable treatment of don t know responses where models replacing them may not help characterize respondents any better .
.
.
combinedlogistic regressionmodel onelimitationofpresentingaseries ofsingle variablemo dels is that their effects might be cross correlated which re duces our ability to isolate independent phenomena.
to show that the factors in this study have independent effects we built a combined logistic regression model using a ll factors in r .
the combined model also included the role and experience of participants.
toreduce the numberof factors we used stepwise regression which deletes variab les that improve the model the most by being deleted according to the akaike information criterion and repeats this process until no further improvement is possible.
.
respondent characteristics here we characterize the self reported background of respondents across both iterations.
about of respondents were developers testers managers and other.
about had less than year of professional software development experience years years years years and more than years.
the common software domains participants worked in were web mobile desktop enterprise client and tiered appli cations software as a service and cloud analytics and statis tics developer tools and application lifecycle managemen t computeraideddesign graphics ecommerce anddatabases .
.
results implications interpreting the results table table summarizes our results.
each row of the table describes one statement for which survey respondents rated their agreement as well as the results of our analysis for each question.
for example respondents answered with a cox and snell regressionr2coefficient of .
.
our regression model for showed a significant relationship p .
between participants levels of agreement with the statement and their adoption.
finally the last column exp b indicates an odds ratio of .
.
if the value of an odds ratio is greater than this means that respondents are more likely to adopt security tools with increases in the likert scores i.e.
when th ey agree with a statement more.
for example for the odd ratio is .
which means that for every one point likert scale increase more agreement e.g.
neutral to agree or agree to strongly agree the odds that participants adopt security tools increase by a factor of .
.
for two points of increase e.g from neutral to strongly agree the odds would increase by a factor of .
.
.
.
conversely if the value is less than individuals are less lik ely to adopt security tools.
for every one point likert scale increase the odds decrease by a factor of exp b .
for example for with exp b .
participants are less likely to adopt security tools for every one likert scale un it increase the odds drop by .
times .
.
and in the case of an odds ratio less than one is expected given the statement s framing.
in table statements are labeled s1 to s39 the order and number is based on highest odds ratio to lowest odds ratio .
the results show securi ty tool usage is a significant predictor for all statements.
to give an overview of the strength of the effects for each factor group we use small bar charts.
in these charts the number of bars represents the number of statements that significantly predict tool adoption the height of each bar represents an odds ratio and the bars are ordered by descending height.
for example the header of section .
.
shows which indicates of the four likert scale statementsthatsignificantlypredictedtool adoption onewas re latively strong .
one medium .
and two weak .
and .
.
questions with large values for n were presented to all respondents of each iteration.
additional variation in nis due to non response for some questions and don t know responses.
discussing implications throughout we will also discuss the implications our findings have for those who want to spread security tools in organizations.
we do this here rather than discussing implications in their own section t o make clear the connections between our findings and the course of action they imply.
to differentiate the findings of our survey from their implications the latter will be in paragraphs beginning with implications in bold.
as we mentioned in section .
while our methodology precludes strong claims of generalizability in our implications we t ake some liberties in assuming that our results apply in widercontexts beyond the participants surveyed for this study.
as is typical for surveys statistically significant relati ons alone do not imply causality.
for some relationships however we have evidence of causation from our interview studies.
where appropriate we will discuss possible causal lin ks and their implications.
we do so to provide questions for other researchers to answer in the future and to show these results potential impact.
.
summary ofresults next we discuss the factors in terms of the four factor groups the innovation factors the social system factors the communication channel factors and the potential adopter factors.
we contextualize survey respondents answers in qualitative data provided by our prior interviewees.
.
social system factors .
.
securityconcern awareness security concern is the perceived importance of security in asocial system.
in our interviews higher security conce rn led to the adoption of tools.
for example some developers reported that the software they developed was only used by authenticated trusted users so they thought security was not important.
as a result these developers did not use security tools .
in the survey security concern predicted security tool use but the three security concern statements had among the weakest effects of all.
for instance a point increase inagreementwiththestatement iworkonsoftware for which security is very important only accounted for a .
increased odds of using security tools.
likewise the five security awareness statements and predicted tool use but als o had smaller effects than most other factors.
combined with our interview study where some developers did use security tools because of this attitude these results impl y a causal link between security concern and security tool use though a relatively weak one.
implications while importance of security is influential our results on the whole indicate that the perceived im portance of security does not influence adoption as much as other factors.
our results comport with xie and colleagues findings that security concerns influence secure coding prac tices but our results suggest it is not the most important factor.
surprisingly based on our results relative e ffect sizes makingdevelopers more security conscious maynot b e as effective as other interventions for promoting tool use.
.
.
policies standards in our interviews the policies and standards relating to security tools affected their adoption as well.
for instance all interviewees required to use security tools did so .
different policies and standards in the companies that developers worked in also predicted tool use.
organizations application of explicit standards for software secur ity predicted security tool use.
adoption is also predicted by the application of secure development processes like thos e from owasp and the microsoft secure development lifecycle .
thesecondstrongesteffectinthesurveywasthatadopters were more likely to report their superiors expect them to use security tools .
though not as strong an effect respondents who used security tools were more likely to say thattheirsuperiorsrewardthemfor writingsecuresoftware .
implications sociological research has found that workers in security critical fields often circumvent security p olicies.
even in hospitals where the cost of mistakes can be fatal workers often circumvent policies requiring the use of barcodes to identify patients and drugs .
ourfindings in contrast indicate thatdevelopers whoare requiredtousesecuritytoolsactuallydoso.
asmentionedi n section .
.
this may be because developers generally believe security tools help them do their jobs better and faste r. these findings suggest that organizations should firstly pre scribe tool use as part of a secure development methodology and secondly explicitly reward developers for the security of their software.
while our findings show some respondents were rewarded for writing secure code we do not know how they were rewarded or what rewards are most effective.
future research could help companies determine the best ways to reward developers and make them feel valued for their secure development efforts.
many companies such as mozilla github facebook and twitter use bug bounties or rewards for outsiders who discover vulnerabilitie s. .
.
structure thestructure of a company or other social system in which developers write software with respect to how security experts and security auditing teams interact with othe r developers affects adoption as well.
for instance we found in our interview study that developers who interact with security experts feel more personally responsible for securi ty.
thus we asked a number of questions about the structure of the environment in which developers worked about how respondents interact with security and testing teams for example.
we also asked about respondents perceptions of their responsibility for security as xie and colleagues found these perceptions led some developers to not adopt security practices.
respondents who used security tools were more likely to report they felt personally responsible for the security of the software they develop and that they interacted frequently with others in their organization who help improve the security of their software .
respondents were also more likely to say their peers thoroughly reviewed their sof tware for security .
while structural relationships we re significant the effects were weaker than most other factors .
implications these results strengthen thefindings from our interviews that interviewees who interacted frequentl y with security teams were more likely to use security tools out of a greater sense of personal responsibility for securi ty.
the strongest structure effect in the survey was with the frequency with which developers interact with others who work in security.
thus we suggest that policy should encourage security experts to conduct audits alongside other developers rather than simply running analyses and sending reports.
security experts and other developers could also conduct pair programming sessions pair programming can effectively transfer knowledge between programmers and thus also might be used to transfer knowledge about security tools.

.57about security and security tools.
some companies hold occasional security seminars while in other companies know ledge of security is part of the interview process and is generally assumed of all developers .
we conducted these survey studies partly to study the effects these differences may have on security tool adoption.
securitytooladopterswere morelikelytoreporttheywere educated or had opportunities to continue their education i n security use was predicted by having learned about securit y tools in university courses and working in an organization that holds frequent trainings on security tools and on software security .
respondents who reported having access to organizational trainings were more likely to report using security tools .
and .
than those taught about security tools in university courses .
.
implications hiring developers who have been trained in software security may be an effective means of spreading security tools in an organization.
even if they do not currently use the tool the organization wants to diffuse they may be more likely to adopt the tool.
these findings also suggest that organizations should hold trainings on not jus t security but on security tools as well.
.
.
culture thecultureofasocialsystem withrespecttosecuritytool adoption consists of the beliefs and social norms concerning security and security tool use in that social system.
we found in our previous interview study that in some companies developers considered using new security tools cool while others had cultures shaped by policies that encouraged just using tools that were already approved for use in the company .
we asked several questions on our survey to determine the effects that such cultural attitudes had on adoption.
respondents who used security tools were more likely to report that the company they worked in had a culture that encouraged secure development and the use of security tools.
they reported developers who use security tools were more prestigious than those who do not to relatively large effect .
and that using security tools improved their image within their organizations .
adopters were also more likely to report that making software secure is important to the developers they worked with .
adopters were more likely than non adopters to report they would be embarrassed if software they developed were not secure .
implications naturally affecting the culture of a social system is a hard problem.
however singer s work indicates that gamification and other means of externally influencing the prestige of using software development practice s can increase their adoption.
building on that work future research might apply social gamification to the security too l adoption problem.
.
innovationfactors .
.
relativeadvantage we asked several questions to determine how well properties of the security tool itself or relative advantage predicts tool adoption.
if a developer thinks using a tool is superior to not using it or to using a different tool it has a high relative advantage.
relative advantage includes develope rs perceptions of technical aspects like soundness andfalse p ositive rates.
another aspect of relative advantage is expens e prior interviewees thought that security tools were too ex pensive in financial or time costs to be worth using .
such tools had a low perceived relative advantage.
in our surveys adopters tended to believe that security tools helped respondents do their jobs faster and at a higher level of performance .
respondents who use security tools are more likely than non adopters to believe that security tools are cost effective were a good use o f their time and feel confident choosing between different security tools .
the relative advantage factors ha d relatively strong effects on adoption.
implications inourpreviousstudy allintervieweeswho were required to use security tools did so .
one interpre tation of those results is that developers only use security tools because of these requirements.
findings in managerial psychology indicate that fear of punishment for breaking workplace rules can influence employee behavior .
this could imply that developers only use security tools to avoid breaking workplace policies.
circumvention of polic y is common in other workplaces such as hospitals .
in contrast our results indicate that developers have thei r own reasons for using security tools in general adopters think security tools have a positive impact on their work.
in this sense the workplace requirement to use security tools is different from other requirements in that developers thin k it actually helps them do better work.
.
.
observability wealso askeddevelopersquestionsabout the observability ofsecuritytools.
accordingtodiffusionofinnovations do i theory a technology is more observable if others can easy to tell that an adopter is using it.
for example cell phones are more observable than desktop computers since an adopter of a cell phone will use it in public while an adopter of a desktop will typically only use it in private.
states that more observable innovations are more likely to be adopted .
survey responses to three questions show a significant relationship between security tool use and aspects of their ob servability .
in fact the strongest of all the relationships we found was with the statement i have seen what others do using security tools .
implications toolsmiths and policymakers may be able to impact tool adoption by increasing observability.
for in stance pair programming or developer led demonstrations is one way to improve observability in an organization.
.
.
complexity states that innovations perceived to be complexare less likely to be adopted than simpler ones.
for instance black and colleagues found that less experienced people with computers were less likely to adopt online banking technologies partly because of the perceived complexi ty of the system .
our previous interviews suggested developers are equally effected one developer reported they did not use a security tool because the tool s interface was so complex that it made performing simple tasks a nightmare .
the survey did confirm that complexity was a significant factor in tool adoption but not particularly strongly .
adopters were more likely than non adopters to report that security tools presented their analyses in understandable ways .
in addition adopters were more likely to believ e that security tools are internally complex than non adopte rswere .
bothfactors effects wereweaker thanthosefrom most other factors.
implications to some degree complexity is linked to the power of a security tool yet toolsmiths may be able to increase adoption through reduced complexity by for example building tools that communicate with developers using familiar terminology.
.
.
trialability in innovations have higher trialability if they are easier to use on a trial basis without significant invest ment in the as yet untested technology.
more trialable innovations are more likely to be adopted than less trialable ones.
in our previous interview study some developers reported not using security tools because it was not worth the time it took to install and configure a tool .
adopters were more likely to say they knew how to satisfactorily try out security tools .
security tool adopte rs also were more likely to say they had access to security tools and were permitted to try security tools to adequately see what they do .
implications these relationships suggest that companies tryingto foster security tool adoption should make pol icies to make it easy for employees to try new tools.
these findings also indicate that policies that prevent developer s from easily trying new tools make them less likely to adopt them.
offering resources to show developers how to install and try out tools may encourage adoption by making developers feel they are able to evaluate their functionality .
toolsmiths maybeabletoincrease adoptionoftheirtools by reducing barriers to demonstrating and trying the function ality of security tools.
for instance future research coul d find ways for companies to host flexible analysis platforms to helpdevelopers with minimal effort try differentsecuri ty tools on their code.

communication channel factors .

trust developers trustdifferent sources of information about security tools different amounts.
in our previous interviews participants trusted prominent developers they know of on the internet more than managers in their organization .
indicates that individuals are more likely to adopt innovations they learn about from trusted parties.
on the first iteration of the survey but not the second iteration we asked four questions about channels participants trusted for information about security tools.
each question was in the form if i learned about a security tool from source iwouldtrustthatinformation where source was a manager in my organization another developer a blog or technical website or an advertisement online or otherwise .
a respondents answered at least one trust question ofwhich 4respondentsdidnotanswer between one and three trust questions.
we ignored such missing data in this analysis.
the median trust in the manager and the developer was agree while blog or technical website was neither agree nor disagree and advertisement was disagree .

we did not find a significant difference between trust for managers and developers.

.
implications these findings indicate that advertisements are not effective ways to inform developers about security tools as developers do not trust them.
developers trust in peers helps explain previous findings that peer recommendation is a particularly effective way developers find out about new tools .
wewere surprisedtofindthatrespondentstrustmanagers as much as other developers.
our interviews and other previous work indicate that developers do not trust their managers as much as other sources for information about tools.
one explanation might be our sampling methodology respondents who heard about the survey through their manager might be more inclined to answer it in a managerfriendly way.
we expand on this threat further in section .
.
.
exposure the extent to which developers are exposed to security tools through different channels also affects their likeliho od to adopt them.
our previous findings in our interview studies on security tool adoption and peer interaction indicate that learning about tools from other developers is infrequent but an effective vector for tool adoption.
respondents who were exposed to tools were more likely to use them.
we found that adopters were more likely than non adopters to report learning about security tools from managers in their organization and technical blogs an d websites .
additionally respondents who used security tools were more likely to report they frequently learne d about security tools from other developers .
the effects of each exposure factor was larger than for most other factors.
implications we were surprised that the effect of learningaboutsecuritytoolsthroughmanagers .
wasabout the same as that of learning security tools through peers .
.
this is surprising given our previous findings that indicate developers do not trust their managers for informa tion about tools .
however our previous findings also indicate that developers learn about tools from their peers only infrequently these findings may actually reflect how in general few developers learn about security tools from their peers.
our findings suggest that companies can use managers as agents of diffusion for security tools developers who frequently hear about security tools from their managers are more likely to use security tools than those who do not and developers may trust managers as much as other developers.
.
potential adopter factors qualities of the potential adopter the developer who must choose whether or not to adopt a security tool affect developers adoption decisions according to our qualitative in terviews.
in particular our interviews identified two relevan t factors developers experience in programming and software security and their inquisitiveness about security tools.
in our interviews we found for example that all developer s who did not seek out information about new security tools also did not use security tools .
we found security tool adopters were more likely than non adopters to say they actively sought out information about security tools a relatively strong effect .

tools.
surprisingly however we did not find a statisticall y significant relationship between respondents years of exp erience in software development and adoption.
implications prior research on technology adoption indicates that experience and inquisitiveness have an impact onadoption.
forinstance chauandhuifoundthatnoveltyseeking behavior and length of experience using computers were strongly related to early adoption of windows .
however our results here indicate that inexperienced deve lopers may be just as likely to use security tools as more experienced ones.
some of our prior results explain this in an unrelated set of interviews interviewees indicated tha t experienced developers can learn about software development tools from interns because interns have more time for experimenting with new tools .
these results suggest that organizations should consider employing inexperienc ed developers as knowledge sources about security tools.
.
acombinedsecuritytooladoptionmodel we built a combined logistic regression model using all factors.
for this model and only for this model we used imputation to deal with missing values.
missing values occurred when participants were not asked a question because of the split survey design did not to respond to a question or selected don t know .
we substituted missing values with the median likert score of the completed responses for that question.
after the stepwise regression the factors for questions and the role demographics survived all other factors were eliminated.
among the surviving factors only were statically significant.
the resulting model is shown in table .
since the range of variables related to survey questions is the same for strongly disagree ... strongly agree th e coefficients for the variables can be directly compared.
a higher coefficient means a stronger influence.
as with the individual models in the combined model the strongest influence remains i have seen what others do using security tools with an odd ratio of .
.
the statistically significant factors with positiveinfluence on security tool adoption come from different categories observ ability advantages policies inquisitiv eness education and exposure .
the demographics did not matter in the combined model experience was eliminated in the stepwise regression and role was not statistically significant.
one significant factor has negative influence .
on security tool adoption it is easy for me to observe others using security tools in my organization .
yet in isola tion this factor had positive influence on adoption .
table .
one explanation is that there is an interaction between and i have seen what others do using security tools .
in the combined model .
the effect of adoption is strongest for people who observed others using security tools and for whom it was not easy high scores for and low scores for .
if observing others was easy high scores for both and the effect on adoption is still positive .
.
.
but not as strong.
in other words having to go through obstacles to discover a security tool may increase the odds of adoption.
another explanation is that the negative effect is a result of data imputation .
we tested this explanation by re running our combined logistic regression model with only and and without imputation we achieved this by only using data from respondents that got the page that contained the observability factor group.
in that model retained a significant positive influence and s negative effect was reduced an d was no longer significant.
this suggests that we cannot rule out imputation as the cause of s negative effect in the combined imputed model.
to further validate the model we used ten fold cross validation.
we split the dataset into random folds.
each fold was then used to validate a logistic regression model basedon the factors in table constructed using the other nine training folds.
the mean precision is .
and mean recall is .
which suggests that the model can successfull y predict security tool adoption.
as with the individual regression models toolsmiths and policy makers can use the combined regression model to identify significant factors as potential avenues for facil itating tool adoption.
additionally if such stakeholders want to address multiple factors choosing several positive si gnificant ones from the combined model may be a way to influence adoption from different perspectives.
for example as we suggested in section .
.
the importance of seeing what others do using security tools suggests that encourag ing practices like pair programming can spread knowledge of security tools.
finally because the significant positiv e predictors of adoption were also significant in the individu al models the reader can have increased confidence that these trends are not simply artifacts of our analysis techniques.
.
threatsto validity threats to construct validity we cannot guarantee that we have described and measured each factor exactly as it affects adoption.
for instance we wanted to measure respondents inquisitiveness but could not directly ask ho w inquisitive are you?
since we cannot expect participants to accurately describe such subjective properties of themselves .
instead we asked questions such as asking if theysoughtoutinformation aboutsecuritytools tomeasur e the effects of their inquisitiveness.
there are many ways to measure inquisitiveness and for practical reasons we mea sured just one of them.
one threat to construct validity is our combining of data from each iteration of the survey as discussed in section .
.
if the samples are systematically different in a way that the second iteration of the survey does not capture our results will not reflect those differences.
for instance the questio ns that existed on the first iteration of the survey but not the second may have been sensitive to such differences but the data we gathered can neither confirm nor deny it.
another threat is the lower statistical power of analyzing question s that appeared on the first survey but not the second because such questions necessarily had fewer total responses .
consequently users and non users of security tools may actually answer these questions differently.
to derive the combined model we use imputation to handle missing values.
different imputation strategies may lea d todifferentmodels.
thus thereader should exercise cautio n when interpreting the combined model.
threats to internal validity the present study is a retrospective survey not an experimental study and so our ability to make predictive claims is limited.
as we noted earlier many cases have evidence for causality base d on our interview study but in other cases especially for those questions designed based on moore and benbasat s work we cannot.
fortunately this paper provides the necessary foundation for conducting future experimental o r actionresearch basedstudies wewouldrecommendsuc h studies focus on the largest significant effects that we have uncovered here.
since we worked with managers to distribute the survey on the first iteration we did not have control over the sampling methodology within companies.
in addition distribution with the help of managers could introduce bias.
forinstance developers who know the manager who distributed the survey may tend to respond more positively to questions aboutmanagementthanifwewereabletodistributethesurvey directly to developers.
however with the exception of the questions on trust if we assume that both frequent and infrequent tool users are equally affected by this bias then the bias would have little effect on our analyses.
a similar response bias threat is that respondents may have had more experience or held a more positive attitude towards securit y tools than non respondents.
as in most survey studies the wording of the survey may have biased participants.
to address this threat we tried to word questions in a value neutral way.
nonetheless our surveydidhavesectionheadingslike inquisitiveness w hich mayhavepositiveconnotationsandmayhavebiasedrespondents towards agreeing with these statements.
as with the potential bias introduced by distribution by management i f we assume equal bias on frequent and infrequent tool users then this bias has little effect on our results.
threats to external validity in our first iteration most responses came from a small subset of the companies sampled in most of the companies we surveyed fewer than developers.
thus while this sample covers a variety of industry developers respondents hail from a small number of companies.
similarly respondents across both iteratio ns may not be representative of all developers.
some questions we asked during our first iteration did not appear significantly related to adoption based on our initia l analysis.
it may be that some relationship does indeed exist but that our study lacked the statistical power to detect it.
asmentionedinsection3 weomittedresponses fromparticipants who took less than minutes to complete the survey in an effort to combat ballot stuffing .
however we may have still included invalid responses from ballot stuffe rs who took more than minutes and also may have omitted data from real respondents who took the survey quickly.
.
conclusion security tools are an important part of secure software development butmanydevelopersdonotusethem evenwhen they believe security is important.
this leaves software le ss secure thanit could be.
inthis paper we describe aquantification of factors that influence security tool adoption.
our results the product of a long term mixed methods researc h project provide toolsmiths and policy makers greater understanding of why tools are or are not adopted.
although toolsmiths and policy makers have more control over some factors our results provide a holistic lens through which thesestakeholderscanbetterunderstandadoption.
wehope future applications of our findings will result in more devel opers using security tools helping increase the security o f the software we increasingly depend upon.
