in this paper we demonstrate how this framework can be used to trace the consistency and completeness of technical documents that consistof a set of system installation design principles used by airbus toensure the correctness of aircraft system installation.
we show inparticular how the platform allows the integration of two types ofreasoning reasoning about the meaning of text using semanticparsing and description logic theorem proving and reasoningabout document structure using first order relational logic andfinite model finding for traceability analysis.
.html i. i ntroduction due to the complexity of software systems that command control and monitor safety critical functions in airborne systems and the necessity of the compliance with the do178c standard there is an increased need for sophisticated and highly automated tools for the analysis of the tracingamong software artifacts e.g.
requirements architecture models source codes and test cases to keep them synchronizedand consistent during the development process.
in this context traceability not only establishes and maintains consistency between these artifacts but also ensures that each requirementis tested that each line of source code has a purpose for the fulfillment of a requirement and so forth.
the implementation of traceability is highly contextual as the certification artifacts produced or used along the processdiffer depending on the product or the organization .
for that reason the modelwriter platform provides the means forusers to specify which artifacts they want to precisely identify and monitor and what meaning they want to assign to the traces between these artifacts.
the considered artifacts represented in our context by trace locations might be of different levels of granularity ranging from a complete document or model to fragments of text or code.
focusing on documents and text both the structure andthe content might be used to reason about traceability.
to this end the modelwriter platform provides a generic traceability analysis applicable to text and model artifacts tosynchronize them.
trace locations can be fragments of text elements of an architectural model and parts of programcodes.
traces are relations between trace locations.
the modelwriter platform allows axiomatization of these relations and reasoning about them i.e.
supporting traceability analysis fordifferent types of artifacts.
in this paper we focus on demonstrating the features of the modelwriter platform for traceability analysis applied totechnical documentation.
a particular challenge in this usecase is to take into account the meaning of natural language.
we integrate techniques from natural language processing nlp and automated reasoning to reason both about the meaning and about the structure of text.
we use techniques from semantic parsing to assign formal meaning representations to nl text.
we then use techniques from theorem provingand model building to infer traceability relations between text fragments here system installation design principles to check consistency and to ensure completeness.

t he airbus sidp u secase we illustrate the workings of the modelwriter platform based on a set of system installation design principles sidp used by airbus to ensure the correctness of aircraft design.
ansidp rule is an installation requirement specifying properties which must be fulfilled for the system to be well formed.
in this usecase sidps are trace locations and we define fivetypes of trace links between these trace locations namely cont ains refines conflicts equals and requires .
in the following we informally give the meaning of the tracetypes adopted from the work of goknil et.
al.

a formal semantics is provided in section iii c. ruler1contains rule r2...r nifr2...r nare parts of the wholer1 part whole hierarchy .
the contained rule is a subrule of the containing rule.
ruler1refines another ruler2if r1is derived from r2by adding more details to its properties.
the refined rule can be seen as an abstraction of the detailed rules.

the required rule can be seen as a pre condition for the requiringrule.

illustration of conflicts equals and requires given a set of sidps the modelwriter platform can be used to check completeness and consistency as follows.
first the sidps are parsed and assigned description logic dl formulae representing their meaning cf.

second traces are either manually specified by the end user or inferred using semantic parsing and dl theorem proving cf.
section iii b .
third new trace links can be inferred fromexisting ones using relational logic rl cf.
section iii c and model finding cf.
section iii d .
importantly the inference of trace links allows for the detection of missing orinconsistent sidps.

as a result it can be seen that not only r5andr6 but alsor4 r1 andr2are inconsistent.

o verview of the approach we now describe the four main modules making up the modelwriter platform.
section iii a introduces the semantic parser i.e.
the module that converts text to description logic formulae.
section iii b explains how the hermit reasoner canbe used to detect refines conflicts and equals trace links between text fragments here sidps .
section iii cshows how alloy formalism can be customized to axioma tize trace types and semantics.
finally section iii d explains how the kodkod model finder is used to infer new trace links between sidps to detect the inconsistent sidps.
a. mapping text to description logic f ormulae the semantic parser used in modelwriter to convert text to dl formulae is described in details in .
in what follows we briefly summarize its working and some evaluation results on a set of sidps used for testing.
the modelwriter semantic processing framework combines an automatically derived lexicon a small hand written grammar a parsing algorithm to convert text to dl formulae and a generation algorithm to convert dl formulae to text.
this framework is modular and robust.
it is modular in that different lexicons or grammars may be plugged to meet therequirements of the semantic application being considered.
for instance the lexicon which relates words and concepts couldbe built using a concept extraction tool i.e.
a text mining tool that extracts concepts from text e.g.
.
and the grammar could be replaced by a grammar describing the syntax of other document styles such as cooking recipes.
it is robust in that in the presence of unknown words the parser can skip wordsand deliver a connected partial parse.
fig.
outlines our approach showing the interaction of various components.
the generation algorithm can be used to automatically synchronizedocuments with models e.g.
by generating a text verbalising the meaning of a dl constraint added to the model .
it is also used to verify the quality of the dl formules derived byparsing given a sentence s and the dl formula derived for s by the parser are the sentences s primethat can be generated from similar to s?

the lexicon maps verbs and noun phrases to grammar rules and to complex and simple concepts respectively.
fig.
showsan illustrative example with a lexical entry on the left andthe corresponding grammar unit on the right.
during generation parsing the semantic literals listed in the lexicon here use andusearg2inv are used to instantiate the variables here a2and rel in the semantic schema here l0 subset x l l2 exists a2 l l rel y .
similarly the anchor value used is used to label the terminal node marked with the anchor sign diamondmath and each coanchor is used to label the terminal node with corresponding name.
thus the strings shall and bewill be used to label the terminal nodes v1andv2 respectively.

we use a feature based lexicalised tree adjoining grammar fb ltag augmented with a unification based flat semantics.
fig.
shows an example fb ltag for the words not pipes and shall be used .
an fb ltag tree is a set of initial and auxiliary trees which have beenlexicalised using the lexicon and can be combined using eithersubstitution or adjunction.
auxiliary trees are trees such as the tree for not which contains a foot node marked with whose category here aux matches that of the root node.
initial trees are trees such as that of pipes and shall be used whose terminal nodes may be substitution nodes marked with .
substitution inserts a tree with root category cinto a substitution node of the same category.
for instance the tree for pipes may be substituted in the np y node of the shall be used tree.
adjunction inserts an auxiliary tree with foot node category cinto a tree at a node of category c.f o r instance the tree for not may be adjoined into the tree for shall be used at the aux node.

for instance given the sentence pipes shall not be used the parser will first select the grammar trees associated with pipes shall be used and not and then combines these trees using substitution and adjunction.
as shown in fig.
the semantics derived for the input sentence is then the union of the semantics of these trees modulo unification.
conversely given the flat semantics shown in the figure the generator will generate the sentence pipesshall not be used by first selecting grammar trees whose semantics subsumes the input and then combining them using substitution and operation.
the generated sentences are givenby the yield of the derived trees whose root is of category s sentence and whose semantics is exactly the input semantics.

the flat semantics representation produced by the grammar is equivalent to the description logic formula shown.
while the grammar integrates a so called flat semantics as shown in fig.
there is a direct translation from this semantics to owl functional syntax.
further details about semanticparser can be found at .github.io semanticparser b. inferring traces using dl theorem proving we use hermit theorem prover to detect inconsistencies entailment and equivalence between two sidps s1ands2.
given the dl formulae 1and 2associated by the semantic parsing process to s1ands2 we determine these relations as follows i if 1 intersectionsq 2is not satisfiable we infer a conflicts trace between s1ands2 ii if 1 unionsq 2is satisfiable we infer arequires trace between s1ands2 and iii if 1 2is satisfiable we infer an equals trace between s1ands2.
c. f ormal semantics of trace types tarski is the module of modelwriter for automated reasoning about traces based on configurable trace semantics recently described in and demonstrated in .
the tool provides an enhanced text editor to allow users to define new trace types in a restricted form of alloy to express complexconstraints among traces.
in the following we axiomatize trace semantics based on the informal definition explained in section ii using first order predicate logic fol with the signature t 1 t 2t 1 t artifact requirement specification 2 t requires refines contains equals conflicts 1 tis the set of unary predicate symbols and 2tis the set of binary predicate symbols.
for simplicity we assume that the universe only consists of the type artifact which is partitioned into disjoint subsets of requirement and specification.
from now on arepresents the set of artifacts.
the symbols and are interpreted and represent equality and membership respectively.
in the following several axiom schemas are listedto formalize traceability theory that is used in the sidp case.
reasoning about requires traces is stated as follows turnstileleft a b c a a b square b c triangle a c triangle turnstileleft a b c a a b triangle b c square a c triangle where square requires refines contains and triangle requires the following axiom schema is being used for generating conflicts traces.
turnstileleft a b c a a b square b c triangle a c triangle turnstileleft a b a a b triangle b a triangle where square requires refines contains and triangle conflicts reasoning about equals traces turnstileleft a b c a a b equals b c square a c square turnstileleft a b c a a b equals c b square c a square turnstileleft a a a a equals where square contains requires refines conflicts in the following axiom schema transitivity is used for reasoning new traces whereas anti symmetry and irreflexivity are used to check consistency.

turnstileleft a a prime b a a b square a prime b square a a prime where square contains we encode above axioms in first order relational logic using the tarski s text editor to configure the tarski module.
d. inferring trace links using model finding we employ kodkod an efficient sa t based constraint solver for fol with relational algebra and partial models for automated trace reasoning using the trace semantics that user provides.
once the user performs reasoningoperations about traces the result is reported back to the user by dashed traces as shown in fig.
.
if there exists different solutions the user can traverse them back and forth.
he can also accept the inferred traces and perform another analysis operation including inferred traces.

inferred relations based on the current snapshot iv .
e v alua tion we evaluate the semantic parsing approach of modelwriter on a dataset of sidps provided by airbus which demonstrates i that the approach is robust .
of the sidps can be parsed and ii that dl axioms assigned to full parses are likely to be correct1.
regarding inference phase since we observed that dl based reasoning is relatively faster than sa t based reasoning in the context of sidps we only focus on the tarski module to evaluate the performance ofmodelwriter approach.
table ii shows the solving results of three configurations of the formal trace specification running with alloy analyzer kodkod and z3 .
the minisat sa t solver is chosen for both alloy alloy4.
.jar and kodkod kodkod .
solvers.
from alloy to smt solver translation for these cases we employ the translation method proposed by el ghazi et.al.
and the problems are encoded in smt lib syntax which is fedinto z3 solver.
transitive closure and integer arithmetic are not used in these use cases to fairly benchmark the results with the smt solver.
in smt lib the logic is set for equalitylogic with uninterpreted functions uf .
evaluation results 1a parse for a sentence s deriving a dl formulae for s is likely to be correct if at least one of the sentences regenerated from is highly similar to the input sentence s.are obtained on a machine that runs bit debian linux operating system with gb of memory and .90ghz intel i7 3520m cpu.
solving times are indicated in milliseconds.
the best results are obtained by the direct use of kodkod api since to find satisfiable models kodkod allows us to configure lower and upper bounds for the solution spaceemploying different pre processing techniques such as slicing incremental upper bounds and unrolling transitivity constraints.
the evaluation shows that our tool is practical and beneficial in industrial settings to specify trace semantics for automatedtrace reasoning.
we plan to conduct more case studies to better evaluate the practical utility and usability of the platform.
t able ii comp arisons of several use cases for trace inferring artifacts traces inferred alloy kodkod z3 v. r ela ted work many existing works on semantic parsing describe the task of obtaining axiomatic representation of natural langauge sentences.
however they suffer from two main limitations i use of controlled languages such as attempto controlled english e.g.
and or ii inability to deduce complex axioms involving logical connectives role restrictions and other expressive features of owl e.g.
as noted in .
in contrast we work on human authored real world text airbus sidps and produce complex owl axioms involving the following dl constructs latticetop the most general concept disjunction conjunction negation role inverse universal andexistential restrictions.
moreover we extended the scope ofour application by deducing traces among the semantic parse outputs.
such traces were then used as baseline input to tarski platform which could infer additional traces propagating over the whole system.
similarly several approaches and tools have been proposed for automated trace reasoning using the trace semantics .
these approaches employ a predefined set of trace types and their corresponding semantics.
for instance goknil et al.
provide a tool for inferencing and consistencychecking of traces between requirements using a set of trace types and their formal semantics.
similarly egyed and gr nbacher propose a trace generation approach.

not allow the user to introduce new trace types and their semantics for automated reasoning.
in the development ofcomplex systems it is required to enable the adoption of various trace types and herewith automated reasoning using their semantics.
tarski module of modelwriter allows the userto interactively define new trace types with their semantics to be used in automated reasoning about traces.
vi.
c onclusion we presented an integrated platform for automatically mapping natural language text to trace types and performing further inference on those traces.
starting with the semanticparser module we showed how complex axioms could be derived to represent text coming from real world use cases.
we identified the traces among the parse outputs and fed it to the tarski tool.
the tarski tool in turn allowed usersto specify configurable trace semantics for various forms of automated trace reasoning such as inference and consistency checking.
the key characteristics of our tool are automatic identification of traces existing in text using semantic parsing allowing user to define new trace types and their semantics which can be later configured deducing new traces based on the traces which the user has already specified and identifying traces whose existence causes a contradiction.
