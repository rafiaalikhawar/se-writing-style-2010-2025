just in time jit defect prediction isanalternativetomodule leveldefectprediction thatoffersseveraladvantages.first sincecodechangesareoften smallerthanmodules e.g.
classes jitpredictionsaremadeata finer granularity which localizes the inspection process.
second while modules have a group of authors changes have only one whichmakestriagingjitpredictionseasier.finally unlikemodulelevel prediction jit models can scan changes as they are being produced which means that problems can be investigated while design decisions are still fresh in the developers minds.
despitetheadvantagesofjitdefectprediction likeallprediction models theyassumethatthepropertiesofpastevents fix inducing changes are similar to the properties of future ones.
this assumptionmaynothold thepropertiesoffix inducingchangesinone timeperiodmaybedifferentfromthoseofanotherperiod.inour paper we set out to address the following central question do the important properties of fix inducing changes remain consistent as systems evolve?

through a longitudinal case study of changes from the rapidly evolving qtandopenstack systems we find that the answer to our central question is no jit models lose a large proportion of their discriminatorypower auc and calibration brier scores one year after being trained.

these fluctuations can lead to consistent overestimates and underestimates of the future impact of the studied families of code change properties.
