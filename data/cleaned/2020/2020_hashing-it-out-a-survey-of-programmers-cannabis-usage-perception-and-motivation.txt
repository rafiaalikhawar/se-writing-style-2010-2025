it is used both medicinally and recreationally and is enmeshedin a complex and changing legal landscape.
anecdotal evidencesuggests that some software developers may use cannabis to aid some programming tasks.
at the same time anti drug policies and tests remain common in many software engineering environments sometimes leading to hiring shortages for certain jobs.
despite these connections little is actually known about the prevalence of and motivation for cannabis use while programming.
in this paper we report the results of the first large scale survey of cannabis use by programmers.
we report findings about developers including450 full timeprogrammers cannabis usage prevalence perceptions andmotivations .
for example we find that some programmers doregularlyusecannabiswhileprogramming of oursamplehastriedprogrammingwhileusingcannabis and18 currentlydosoatleastonceamonth.furthermore thiscannabis usageisprimarilymotivatedbyaperceivedenhancementtocertain software development skills such as brainstorming or getting intoaprogrammingzone ratherthan medicinal reasons suchas pain relief .

this prohibition of cannabis use in software engineering has contributed to a widely reported hiring shortage for certain us governmentprogrammingjobs .in2014 afterstruggling to meet hiring goals then director of the american federal bureau ofinvestigationjamescomeystatedthatwhilehehad tohirea greatworkforcetocompetewith...cybercriminals ...someof those kids want to smoke weed on the way to the interview a behavior counter to the fbi s current policy that prohibits anyone working for it who has used cannabis in the past three years .
despite such evidence highlighting the intersection of cannabis and programming little empirical research has been conducted on cannabis use in software development.
to our knowledge previous related publications either combine cannabis use with other illegal substances such as cocaine show data about computer scientists as a sub population in a much larger survey and or includeprogrammingonlyaspartofamuchbroadersectorsuch as engineering or business services .
these previous studies do not sufficiently investigate the intersection of cannabis and pro gramming for several reasons.

while we anticipated our finding thatpersonalprogrammingprojectswouldbethemostcommon projecttypecompletedwhileusingcannabis wehypothesizedthat the percentage using cannabis for work related projects wouldbe lower than observed.
this indicates that cannabis routinelyinteracts with professional software engineering environments underlining the potential impact of corporate drug policies and motivating future studies of cannabis in software engineering.

programmers there is a wide array of experiences and reactions a variancethatinvitesfurtherandmorein depthqualitativeanalysis.
implications as a result of these conflicting experiences our findings raise the question of whether the programming related benefitsofcannabisperceivedbysomedevelopersactuallytranslate to verifiable programming enhancement.
for example eventhough many participants report using cannabis to enhance programmingcreativity itisunclearifthisactuallyoccurs.wenote this concern was raised by some non cannabis using programmers.
forinstance onesuchprogrammerwrotethatthey hadaseries of developers work for that used cannabis to varying degrees.allofthemfullybelievedthatitmadethembetterengineers that is sparked creativity and capability.
from the outside however the results have consistently not been that way.
not just from less code productivity but far more often inability to work as well with others and codequality issues.
thus our resultsmotivate future observational study of the effects of cannabis on programming.
this motivation and considerations surrounding any such study are discussed further in section .
we found that programmers who use cannabis were more likely to be motivated by potential programming ability enhancement or programming enjoyment than wellness related reasons.

we investigate cannabis perceptions in general and programming specific con texts.
for the former we compare to national cannabis attitudessurveys.
for the latter we analyze attitude differences betweenprogramming students employees and software managers.
we then compare any differences to each group s cannabis usage.
general cannabis perceptions programmers in our sample have more positive attitudes towards cannabis than the population overall.forexample ofourparticipantssaythatmarijuanauseshouldbelegalforbothrecreationalandmedicinalusecomparedto of the general united states population in .
similarly only of our population views smoking marijuana once or twice a week to be of great risk as opposed to of the us popula tion .
this difference is likely explained by the demographic differencesinage gender andpoliticalleaningbetweenprogrammers in our sample and the population overall see section .

discussion in this paper we report that cannabis frequently interacts with programminginbotheducationalandprofessionalsoftwareengineeringcontexts.however ourworkisalsoonlyafirststeptoward understanding this intersection.
in this discussion we considerthe impacts of our findings on programming workplace cultureand policies.
we also discuss questions raised by our results andpotential directions for future work including focus groups andobservational studies.
we conclude with a broader discussion of the intersection of cannabis and software engineering in general.
cannabisuseandcompanypolicies ourfindingshaveimplications for software company anti drug policies.
while perhaps less prevalent than in other industries notably many fang facebook amazon netflix google companiesdonotdrug testemployees anti cannabis regulations remain common in programmingenvironments e.g.
p. and policiesoften enforced through drug testing of our participants reported taking a drug test for a programming job.
at the same time we found cannabis use is common among programmers with of our sample having used cannabis while programming ofwhichsometimesdosoforwork relatedtasks especiallyduringremotework .cannabis usingprogrammerstypically use thc products the chemical detected by most drug tests.
furthermore perceptions of cannabis use while programming are mostly ambivalent from both managers and employees and we observelimitedreportsofcannabisusenegativelyimpactingprogramming work places while of programming managers suspect cannabis use by a supervisee less than report that those programmerswerelessproductive andonlyonemanagerinour sample reported reprimanding an employee for cannabis use.
thus our results indicate that software company anti drug policiesmayconflictwiththepreferredpracticeofmanydevelopers adissonancethatcanleadtosmallerapplicationpoolsandhiringdifficulties for drug testing jobs as evinced by the fbi cybersecurity hiring shortage .
our results support additional study and reassessment of extant anti drug policies for programmingjobs including further contextualization on when and how oftenprogrammers currently take drug tests for programming related jobs11and if such policies are actually necessary or effective.
outstanding questions and future directions one direct question is functional does cannabis use while programming actuallyaffectcodequality andifso how?fromcreativitytoreadabilitytodefectdensity thereareanumberofpurportedeffectsofcannabis use on code.
this is particularly compelling because programming cannabis use is often motivated by the desire to enhance programmingskillssuchasbrainstormingandfocus seesection .
.observational studies in which programmers complete various software taskswithandwithoutcannabis provideonewaytoinvestigate suchquestions.
bothfunctionaloutcomes andalsomedical markers e.g.
eye tracking blood testing etc.
are relevant.
such studies are currently legally challenging in most parts of world.
however cannabis laws are increasing in leniency and in the us both cbd and thc have synthetic versions approved for medicinal use by federal regulatory boards.
finally some observational studies have beenconducted withreal worldcannabis.
forexample bidwell et al.measured impairment with state legalized cannabis comparing thc dosages using a series of cognitive tests encouraging the pursuit of similar observational studies in a software context.
other research techniques may be more immediately applicable.
qualitative studies employing interviews or focus groups could deepenunderstandingofcannabisprogrammingculture.suchstud iescouldalsohelpidentifyifandwhenanti drugpolicesimpactjob application or hiring decisions.
other directions include additional 11unfortunately wedidnotcollectdataregardingthetypesofdrugtestingexperienced by programmers e.g.
once during hiring vs. continuous spot checking data that would provide useful context.
we encourage future work to explore this gap more directly.

limitations and threats to validity otherlimitationsincludeself selectionbiasanddataqualityconcerns commonforsurveyresearchingeneralandforself reported drug research in particular .
due to interest cannabis using programmers may be more likely than non users to participate.simultaneously cannabis users may be less willing to report use duetoretaliationworries.tomitigatethesebiases wemadeitclear thatpriorcannabisusewasnotnecessary seesection andour survey was anonymous and confidential to encourage honesty.
to checkforself selectionbias wevalidatedthatkeydemographics in our sample match those of our recruitment populations see section4 .
we also note that online cannabis use surveys typically producehighqualityandinternallyconsistentdata .evenso these biases are important when interpreting our findings and may result in our findings overestimating the prevalence of cannabis use while programming.
one additionallimitation is timingduring covid our findingsmaybeinfluencedbythisperiodofprimarilyremotework.wemitigatethisthreatbyaskingaboutcannabis usebehaviorchanges resulting from the onset of covid see section .
.
we note however that while this is a potential limitation it also admits timely and useful analysis in light of our finding that remote work increases cannabis use while programming for work related tasks.
conclusion inthispaper wepresentedresultsof thefirstempiricalstudyof cannabis s prevalence perceptions and usage motivationsin programming environments .
to do so we conducted a surveyof803programmers including450full timeprofessionaldevelopers recruitedfrom open source university andsocial mediaprogramming communities.
we found that some programmers regularlyusecannabiswhileprogramming ofoursampledoso atleastonceamonth manychoosingtousecannabisforbothper sonalandwork relatedprojects.furthermore wefindthatcannabis use while programming is primarily motivated by perceived enhancementtoprogramming relatedskillsandincreasedenjoymentratherthanbymedicinalreasons.finally wefindthatprogramming employees managers andstudentsusecannabiswhileprogrammingatsimilarrates despitedifferencesincannabisperceptions and visibility.
such cannabis usage however is in conflict with anti drug policies currentlyenactedfor many softwareengineering jobs of oursamplereportedtheyhadtakena drugtestfora programmingrelatedjob ahiringpracticethatmaylimitdeveloperapplication pools.
thus our results have implications for programming workplacesthatcurrentlyhaveanti drugpoliciesandmotivatefuture research into the effects of cannabis use while programming.
