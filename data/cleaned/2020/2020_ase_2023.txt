message from the chairs ase on behalf of the entire conference organizing committee it is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 38th edition of the ieee acm international conference on automated software engineering ase in the grand duchy of luxembourg.
the ase conference series is the premier research forum for automated software engineering research and practice.
each year it brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss foundations techniques and tools for automated analysis design implementation testing and maintenance of large software systems.
ase was held from september 11th to september 15th in the european convention center luxembourg a modern convention center in luxembourg in the heart of europe.
although the conference was in person we used virtual and hybrid tools to expand the in person experience and include participants who were not able to attend in person for various reasons including delays in visa approvals.
this publication contains the proceedings of ase .
the first and the last days of the conference were allocated to workshops tutorials the doctoral forum and the new faculty symposium.
the main conference was held from september 12th to september 14th and featured three keynotes as well as technical experience new idea journal first demo industry showcase and late breaking result papers.
this year we also held a special invitation only track where prominent researchers from our community discussed how software engineering research is being impacted by recent advances in large language models.
the goal of ase is to support developers with automated solutions for the construction and evolution of modern ever more complex and critical software systems.
the conference technical program features the latest development in the area of automated software engineering including but not limited to research on applications of machine learning to automated software engineering automated program synthesis and repair mobile application development verification and validation debugging program analysis performance testing green software security quality assurance and of course different types of software tools.
ase has been supported by many organizing committee members including numerous researchers from the interdisciplinary center for security reliability and trust of the university of luxembourg.
we thank all organizing committee members for their support making the conference a success!

the program included three exceptional keynote talks julia lawall from inria france on automating software evolution in the linux kernel dan hao from peking university china on fault localization research opportunities and challenges danny tarlow from google brain canada on didact large sequence models for software development activities a new record number of submissions has been received in almost every track of ase with a total of papers submitted.
this includes papers submitted after desk rejects to the main research track papers submitted to the nier track to tool demonstrations to industry showcase and to journal first.
the research track received a record number of submissions.
three of these submissions were desk rejected due to major double anonymous and formatting violations.
the remaining submissions went through a double anonymous review process.
during this process each submission was reviewed by at least three program committee members and was intensively discussed online.
at the end of the discussion period submissions were accepted conditionally provided that the authors adequately address the reviewers comments in the revision.
overall this careful and thorough review process resulted in the final selection of papers accepted to the research track.
our sincere thanks go to arie van deursen baishakhi ray denys poshyvanyk foutse khomh jingling xue kevin moran lars grunske maleknaz nayebi michael pradel pei wang sam malek tao xie tianyi zhang who helped us facilitate the on line discussion all members of the program committee and all the authors for their hard work and contributions!

certpri certifiable prioritization for deep neuralnetworks via movement cost in feature spacehaibin zhengzhejiang university of technologyhangzhou chinahaibinzheng320 gmail.comjinyin chen zhejiang university of technologyhangzhou chinachenjinyin zjut.edu.cnhaibo jinzhejiang university of technologyhangzhou china2112003035 zjut.edu.cnabstract deep neural networks dnns have demonstratedtheir outperformance in various software systems but also exhibitmisbehavior and even result in irreversible disasters.
therefore it is crucial to identify the misbehavior of dnn based softwareand improve dnns quality.
test input prioritization is one ofthe most appealing ways to guarantee dnns quality whichprioritizes test inputs so that more bug revealing inputs can beidentified earlier with limited time and manual labeling efforts.however the existing prioritization methods are still limited fromthree aspects certifiability effectiveness and generalizability.to overcome the challenges we proposecertpri a test inputprioritization technique designed based on a movement costperspective of test inputs in dnns feature space.
certpri differsfrom previous works in three key aspects certifiable itprovides a formal robustness guarantee for the movement cost effective it leverages formally guaranteed movement costs toidentify malicious bug revealing inputs and generic it can beapplied to various tasks data models and scenarios.
extensiveevaluations across tasks i.e.

white box and black box demonstrate certpri s superior performance.for instance it significantly improves .

the code of certpri isopen sourced at terms deep neural network test input prioritization deep learning testing movement cost certifiable prioritizationi.
introductiondeep neural networks dnns have performed impres sive success in many fields including computer vision natural language processing and software engineer ing etc.
however like traditional software systems dnns are also vulnerable in terms of quality and reliabil ity .
meanwhile these vulnerabilities could lead toserious losses such as a crash caused by a google self drivingcar and even irreversible disasters such as the deadly carcrash caused by the autopilots of tesla and uber .therefore it is crucial to detect the misbehavior of dnn basedsoftware and ensure dnns quality.much effort has been put into dnn based software qualityassurance .
one of the most appealing methodsis test input prioritization which prioritizes testinputs so that more bug revealing inputs e.g.
misclassifiedinputs can be identified earlier with limited time and manual corresponding author.labeling efforts.
moreover these inputs facilitate the debug ging of dnn based software which could improve dnns quality and reduce their retraining cost .
thereare several prioritization methods mainly including four as pects i.e.
coverage based surprise based confidence based and mutation based methods.
the first two methods prioritize test inputsbased on dnns neuron coverage and surprise adequacy acti vation traces respectively.
confidence based methods identifybug revealing inputs by measuring the classifier s output prob abilities.
mutation based methods design a series of mutationoperations and then analyze the mutated output probabilitiesbased on supervised learning.
these methods make greatprogress in identifying bug revealing inputs earlier but theystill suffer from the following problems.first the existing methods are empirically lacking formalguarantees which results in vulnerability against maliciousattacks i.e.
prioritizing bug revealing inputs at the backwhen attacked.
more specifically taking neuron activationsuppression as an optimization objective the adversary couldcraft imperceptible adversarial perturbations .
thesebug revealing inputs with perturbations will be prioritized atthe back due to low neuron coverage or inadequate activationtraces i.e.
coverage based and surprise based methods losetheir effectiveness.
similarly confidence based methods fail towork when increasing the highest probability value by adding well designed perturbations to inputs.
mutation based methods include input mutation and model mutation both of which are similar to data augmentation and network modification respectively.
once themutation operations are leaked the adversary can bypass theseoperations by crafting malicious bug revealing inputs.
then mutation based methods will be invalid.
therefore a formalrobustness guarantee for certifiable prioritization is required.second almost all methods either suffer from prioritizationeffectiveness or efficiency issues.
for instance coverage basedmethods have been demonstrated to be ineffective and time costly .
surprise based methods improve test input prior itization by utilizing more advanced metrics e.g.
surprise adequacy and activation frequency but are computation ally expensive due to more parameter tuning.
confidence based methods apply output probabilities to perform fastand lightweight prioritization and their effectiveness is better12023 38th ieee acm international conference on automated software engineering ase .

than the previous two.
however once adversarial orpoisoned inputs are injected into the test dataset theireffectiveness drops largely.
mutation based test input priori tization prima is the state of the art sota methodfor dnns outperforming the confidence based methods by anaverage of but with a time cost increase of more than100 times.third most methods suffer from the generalizability issue including the generalizability of tasks data forms modelstructures and application scenarios.
for instance confidence based methods rely on dnns output probabilities and thusmay not be directly generalized to a regression task.
mean while their prioritization effectiveness for sequential dataform e.g.
text data has been demonstrated to drop byan average of in the existing study .
mutation based methods could be generalized to various data andtasks but specialized domain knowledge is required to designdiverse data specific e.g.
structured data and graphdata mutation strategies.
moreover it is unclear whethertheir model mutation strategies can still perform well onother model structures such as graph convolution network gcn .
except for confidence based methods the otherthree types are all designed for white box testing and need toacquire dnns details.thus our design goals are as follows we intend totake formal guarantee into account when designing a certi fiable prioritization method we want the certifiability toserve prioritization effectiveness without degrading efficiency we plan to evaluate its generalizability.one of the main contributions of dnns is automatic featureextraction which maps test inputs from the data spaceto the feature space.
based on the mapping ability zhenget al.
improved the robustness of dnns by pushingthe test input to the target position i.e.
class center basedon inverse perturbation.
further we find that the inverseperturbation measures the movement cost of test inputs infeature space.
thus we explore the variation in the movementcost of different test inputs and give an example as shownin figure .
we compute the movement cost i.e.
inverseperturbation based on infinite norm of test inputs fromimagenet on a pre trained vgg model .
we first dividetest inputs into groups according to the original predictionprobability and then calculate the movement cost of reaching aposition with a higher probability.
as shown in figure wefind that there was a significant difference p value .38e based on t test in the movement cost of correctly andincorrectly predicted test inputs which can be consideredfor prioritization.
however the inverse perturbation isobtained through iterative training which is still empirical.to satisfy the certifiability requirement we further derive aformal guarantee of the inverse perturbation with the lipschitzcontinuity assumption .according to the utility analysis and certifiability consider ation we design a certifiable prioritization technique certpri which reduces the problem of measuring misbehavior prob ability to the problem of measuring the movement difficulty a .

based on the formalrobustness guarantee certpri is valid for identifying maliciousbug revealing inputs as well as clean bug revealing inputs without degrading efficiency.the main contributions are as follows.
through inverse perturbation analysis and measurement we first implement a formal robustness guarantee for themovement cost which provides a new perspective formeasuring dnns misbehavior probability.
based on the formal guarantee we propose an effectiveand efficient technique certpri which leverages certifia bility to facilitate the prioritization effectiveness.
to evaluate certpri s generalizability we conduct ex tensive experiments on various tasks data models andscenarios the results of which show the superiority ofcertpri compared with previous works.
we publish certpri as a self contained open sourcetoolkit online for facilitating prioritization research.ii.
backgroundin this section we first introduce the basic knowledge ofdnns and then give the definitions of inverse perturbation.a.
deep neural networksdnn consists of several layers each of which contains alarge number of neurons .
generally the basic tasks ofdnns include classification and regression.
these tasks areaccomplished by building models with various basic struc tures such as fully connected network fcn convo lutional neural network cnn long short term memory lstm and gcn .
the classification and regressionmodels are as follows.the classification model predicts which class the test inputbelongs to.

all the notationsare summarized in table i.iii.
certprimethodologyin this section we present a technical description of certpri.first we discuss the prioritization feasibility based on a move ment cost view.
then we introduce certpri which provides aformal robustness guarantee based on the lipschitz continuityassumption and estimates the movement cost based ongevt .
finally we prioritize inputs via movement costs.a.

taking a classifier based on a fcn withthree hidden layers on mnist dataset as an example the t sne based distribution of test inputs in featurespace is visualized in figure .
during the forward propagationas shown in figure a we observe that most test inputsdirectional approach the correct class which realizes the rightprediction.
however several test inputs move without directionleading to the dnn s misbehavior i.e.
misclassification which are the bug revealing inputs that need to be identified.it is intuitively based on the feature purity theory of testinputs .
for a bug revealing test input it not only containsfeatures of multiple classes but the highest feature purity isclose to the second highest one and even the feature purityof each class is close.
thus the movement of this test inputin the forward propagation is directionless.then we further analyze the movement cost of correctlyand incorrectly predicted test inputs based on the inverseperturbation .
as shown in figure b the ground truthofx0isiibut is misclassified asiii.
asx0proceeds along thegradient direction its class center ofiiican be reached withlow movement cost.
however correctly predicted test inputsrequire high movement cost to reach their class centers.
it isconsistent with the interpretation based on feature purity .the incorrectly predicted test inputs improve the feature purityof the corresponding class after adding inverse perturbation which turns random movement into directional movement inforward propagation.
therefore only a low movement cost isrequired to reach the class center.
the correctly predicted testinputs contain high feature purity which keeps them stable infeature space.
thus further movement requires a high cost.note that the class center is given bydefinition whichdiffers for each test input .based on the above analysis we reduce the problem ofmeasuring misbehavior probability of prioritization to the3authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with ieee.

there fore we estimatemax xh x j qwith a small number ofsamples based on gevt which ensures that the maximumvalue of a random variable sequence can only follow oneof the three extreme value distributions .
the cdf of xh x j qis as follows g z e x p parenleftbig z 1 parenrightbig where1 z z xh x j q u ris a extremevalue index u rand r are the expectation andvariance.
the parametersu and determine the location scale and shape ofg z respectively.g z belongs toeither the gumbel fr echet or weibull distributions.we plot curves of probability density function pdf andits cdf for different extreme value distributions in figure where pdf denoted asg z is the differential of cdf.
theweibull distribution shows an interesting property in figure i.e.
a finite right end point denoted as 1 which limitsthe upper bound of the distribution.
therefore we adopt theweibull to describe the gradient norm distribution where theright end point is the estimation ofmax xh x q.d.
prioritization through movement costbased on the movement cost perspective in section iii a we can conclude that a test input with a small value of lshould be prioritized at the front.
therefore we compute the lvalue of each test input and then prioritize these inputsaccording to their lvalues from small to large.algorithm 1shows the details of certpri by taking the classification modelas an example.
we first establish the gradient norm distributionof a test input by randomly sampling in the hyper ball theloop from lines to .
then we estimate the location ofthe maximum gradient norm based on the weibull distributionand compute the lower bound of the movement cost basedontheorem lines and .
finally we repeat the aboveoperations for each test input the loop from lines to andprioritize them according to the ascending result of their lvalues line .
note that for algorithmic illustration we onlycompute onegmaxi j line for each iteration.
to implementthe best efficiency of gpu we usually evaluate these valuesin batches and thus a batch ofgmaxi jcan be returned.furthermore we can easily generalize certpri to a regres sion model through replacing theh x function at line withh x summationtexti fri x fri x d2based ontheorem .
besides we can extend certpri to a black box scenario based on thegradient estimation .iv.

.8317mcp and deepgini cannot directly apply to regression tasks we separately present results on both tasks.
we conduct apreliminary t test about rauc across all subjects as shown intable iv.
since deepgini and prima show significantlybetter performance than other baselines we mainly comparethe results between certpri and these two in tables v vi viiand viii.overall effectiveness.
certpri finds a better permutationof test inputs than baselines i.e.
identifying bug revealinginputs earlier which significantly improves prioritization.
forinstance in table iii all average rauc values of certpriare the highest compared with baselines for various tasks.more specifically the average rauc value of certpri is .50times and .
times that of baselines for classification andregression tasks respectively.
additionally certpri improvesthe prioritization effect by .
and .
for classifica tion and regression tasks respectively.
from table iv we cansee that the p values of all rauc metrics are small enough which demonstrates that certpri significantly outperforms allbaselines.
the outstanding performance of certpri is mainlybecause it takes formal guarantees into account when iden tifying bug revealing inputs while baselines only prioritizeempirically.
therefore certpri shows a stable overall prior itization effect without being affected by interfering factors e.g.

certprioutperforms all baselines on all six data forms in terms ofalmost all rauc values especially for unstructured dataforms i.e.
image text etc .
for instance in table v almostall rauc values of certpri are the highest except rauc all on speech and graph data forms.
we investigate theirmodel feature space and find that their decision boundariesare smoother than others which causes gradient vanishing.therefore we extend the sampling radiusr .

after radius extension certpri realizes the highestaverage rauc all improving to .
and .
for speechand graph data forms respectively.
additionally the averagerauc of certpri is .
.
times that of baselines forunstructured data forms but only .
times for structureddata.
we speculate that the gradient vanishes during backpropagation due to the sparse coding of structured data.gradient vanishing is beyond the scope of this paper but it canbe improved by batch normalization and non saturatingactivation function .effectiveness on various data types of test inputs.
certprilargely outperforms all baselines against adaptive attacks interms of all average rauc values while approaching thesota baseline i.e.

forinstance in table vi the average rauc values of cert pri against adaptive attacks range from .
to .8827with average improvements of .

this is mainly because we provide a formalguarantee of movement costs in feature space which cannot bean objective of adaptive attacks.

wespeculate that the purity assumption of deepgini is not tenablein the two training scenarios whereas certpri and primafacilitate their prioritization based on the movement cost andmutation perspectives respectively.effectiveness on various prioritization scenarios.
certprilargely outperforms all baselines in terms of all rauc valuesin both prioritization scenarios which is beneficial to iden tify bug revealing inputs in software engineering testing withprivacy requirements.

the evaluation results are shown in table ix where the time cost of prima includes input mutation model mutation and ranking model training.
here we havethe following observation.prioritization efficiency.
certpri prioritizes test inputsmore efficiently than mutation based methods and is competi tive with confidence based methods which meets the rapidityrequirements of software engineering testing.
for instance intable ix the efficiency of certpri is .

threats tovaliditythree aspects may become the threats to validity of certpri.theinternalthreat to validity mainly lies in the centerposition determination.
there are differences in movementcosts to reach different centers especially for non uniformlydistributed data in feature space.
to reduce the internal threat we customize the center position for each test input indef inition i.e.
relative center.
besides we collect a largenumber of subjects with great diversity and perform extensiveexperiments to verify certpri s utility.theexternalthreats to validity mainly lie in the non differentiable component and gradient vanishing.
to reducethese threats we further extendtheorems 1and2to a specialcase of non differentiable functions i.e.
a model with reluactivation as shown in then we leveragebatch normalization and non saturating activation to reducethe probability of gradient vanishing and enlarge the samplingradius of the hyper ball.theconstructthreats to validity mainly lie in the hyper parameters in certpri includingnb nrsbandrvalues inalgorithms .l a r g e rh y p e r p a r a m e t e rv a l u e sp r o d u c eb e t t e reffectiveness but reduce efficiency.
to reduce the threat fromthe hyperparameters we conduct a double minimum strategy.besides the norm valuep and the extreme value distribu tion type is weibull in our experiments.
in future work wecan explore prioritization results for various norm types andextreme value distributions.vii.

zhanget al.
observed the activationpattern of neurons and produced prioritization results accord ing to the activation patterns between the training set and testinputs.
maet al.
considered the interaction between testinputs and model uncertainty and determined bug revealinginputs with higher uncertainty.
these surprise based methodsimprove performance but their prioritization results are relatedto the training set quality.
furthermore zhanget al.
prioritized test inputs based on noise sensitivity analysis independent of the training set.
shenet al.
proposedmcp in which clusters test inputs into the boundary areasand specify the priority to select them evenly.
fenget al.
proposed deepgini which prioritizes test input by measuringset impurity.
these confidence based methods are effective andefficient but only for classification tasks.drawing lessons from the mutation view in software en gineering wanget al.
proposed prima which gives priority to test inputs that generate differentpredictions through diversity mutations i.e.
input level andmodel level .
prima demonstrates sota performance butcannot be applied to black box scenarios.viii.
conclusionswe propose a certifiable prioritization method for bug revealing test input identification earlier certpri to efficientlysolve the labeling cost problem in dnn testing and buildtrustworthy deep learning systems.
certpri provides a newperspective on prioritization which reduces the problem ofmeasuring misbehavior probability to the problem of measur ing the movement difficulty in feature space.
based on thisview we give formal guarantees about lower bounds lonmovement cost and compute lvalue based on gevt.
thepriority of each test input is determined in ascending orderof lvalue.
furthermore we generalize certpri in black boxscenarios by gradient estimation.
certpri is compared withbaseline on various tasks data forms data types model struc tures training and prioritization scenarios.
the results showthat certpri outperforms baselines in terms of effectiveness efficiency robustness generalizability and guidance.acknowledgementsthis research was supported by the nsfc no.
