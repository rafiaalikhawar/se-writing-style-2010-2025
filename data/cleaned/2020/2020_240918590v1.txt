although third party advertisements ads are a vital revenue source for free web services they introduce significant accessibility challenges.
leasing a website s space to ad serving technologies like doubleclick results in developers losing control over ad content accessibility.
even on highly accessible websites third party ads can undermine adherence to web content accessibility guidelines wcag .
we conduct the first of its kind large scale investigation of 430k website elements including nearly 100k ad elements to understand the accessibility of ads on websites.
we seek to understand the prevalence of inaccessible ads and their overall impact on the accessibility of websites.
our findings show that of websites experience increased accessibility violations due to ads with common violations including focus visible wcag .

popular ad serving technologies like taboola doubleclick and revcontent often serve ads that fail to comply with wcag standards.
even when ads are wcag compliant of them have alternative text in ad images that misrepresents information potentially deceiving users.
manual inspection of a sample of these misleading ads revealed that user identifiable data is collected on of websites through interactions such as hovering or pressing enter.
since users with disabilities often rely on tools like screen readers that require hover events to access website content they have no choice but to compromise their privacy in order to navigate website ads.
based on our findings we further dissect the root cause of these violations and provide design guidelines to both website developers and ad serving technologies to achieve wcag compliant ad integration.
index terms accessibility web ads privacy i. i ntroduction approximately of the global population has some form of disability and their access to the internet depends largely on website accessibility.
many of these users rely on assistive technologies like screen readers which require highly accessible websites e.g.
properly labeled images to function effectively .
the web content accessibility guidelines wcag led by the world wide web consortium w3c have driven efforts to improve website s accessibility.
as a result numerous tools and services now exist to test and enhance website accessibility .
while website s accessibility is gradually improving due to these tools the accessibility of website advertisements ads remains largely unexamined.
website ads are the driving force behind the free and open internet .
website developers integrate ads on their websites by leasing space to ad serving technologies e.g.
taboola that serve user relevant ads when a visitor accesses the site.
consequently developers give up control over the ad content served on their websites and whether it meets wcag accessibility guidelines.
problem.
including ads on a website poses several challenges in evaluating the website s accessibility.
first popular website accessibility tools like google lighthouse do not include ads in their assessments which overestimates accessibility in evaluation reports.
second due to the dynamic nature of ad content website developers cannot predict which ads will be served to users or whether those ads will adhere to wcag guidelines.
even when a website developer makes the best effort to ensure wcag compliance ads can significantly deteriorate the overall accessibility of the website.
third inaccessible website ads prevent users with disabilities from accessing a significant portion of the website.
this is especially alarming when ads pose privacy and security risks as they are more likely to lead to fraud phishing and scams.
fourth blanket ad blocking harms the free internet and causes fundamental equity issues by making ads completely unreachable.
accessible ads not only encourage a free and open internet but also equip users with disabilities with the necessary context for safe and informed interaction with ads.
prior work.
while website accessibility has been extensively studied to date no comprehensive study has examined the accessibility of website ads at a large scale leaving a significant gap in our understanding of website accessibility as a whole.
only three studies have examined digital ad accessibility focusing on small datasets of platform specific ads and solely on blind website users.
he et al.
studied only ad screens within android apps and introduced a tool for detecting accessibility violations.
similarly prior work manually examined alt text on websites and used a survey to understand screen reader users challenges with website ads .
with the prevalence of website ads and their potential safety risks the impact of website ads on accessibility remains an open yet important question.
contributions.
in this paper we conduct the first of its kind large scale in depth investigation of website ad accessibility and its impact on overall website accessibility.
we perform an automated analysis of 430k website elements with nearly 100k website ad elements on the top 5k news and media websites.

ity of websites.
we build an automated pipeline to rigorously analyze the accessibility of website elements and the ads using ibm equal access accessibility checker and state of the art ad blocker ublockorigin.
among ads that adversely impact a website s accessibility we analyze the accessibility violations in accordance with wcag guidelines.
identifying such violations provides key insights into commonly overlooked accessibility guidelines in ads and determines whether these violations are prevalent only in ads.
to inform developers about accessibility violations across different ad serving technologies we further analyze inaccessible ads with respect to the technologies serving them.
ads are historically more likely to lead to fraud phishing and scams .
even when ads are accessible we investigate whether the provided accessible information truly represents the content and intent of the ad.
we utilize opensource clip contrastive language image pretraining model to confirm whether the content of ad images aligns with the provided alternative text for accessible ads.
for instance users with visual impairments solely rely on alternate text to access website content false and misrepresented alternatives can mislead such users into involuntary interaction with ads.
the onus for addressing inaccessible and misleading ads falls on the website developer whose website is hosting such ads.
findings.
our analysis reveals that of websites have ads that frequently fail to comply with wcag guidelines.
on average we observe more accessibility violations due to ads.
we further categorize the most common wcag guideline violations found in ads to illustrate their potential impact on individuals with disabilities.
we identified different wcag guideline violations in ad elements with of these violations predominantly occurring in only ad elements.
these violations are related to missing captions missing focus order and missing page language all of which are critical in ensuring smooth navigation on a website.
our analysis also identifies the ad serving technologies responsible for the majority of these violations.
we found that of websites use one of google s ad serving technologies e.g.
doubleclick which account for over 14k violations in their ad elements.
we show that the misrepresentation of data in alternate texts compared to the actual image deceives users with visual impairments and cognitive disabilities making it difficult for them to interpret the intent of the ads.
we found that of ad images misrepresent their content and intent.

manual inspection of ads from top news websites reveals that up to of the ads collect trackable user identifiers upon onmouseover onhover and onclick events.
these events help assistive technologies identify website elements that a user with disability desires to access.
thus navigating ads can compromise the privacy of assistive technology users.
to the best of our knowledge this is the first work that investigates the accessibility violations of website ads on a large scale.
data availability our data is available at records .
ii.
m otivating example this section presents a case study showing how some ads on websites violate accessibility guidelines and affect the overall website s accessibility.
alaska s news source alaskasnewssource.com provides local news weather updates sports coverage and community events for the state of alaska.
it is ranked 14thin the top 5k in the news and media category.
in the stock chrome browser this website shows numerous ads in ad slots three at the top and one at the bottom as seen in figure a .
the top slots are served by taboola and the bottom by google ads .
website accessibility without ads.
in the first step we generate the accessibility report for alaskasnewssource.com by computing the violation count without including any ads.
we remove ads from the website to emulate the website development stage where website developers are unaware of the precise ads that will be served by the ad serving technologies.
this is a common practice employed by many website quality and accessibility checkers like google lighthouse that do not include ads in their accessibility evaluations.
we use ibm s accessibility checker chrome extension a tool usedfig.
overview of our methodology involving generating accessibility reports for each website with rwith ads and without ads rwithout ads then comparing them to isolate and analyze the accessibility violations caused by only ads rads only .
by over 20k developers mainly because it evaluates all website elements including ad elements.
to remove ads from the website we deploy the ublock origin s chrome extension which has over 700k users to block all ads on the website.
as seen in figure b all ads on alaskasnewssource.com are removed and the accessibility checker reports violations.
for example the element in listing violates the wcag .
.
link purpose guideline because it lacks descriptive link text label or an image with a text alternative.
the guideline requires that links must have a clear purpose that users can understand especially when the link is not accompanied by any other textual context.
this can be resolved by adding aria label download the alaska s news source streaming apps to this tag by developer.
a data tb link target self rel href class link text reset d block h w listing anchor tag missing descriptive text most accessibility violations can easily be addressed by the developer with simple refactoring of the website s code i.e.
html css and js .
website accessibility with ads.
next we compute accessibility report for alaskasnewssource.com by computing the violation count with ads as displayed to the user.
this setting allows us to demonstrate the increase in the violations attributed to ads on the website.
figure c shows that ads appear on the website as they did on a normal visit.
the accessibility checker reports violations showing a .
change in the violation count.
given that the only difference between the two websites is the presence of ads it is reasonable to attribute the increase in accessibility violations to the ads.
we further examine specific violations related to ads particularly concerning the ad slots taboola serves.
figure a shows violations identified by the accessibility checker across three ad slots for taboola highlighted with ared circle around their title and short description .
this violates the wcag .
.
keyboard guideline because the element cannot be interacted with using a keyboard alone.
all ad images are designed with a link role which does not include a tabbable element.
thus users who rely on keyboard navigation cannot directly access these elements.
additionally most of these ad images do not include alternate text to make them accessible for visually impaired users.
we further test the accessibility of these ads with google s chrome v ox screen reader .
v ox only announces image for taboola advertising unit on tab focus without reading the title and short description of each ad.
figure b shows how the website and ads appear to visually impaired users using screen readers leaving ads content mostly inaccessible except the two vague alternate texts.
it is difficult for a website developer to anticipate and address ad accessibility violations as these violations are non deterministic and occur after the deployment of the website.
in the case of alaskasnewssource.com ads are negatively impacting accessibility which raises the concern of whether such an effect is prevalent across all ads if yes then what kinds of violations do they cause?
and if not then does the accessible information in these ads adequately represent their content?
similarly it is useful to know which ad serving technologies are serving more inaccessible ads.
iii.
r esearch questions given the proliferation of ads on popular websites their impact on vulnerable users and the gap in developers understanding of ad accessibility we aim to answer the following research questions rq1 how do advertisements impact the accessibility guideline violations of websites?
rq2 what are the most common accessibility guideline violations found in advertisements?

iv.
m ethodology to address the research questions we designed an automated pipeline to inspect websites identify accessibility violations in each element extract violations specific to ad elements and categorize them based on wcag guidelines .
figure illustrates the overview of the process used in our empirical investigation which is completely automated and packaged into a single measurement tool.
a. websites visited we visit the top 5k news and media category websites from similarweb using a custom selenium version .
.
based automated website navigator running on google chrome version .
.
.
.
prior literature has also focused on this category of websites because they have the most ads offering the most breadth and coverage of ads.
for every website we launch our automated website navigator to first visit the website and then eventually trigger the accessibility evaluation using the ibm accessibility tool as explained in section iv c. it takes approximately seconds for a website to fully load until the onload event is fired on average and an additional five minutes to ensure all ads are loaded before applying the accessibility checks.
we use a stateless crawling process with all cookies and local browser states cleared between consecutive visits.
this approach helps ensure that the collected accessibility data accurately reflects the current state of the website without being biased by previous visits.
we visited all 5k websites in north america.
we crawl each website twice to obtain two accessibility evaluation reports for the same website report rwith ads accessibility report of the website with ads.
report rwithout ads accessibility report of the website without ads.
report rwith ads contains the accessibility report for all elements on the website including ad elements.
report rwithout ads contains the accessibility report for all elements on the website excluding ad elements.
finally we extract the report ronly ads by differencing the rwith adsviolation element wcag count overallall ad levels ada aa criterion ad2.

andrwithout ads which represents the accessibility report for the ad elements only rwith ads z website elements with ads rwithout ads z website elements without ads ronly ads z ad elements why do we need this approach to find the accessibility of ads?
to date there does not exist any tool that can identify and isolate accessibility scores for ad elements alone.
ads can only be evaluated post deployment because during the development phase ad serving technology only requires reserved space on the website.
the actual ads only appear on the website based on user client profiling and real time advertiser bidding.
we opt to evaluate these ads post deployment on the client side to understand the true accessibility impact of ads offering insights for developers and ad serving technologies.
b. blocking website advertisements to measure the website s accessibility without ads we aim to load the website without any ads in our crawler which requires removing all ads before performing accessibility evaluations.
we leverage a widely used advanced ad blocking tool called ublock origin to remove ads from a website before it completely loads in the browser.
ublock origin relies on a crowd sourced filter list which are databases of rules and patterns that identify and block resources from commonly used ad serving technologies.
almost all ad blocking tools rely on the same filter lists and therefore have more or less similar effectiveness in blocking ads.
internally when a user visits a website the ad blocker scans the page and its resources comparing urls and scriptsagainst its filter lists.
if it detects elements associated with ad serving technology it prevents these elements from being loaded on the page.
this can involve blocking requests to known ad servers hiding ad elements within the dom or preventing ad scripts from executing.
as a result the ad content is not displayed to the user resulting in an ad free website which we use to perform accessibility evaluations rwithout ads.
prior work on the effectiveness of adblocking tools has shown that ublock origin is the most effective ad blocker.
c. accessibility evaluation after the website loads we automatically perform a rigorous accessibility evaluation using the ibm equal access accessibility checker a chrome extension.
initially we use google s lighthouse commonly used for quality checks during development.
however tools like lighthouse axe and wave exclude ad elements by default leading to inaccurate measurements for sites with ads.
thus we use the ibm checker to assess accessibility for all website elements including ads.
internally ibm s accessibility checker injects a content script into the website to interact with the website s dom.
the content script scans the website s dom to identify elements and runs a series of checks based on the following predefined rules such as wcag .
.
the results are intercepted by our automated website navigator and stored in separate storage for downstream analysis.
accessibility report.
table i shows a sample accessibility evaluation report with a detailed analysis of violations including page title url html element type element code xpath wcag checkpoint and violation level.
each checkpoint corresponds to a specific wcag criterion with a description of the violation.
the wcag level indicates the priority and severity of accessibility violations categorized into three levels level a these guidelines are fundamental for all websites.
non compliance makes website content inaccessible to users with disabilities.
for example text alternatives for non text content wcag .
.
are crucial for users with visual impairments.
meeting level a criteria is a top priority.
level aa these guidelines should be met by most websites.
conformance to level aa significantly improves the accessibility of website content.
for example ensuring that text and images of text have a contrast ratio of at least .
wcag .
.
is crucial for users with visual impairments including those with color blindness.
level aaa these guidelines represent the highest website accessibility standards for full accessibility.
for example sign language interpretation for pre recorded audio wcag .

level aaa conformance is not mandatory for wcag compliance as it applies to specific content types.
note these violations require manual assessment and are excluded from this analysis .

we first generate the two accessibility reports of each website in our dataset rwith adsand rwithout ads.rwith adsrepresents the accessibility report of all the website elements including ads as illustrated in figure .rwithout adsrepresents the accessibility report of all the website elements excluding ads as illustrated in figure .
finally we automatically compare the two accessibility reports by first matching website elements based on their code and xpath location resulting in a list of website elements that are not ads and .
we exclude these elements from rwith ads which results in an accessibility report of ads only rads only as illustrated in figure .
we analyzed 430k unique html elements with accessibility violations across 5k websites of which .
are ad elements.
computing accessibility reports is time consuming and resource intensive due to the extensive checks required on the rendered page styling and html structure.
it also cannot be deployed on the cloud as certain accessibility metrics can only be measured when active display is available for ui rendering.
therefore analysis on the 5k website consumed more than cpu hours to generate accessibility reports spanning .

table ii lists the number of website elements with violations that we interacted with during this campaign.
specifically it details the ad elements with violations categorizing them by the level and criteria of violations.
v. r esults a. rq1 impact of advertisements on accessibility violations we first examine the impact of ads on the number of accessibility violations on websites.
this analysis demonstrates how third party ad content can lower a website s accessibility which has several downstream consequences such asviolation in ad elements ronly ads websites check the keyboard focus indicator is visible when using css declaration for border or outline inform the user when their input action will open a new window or otherwise change their context2 hyperlink has no link text label or image with a text alternative1 verify frame content is accessible confirm the element should be tabbable and if so it becomes visible when it has keyboard focus1 content is not within a landmark element verify there is a way to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple web pages1 confirm windows high contrast mode is supported when using css to include position or alter non decorative content1 page detected as html but does not have a lang attribute1 inline frame does not have a title attribute table iii top most prevalent violations in ad elements potentially low search rankings on google due to accessibility violations in addition to the fundamental inclusivity issues for users with disabilities.
figure presents the cumulative distribution of websites and their wcag guideline violations of ad elements ronly ads .
concretely the average violation count is .
with a median of for websites without ads rwithout ads .
for websites with ads rwith ads the average violation count increases to .
with a median of .
overall the average violation count for ad elements ronly ads is to .
.
while the magnitude of the increase in violations may not look drastic it is important to understand that a single violation directly points to an accessibility issue of a website element that makes it inaccessible for at least one type of disabled website user.
as mentioned before wcag guidelines violations in ads are more challenging to address than the violations in original website content as a developer can immediately act on violations from original website content whereas in the case of ads it is infeasible for the developer to address the violation due to user specific dynamic nature of ads.
to further understand the number of violations caused by the ads on websites we distribute websites with the number of violations caused by ads.
figure displays the distribution of websites for one or more accessibility guideline violations.
we find that nearly .
of websites have at least one accessibility violation in their ad elements ronly ads and .
of websites have an increase in violations after including ads rwithout ads rwith ads .
finding.
overall nearly of websites show at least one accessibility violation attributed to ad elements underscoring the need for further investigation into these violations.

table iii highlights the most prevalent violations we found in ads across 5k websites.
note that these ad elements with violations are rendered at runtime preventing developers from addressing them during deployment.
focus visible is one of the most common violations.
focus visible results enforce that keyboard focus indicators are visible when styling elements like links or ad elements using css.
in other words website elements currently focused on should be highlighted.
for example on the website 10news.com we identified a google ads iframe that violates this rule as depicted in figure b .
in a the website developer has correctly implemented the focus visible feature by highlighting website cards with a blue border and thus adheres to focus visible.
under wcag success criterion .

focus visible focus indicators must always be visible which benefits users with motor disabilities visual impairments including low vision cognitive disabilities and those relying on accessibility tools like screen readers.
we observe that .

for example on the website foxnews.com we identified an ad that violates this rule as shown in figure .
the red highlighted ad has associated onclick onmouseover onmousedown and onfocus events as shown in listing .
these events open a new window target blank but there is no indication in the link text or an accessible tag like aria label to inform users that a new window will be opened.
it is mandatory to inform users about changes in context to prevent disorientation.
finding.
overall we observed different types of violations with the most prevalent being focus visible and in input across various websites.
violations in ad elements ronly ads vs. non ads website elements rwithout ads this analysis highlights the accessibility violations that are specific to ad elements ronly ads but not quite prevalent in non ad elements rwithout ads .
we compare violations from over 99k ad elements and 331k non ad elements.
figure a c shows the distribution of websites with the three most commonly found violations in ad elements ronly ads which are not common in non ads website elements rwithout ads .
missing captions wcag .
.
is one of the most common accessibility violations found more in ad elements ronly ads than standard website elements rwithout ads .
this criterion requires that pre recorded and live audio content in synchronized media such as videos includes captions.
captions are essential for users who are deaf as they provide a text alternative to spoken dialogue and important audio information.
on average .
of ad elements ronly ads contain at least one instance of this violation whereas only .
of website elements rwithout ads exhibit the same violation.
in other words ad elements ronly ads are more likely to be missing captions than non ads elements rwithout ads on websites.
focus order wcag .
.
is found to be more preva lent in ad elements ronly ads than non ads website elements rwithout ads .
this criterion requires that the navigation order of interactive elements on a website is logical and intuitive ensuring users can navigate through content in a predictable manner.
proper focus order is crucial for users who rely on keyboard navigation such as individuals with motor impairments or those using assistive technologies like screen readers.
without a logical focus order users may struggle to understand the structure of the page miss important information or find it difficult to interact with the content.
on average .
of ad elements ronly ads contain at least one instance of this violation whereas only .
of website elements rwithout ads exhibit the same violation.
language of page wcag .
.
is another accessibility violation that is found more in ad elements than non ad website elements.
this criterion requires that the primary language of a website element is clearly defined in the html.
declaring the language is essential for users who rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers which use this information to provide accurate pronunciation and interpretation of the content.
without the language of the page specified users with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities may have difficulty understanding the content leading to a less accessible and non inclusive website experience.
on average .
of ad elements ronly ads contain at least one instance of this violation whereas only .
of website elements rwithout ads exhibit the same violation.
thus ad elements ronly ads are more likely to have this violation than non ad elements rwithout ads .
this significant difference points to the special ad accessibility case where website developers are not able to enforce language constraints on the ads served on their website due to the user specific and dynamic nature of websites.
finding.
overall we observed seven violations more common in ad elements ronly ads than in website elements rwithout ads missing captions incorrect focus order undefined page language insufficient text spacing hover content violations keyboard accessibility issues and focus related violations.domain company websites violations wcag description count taboola.com taboola .

d. misrepresentation of alt text in advertisements among the ads that do not lead to accessibility violation we investigate the accessible information associated with ads that a alt text foxes accused of stealing crocs sandals from campers after many pairs found at den.
b alt text distressed hotels turned into apartments for affordable housing.
fig.
misrepresentation of alt text in image tags of ads.
truly represents the intext and content of the ad.
prior work privacy implications of ads and malvertising show that clickbait and false ads can lead to scams phishing and fraud.
analyzing alternate texts of otherwise accessible ads is important because it highlights how effective alternate texts are in effectively conveying the content of ads to users with disabilities.
we start by extracting img tags with alt text from the ads html and collecting their src values which contain the image urls.
next we use the clip contrastive language image pretraining model to assess the relevance between images and their alt text.
clip encodes images and text into a shared embedding space allowing us to compute the cosine similarity between them.
we classify alt text as redundant if the cosine similarity is below .
which is the optimal threshold reported in previous research .
this approach efficiently evaluates the semantic alignment between visual and textual data.
overall across 5k websites we find ad images with alt text.
of these .
of ads have a cosine similarity score below .
indicating a low level of similarity between the text and the ad image.
for example figure a shows an image of shoes on a bench served by taboola on wsfa.com but the alt text describes foxes stealing footwear.
this alt text mimics a news headline to confuse users with a cosine similarity score of .
.
similarly figure b shows a hotel image onclickorlando.com but the alt text describes hotels turned into apartments for affordable housing.
this alt text also resembles a news headline with a cosine similarity score of .
.
the alt texts of these ads do not disclose that they are ads and not the content served by the website.
users may only realize it is an ad after performing actions like pressing enter to open the link only to be redirected to a page outside the original domain.
malicious and false ads represented as news in alt text can redirect to scam and phishing websites compromising the safety of users with disabilities who struggle to assess a website s trustworthiness.
finding.
overall of the nearly 10k ads have alt text that misrepresents ad image s content and intent.
privacy implication of misleading advertisements.
we manually inspect the consequences of interacting with these misleading ads to determine if any user identifiers are collected for invasive tracking onhover onmouseover or when the user presses enter for tabbable access on these ads.
thesethree events are key resources for assistive technologies like screen readers to collect accessible information from website elements and deliver it to users using them prior research has shown that network traffic resulting from interacting with ads may contain user identifiers in headers cookies and parameters .
these identifiers can be used to trace a user s browsing activity on the web violating their privacy.
lists maintained by ad blockers identify specific headers cookies and parameters as tracking identifiers for users.
we compare our network traffic from manually interacting with ads on the top news websites against these lists to identify any tracking of user identifiers.
our results show that on of websites at least one tracking identifier is sent to an external server by hovering and on of websites at least one tracking identifier is sent to an external server by pressing enter on the ads.
both events are essential actions that screen readers perform to read and announce website elements content.
none of the actions are necessary to access ads for regular users.
finding.
on of websites hovering sends tracking data to external servers forcing users with disabilities to compromise privacy to navigate ad content unlike regular users.

d iscussion and takeaways based on our empirical investigation we provides insights for website developers and ad serving technologies to address ad accessibility violations and highlights future research avenues for improving the website experience for users with disabilities.
accessibility promoting ad integration for website developers.
ad integration is crucial for ad driven websites.
developers must ensure high accessibility and wcag compliance which can be a regulatory requirement .
once published the developer cannot modify the website to address ad related accessibility issues since new ads may introduce different violations.
developers can ensure two key aspects to improve ad accessibility during integration.
first they can inject javascript to enforce css rules using !important to implement basic checks on wcag type a violations.
for instance a script can be added to ensure all text elements have sufficient color contrast.
such a script can be triggered ononload events to detect certain accessibility violations and address them appropriately if possible.
some type aa violations can also be addressed by injecting similar checks in the javascript such as ensuring all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
secondly developers can run accessibility checks on their websites post deployment similar to our analysis to analyze ad elements and derive specific selfcorrecting strategies to address those concerns.
accessibility strategies for ad serving technologies.
website developers integrate ads on their websites by leasing ad space to ad serving technologies.
these ad serving technologies often enroll in programs such as the acceptable adsprogram and adhere to guidelines set by the interactive advertising bureau iab .
the acceptable ads program promotes non intrusive ad formats that respect user experience requiring adherence to specific display guidelines.
the iab sets comprehensive standards for digital advertising including ad formats measurement and data privacy ensuring compliance with industry best practices.
however none of these current programs and iab standards address the accessibility of ads such as readability by screen readers or keyboard navigation.
including accessibility criteria in these guidelines would ensure that ads meet website accessibility standards.
updating iab standards to cover accessibility requirements would support assistive technologies and enhance compliance with website accessibility guidelines.
when leasing an ad slot the website developer is often provided with the option to enforce restrictions on the type of ads they want to display on their websites.
based on our findings we advocate that this ad restriction should also include an option to host only wcag complaint ads.
user side accessibility tools.
recent advancements in large language models llms can significantly benefit accessibility tools by addressing common accessibility violations automatically.
for instance when dealing with missing alt text for images llms can analyze the image s content and generate descriptive and contextually relevant alt text .
these models can provide accurate descriptions by leveraging advanced image recognition and natural language processing capabilities making the content more accessible to users with visual impairments.
however hosting large sized models in a browser extension is not feasible.
small domain specific language models are an active area of research which can advance a browser s ability to auto transform inaccessible ads into wcag complaint with minimal runtime cost.

t hreat to validity internal validity.
our analysis in section v involves collecting ad elements ronly ads by differencing website elements without ads rwithout ads from those with ads rwith ads .
however various confounding factors may influence ronly ads.
for instance some websites dynamically fetch different elements including ads on each visit.
consequently website elements loaded in rwith adsmight not appear in rwithout ads.
other factors include changes in behavior due to the environment e.g.
browser and host os visit time and location.
to minimize this threat we perform the two visits in quick succession and maintain consistent environments across different states ensuring the same location browser and stateless crawls.
external validity.
the ibm equal access accessibility checker on different browsers might produce different accessibility violations due to the browser s built in features such as safari s default blocking of certain ad serving technologies .
we conduct our experiments using the chrome browser with a chrome based extension which is the most widely used browser to minimize this threat.construct validity.
we collect the website s elements at page load time and do not capture changes in accessibility violations triggered by user interactions such as scrolling and clicking.
this is a general limitation of dynamic analysis that is challenging to overcome due to the numerous navigation and interaction scenarios on websites.

r elated work accessibility of websites and mobile applications has been extensively studied .
hackett et al.
used the internet archive s wayback machine to demonstrate that websites have become progressively less accessible as their complexity has increased.
teixeira et al.
conducted a systematic literature review focusing on website accessibility within the tourism industry.
similarly moreno et al.
proposed a method to improve website design for accessibility by addressing identified violations.
fok et al.
conducted a large scale analysis of mobile applications to investigate how inaccessible user interfaces are.
similarly milne et al.
and ross et al.
found that missing or vague labels in mobile applications hinder screen readers from conveying information to visually impaired users.
digital ads on websites and mobile applications are mainly studied for privacy invasive targeted advertising mechanisms e.g.
malicious ads spreading malware or click fraud and phishing attacks e.g.
and deceptive or manipulative content e.g.
.
however there is very limited research specifically focused on the accessibility of online ads.
he et al.
conducted an empirical study on the accessibility of mobile ads for blind users in android apps identifying significant challenges such as missing alt text for images complex gestures problematic for screen readers and ads that disrupt app functionality.
however their analysis was limited to only ad elements on mobile applications so their insights are not applicable to website ads broadly.
similarly thompson et al.
manually examined alt text for ad elements on news websites while chiou et al.
automatically detected reflow accessibility violations in website advertisements for keyboard users.
both studies are small scale and on limited accessibility violations.
to date the large scale accessibility of website ads remains a significant and unresolved question.
several tools have been developed to address accessibility issues.
twitter a11y is a browser extension designed to add alternative text to images on twitter.
zhang et al.
created a machine learning model that infers accessibility metadata from mobile app screens improving ios v oiceover functionality and enhancing accessibility for existing apps.
instafetch is a browser extension that consolidates website content into a screen reader friendly interface allowing blind users to access information across multiple pages efficiently.
while these tools may improve the accessibility of general website content it is yet to be measured if these fully address the accessibility violation caused by the ads.ix.
c onclusion website ads are an integral part of a website and are essential for supporting free internet however they often fail to meet basic accessibility standards.
this paper presents the first extensive study on the accessibility issues of website ads.
our research reveals that of websites show a noticeable increase in accessibility violations due to ads.
we also discovered that popular ad serving technologies do not adhere to the wcag guidelines when displaying ads and nearly one quarter of ads that do comply with wcag guidelines have misleading alt text.
our findings provide insight into the challenges faced by website developers in integrating ads while maintaining accessibility.
this research suggests ways for developers to enforce accessibility standards to lessen the impact of ads on overall website s accessibility.
