as companies may not have the resources to address these goals by increasing team size organizations must look to improving the productivity of those involved in producing the software.
a desire to improve software development productivity is not new boehm wrote eloquently about the need for improved software productivity in the late 1980s .

recognizing thesignificantimpactindividualshaveontheproductivityofasoftwaredevelopmentorganization recentresearchhasplacedmore emphasis on the individuals involved in the development process andinparticular onhowtheyviewtheirownproductivity .
recent research also suggests that the measurement of productivityneedstoincludemultipledimensionsofindividualmetrics including such aspects as satisfaction activity and flow .
however individuals do not work alone on a software development project.
software development teams comprising multiple individuals areattheheartofmostcomplexsoftwaredevelopment projects.
individuals constantly must make trade offs to balance makingprogressontheirindividualworkversushelpingateammate e.g.

despite the necessary and central role of teams in software development surprisingly few studies focus on team softwaredevelopmentproductivity andthosethatdo studyasnapshot of development.
for instance lakhanpa et al.
using a one time survey found team cohesion to be the dominating factor wheninvestigating team performance .
these studies leave open manyquestionsabouttheinterplaybetweenindividualandteam productivity.
we focus our analysis on the following rq1 what is the relationship between perceived team and individual productivity in software teams?
rq2 whichteamfactorsaffectindividualandteamproductivity perceptions?
to investigate these questions we undertook a three month multi modal study in which we collected daily self reports from25 software developers within five companies in north america andeurope.thesesurveys collectedonadailyandbi hourlybasis asked participants to report their individual and team productivity andtoreflectonavarietyoffactorswhichaffectedtheirproductivity that day such as team interactions time spent in meetings and the amount of unplanned work they had done.

related work traditionally productivity is defined as the ratio of outputs over inputs whereoutputisvalueproducedandinputistimeorother costs invested .
while this definition can work well in some contexts like manufacturing it is not easily applied to software development as outputs and inputs tend to be difficult to quantify.
we consider how our work builds on and compares to quantifying software development productivity as well as individual developer andteamproductivity.asourstudywasconductedduringcovid19 which provides a unique work situation we also consider how our study compares to other efforts to study software development during covid .

we focus primarily on the team aspect of software development though the collected data also corroborates many earlier findings on individual productivity such as the positive effects of having clear goals or the negative effects of frequent context switches.
.
the fluid notion of teams inthethreemonthlyinterviews weaskedparticipantshowthey define their team and whether this team has changed since the start of the study.
we found that the concept of team is more fluid than we initially expected.

gauging team productivity by individuals howdo developersgaugethe productivityoftheir team?various themes were identified in the final interviews regarding team productivity including that assessing team productivity is difficulteven when activity metrics are available.
as a result developers use several proxies to gauge team productivity.
assessingteamproductivityisdifficult especiallyduetolimited team awareness.
many participants explicitly stated that it was difficultforthem toassesstheproductivityof theirteam inlarge partbecauseofalackofawarenessofwhattheirteamwasworking on.almosthalfofthecodedparticipants mentionedat leastoncethattheyhavenoawarenessabouttheirteam regardless of them being an individual contributor or a team manager.
commenti just have no means or mechanism to easily determine how much work they ve done s25 commenti don t have insight into my team s daily productivity s12 the prevalence of remote work contributed strongly to this lack ofawarenessandthusthedifficultyingaugingteamproductivity.
from the developers coded only one participant worked mostly in the office four experienced remote and office work during the study period and the other worked remotely most ofthetime.allsurveyresponsesforwhichparticipantsreported having no awareness of their team stem from days on which the participants worked remotely.

theimportanceofteamawarenessingaugingteamproductivity further manifests in participants often referring to their team interactionswhenexplainingtheirteam sproductivityinthedaily survey.
more than half of the coded participants explicitlymentionedtheengagementwiththeirteamintheseanswers talkingaboutthemeetings moregeneralinteractionswith teammates or working together .

onefactor that was mentioned several times as an indicator for the team s productivity is the availability and responsiveness of teammates.
the more responsive teammates were the more productive the team was perceived.
for instance several participants explicitly mentionedtheresponsivenessoftheirteammatesinchatapplications or on code review discussions as an explanation for a high or low productivity rating .
commentmy team was responsive when i needed them to be s24 commenteveryone i worked with was fairly responsive and we accomplished a lot together s24 afewparticipantsalsorelatedtheresponsivenessofteammatesnot justtotheirteamproductivity butalsototheirownproductivity when the lack of responsiveness might block them .
comment abletocommunicatetodifferentdepartmentsinatimely manner so i was not blocked on my work s5 automated metrics sparsely used.
all participating teams used issuetrackers versioncontrolsystems andothertoolsthatprovide metrics on team performance.
yet only a few participants referred to automatically collected metrics such as issue tracker activityorcodereviewprogress fortheirteamproductivityratings.
commenti didn t see many tickets moving forward on the kanban board and didn t get any request for peer review of code either so it looks like the team did not feel very productive s1 on the contrary some participants referred to a feeling of how productivetheirteamwasratherthanconcretemetricsthatthey used to gauge team productivity .
commenti was not able to have a feeling about the output of the team today s16 commentin the morning i heard that many things were already done.
in the afternoon i did not hear that much anymore so it s more a stomach feeling s23 oneteamevenexplicitlystatedatthebeginningofthestudythat the progress tracked in their issue tracker is not being used for assessing their team s productivity due to the variance in task complexity and size.
individual productivity as a base.
to gauge the team s productivity participants also used the perception of their own productivity as a basis and assumed that the team s productivity was similar .
commenti tend to assume my team is as productive as i am s10 based on their perception of their own productivity and how they thought their activities differ from a usual day participants adjustedtheteam sproductivity.forinstance whenaparticipantwas more distracted had more meetings than usual or more context switches they rate their team s productivity higher than their own productivity.

gauging individual productivity in teams howisindividualproductivityassessedinateamcontext?wewere curious to know whether developers are assessed in their teams in the way they perceive they are.
to explore this question we posed the following assessment questions 106an exploratory study of productivity perceptions in software teams icse may pittsburgh pa usa for individual contributors asked in the follow up survey in a few words what would you say are the criteria your manager uses to assess your productivity?
formanagers askedintheinterviewandthefollow upsurvey what criteria do you use to assess the productivity of your team?
expectations from individuals differ from the ones of managers.
participating individual contributors expect managers to predominantlyassessthembytakingintoaccountamoretraditionalproductivity notion based on input and output metrics such as commenthow long i am spending on my tasks s24 commentunits of work completed per unit of time s7 commentprojects completed s25 twoparticipantsfurtherexpectedthemanagertoactivelytakeinto account feedback or reviews from their team members s2 s9 .

the responses of individual contributors suggest an interpretation of how does my manager know i am being productive?

we also included a variable on time spent on unplanned work since we hypothesized that such work mostly stems from team issues in the collaborative setting of software development.
the answers in the daily survey on the nature of the unplanned work further confirmed our hypothesis.

though meetings were often mentioned as a factor affecting productivity in the qualitative data see below we did not see a significant effect in the model.
this may be because meetings both drive progress forward while concurrently fragmenting the workday and hindering focus.

measuring productivity gauging team productivity how to measure productivity for individual software developers and software development teams remains a subject of inquiry and debate.
within the last year some have advocated for multidimensionalapproaches toassessing individualproductivity whereasothersbelieve teamproductivitycanbemeasuredatan organizational scale with simple holistic observations any serious failings in individual productivity can be discovered by means of good organizational habits .
our results indicate how tricky it is to measure assess or gauge team productivity whetherasaprojectionofindividualproductivityorthroughdirect measurementapproaches.thefluidityofteamsthatexistinsoftwaredevelopmenttodaywouldneedtobeincorporatedintoany assessment approaches.
it may be that it is more important from an organizational level to consider how software is actually being produced ratherthanhowtheorganizationalchartindicatesthe softwareisbeingproduced.thiskindofshiftisoccurringinsoftware development as organizations begin focusing on the streams of value being produced .
effects of team factors an avenue for future work would be to investigate how team characteristics e.g.size workflow orroles manager contributor affect productivity perceptions.
in this work we chose not to perform a broad analysis of many teams favoring instead to conduct an in depth longitudinal case study of a few teams to examine how teamandindividualproductivityrelateovertime.afuturestudy could engage a wider sample of teams that vary systematically on certain characteristics to investigate these questions.
.
enhancing productivity our results suggest possible changes to tools and processes that may help enhance productivity in software development.
these improvements relate either to team awareness or to engagement.
improving team awareness the results of our study suggest that developers often lack awareness of their team s work and progress corroborating previous findings .giventhatourstudywasconductedduringtheunprecedented remote work situation of the covid pandemic this lack of awareness may have been more pronounced as team members did not often have the chance to meet in person.
our participants used a number of digital collaboration tools for example microsoftteams slack andzoomforcommunication screenfor para programming and atlassian jira and other digital scrum and kanbanboardsforprogresstracking.thoughthecommunication tools help to gauge presence and progress trackers help to provide quantitative metrics these tools only give a surface level measure of productivity and the process of combining these data can be tedious.thereisaneedforimprovingawarenessbybettercommunication and collaboration tool design.

threats to validity external validity asoursamplesetfeaturedonlyfiveteams generalizabilitytoother development companies and developers might be limited.
these companies were recruited through word of mouth social media and other personal and professional contacts and may therefore exhibit a sampling bias.
we tried to mitigate this bias by recruiting teamsoffourcompanieswithdifferentproductfocuses innorth america and europe.
furthermore our sample set does not exhibit an equal gender balance.
in recruiting participants our primary aim was to include full teams as many members from a team as possible andwethereforedidnotoptimizefordemographicrepresentation.

we present a methodology for undertakingalongitudinalstudyofsoftwareteams findingsaboutdeveloper perceptions of their team s productivity and a replication package with the study material and anonymized quantitative data.
we saw several themes emerge from the daily survey responses collected from developers in teams.
the findings suggest that developers operate in a fluid team construct with fuzzy frequently changingboundaries.furthermore developersoftenlackawareness of their team s productivity.
finally the most significant predictor of perceived team productivity was the reported individual productivity above factors such as team interaction unplanned work and timespentinmeetings.wesuggestthatfutureresearchshouldfurther explore theintricacies of developmentin a broader spectrum of collaboration e.g.
as an individual between collaborators in teams and on the organizational level and to consider what the fluidityanddynamismofthesecollaborativestructuresmeanfor the success of software projects.
