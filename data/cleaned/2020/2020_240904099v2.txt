however misaligned trust skepticism and usability concerns can impede the adoption of such tools.
research also indicates that ai can be exclusionary failing to support diverse users adequately.
one such aspect of diversity is cognitive diversity variations in users cognitive styles that leads to divergence in perspectives and interaction styles.
when an individual s cognitive style is unsupported it creates barriers to technology adoption.
therefore to understand how to effectively integrate genai tools into software development it is first important to model what factors affect developers trust and intentions to adopt genai tools in practice?
we developed a theoretically grounded statistical model to identify factors that influence developers trust in genai tools and examine the relationship between developers trust cognitive styles and their intentions to use these tools in their work.
we surveyed software developers n at two major global tech organizations github inc. and microsoft and employed partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem to evaluate our model.
our findings reveal that genai s system output quality functional value and goal maintenance significantly influence developers trust in these tools.
furthermore developers trust and cognitive styles influence their intentions to use these tools in their work.
we offer practical suggestions for designing genai tools for effective use and inclusive user experience.
index terms generative ai llm software engineering trust cognitive styles behavioral intentions pls sem i. i ntroduction generative ai genai tools e.g.
chatgpt copilot are being increasingly used in software development .
these tools promise enhanced productivity and are transforming how developers code and innovate .
however this push for adoption is marked with ai hype and skepticism as well as interaction challenges .
trust has long been recognized as a critical design requirement of ai tools .
miscalibrated levels of trust over or under trust can lead developers to overlook errors and risks introduced by ai or deter them from using these tools .
prior research has identified various factors that foster developers trust in genai tools .
for instance interaction factors such as setting appropriate expectations and validating ai suggestions along with community factors like shared experiences and community support are relevant in building trust.
recently john son et al.
introduced the picse framework through a qualitative investigation with software developers outlining key components that influence the formation and evolution of trust in software tools see sec.
ii a .
what is missing however is an empirically grounded theoretical understanding of how the multitude of factors associate with developers trust in genai tools.
therefore it becomes important to answer rq1 what factors predict developers trust in genai tools?
understanding the significance and strength of these associations is needed to inform the design and adoption of genai tools in software development.
another important concern in industry wide integration of ai tools is that software design can be exclusionary in different ways often failing to support diverse users .
while a substantial body of work exists on modeling users technology acceptance these studies do not consider the inclusivity of the software design.
one often overlooked aspect of inclusivity is supporting cognitive diversity variations in individuals cognitive styles which fosters divergence in perspectives and thoughts see sec.
ii b .
numerous studies have shown that when technology is misaligned with users diverse cognitive styles it creates additional barriers for those whose styles are unsupported forcing them to exert additional cognitive effort .
thus it is essential to understand how developers cognitive styles influence their intention to adopt genai tools and how trust contributes to this multi faceted decision.
therefore we investigate rq2 how are developers trust and cognitive styles associated with their intentions to use genai tools?
we answer these research questions by establishing a theoretical model grounded in prior literature for trust and behavioral intentions toward genai tools.
we evaluated this model using partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem with survey data from developers n at two global tech organizations github inc. and microsoft .
our theoretical model figure empirically shows that genai s system output quality presentation adherence to safe and secure practices performance and output quality in relation to work style practices functional value educational value and practical benefits and goal maintenance alignment between developers immediate objectives and genai s actions are positively associated with developers trust in thesearxiv .04099v2 dec 2024tools.
furthermore developers trust and cognitive styles intrinsic motivations behind using technology computer selfefficacy within peer groups and attitudes towards risk are associated with their intentions to use these tools which in turn correlates with their reported genai usage in work.
the main contributions of this paper are twofold an empirically grounded theoretical model for developers trust and behavioral intentions towards genai tools extending our understanding of ai adoption dynamics in software development and a psychometrically validated instrument for capturing trust related factors in the context of human genai interactions that can be leveraged in future work.

b ackground a. trust in ai trust in ai is commonly defined as the attitude that an agent will help achieve an individual s goals in a situation characterized by uncertainty and vulnerability .
trust is subjective and thus a psychological construct that is not directly observable and should be distinguished from observable measures such as reliance .
trust involves users attributing intent and anthropomorphism to the ai leading to feelings of betrayal when trust is violated.
despite ai systems being inanimate users often anthropomorphize them thereby shifting from reliance to trust in ai systems.
unobservable psychological constructs are commonly measured through validated self reported scales instruments using questions designed to capture the construct of interest.
in this paper we measure developers trust in genai tools using the validated trust in e xplainable ai txai instrument .
txai has been derived from existing trust scales and its psychometric quality has been validated .
researchers frequently advocate using the txai instrument for measuring trust in ai .
factors affecting trust prior research has extensively examined factors influencing human trust in automation .
however these preliminary insights do not necessarily transfer to human ai interactions because of the nuances in how users form trust in ai tools alongside the inherent uncertainty and variability associated with these systems.
additionally the context in which ai is applied in our case software development influences how trust is developed and its contributing factors .
relevant to our domain johnson et al.
interviewed software engineers to outline factors that engineers consider when establishing and re building trust in tools through the picse framework personal internal external and social factors interaction aspects of engagement with a tool control over the tool system properties of the tool and expectations with the tool .
since picse is developed for software engineering se we use it to design our survey instrument to identify factors influencing developers trust in genai tools.
however the picse framework was qualitatively developed and the psychometric quality reliability and validity of a survey based on it has not yet been assessed.our work builds upon picse to contribute a a validated instrument for capturing different factors that developers consider when forming trust in genai tools sec.
iii b through a psychometric analysis of the picse framework and b assesses the significance and strength of these factors association with trust in genai tools sec.
iv .
b. users cognitive styles ai can be exclusionary in different ways often failing to support all users as it should .
e.g.
weisz et al.
found that some but not all participants could produce high quality code with ai assistance and the differences were linked to varying participant interactions with ai.
user experience in human ai interaction hai ux can be improved by supporting diverse cognitive styles which refer to the ways users perceive process and interact with information and technology as well as their approach to problem solving .
while no particular style is inherently better or worse if a tool insufficiently supports or is misaligned with users cognitive styles they pay an additional cognitive tax to use it creating barriers to usability .
here we scope developers diverse cognitive styles to the five cognitive styles in the gendermag inclusive design method .
gendermag s cognitive styles facets are users diverse attitudes towards risk computer self efficacy within their peer group motivations to use the technology information processing style and learning style for new technology.
each facet represents a spectrum.
for example risk averse individuals one endpoint of the attitude towards risk spectrum hesitate to try new technology or features whereas risktolerant ones the other end are inclined to try unproven technology that may require additional cognitive effort or time.
gendermag s cognitive styles are well suited as they have been a repeatedly shown to align with users interactions with technology both in the context of se and hai interactions and b distilled from an extensive list of applicable cognitive style types intended for actionable use by practitioners.
we used the validated gendermag facet survey instrument in our study.
c. behavioral intention and usage behavioral intention refers to the extent to which a person has made conscious plans to undertake a specific future activity .
technology acceptance models such as tam and utaut identify behavioral intention as a key indicator of actual technology usage .
understanding users behavioral intentions is useful for predicting technology adoption and guiding future design strategies .
while there is an extensive body of work modeling users behavioral intentions towards software tools these studies primarily focus on socio technical factors driving adoption.
our work contributes to this line of research by examining the role of developers trust and cognitive styles in shaping their intentions to use genai tools sec.
iii c and iv thereby extending the understanding of ai adoption dynamics in se.
we used components of the utaut model to capture developers behavioral intentions and usage of genai tools.iii.
m ethod to address our rqs we surveyed software developers from two major global tech organizations github inc. and microsoft.
we leveraged existing theoretical frameworks and instruments to design our data collection instrument see sec.
ii .
while using existing theoretical frameworks is a first step in developing questionnaires conducting a psychometric quality assessment is essential to ensure its subsequent reliability and validity .
as there was no validated instrument to measure the constructs of the picse framework our chosen trust framework we performed its psychometric assessment sec.
iii b .
this assessment helped us define a theoretical model of factors developers consider when forming trust in genai tools which we then evaluated using partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem to answer rq1.
to answer rq2 we assessed the relationships between developers trust and cognitive styles with their intentions to use genai tools.
next we discuss each step.
a. survey design and data collection survey design we defined the measurement model based on the theoretical frameworks discussed in sec.
ii to guide our survey design table i .
four researchers with experience in survey studies and github s research team co designed the survey over a four month period oct to jan .
we adapted existing validated instruments in designing the survey questions table i .
the questions were contextualized for the target population and pragmatic decisions were made to limit the survey length.
the complete questionnaire is available in the supplemental material .
table i measurement model constructs and instruments construct instrument trust txai instrument factors affecting trust picse framework users cognitive styles gendermag facet survey behavioral intention usage utaut model we used the item txai scale instead of the item scale to reduce participant fatigue.
picse does not have a validated questionnaire in .
after the irb approved informed consent participants responded to closed questions about their familiarity with genai technology and their attitudes and intentions towards using genai tools in work.
all closed questions utilized a 5point likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree with a neutral option.
these questions also included a 6thoption i m not sure for participants who either preferred not to or did not know how to respond to a question.
this differs from being neutral acknowledging the difference between ignorance and indifference .
demographic questions covered gender continent of residence years of software engineering se experience and primary se responsibilities at work.
we did not collect data on country of residence or specific job roles work contexts to maintain participant anonymity as per github and microsoft s guidelines.
an open ended question for additional comments was included at the end of the survey.table ii respondent demographics n attribute n percentage gender man .

the survey took between minutes to complete.
attention checks were included to ensure the quality of the survey data.
to reduce response bias we randomized the order of questions within their respective blocks each construct in table i .
we piloted the questionnaire with collaborators at github to refine its clarity and phrasing.
distribution github and microsoft administered the online questionnaire using their internal survey tools.
the survey was distributed to team leads who were asked to cascade it to their team members.
this approach was chosen over using mailing lists to ensure a broader reach .
the survey was available for one month feb mar and while participation was optional it was encouraged.
responses we received a total of responses from microsoft and from github.
we removed patterned responses n outliers 1year se experience n and those that failed attention checks n .
further we excluded respondents who discontinued the survey without answering all the close ended questions n .
we considered i m not sure responses as missing data points.
as in prior work we did not impute data points due to the unproven efficacy of imputation methods within sem group contexts .
after filtration we retained valid responses microsoft github from developers across six continents representing a wide distribution of se experience.
most respondents were from north america .
and europe .
and most identified as men .
aligning with distributions reported in previous studies with software engineers .
table ii summarizes the respondent demographics.b.
psychometric analysis of picse framework psychometric quality refers to the objectivity reliability and validity of an instrument.
we primarily used validated instruments in designing the survey.
however since picse was not validated we conducted a psychometric analysis to empirically refine its factor groupings which were then evaluated for their association with trust sec.
iv .
table iii presents the factors evaluated in our survey.
we performed the analysis using the jasp tool adhering to established psychometric procedures as detailed below confirmatory factor analysis cfa original grouping cfa is a statistical technique that examines intercorrelations between items and proposed factors to test whether a set of observed variables align with a pre determined factor structure .
we assessed whether the picse items align with their original five factor structure personal interaction control system and expectations .

we employed robust maximum likelihood estimator mle 1since the data did not meet multivariate normality assumptions confirmed using mardia s test see supplemental .
as shown in table v results from the original five factor structure did not indicate a good model fit based on rmsea srmr cfi and tli.
this was not entirely unexpected given picse s conceptual nature .
therefore to identify a more appropriate model of factors we proceeded with an exploratory factor analysis efa uncovering alternative groupings that might better fit the data.

exploratory factor analysis efa unlike cfa which relies on an existing a priori expectation of factor structures efa identifies the suitable number of latent constructs factors and underlying factor structures without imposing a preconceived model .
given the violation of multivariate normality we used principal axis factoring considering factors with eigenvalues as recommended for efa .

and as they did not load onto any of the factors they were excluded from the final model.
items in factor p1 p2 c1 also had low communality values and were likewise dismissed.
based on these results we concluded that a four factor solution was the most appropriate dropping factor due to its low variance explanation high correlations with other factors and low communality.

the reliability and validity assessments further support the robustness of these constructs see sec.

we still report the values for completeness.
c. model development as discussed in the previous section we refined the factor groupings within the picse framework.
in this study we are not proposing fundamentally different relationships to trust beyond those identified in the picse framework.
instead we have constrained our focus to only those factors that were psychometrically validated.
next we detail the hypotheses embedded in our theoretical model for each research question.
rq1 factors associated with trust system output quality encompasses genai tools presentation adherence to safe and secure practices including privacy and security implications of using genai and its performance and output quality consistency and correctness in relation to the development style or work environment in which it is utilized s2 s5 e3 .
developers often place trust in ai based on its performance and output quality accuracy and consistency which serve as proxies for the system s perceived credibility .
prior work evidenced that developers are often wary about the security and privacy implications of using ai tools in their work which influences the level of trust they place in these tools.
drawing upon these insights we hypothesize h1 system output quality of genai is positively associated with developers trust in these tools.
functional value of a tool refers to the practical benefits and utility it offers users in their work .
in our context genai s functional value encompasses its educational value and clear advantages relative to work performance i3 p3 .
prior work highlights that developers expectations of clear advantages from using ai tools e.g.
increased productivity improved code quality contribute to their trust in using these tools .
further ai s ability to support learning fosters trust in these tools .
based on these we posit h2 functional value of genai is positively associated with developers trust in these tools.
ease of use associated with genai tools includes the extent to which developers can easily use and integrate genai intotheir current workflow s1 c2 .
prior research highlights that a tool s ease of use and compatibility with existing workflows contribute to users trust.
following this we hypothesize h3 genai s ease of use is positively associated with developers trust in these tools.
goal maintenance is related to the degree to which genai s actions and responses align with the developer s ongoing goals e4 .
by its very nature goals can vary depending on the task and context .
therefore aligning ai behavior with an individual s immediate goals is crucial in humanai collaboration scenarios .
in terms of human cognition this congruence is important for maintaining cognitive flow and reducing cognitive load which in turn fosters trust in systems .
consequently we propose h4 goal maintenance is positively associated with developers trust in genai tools.
rq2 factors associated with behavioral intentions trust is a key factor in explaining resistance toward automated systems and plays an important role in technology adoption .
multiple studies have correlated an individual s trust in technology with their intention to use it .
in our context we thus posit h5 trust is positively associated with intentions to use genai tools.
in the context of gendermag s cognitive styles motivations behind why someone uses technology technophilic or task focused not only influences their intention to use it but also affects how they engage with its features and functionalities .
naturally individuals motivated by their interest and enjoyment in using and exploring the technology opposite end of the spectrum from those motivated by task completion are early adopters of new technology .
based on this we posit h6 motivation to use technology for its own sake is positively associated with intentions to use genai tools.
computer self efficacy refers to an individual s belief in their ability to engage with and use new technologies to succeed in tasks .
it shapes how individuals apply cognitive strategies and the effort and persistence they invest in using new technologies thereby influencing their intention to use them .
in line with this we propose h7 computer self efficacy is positively associated with intentions to use genai tools.
attitude towards risk encompasses an individual s inclination to take risks in uncertain outcomes .
this cognitive facet influences decision making processes particularly in contexts involving new or unfamiliar technology .
risk tolerant individuals one end of the spectrum are more inclined to experiment with unproven technology than riskaverse ones the other end and show higher intentions to use new tools .
thus we posit h8 risk tolerance is positively associated with intentions to use genai tools.
information processing style influences how individuals interact with technology when problem solving some gather information comprehensively to develop a detailed plan before acting others gather information selectively acting on initial promising pieces and acquiring more as needed .
genaisystems by their very interaction paradigm inherently support the latter by providing immediate responses to queries allowing users to act quickly on the information received and gather additional details incrementally.
accordingly we posit h9 selective information processing style is positively associated with intentions to use genai tools.
learning style for technology by process vs. by tinkering refers to how an individual approaches problem solving and how they structure their approach to a new technology .
some prefer to learn through an organized step by step process while others prefer to tinker around exploring and experimenting with new technology or its features .
prior work indicates that software more often than not is designed to support and encourage tinkering making individuals who prefer this approach more inclined to adopt and use new tools .
thus we propose h10 tinkering style is positively associated with intentions to use genai tools.
behavioral intention.
successful technology adoption hinges on users intention to use it translating into future usage.
prior work has consistently shown these factors to be positively correlated suggesting that users who intend to use technology are more likely to do so.
accordingly we hypothesize h11 behavioral intention to use genai tools is positively associated with the usage of these tools.
d. data analysis we used partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem to test our theoretical model.
pls sem is a second generation multivariate data analysis technique that has gained traction in empirical se studies investigating complex phenomena .
it allows for simultaneous analysis of relationships among constructs measured by one or more indicators and addresses multiple interconnected research queries in one comprehensive analysis.
it is particularly suited for exploratory studies due to its flexibility in handling model complexity while accounting for measurement errors in latent variables .
importantly pls sem does not require data to meet distributional assumptions.
instead it uses a bootstrapping approach to determine the statistical significance of path coefficients i.e.
relationships between constructs .
the pls path model is estimated for a large number of random subsamples usually generating a bootstrap distribution which is then used to make statistical inferences .
we used the smartpls v4.
.
software for pls sem analyses which comprised two main steps each involving specific tests and procedures.
first we evaluated the measurement model empirically assessing the relationships between the latent constructs and their indicators sec.

next we evaluated the theoretical or structural model sec.

we performed anf test with multiple linear regression setting a medium effect size .

the maximum number of predictors in our model is seven six theoretical constructs and one control variable tobehavioral intention see fig.

.
a. measurement model evaluation our model evaluates several theoretical constructs that are not directly observable e.g.
trust behavioral intention .
these constructs are modeled as latent variables each measured by a set of indicators or manifest variables see fig.
.
the first step in evaluating a structural equation model is to ensure the soundness of the measurement of these latent variables a process referred to as evaluating the measurement model .
we performed a series of tests to validate the measurement model detailed as follows table vi internal consistency reliability and convergent validity cronbach s cr a cr c ave system output quality .

cronbach s tends to underestimate reliability whereas composite reliability cr c tends to overestimate it.
the true reliability typically lies between these two estimates and is effectively captured by cr a .
convergent validity examines how a measure correlates with alternate measures of the same construct focusing on the correlations between indicators questions and their corresponding construct.
this evaluation assesses whether respondents interpret the questions as intended by the question designers .
our theoretical model comprises latent constructs that are reflectively measured meaning the changes in the construct should be reflected in changes in the indicators .
consequently these indicators should exhibit a significant proportion of shared variance by converging on their respective constructs .
we assessed convergent validity using average variance extracted a ve and indicator reliability through outer loadings .
a ve represents a construct s communality indicating the shared variance among its indicators and should exceed .
.
a ve values for all latent constructs in our model surpassed this threshold see table vi .
regarding outer loadings values above .

are sufficient for exploratory studies .
we removed variables that did not sufficiently reflect changes in the latent construct se3 from computer self efficacy and ip3 from selective information processing .2thus all indicators in our model exceeded the threshold ranging between .
and .
see fig.
.
internal consistency reliability seeks to confirm that the indicators are consistent with one another and that they consistently and reliably measure the same construct.
to assess this we performed both cronbach s and composite reliability cr a c tests .
the desirable range for these values is between .
and .
.
as presented in table vi all values corresponding to our model constructs fall within the acceptable range confirming that the constructs and their indicators meet the reliability criteria.
discriminant validity assesses the distinctiveness of each construct in relation to the others.
our model includes latent variables table vi .
a primary method for assessing discriminant validity is the heterotrait monotrait htmt ratio of correlations .
discriminant validity may be considered problematic if the htmt ratio .
with a more conservative cut off at .
.
in our case the htmt ratios between the latent constructs ranged from .
to .
all below the threshold.
we report the htmt ratios in the supplemental along with the cross loadings of the indicators and the fornell larcker criterion values for the sake of completeness.
collinearity assessment is conducted to evaluate the correlation between predictor variables ensuring they are independent to avoid potential bias in the model path estimations.
we assessed collinearity using the variance inflation factor vif .
in our model all vif values are below .
well below the accepted cut off value of .
2after removing se3 and ip3 the a ve values for computer self efficacy now with indicators and selective information processing now with indicators increased from .
to .
and .
to .
respectively.b.
structural model evaluation after confirming the constructs reliability and validity we assess the structural model graphically represented in fig.
.
this evaluation involves validating the research hypotheses and assessing the model s predictive power.
path coefficients and significance table vii presents the results of the hypotheses testing including the mean of the bootstrap distribution b the standard deviation sd the confidence interval ci and the p values.
the path coefficients in fig.
and table vii are interpreted as standard regression coefficients indicating the direct effects of one variable on another.
each hypothesis is represented by an arrow between constructs in fig.
.
for instance the arrow from functional value to trust corresponds to h2.
given its positive path coefficient b .
genai s functional value is positively associated with developers trust in these tools.
the coefficient of .
indicates that when the score for functional value increases by one standard deviation unit the score for trust increases by .
standard deviation units.
the analysis results table vii show that most of our hypotheses are supported except for h3 p .
h9 p .
and h10 p .
.
next we detail the factors associated with trust and behavioral intentions for the supported hypotheses with some exemplary quotes from responses to the open ended question to illustrate our findings.
factors associated with trust rq1 our analysis supported hypotheses h1 p .
h2 p .
and h4 p .
table vii .
first the support for system output quality in fostering trust h1 can be explained by how developers prefer tools that deliver accurate reliable outputs matching their work style and practices .
next the functional value of genai encompassing educational benefits and practical advantages promotes trust h2 since developers prioritize tools that offer tangible utility in their work .
for instance one survey respondent mentioned the practical utility of genaitools stating i find value in these models for creative endeavors gaining different perspectives or coming up with ideas i wouldn t have otherwise .
finally goal maintenance is relevant for cultivating trust h4 .
the alignment between a developer s goals and genai s actions supports using genai tools to achieve these goals.
this eliminates the need for developers to constantly verify the relevance of genai s outputs thereby reducing cognitive load.
this congruence ultimately enhances genai s credibility as a cognitive collaborator rather than as an independent and potentially untrustworthy tool thus bolstering trust in these tools.
factors associated with behavioral intentions rq2 our analysis supported hypotheses h5 p .
h6 p .
h7 p .
and h8 p .
indicating that developers trust h5 and their cognitive styles motivations h6 computer self efficacy h7 and risk tolerance h8 are significantly associated with their behavioral intentions to use genai tools.
trust h5 is pivotal in shaping adoption decisions as it reduces resistance to new technologies .
when developers trust genai tools they perceive them as credible partners enhancing their willingness to use these tools.
moreover developers cognitive styles significantly shape their intentions to adopt genai tools.
developers motivated by the intrinsic enjoyment of technology h6 have higher intentions to adopt genai tools.
in contrast those with a task oriented approach tend to be more cautious and hesitant about the cognitive effort they are willing to invest in these tools .
one respondent echoed this stating i am slow to adopt new workflows i put off actively exploring new tools unless it is related to what i need to do .
higher computer selfefficacy within peer groups is also significantly associated with increased intentions to use genai tools h7 .
despite generally high self efficacy some developers face interaction challenges with genai that may impact their confidence and adoption rates.
one respondent shared i see my colleagues getting good responses while i fiddle around to get the answers i need.
also it does not always show the right document relevant to me so i prefer traditional ways .
furthermore we found that developers with higher risk tolerance are significantly more inclined to use these tools than risk averse individuals h8 .
the context and involved stakes in which these tools are used further play a role as highlighted by another respondent i don t use it yet to write code that i can put my name behind in production i just use it for side projects or little scripts to speed up my job but not in actual production code .
finally our analysis supported hypothesis h11 p .
highlighting a significant positive association between developers behavioral intention to use genai tools and its usage in their work.
this corroborates with prior technology acceptance models emphasizing the pivotal role of behavioral intentions in predicting use behavior.
control variables although experience is often relevant for technology adoption our analysis found no significant associations between se experience and trust behavioral intentions or usage of genai tools.
this is likely since genai introduces a new interaction paradigm which divergestable vii standarized path coefficients b standard deviations sd confidence intervals ci p values and effect sizes f2 b sd ci p f2 h1 system output quality trust0.

familiarity with genai while potentially influential was excluded as a control variable due to a highly skewed distribution of responses with most participants reporting high familiarity.
including such skewed variables could lead to unreliable estimates and compromise the model s validity .
similarly the gender variable was excluded due to its skewed distribution.
the analysis of unobserved heterogeneity see supplemental confirms the absence of any group differences in the model e.g.
organizational heterogeneity caused by unmeasured criteria.
model evaluation we assessed the relationship between constructs and the predictive capabilities of the theoretical model by evaluating the model s explanatory power r2 adjusted adj.

explanatory power the coefficient of determination r2 and adj.
r2values indicate the proportion of variance in the endogenous variables explained by the predictors.

further table vii presents the effect sizes f2 which measure the impact of each predictor on the endogenous variables.
the effect sizes indicate that the predictors exhibit medium to large effects on their respective endogenous variables for all supported hypotheses in our model with values ranging from .

furthercorroborating the model s explanatory power.
model fit we analyzed the overall model fit using the standardized root mean square residual srmr a recommended fit measure for detecting misspecification in pls sem models .
our results suggest a good fit of the data in the theoretical model with srmr .

predictive relevance finally we evaluated the model s predictive relevance using stone geisser s q2 a measure of external validity obtainable via the pls predict algorithm in smartpls.
pls predict is a holdout sample based procedure it divides the data into ksubgroups folds of roughly equal size using k folds as a training sample to estimate the model while the remaining fold serves as a holdout to assess out of sample predictive power.
q2 predict values are calculated for endogenous variables values greater than indicate predictive relevance while negative values suggest the model does not outperform a simple average of the endogenous variable.
our sample was segmented into k parts and repetitions were used to derive the q2 predict statistic all of which were greater than table viii confirming our model s adequacy in terms of predictive relevance.

common method bias we collected data via a single survey instrument which might raise concerns about common method bias variance cmb cmv .

these indicate that cmb was not a concern in our study.
v. d iscussion a. implications for practice design to maintain developers goals.
our findings suggest that developers trust in genai tools manifests when these tools align with their goals h4 .
this is likely because goal maintenance reduces the need for developers to constantly verify the relevance of genai s contributions easing cognitive load and allowing them to focus on task related activities.
to achieve goal maintenance the ai should consistently account for the developer s current state immediate goals and the expected success outcomes from ai as well as preferences for transitioning from their current state 3large r2andf2can occasionally indicate overfitting.
we thoroughly evaluated this issue by analyzing residuals and conducting cross validation finding no evidence of model overfitting see .
to achieving their immediate goals .
these preferences may involve process methodologies interaction styles output specifications alignment with the work style or safety security considerations .
given that an individual s goal s may evolve in response to changes in their task state toolsmiths must also prioritize adaptability in genai tool design.
for instance adaptability can be incorporated by iteratively adjusting ai s actions based on user input on and to ensure its ongoing alignment with their shifting goals.
allowing developers the flexibility to explicitly steer ai s actions as needed is also important for goal maintenance.
this control can be essential if the genai tool deviates from the expected trajectory enabling developers to re calibrate it to support their goals.
further this can also support developers metacognitive flexibility i.e.
they may adapt their cognitive strategies based on new information or task state changes.
the ability to steer the ai to align with these adapted strategies helps accommodate their evolving goals.
design for contextual transparency.
developers often face decisions about incorporating genai tool support for their tasks.
any mismatch between their expectations and genai s true capabilities can lead to over under estimating the tool s functionality increasing the risk of errors lost productivity or potential adverse outcomes in critical tasks .
such outcomes are detrimental to fostering subsequent trust.
thus helping developers to calibrate their expectations to match the true tool capabilities is essential.
creating this alignment involves designing interfaces that explicitly communicate the tool s capabilities and limitations consistent with hai interaction guidelines .
this clarity allows individuals to form accurate expectations about system quality h1 within their task contexts and assess its functional value h2 thereby fostering appropriate trust .
to that end we suggest a communicating genai s reasoning process and derivation of its outputs in the context of the current task .
such transparency about the source and how an ai arrived at its output can enable developers to assess correctness more accurately and evaluate any safety or security issues related to using these outputs in their work.
this can enhance the assessment of system output quality thus cultivating appropriate trust h1 .
b communicating genai s limitations for the current task and scoping assistance under conditions of uncertainty to incite warranted trust .
so allows developers to consider the tool s practical utility for their task context clarifying its appropriate functional value h2 in their work.
inclusive tool design for hai ux fairness.
ai fairness has gained substantial traction over the years .
while much of the research and discussion has focused on data or algorithmic fairness fairness should also include user experiences in human ai interactions hai ux .
we advocate promoting fairness in hai ux through inclusive genai tool design specifically by supporting developers diverse cognitive styles.
our findings indicate that developers who are motivated to use genai tools for their own sake h6 have higher computer self efficacy h7 and have greater tolerance for risk h8 are more inclined to adopt these tools compared to their peers.to achieve more equitable acceptance of these tools across the cognitive spectrum of developers future designs must prioritize adaptability based not only on developers goals discussed above but also on their cognitive styles.
this can be achieved by capturing these styles e.g.
using the survey questions from this study and designing genai tools that dynamically adapt to align with these styles using various strategies.
for example to support developers motivated by task completion genai tools can solicit their immediate goals and expected outcomes and deliver contextually appropriate information and explanations consistent with their preferred styles.
this would simplify developers ongoing tasks without overwhelming them with unrelated features or extraneous information helping them complete their tasks effectively.
as another example genai tools can support individuals with lower self efficacy by offering explicit cues that differentiate between errors arising from prompting issues and those due to system limitations.
for instance it can caution users about tasks where it typically underperforms based on prior feedback or highlight specific parts of the prompt that influenced the generated output.
this distinction can help prevent individuals from doubting their ability to effectively use these tools in their work.
further for risk averse developers transparency in genai behavior and outputs should be emphasized.
genai should also provide explicit indicators of any potential flaws or uncertainties in its outputs e.g.
confidence scores .
such transparency can help developers make informed decisions about incorporating these outputs into their work e.g.
using ai generated code accommodating the caution and deliberation associated with risk aversion.
b. implications for research our study establishes an understanding of developers trust and intention related factors during the early stage of genai adoption.
furthermore our study offers a validated instrument for capturing relevant factors in the context of humangenai interaction.
researchers can utilize this instrument to operationalize theoretical expectations or hypotheses such as capturing the dynamics of trust and intentions in finer contexts refining genai tools with design improvements and comparing user experiences before and after design changes thus advancing the understanding of ai adoption.
non significant associations our analysis did not find support for hypotheses h3 p .

and h10 p .

these findings are surprising as ease of use information processing and tinkering learning style are relevant when considering traditional software tools .
however in genai contexts these constructs may manifest differently due to the altered dynamics of user engagement compared to more traditional software.
the intuitive nature of genai interfaces might diminish the traditional impact of these factors.
for example ease of use might not show a relation as using these interfaces is inherently easy instead the appropriateness of the queries is what matters.
similarly developers information processing style h9 did not significantly influence their intentions to use genai tools likely because how individualsarticulate their needs a single comprehensive prompt or sequence of queries often aligns with their preferences for consuming information comprehensive or selective .
the lack of a relationship for tinkering style h10 as well could be attributed to genai s interaction paradigm which is primarily centered around re formulating and following up with queries rather than tinkering with the software s features.
if these speculations hold how certain validated constructs were framed in the current study might have indeed limited our understanding of these dynamics.
future research should explore these constructs more deeply within the context of human genai interactions.
for instance instead of focusing on ease of use or tinkering with software features studies could examine ease of prompting or tinkering with prompt strategies and how preferences and proficiency in these areas influence developers trust and behavioral intentions.
understanding these dynamics can inform the future design and adoption strategies of genai tools aligning them more closely with user interaction patterns and cognitive styles.
c. threats to validity and limitations construct validity we captured constructs through selfreported measures asking participants to express their agreement with literature derived indicators.
this approach assumes that participants responses accurately reflect their beliefs and experiences which might not always be the case due to various biases or misinterpretations.
to reduce this threat we used validated instruments evaluated the psychometric validity of the picse questions involved practitioners in designing the questions ran pilot studies incorporated attention checks randomized the questionnaire within blocks and screened the responses.
further our analysis confirmed that the constructs were internally consistent reliable and met convergent and discriminant validity criteria.
we did not directly ask participants about their genai experience instead we used their familiarity with genai tools and its frequency of use at work as proxies to capture their experience with these tools.
internal validity our hypotheses propose associations between constructs rather than causal relationships given the cross sectional nature of the study .
we acknowledge the limitation of self selection bias as respondents interested in or skeptical about genai tools might be more willing to complete the questionnaire.
further a theoretical model like ours cannot capture an exhaustive list of factors.
other factors can play a role thus positioning our results as a reference for future studies.
future work should also consider using longitudinal data and control for potential confounding factors such as familiarity with genai and demographic variables.
additionally trust is a situation dependent construct .
although we focused on software development trust in genai tools may vary based on finer work contexts e.g.
software design vs. software testing tasks .
therefore our results should be interpreted as a theoretical starting point guiding future studies to explore these contextual influences.
external validity our survey was conducted within github and microsoft.
while the sample includes engineers fromaround the globe it may not fully represent the broader software developer community.
however the sample distribution aligns with previous empirical studies involving software engineers providing a suitable starting point to understand the associations presented in our model.
the responses were sufficiently consistent to find full or partial empirical support for the hypotheses.
nevertheless theory development is an iterative process .
thus our results should be interpreted as a starting point aiming for theoretical rather than statistical generalizability.
future studies should replicate validate and extend our theoretical model in various contexts.
vi.
c onclusion our findings highlight that genai s system output quality functional value and goal maintenance significantly influence developers trust.
furthermore trust and cognitive styles motivations computer self efficacy and attitude towards risk influence intentions to use these tools which in turn drives usage.
we also contribute a validated instrument to capture trust related factors in human genai interaction contexts.
beyond theoretical contributions our study offers practical implications including pointers for design mechanisms that foster appropriate trust and promote equitable user experiences sec.
v .
while our work enhances the understanding of developers trust and behavioral intentions towards genai tools long term longitudinal studies are essential for refining the knowledge of ai adoption dynamics in software engineering.
