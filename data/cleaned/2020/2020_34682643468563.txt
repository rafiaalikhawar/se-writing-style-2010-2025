introduction open source has democratized software development.
developers flocktoossprojectshopingtoaddcertainfunctionality contribute to a worthy goal and sharpen their skills.
however more than ofossprojectsbecomeabandonedovertime especiallythe smallerandyoungerprojects .certainlynotallossprojects are meant to be widely used or even to persist beyond a college semester.however eventhelarge popularosssoftware widely usedinourdailylivesandbyfortune500companies startedout as small projects.
thus from a societal perspective it is important to ask why do some nascent oss projects succeed and become self sustaining while others do not ?
and can the latter be helped?
to aid developer communities to build and maintain sustainable oss projects nonprofit organizations like the apache software foundation asf have been established.
asf runs the asf incubator asfi wherenascentprojectsaimingtobeapartofthe asf community are provided with stewardship and mentor like guidance to help them eventually become self sustaining and even top levelprojectsinasf.projectsinasfi called podlings arerequiredtoadheretoasfrulesandregulations includingkeepingall commitsandemailspublic.whencertainconditionsaresatisfied project developers andasf committeesdecideif a podling should begraduated referredtoasa successful sustainabilityoutcome.otherwisetheyget retired.perasfi amajorcriterionforgraduationis tohavedevelopedanopenanddiversemeritocraticcommunity.graduationtestswhetheraprojecthaslearnedenoughandisresponsible enough to sustain itselfas suchacommunity .
podlings in asfi receive a mentor file monthly reports and get feedback.
in spite of this support many podlings fail.
most asfi committers do not lack coding expertise but graduating from the incubator requires more it asks for effective teamwork and sustainable communitydevelopment.theserequirementsaremost challengingtomeet.fromcommentsinasfi weseethatdevelopers areconfusedbytheexpectationof theapacheway especially initially.
e.g.

esec fse august athens greece likang yin zhuangzhichen qi xuan andvladimirfilkov already confused with what s going on with the move to apache... the frustrations sometimes persist beyond the initial period.
a commentfromproject flexon06jan2012 states ...manypeople are confused and lost as to what to do.
who is providing that direction for them?
in large part understanding how to achieve the graduation requirements seems to be the culprit likely due to the abstract nature of those concepts.
another reason is that comparisontoothersisdifficult.fromproject raveon28june2011 makes it very confusing and difficult to compare against what other projects as some are toolittlewhileothersare toomuch... thus thereisaneedtoconnecttheproverbialdotsonhowto getfromthepointofentryintoasfitocheckingallthegraduation requirementboxes.thatbringsustothemotivationofourpaper.
the extrinsically labeled asfi dataset offers heretofore unavailable fine grainedrecordsofhistoricaltrajectoriesofprojectsunder policies andregulationsofasfi.we positthat the process that asfi projects follow toward becoming sustainablecanbemodeledasafunctionofasmallsetofproject features sothattheoutcome graduation retirement canbe predicted early on from the successes and failures of others allowing for trajectory adjustmentif needed.
to deliver on that in addition to the historical outcome labeled asfidata wealsoneedatheoreticalframeworkthatcancapture thecomplexityofossdevelopment.overthepast30yearsresearch inorganizationalbehaviorandmanagementhasdocumentedthe evolutioninprojectmanagementpractices astheyhavemoved toward more successful models .
thesocio technical view of an organization has emerged as one of the more successful hybridmodelsrecognizingthebenefitsthatintegratedtreatment of the technical aspect code machines device etc.
and the social aspect people communication well being etc.

likewise oss projects have been effectively studied fromthesocio technicalsystem sts perspective withthesocial side capturing humans and their communication channels and the technical capturingthe content and structure ofthe software .
here inspired by the socio technical systems modeling perspective andtheavailabilityofextrinsicallylabeledhistoricaldataof project sustainabilityfromasfi ourgoalsare to identifysociotechnicalfeaturesdistinguishingprojectsthatgraduatefromthe asf incubator from those that do not i.e.

wedescribeastrategyforreal timemonitoringofthesustainability forecast for any project derived from an interpretable versionof our dnn model.
this paper is a first step toward showing that end results of oss projects sustainability trajectories can be effectively forecast and possibly corrected upward if needed.
our motivation goes beyond asfi as many more nascent projects fail outside of asfi soself monitoringandself adjustmentmaybemorepertinentto them.

apachesoftwarefoundationincubator communityovercode isthetenetoftheapachesoftwarefoundation asf community .
their belief is that if they take good care ofthe community goodsoftware willemergefrom it.
however conflictsareubiquitous inoss projects andnot even asf can escape them.
to minimize conflicts asf requires projects to make all communication publicly available on the mailinglists summarizedpopularlyas ifitdidnothappeninthemailing lists it did not happen .
the communication records benefit developers as they reflect on previous decisions and trace their precursors therefore improvingefficiency andproductivity.
the asf community adopts ademocraticwayinmanyof their affairs.
for example contributors are invited to vote yes 1057sustainability forecastingforapache incubatorprojects esec fse august athens greece okay or no to project wide changes.
however asfcommitters can live in different time zones and their response to a project decision can delay largely.
regarding that asf community adopts thelazy consensus .
moreover the asf community also believes inearned rights that newcomers should be treated the same wayif they have proven theirtechnical skills.
the goal of the asf incubator asfi is to help projects become self sustained and eventually join asf.
like many oss developers asficommittersworkatwillandtherearenoformalobligations on them.
thus asfi projects are required to show they are able to recruit new committers and fill existing technical debt .
however attracting new committers is difficult as they can be affected by both social and technical barriers .
to address this issue the asfi community has established a set of specific rules that emphasizeprovidingmentorship to newcomers .
during incubation asfi projects need to adopt asf procedures to developand cultivatethe projects community and standardize their working style.

socio technical systemstheory socio technical structure plays an important role in achieving collectivesuccessinossprojects .asocio technicalsystem sts comprises two entities the social system where members continuously create and share knowledge via various types of individualinteractions andthetechnicalsystemwherethemembers utilize the technical hardware to accomplish certain collective tasks.
the theory of sts is often referenced when studying how the technical system is able to provide efficient and reliable individual interactions and how the social subsystem becomes contingent in the interactions and further affects the performance ofthe technical subsystem .
oss projects have been studied from the network view .

.joslinet al.
find that project success associates with the methodologies e.g.
process tools methods etc.
adopted by the project.
andnot a single organizational structure is equally effective in all cases.
as theorganizationalcontextchangesovertime tomaintainconsistency the project must adapt to its context accordingly.
otherwise conflictsandinefficiencyoccur i.e.

hypothesesand research questions our goal is to build effective models for forecasting asfi project sustainability.
here we generate our hypotheses and formulate research questions based on prior work and the pertinent theories.
.
hypotheses sts theorysuggeststhatpublicly observableparticipation anddecentralized contributions to software projects foster sustainable collaborations.
the asfi ecosystem is in a form of a typical sts wherethetechnicalactivitiesbuildasharedcodeartifactandthe social ones mediate knowledge and organizational details to individuals.
since all activities are logged various socio technical metrics can be calculated.
our main hypothesis is that the sts formalism and the full availability of the projects longitudinal digital traces will make it possibletobuildan accuratemodelof sustainability.accordingto contingencytheory nosingleorganizationalstructureisequally effectiveunderallcircumstances.thus acrossasfiprojects weexpecttoseethatthesamesocio technicalfactorsmayhavedifferent contributionstosustainability.finally weposit percontingency theory that the roles of some social technical factors may vary over time.
moreover we expect to see that similar asfi projects canendwithdivergentoutcomes graduationorretirement over time basedonactions they have undertaken.
.
research questions weformalizetheaboveintoourrqs asfollows.thefirstisavalidation of contingency theory hypotheses that there exist measurable differencesbetween graduatedprojectsand retiredprojects along withmultiple features.
namely rq1arethere significantdifferencesamongsts measures between graduatedprojectsandretiredprojects?
next ststheoryholdsthatprojectsustainabilityisassociated with social and technical network features.
contingency theory implies there will be multiple such features in play.
thus we expectthataquantitativetemporalmodelmaybefittedwelltothe availableasfidata solongasasufficient numberoffeaturesand projectsare available.
rq2howwellcanwepredictthesustainabilitybasedontemporal traces of asfi projects?
and can we identify the determinants alongwiththeirweightsanddirections?
to make the model useful in practice it needs more than just accuratepredictionsofoutcomes italsoneedsto generatetimely adviceonwhethertheprojectshouldstaythecourseorimplement specific corrective action to improve the graduation trajectory.
we formulate this as rq3canwemonitorprojectsustainabilitystatusinacontinuous manner?whenandhowshouldprojectsreacttothemonitoring advice?
data and methods we collected historical trace data of commits emails incubation length sponsor information and incubation outcome for asfi projects whichhaveavailablearchivesofbothcommitsandemails from03 2003to10 .amongthem 176projectshave already graduated have retired and are still in incubation.
thelatter projectsstillinincubation werenotstudiedinthispaper.
wecollectedtheasfidatafromtwosources asfmailinglists and svn commits.
the mailing list archives are open access and canbeaccessedthroughthearchivewebpage apache.org mod mbox .
they contain allemails and commitsfrom theproject sasfentrydate andarecurrent.weconstructedurls for individual project files in the asf incubator as project url .
the project urls use the pattern project name yyyymm .mbox .
for example for project hama the full url is apache.org mod mbox hama dev .mbox .
eachsuch file containsamonthofmailinglistmessagesfromtheproject forthedate specifiedintheurl.here devstandsfor emailsamongdevelopers .
however we findthat many projects especiallytheseover ten years old which used svn used a bot in the devmailing list to recordallcommits thusamessagefrom devisnotalwaysanemail.
similar emails were sent to the commits mailing list which thus containssomeemails.therefore wecollectedboth devandcommits mailing lists files for the graduated or retired asf incubator projectsthroughthe archive webpage5.
.
data pre processing asfmanagesandrecordsthecommunicationsamongpeopleby globally assigning an exclusive email name to each developer at the project level.
however somedevelopers still prefer to use their personal email name instead of the assigned one which in turn complicatestheidentificationofdistinctdevelopers .weperformedde aliasingforthosedeveloperswithmultiplealiasesand or emailaddresses asfollows.wefirstremovetitles e.g.
jr. andcommon words in the name e.g.
admin lists group from usernames then we match with both the original order and switched first last name order whenever names contain exactly one comma to eliminateambiguousstyles.thenwematcheachdeveloperwithher his multiple email addresses if any .
manyprojects especiallythoseovertenyearsoldthatusedsvn utilizeda botfor extensive mailings empirical evidence shows26 of popular github projects use bots thus forming outliers in the dataset.
some broadcast emails are automatically generated by theissuetrackingtool e.g.
jira andnodeveloperwouldreplyto them.
we eliminated the broadcast messages that no one replied to and we find many of them are generated by automated tools.
we find some developers contributed many commits by directly changing uploadingmassive non sourcecodefiles e.g.

since those can form outliers in the dataset commitstofileswithextensiondata .json .xml .yml .yaml 5dataand scriptsareavailable 1059sustainability forecastingforapache incubatorprojects esec fse august athens greece .jar text configurations .config .info .ini .txt .md andimage .jpg .gif .pdf .png are eliminated.
as result we identify unique contributors who either committedcodeorpostedemails .amongthem 469onlycommitted code and only posted replied to discussions without committing code.

stsandsocio technical networks weusesocio technicalnetworkstoanchorourstudyofosssts.
network science approaches have been prominent in studying complex dynamics of oss projects although the specific definitionmayvary withdomaincontext .
in this paper we define the projects socio technical structure using social email based and technical code based networks inducedfromtheiremailstothemailinglistsandcommitstosource files as follows.
similar to the approach by bird et al.
we form a social email network for each project at each month from the communications between developers a directed edge from developer atobexists ifbhas replied to a s post in a thread or ifahas emailed bdirectly which is contained in the in replyto field .thetechnical code collaborationnetworksareformed foreachproject ateachmonth byincludinganundirectededge betweendeveloper aanddeveloper bifbothdeveloper aandbhas committedtothesamecodingsourcefile s fthatmonth excluding the svn branchnames .
.
features metrics ofinterest the socio technical and project features variables that we chose for this study have been identified based on our discussion and considerationoftheunderlyingtheories.allourdataislongitudinal.
all metrics are aggregated over monthly intervals for each project from the start to the end of its incubation .
we started with variables given theirstatisticsas supplementary material.

graduation grad status is a binaryvariable retired or1 graduated indicatingtheprojects graduationstatusinthe incubator as discussedabove.
longitudinal projectmetrics the number of active developers num act devs isthecountofcontributorswhohavebeenactive by either making commits or participating in discussions.
number ofcommits num commits is thecount ofsource code commits made by all committers in the project.
the process of excluding the commits that do not contain source code is described in the data section.
the number of emails num emails is the number of emails includingboththreadstarteremailsandreply toemails .

1061sustainability forecastingforapache incubatorprojects esec fse august athens greece we observe notable differencesas follows.
the medianincubation monthsofretiredprojectsis significantlyhigher thanofthegraduatedprojects suggestingthatretirementisnotaneasydecision andthatperhapsnecessarytimeisgiventoprojectstochangetheir trajectories andachieve graduation.
graduated projects also tend to have more code commits and more email communications implying that in terms of criteria for graduation the asf community values both technical contribution as commits and social communication as emails and both of themmaybeofimportanceinbuildingasustainablecommunity.
such results also motivate us to expand our research goals from descriptive data to inferential data with more complex network features.
across both the social and technical networks the network size varies for the graduated projects indicating that projects of any size can be sustainable and it also suggests that project size can beusedasacontrolinmodeling.thenotabledifferencebetween graduated and retired projects and the lack of variance in network sizes in the retired projects suggests recruitment difficulties in the latter exposing themto significant risksas people leave.

our model identifies the lack of both email and commitactivitiesareassociatedwiththedownturn.thereisalsoan overalldecreasing trendin thenumberof activedevelopers from to thento 4eventually .
to investigate whytheir promising trajectory changed and then changed again we looked through theirdiscussionsonthe mailinglist.
in the month with the lowest graduation forecast the project released a major version of their software following which the committers showed less activity.
we also noticed that the asf incubator project management committee pmc routinely sent an email to the project asking for the periodically report6 but such reportswere notrequested formore than 2monthsafterthe release.
lastly we saw email arguments on the technical direction for the project s future development.
unsurprisingly the project was going to fail if no one observes such situation and takes action tointervene.however anemailfromoneofthemajorcontributors dev1 appears tohave initiatedtheturningpoint.belowwequote itandthe ensuingdiscussion.

rq3 actionable recommendation we start with a caveat.
precise actionable models require interventionsandrandomizedexperiments.ourmodelsarenotbased onsuchexperiments andanyactionabilitywederivefromthem must therefore be less powerful than those.
at best our experimentscanbeconsidered naturalexperiments asubclassofquasiexperiments where the class assignment is not controlled by theexperimenter.
thus any interventions we suggest here must be validated experimentally in order to avoid large uncertainties in outcomes.withthatcaveatinmind wesoughttoanswer tothe best of our experimental methods the following intervention question whataction should aprojecttake andwhen?

of thoseprojectsthathavenotexperienceddownturns theaverage incubation time was months versus months for projects that have had downturns implying an association between downturns and length of stay in the incubator.
we note that the upturn events tendtobeassociatedwithasfmentors intervention.thisisconsistent with one of the responsibilities of asf mentors to watch over the projects they are mentoring and keep them on track.

this ad hoc approach while an approximation is anaturalsignalprocessingwaytoaccountforinherentuncertainty inthe signal.

increasing the values of features with positive coefficients and or decreasing the values of the negative coefficient features results in an increase of the graduation forecast.

3ecosystem andproject specific fine tuning.
ourstrategycan be further fine tuned in several ways.
first there are common patternsinthegraduationforecastsoverallprojects.figure 9shows that for graduated projects in green there is an apparent upward trendintheforecastinthefirst6months suggestingthattheearlystage development deserves more attention from project managers.
from month to month we do not observe a significant change andthedecreasingvariancealsotendstosupportsuchanargument.
however we find increasing variance in months through .
one possible reason is that many graduated projects achieve their milestoneinthatperiod andslowfurthercommitsanddiscussions thuslowering the graduationforecast.theseconsiderationscan be taken into account during forecastmonitoring with more frequent monitoring chosen or increased attention paid at times around milestonesandreleases.theasfcommitteescanalsoaskformore frequentprojectreports duringthefirst6monthsand12months of incubation as project reports were seen to be an incentive to productivityinour casestudy.

werecognizethatsomesocio technicalelementsaremoredifficult to change compared to others.
this is project specific in that some projects can easier modify some features than can other projects.e.g.

mechanistically herearesomepossiblereasonsforwhyfeatures e.g.
number of commits files may have different effects across projects.first havingmuchmorethantheusualamountofcode changesandfiletouchesinagivenperiodoftimemaybeindicative of refactoring or even change of direction for a project.
this can be the result of a project pivoting which may lead to longer stay intheincubatorandpossibleretirement.second increasesinthe numberoffilesmayresultininsufficienthumanresourcestohandle them e.g.

in effect the coefficients of the same factor can vary underdifferentprojectcontexts.
lastly awordofcaution.intermsofexpectationsthatincluding morefeaturestointerveneon mayleadtofasterbounce up wenote thatempiricalevidenceshowssocio technicalfeatureshaveways of gettingcorrelated pairwise over time in the same system.
thus even if not correlated the effect of increasing multiple features simultaneouslymaynot be additive.

project specific features can be selected from the suggestions forinterventionwhenexperiencingdownturns.thealgorithm can be made bespoke by introducing more frequent monitoringaround releases milestones.

threats to validityand conclusion threats.first our commit and email data is from only hundreds of projects asf incubator projects.
thus generalizing the implications beyond asf or even beyond the asf incubator projects carriespotentialrisks.expandingthedatasetbeyondasf e.g.

second we do not considercommunicationsother than through the asf mailing lists.
however asf s policies and regulationsinsistonthe useof mailinglists which lowersthis risk.
lastly interpretingdeeplearningmodelsisstillanart andlime models are approximations.
they may be particularly sensitive to correlatedfeatures.welowersuchriskbyeliminatingcorrelated variablesbeforetraining.takingtheactionablesuggestionsgiven in this paper may result in changes of more than one variable e.g.

conclusion.
understanding why many nascent projects have failed may help others improve their individual practice organizationalmanagement andinstitutionalstructure.hereweshowed quantitative network science approaches combined with stateof the art ai methods can effectively model asf incubator project sustainability from a novel longitudinal dataset of socio technical contributions in asfi projects more narrow in scope than general oss projects but with extrinsic graduation sustainability labels.
we also demonstrated the combined power of mixed methods both quantitative and qualitative studies.
through case studies we identified specific reasons for success and failure of projects complementing our models.
finally we developed a strategy for translational use of the models in practice.
our methods make it straightforwardtotrackaproject strajectoryasitprogressestowardsustainability andevenofferadviceforcorrectingtrajectories upwards.futureworkisneededtooffervalidationofthisorsimilar strategies experimentally.
