one approach introduced and dubbed veritesting by avgerinos et al.
works by translating a boundedcontrolflowregionintoasingleconstraint.thisapproach is a convenient way to achieve path merging as a modification to a pre existing single path symbolic execution engine.
previous work evaluated this approach for symbolic execution of binary code butdifferentdesignconsiderationsapplywhenbuildingtoolsfor other languages.
in this paper we extend the previous approach for symbolic executionofjava.
because java code typically contains many small dynamically dispatchedmethods it isimportanttoincludethemin multi path regions we introduce dynamic inliningof method regions todo so modularly.
java s typed memory structure is very different from thebinaryrepresentation but weshow how the ideaof staticsingle assignment ssa form can be applied to object
