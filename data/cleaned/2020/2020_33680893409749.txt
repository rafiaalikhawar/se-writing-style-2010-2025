the ideaisthat whileknowninformationmaybeinsufficientto makeoptimaldecisions some alternatives can be shown to be better than others and that information can help engineers to explore huge spaces of design decisions to improve their choices.

we call this initial set seed variants and the processequaluses to pick the seed and later variants selection strategy.

assessment feeds its ranking of variants back to selection recall figure which uses this information to generate an improved set of variants during the next iteration.

the goal is to enable an architect to control the selection step s number of iterations and generated variants to fit her needs specific context and available computational resources.

assessment toassess a variant s quality equaldynamically analyzes itvia simulation.
wechosesimulation basedanalysisbecausesimulations are representative of a system s real behavior due to their inherent nondeterminism .equalreliesondiscrete eventsimulations generatingoutputsintheformoftime seriesobjects.
comparing different variants thus requires an analysis of their simulationgenerated time series.
although there are dozens of similarity metrics inmostdomains e.g.
robotics speechrecognition softwareengineering dynamictimewarping dtw hasbeenshown to perform betterthanthe alternatives .
we thus use dtw.
for each design variant equalgenerates a single time series objectforeachnfp.forhadoop thatmeansfourtime seriesper variant correspondingto the system s reliability execution time machineutilization and cost.
eachdatapointinatimeseries corresponds to the computed value for the given property at the given time.
depending on the direction of the relationship of a property with overall system quality we aim to find the variant that has yielded the time series with the highest direct relationship e.g.
forreliability or lowest inverse relationship e.g.
for cost values forthatproperty.
tothisend weneedtocompareeachtime series with theoptimum time series .
the optimum time series for a given nfp is a constant time series each of whose data points is equal to the highest or lowest value of the property achieved across all simulations.
this comparison requires having access to all of the simulation generated data in one place and computing the global optimum and distances from it.
this may entail transferring hundredsofmegabytesofdatapervariant andhavingtoredoallof thecalculationseachtimeanewvariantchangestheoptimumtimeseries.
suchasolutionwouldbeprohibitivelycostlyinscenarios withmultiple iterations involving thousandsofvariants.
to address this problem we devised the bipartite relative timeseries assessment technique brta which distributes the timeseries analysis.
as indicated in figure multiple nodes are tasked with assessing different subsets of variants via simulation.
each nodebehavesinthemannerdescribedabove itperformsadiscreteevent simulation of the design variants with which it is tasked computesanoptimumtime series andusesdtwtocomparethe individualtime serieswiththeoptimum.
notethattheoptimum time seriesisa localoptimum sincetheothernodeswillperform the sametasks on theirvariants.
in addition for eachnode brta calculates the range minimum to maximum for the time series computedlocally aswellasthenormalizeddistance distancedividedbythe number ofpointsinthe time series .
instead of returning all simulation generated data to the assessmentnode recallfigure brtaonlysendsasummarycontaining the above measurements.
the global assessment algorithm gathers these summaries and calculates the distance to the global optimum time seriesfor eachtime seriesas follows d braceleftbiggmax ol dl if direct ol min dl if inverse reliability cost utilizationexecution time figure equal s radar diagram for two candidate hadoop variants showingtheirrespectivevaluesforfourproperties ofinterest.
d is distance to the global optimum olis the local optimum dl is distance to the local optimum max min is the global max min value among all time series of a nfp.
we formally prove this formula s correctness in our experimental replication package .
brta s reduction in the amount of transferred data directly facilitates equal s support for exploring many design alternatives.
the updated brta summaries include the globally normalized values for each time series in each variant and are used to rank the variants.

guidearchhelpsarchitects make decisions using fuzzy math to deal with uncertaintiesaboutsystemvariationpoints.
guidearchusesthree pointestimates architectsmustprovide pessimistic mostlikely and optimistic values to describe the effects of their decisions on nfps.
for instance in the case of hadoop s processing power for each decision e.g.
using machines with 2ghz cpus architects have to specifythe three valuesfor utilization executiontime andcost.
guidearchdoesnotrequirethecreationofasystemmodel.
however guidearch susefulnessiscontingentontheaccuracyofits inputs which requires in depth knowledge of the system s domain andbehavior.
itsauthorsacknowledgethat evenforarchitectswho areintimatelyfamiliar withasystem itmaybechallengingtoaccurately estimate e.g.
the pessimistic value of resource utilization or the most likely system reliability .
for this reason guidearch s authors recommend that architects obtain this information by analyzingpriordata lookingatsimilarsystems studyingmanufacturer specifications and consulting publications .
these are nontrivial tasks likely to rival the modelingeffortrequiredby equal.
thespecificationofnfpsinguidearchissimilarto equal.
however as discussed above the specification of variation points is different which in turn impacts the modeling and analysis ofavailable options.
guidearch requires that all options be specified discretely andcannotexplore ranges.

fitness models describe the nfps of a system using its variation points and their interactions.
these models were obtained by siegmund et al.

the controlled experiment had two potential validity threats thatarosefrompracticalconsiderations.

thefirstconsideration is the participants use of existing ground truth models rather than creating their own.
this was necessary to enable objective comparisonbetweentheuser generatedsolutions.
moreover these models were produced by a third party .
the second threat stemmed from having to execute the study in a limited amount of time.
