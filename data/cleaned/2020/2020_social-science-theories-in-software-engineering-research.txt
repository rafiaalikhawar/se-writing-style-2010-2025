increasing attention to social science theories will help researchers to create accumulate and preserve knowledge cope with the multi disciplinarity of se research improve the quality of their research and reduce the need for trial and error .

some fields intersect several broader social sciences e.g.
communicationstudiesintersectsculturalstudies linguistics management and sociology .
each field has many subfields e.g.
information systems whichsharesmanysimilaritieswithse isasubfieldofmanagement .
we are not sure that philosophy is a social science per se but tentatively include it anyway.
theories can be classified on numerous dimensions including whattheyarefor theirscopeandtheirstructure aswellastheway they are used and where in an article they are used.
gregor proposed a taxonomy for classifying information systems theories according to their purpose.
she argued that theories can serve four purposes analysis and description explanation prediction and prescription leading to five types theoriesforanalyzing alsocalledframeworksortaxonomies arerelativelysimple descriptivetheories.agoodexample isiivarietal.

theoriesforpredicting predictfutureeventswithoutspecifying causalrelationships e.g.

these theories have testable propositions but no prescriptions.

prescriptions may be included but are not the focus.
this type is common in information systems where examplesinclude thetechnology acceptancemodel cognitivefit theory and the theory of task technology fit .

theories also exist on a kind of generalizeability spectrum from observationsandempiricalgeneralizationstomiddle rangetheories generaltheories grandtheories andtheoriesofeverything .seresearchersaremainlyconcernedwithempiricalgeneralizations middle rangetheoriesandgeneraltheories .anempirical generalization is an isolated proposition summarizing observed uniformities of relationships between two or more variables forinstance moore slaw.
middle rangetheories e.g.
cocomo the software engineering principles of davis lie between the minor but necessary working hypothesis that evolve in abundance during day to day research and the all inclusive systematic efforts todevelopaunifiedtheorythatwillexplainalltheobserveduniformities .

researchers also distinguish between variance theories process theories and taxonomies.
variance theories explain and predictthevariancein one or more dependent variables using independent moderating and mediating variables .
process theories explainhowanentitychangesanddevelops .taxonomies also calledtheoriesforunderstanding descriptivetheories frameworks and typologies organize instances individual things into classes abstract descriptions .
