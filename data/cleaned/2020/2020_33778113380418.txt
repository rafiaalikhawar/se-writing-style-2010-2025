due to the high cost of manually establishing trace links researchers have developed automated approaches that draw relationships between pairs of textual software artifacts using similarity measures.
however the effectiveness of such techniques are often limited as they only utilize a single measure of artifact similarity and cannot simultaneously model implicit and explicit relationships across groups of diverse development artifacts.
in this paper we illustrate how these limitations can be overcome through the use of a tailored probabilistic model.
to this end we design and implement a hierarchi cal probabilistic model for softwar e traceability comet that is able to infer candidate trace links.
comet is capable of modeling relationships between artifacts by combining the complementary observational prowess of multiple measures of textual similarity.
additionally our model can holistically incorporate information from a diverse set of sources including developer feedback and transitive often implicit relationships among groups of software artifacts to improve inference accuracy.
we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of comet that illustrates an improvement over a set of optimally configured baselines of in the best case and across all subjects in terms of average precision.
the comparative effectiveness of comet in practice where optimal configuration is typically not possible is likely to be higher.
finally we illustrate comet s potential for practical applicability in a survey with developers from cisco systems who used a prototype comet jenkins plugin.

introduction motivation the importance of traceability in modern software systems cannot be overstated.
traceability links that connect high level artifacts such as requirements and use cases to low level artifacts written in code help to facilitate crucial components of the software development and maintenance cycle.
for instance linking requirements to code provides visibility into a system by enumerating what has been implemented whereas linking requirements to test cases helps to provide an indication that the software is functioning as expected.
additionally the establishment of trace links aids in facilitating a broad set of developer activities including code comprehension change impact analysis and compliance validation .
in certain software domains such as those involving safety critical systems traceability is necessarily mandated by regulatory bodies in order to properly demonstrate the safe functioning of a system .
furthermore traceability is increasingly used to help ensure the security of a given system .
for example our industrial partners at cisco systems inc. require that securitycritical requirements are verified by a dedicated group of analysts to avoid software threats and ensure best practices.
unfortunately despite its importance software traceability is by its nature an inherently difficult and error prone task .
this difficulty primarily stems from the need to bridge a logical abstraction gap that exists between different software artifacts such as requirements written in natural language and code written in lower level programming languages.
given the effort required to establish and evolve effective trace links it is often too costly to manually establish them outside of regulated domains and in practice the quality of mandated links are often questionable .

moran d. n. palacio c. bernal c rdenas d. mccrsytal d. poshyvanyk c. shenefiel j. johnson the inherent difficulty in establishing trace links has lead to research on automated techniques for modeling establishing and evolving trace links that primarily rely upon information retrieval ir and machine learning ml techniques which retrieve or predict trace links based upon textual similarity metrics.
however in large part current automated approaches for traceability often trade precision for completeness and vice versa making them difficult to adopt in practice.
we observe three major shortcomings of current automated techniques that contribute to their limited effectiveness limited measures of artifact similarity existing techniques for trace link recovery tend to use a single textual similarity metric to draw relationships between artifacts.
this is problematic for several reasons.
perhaps most importantly it is often difficult or impossible to determine how well a technique that uses a given similarity measure will function on artifacts from a new project without any pre existing trace links.
this so called cold start problem is due to the fact that existing ir ml techniques for measuring textual similarity often need to be calibrated on a subset of ground truth artifact pairs with pre existing links.
this makes performance of these techniques difficult to predict when applied to new datasets.
furthermore in practice industrial projects often lack pre existing trace links as confirmed by our partners at cisco.
thus while certain techniques have been shown to perform well on research benchmarks the efficacy of a similarity measure is often tightly coupled to the underlying semantics of software artifact text and to the configuration of the corresponding ir ml technique .
using only a single textual similarity metric also needlessly restricts the predictive power of a traceability technique.
past work has illustrated the orthogonality of different similarity measures suggesting that combining several different measures could lead to more accurate and robust techniques that function consistently well when applied to new projects without pre existing links.
inability to effectively capture developer feedback the rapid pace of modern agile development practices often results in crucial knowledge about a software system being siloed within the expertise of individual developers.
thus one unstructured development artifact that has gone underutilized by past techniques isdeveloper feedback.
when an automated traceability model is uncertain about particular trace link pairs developers can provide critical feedback to help improve trace link inference.
limited view of interactions between artifacts existing automated traceability approaches are typically tailored to establish relationships between pairs of specific types of artifacts e.g.
user stories and class files .
however information pertaining to the relationship of one type of artifact pair may be contained within other related artifacts.
for example if a piece of source code is linked to a given requirement through textual similarities and this source code is also intrinsically linked to test code via method calls then it is likely the requirement is also linked to the test code.
however in this situation it may be difficult for a textual similarity metric to link the requirements and test code due to limited test documentation for example.
thus in this way established relationships between certain artifacts may influence the probability of other artifact relationships.
in this paper we refer to these phenomena as transitive links.
existing techniques generally cannot model such interactions between artifacts.the limitations discussed above stem from both technical and practical limitations of existing traceability techniques and surfaced during our development of an automated traceability approach in close collaboration with cisco systems.
in this paper we introduce a novel technique that overcomes these limitations by constructing a hierarchical bayesian network for inferring a set of candidate trace links.
the model that underlies our approach is capable of deriving the probability that a trace link exists between two given artifacts by combining information from multiple measures of textual similarity while simultaneously modeling transitive relationships and accounting for developer expertise.
we implemented our approach called comet hierarchi cal probabilistic model for softwar e traceability in both an extensible python library and as a plugin for the popular jenkins ci cd system.
in an extensive set of empirical experiments we illustrate that comet is able to outperform the median precision of optimally configured baseline techniques by across subjects and in the best case.
given that optimal configuration is typically not possible in practice this illustrates that given a project with no pre existing trace links comet is likely to perform significantly better than most existing ir ml techniques.
additionally we show comet s potential for integration into the workflows of development teams at cisco.
in summary this paper s contributions are as follows the derivation of a hierarchical bayesian network hbn for inferring a candidate set of trace links an implementation of this model called comet as both an extensible python library and a jenkins plugin that has been deployed for testing with our industrial partners at cisco an extensive evaluation of comet on both open source projects and two industrial datasets from one industrial software project including feedback from professional developers at a major telecommunication software company an open source commercial grade traceability benchmark developed in coordination with our industrial partner for the benefit of the research community an online appendix including our open source implementation of comet and evaluation data for reproducibility .
related work we focus our discussion of related work on prior techniques that have in limited contexts i considered novel or hybird textual similarity measures ii modeled the effects of multiple types of artifacts or iii incorporated developer expertise.
we then conclude with a statement distilling comet s novelty.
novel hybird textual similarity measures guo et al.
proposed an approach for candidate trace link prediction that uses a semantically enhanced similarity measure based on deep learning dl techniques.
however unlike comet this technique requires pre existing trace links in order to train the dl classifier.
in contrast comet does not require known links for the projects it is applied to but rather requires a project to serve as a tuning set.
we show that comet performs well when tuned and tested on different datasets outperforming guo et al.
s dl based approach when it is trained in a similar manner.
gethers et al.
implemented an approach that is capable of combining information from canonical ir techniques i.e.
vsm jensen shannon with topic modeling 874improving the effectiveness of traceability link recovery using hierarchical bayesian networks icse may seoul republic of korea techniques.
however their approach can only combine two ir ml techniques whereas comet can combine and leverage the observations from several ir ml techniques and combine this with other information such as expert feedback and transitive links.
modeling of multiple artifacts rath et al.
recently explored linking nontraditional information including issues and commits and cleland huang et al.
have investigated linking regulatory codes to product level requirements.
comet s model has the potential to improve trace link recovery in these scenarios both through its more robust modeling of textual similarity and through incorporation of transitive link information.
furtado et al.
explored traceability in the context of agile development and nishikawa et al.
first explored the use of transitive links in a deterministic traceability model.
additionally kuang et al.
used the closeness of code dependencies to help improve ir based traceability recovery .
however none of these approaches is capable of incorporating transitive links while also considering combined textual similarity metrics and developer feedback.
incorporation of developer expertise de lucia et al.
and hayes et al.
analyzed approaches that use relevance feedback to improve trace link recovery.
however these approaches are either tied to a particular type of model such as tf idf or require knowledge of the underlying model to function optimally.
in contrast comet implements a lightweight likert based feedback collection mechanism that we illustrate can improve link accuracy even when only a small amount of feedback is collected.
summary of advancement over prior work comet s features facilitate its application to projects without any pre existing trace links and as our evaluation illustrates allow it to perform consistently well across datasets.
comet is able to combine information from transitive links with both robust textual similarity measures and lightweight developer feedback for improved accuracy.
while some aspects of comet s approach have been considered in limited contexts in prior work such as developer feedback and restricted combinations of ir ml techniques there has never been a framework capable of combining all these aspects in a holistic approach.
our evaluation illustrates that comet s holistic hbn is able to outperform baseline techniques on average.
background .
problem definition our goal is to design a model that captures meaningful information regarding logical relationships between software artifacts and then use this model to infer a set of candidate trace links.
more specifically given a set of source artifacts s e.g.
requirements use cases such that s s1 s2 .
.
.sn and a set of target artifacts t e.g.
source code files test cases such that t t1 t2 .
.
.tn we aim to infer whether a trace link lexists between all possible pairs of artifacts in sandtsuch that l s t s s t t s t where each pair of artifacts sandtare said to be logical trace links.
.
defining a probabilistic view of traceability .
.
the probabilistic nature of software traceability .the process of building software is not inherently deterministic and is instead the result of decisions made by engineers over prolonged periods of time that may be hard to predict.
developer decisionsrelated to nearly every observable phenomenon in modern software development are influenced by a combination of multiple factors.
for instance the presence of a functional bug may be influenced by the quality of related requirements implementation constraints imposed by a given programming language or the changeproneness of underlying apis .
given that such factors are often hard to predict there is a clear sense of randomness inherent to the software development process.
similarly the existence of trace links among software artifacts is also likely to be influenced by several different effectively random factors.
these factors could include textual similarities between artifacts programmatic associations between pieces of code or even abstract notions of similarity held by expert developers.
for example the textual quality of requirements or identifiers in code are typically a function of several factors such as the fluency and writing style of the author and the familiarity of key phrases chosen for identifiers .
this may lead to variable names that may be perfectly clear to one engineer being indecipherable to another.
from this view point the existence of trace links between software artifacts can be thought of as an inherently a probabilistic phenomenon.
.
.
traceability as a bayesian inference problem .hence in order to effectively model trace links among software artifacts it is necessary to model a collection of random factors that influence the probability that a trace link exists.
thus the process of deriving trace links can be modeled as a bayesian inference problem wherein a probability distribution representing the existence of a trace link between two artifacts can be inferred.
as we illustrate by modeling the trace link recovery problem in a probabilistic manner we are able to construct an an automated approach that largely overcomes the typical drawbacks discussed in sec.
.
to understand this context let us consider the general definition of bayes theorem p h o p o h p h p o where his a hypothesis regarding some phenomenon ois a set of observations that provide some information about the hypothesis and where our goal is to infer or estimate the probability that our hypothesis is true p h o which is called the posterior probability distribution or more simply the posterior.
however a given hypothesis is rarely made in a vacuum and one typically holds some prior belief as to the probability that is being inferred.
this prior belief is modeled as a probability distribution p h which we will simply refer to as the prior and can be influenced by a number of factors.
in order for the posterior to be inferred from a set of observations these must be modeled in a probabilistic manner.
this is the purpose of the likelihood p o h which is a probability distribution that is derived purely from observed data.
thus in bayesian inference initial beliefs are represented as the prior observations are modeled as the likelihood and the final beliefs are represented by the posterior.
this posterior probability distribution can be inferred via one of several existing statistical inference techniques.
in framing the problem of inferring trace links as a bayesian problem we consider our hypothesis to be whether a given trace link exists between a single source artifact sxand a single target artifact ty.
given the nature of trace links e.g.
a link either does or does not exist we can model our prior as a distribution on the interval where indicates the presence of a link and indicates an absence.

d stage hyperprior figure plate diagram of comet s hbn .
.
a hierarchical bayesian network for traceability .in the context of this paper we will consider our likelihood observations to be the binary indication that a link exists according to a set of textual similarity measures and an empirically derived threshold value.
however given that we aim to model multiple factors that might influence traceability our model employs multiple priors called hyperpriors forming a hierarchical bayesian network hbn .
in this work we consider three priors corresponding to the three factors we wish to model i a normalized set of diverse textual similarity measures ii developer expertise and iii transitive trace links.
we assign each of these priors an initial probability distribution which is then influenced and estimated based upon observable data e.g.
a developer confirming or denying a trace link .
once this network is established the posterior can be computed via one of several estimation techniques.
by modeling these three information sources our technique is able to largely overcome the limitations enumerated in sec.
.
hbns are also highly extensible via adjustments to the prior s .
thus our defined model be capable of adapting to advancements in textual similarity measures or considering new development artifacts from future development workflows.
inferring trace links with a hierarchical bayesian network in this section we provide a formal description of comet s probabilistic model introduced at a high level in sec.
.
.
to help aid in the comprehension of comet s underlying model we provide a graphical representation using plate notation in fig.
which we use to guide our introduction and discussion.
the model in fig.
1is computed on a per link basis that is between all potential links between a set of source s and target artifacts t .
in this section we will use sxandtyto refer to a single source and target artifact of interest respectively.
comet s probabilistic model is formally structured as an hbn centered upon a trace link prior which represents the model s prior belief about the probability that sx andtyare linked.
our model is hierarchical as the trace link prior is influenced by a number of hyperpriors which are constructedin accordance with a set of hyper parameters that are either derived empirically or fixed.
in fig.
hyperpriors are represented as empty nodes and hyper parameters are represented as shaded blue nodes.
in general empty nodes represent latent or hidden variables whereas shaded nodes represent variables that are known or empirically observed quantities.
the rectangles or plates in the diagram are used to group together variables that repeat.
to make our model easier to comprehend we have broken it down into four major configurations which we call stages indicated by different colors in fig.
.
the first stage of our model shown in blue at top unifies the collective knowledge of textual similarity metrics computed by ir ml techniques.
the second stage shown in orange at the bottom reconciles expert feedback to improve the accuracy of inferred trace links.
the third stage shown in green in the middle accounts for transitive relationships among development artifacts and the fourth stage combines each of the underlying stages.
it should be noted that the first stage of our model can be taken as the base case upon which the other complexities build and is always required to infer the existence of a trace link.
the order of calculation starts with the first stage and proceeds sequentially.
the design and parameterization of our model presented in this section is not arbitrary but instead based on the well founded theory of conjugate priors which aids in defining appropriate distributions and hyperparameters for a given prior.
we center the description of our model first upon the likelihood estimation and then around the estimation of the prior probability distribution as defined by the four stages.
after defining the hyperpriors for each of the four stages we briefly discuss the inference techniques we employ to estimate the posterior probability distribution of our model and thus the probability of whether a given link exists.
while this section provides an overview of our model we discuss its instantiation including utilized ir ml techniques in sec.
.
.
.
estimating the likelihood the likelihood function in our hbn models observed data so that these observations can be reconciled with our estimated prior probability distribution to infer a posterior probability.
the likelihood is shown as the observed variable y .
the variable irepresents the number of observations made.
in the context of traceability we express the likelihood as a discrete bernoulli distribution as two artifacts can either be linked or not linked y p li i bern li i where liis an observable data point 1forinumber of observations.
we define an observation as a function of the textual similarity score generated by an ir technique between sxandtyand some threshold kiwhere any similarity above the threshold is considered an observed link and any similarity value below this threshold is considered a non link.
the number of ir techniques or configurations utilized corresponds to the number of observations i. ideally to capture the most accurate trace link observations from ir techniques the threshold kishould be chosen to maximize the chance that each ir technique correctly establishes whether two artifacts are linked.
in other words kishould be chosen for each ir technique such that the precision and recall of the technique is maximal across the entire set of considered source and target artifacts s andt.
however this information is not available a priori without 876improving the effectiveness of traceability link recovery using hierarchical bayesian networks icse may seoul republic of korea the consultation of a ground truth set of trace links.
as we illustrate in sec.
5this threshold can often be estimated with surprising accuracy by analyzing the distribution of similarity values an ir technique produces for a given set of artifacts.
.
stage unifying textual similarities between development artifacts the first base stage of our model informs the trace link prior represented as a probability distribution p according to the textual similarity measurements of a set of ir techniques.
however converse to the likelihood estimation the actual textual similarity values of ir techniques are directly used to estimate a beta distribution the conjugate prior of the likelihood s bernoulli distribution .
this beta distribution is represented as follows b where and are parameters of the beta distribution representing its mean and variance.
this prior and its two parameters are illustrated in the right most part of the blue segment .
to inform this beta distribution the textual similarity of values of a given number iof ir ml techniques are normalized according to a sigmoid function centered upon the median of the distribution of similarity values across all sandtin a given dataset.
then a logistic regression is performed upon the normalized similarity values to infer the values and which define a hyperprior beta distribution i r. this hyperprior with parameters are shown on the left of the blue segment .
the mean and the variance of this hyperprior distribution then inform and of the base prior var mean thus by considering the textual similarity values of a set of ir techniques our model can effectively reconcile the collective knowledge to ultimately make an informed prediction.
.
stage incorporating developer feedback the second stage of our model is capable of leveraging human feedback by influencing the prior distribution introduced in the first stage of our model.
to model expert feedback we estimate hyperpriors dand d shown in orange in fig.
.
to perform this estimation our model accepts from a developer or analyst their confidence that a given link exists as a value between .
in section .7we illustrate how such feedback can be collected from developers in a lightweight manner.
this confidence value serves as a parameter for estimating the distribution of the first hyperprior d b d c sd .
where dis a beta distribution parameterized by its mean dset to the confidence value provided by a developer and standard deviation sdwhich we set to .
signaling a low variance in the derived beta distribution.
this distribution then parameterizes the second hyperprior d modeled as a bernoulli distribution.
now that we have derived a distribution representing developer feedback we must define how this distribution affects the prior probability of the first stage of our model.
to do this we define reward and penalty functions and that are influenced by which represents a specified belief factor between that controls the extent to which the feedback influences the trace link prior.
the reward function is defined as d whereas the penalty function is latexit sha1 base64 gr9la ciemh qff04yo q6mlm7k aaacbxicbvc7sgnbfj31gemramkzgasrsbselym2lhhma5ilze7uzsfm7iwzd4uqutva6j yia3f4s

where the mean of the first stage prior is represented as a normal distribution parameterized by nset to the sum of and and a standard deviation set to .

thus in this manner expert feedback is utilized to influence the prior distribution that a given trace link exists.
the structure of the stage hyperpriors allows comet s hbn to effectively consider feedback from multiple developers.

stage leveraging transitive links as discussed earlier the probability that a trace link exists between a source and target artifact can be influenced by transitive relationships among varying software development artifacts.
the third stage of comet s hbn is able to utilize these transitive links to improve the accuracy of its inferred trace link.
however before we describe how our model reconciles this information in a probabilistic manner it is first important to understand the phenomena of transitive links.
at a high level a transitive link is an inherent relationship between two software artifacts a1 a2 that may influence the existence of a trace link between either a1and any other artifact ora2and any other artifact.
comet is currently capable of leveraging two types of transitive links one based on textual similarities req.

and one based on dynamic execution information req.

however comet could also be extended to model transitive relationships between other types of artifacts such as commit messages or issues.
fig.
2provides an illustration of both transitive link types which we detail below.
note that for execution traces a relationship is considered strong between a test method and source method if the test executes the method and weak otherwise.
for req req relationships it is strong if the textual similarity is above the threshold and weak if it is below the threshold.

consider the scenario in which the relationship between s1andt1is weak but s1is highly similar to the other two requirements s2ands3.
given that we know the three source artifacts are highly related the relationships between s2 t1ands3 t1 have a transitive influence on the target relationship between s1and t1.
for instance if s2 t1ands3 t1both indicate strong probabilities then likewise the probability of the target link s1 t1 should be increased to account for these transitive relationships.

incorporating transitive links into comet s hbn .in order for our hbn to incorporate transitive req.
req.
links it must first derive the set of requirements that are related to a given target requirement sx.
to accomplish this one of several ir techniques can be used to compute textual similarity or the first stage of our model can be used to derive the relationships illustrated as s s1 s2 s s1 s3 in fig.
.
to incorporate information from req.
test case links dynamic information must be collected that provides the exec exec 2relationships illustrated in fig.
.
in either case a specified threshold signals whether a pair of requirements is related and the total number of related requirements or test cases is specified by the hyper parameter .
once the related requirements have been derived our hbn estimates three hyperpriors wt bmix and trans .
first wtis formulated as a dirichlet distribution according to the number of related transitive requirements.
then to estimate bmix the first stage of our hbn is computed between each related requirement and a given target artifact ty.
the inferred values for each transitive link and wtare used to form a mixture model bmix mix wt where bmixis a beta mixture model parameterized by the 1st stage inference of each transitive link and weights modeled as a dirichlet distribution parameterized by .
this dirichlet distribution is then used to derive a meditated normal distribution trans trans bmix mean where mean represents the mean of the probability distribution of ir similarity values from stage on the trace link prior and is represents the belief factor of the transitive links e.g.
the degree to which the transitive relationships should affect overall prior trace link probability .
trans can then be utilized to derive the reward and penalty functions introduced earlier where trans whereas trans .
the reward and penalty functions can then in turn be used to influence the mean of trace link prior n n trans sd .

.
inferring the posterior in order to reason about the probability that a trace link exists we must estimate the posterior probability distribution of our hierarchical model p l according to the observable data land prior knowledge of the link p .
here p encompasses the trace link prior and all constituent hyperpriors depending upon the stage of the model.
once the posterior has been estimated comet utilizes themean of the distribution as the general probability that a link exists.
we can represent the general calculation of the posterior for our model using using bayes theorem as follows p l p p l p p l d p n i 1p li i where nrepresents the total number of observations i.e.
the number of underlying ir techniques and configurations .
comet s hbn is non trivial and thus the posterior p l cannot be computed analytically.
therefore we turn to approximation techniques for estimating the posterior probability distribution.
comet can currently utilize three different techniques including i maximum a posteriori map estimation a markov chain monte carlo mcmc technique via the no u turn sampling nuts process and a machine learning based technique called variational inference vi .
we provide experimental results in sec.
6for all techniques for stage of comet s model and nuts map for stages as vi cannot be applied to more complex stages of the model.
.
the c omet python library jenkins plugin we implemented the four stages of comet s hbn in an extensible traceability library written in python3 .
in order to explore the practical applicability of comet we implemented the first two stages ofcomet s hbn as a jenkins plugin.
we did not implement the final two stages due to time limitations but are actively working on this in partnership with cisco.
this plugin was developed by one of the authors during an internship with cisco systems in close collaboration with researchers engineers and analysts.
the code and extensive documentation for the comet library and plugin is available in our online appendix .
.
.
an illustrated use case of the comet plugin .fig.3provides a general overview of the comet plugin architecture.
to illustrate the utility of the plugin we describe its workflow from the viewpoint of a developer.
as depicted in fig.
the plugin is triggered when developers commit changes to a given project 878improving the effectiveness of traceability link recovery using hierarchical bayesian networks icse may seoul republic of korea figure comet jenkins plugin traceability report configured to utilize our traceability plugin in jenkins.
the commit triggers a job that checks out compiles and executes the project code according to our industrial partner s existing ci pipeline.
as illustrated in fig.
our plugin parses and preprocesses the source code test code and requirement text to be analyzed with comet once the normal ci s build flow finishes.
the preprocessed corpora of requirements code and tests are then passed to the comet library where the first stage of the hbn configured according to the tuning datasets described in sec.
is run to establish an initial set of trace links among artifacts.
note that our plugin can be configured to run according to varying intervals e.g.
every minor or major release .
given that our plugin supports the first two stages of comet s hbn it is capable of collecting feedback from developers to improve trace links.
to do this developers select an option from a dropdown likert scale with each option representing a potential value of dfor stage of comet s hbn strongly agree .

to ensure a responsive feedback mechanism to reflect developer feedback the stage link probabilities are precomputed.
once the plugin job finishes it generates an interactive traceability page that allows a developer or analyst to view inferred trace links and provide feedback.
as shown in fig.
4the blue rectangle highlights a drop down menu that allows a developer to filter inferred trace links by type i.e.
req src req test cases src test cases and artifacts not linked .
the drop down menu highlighted in red allows developers to filter trace links according to the inferred probability ranges of incomet s hbn including probably linked i.e.

and unsure representing links where the model is unable to make a confident inference i.e.

the area highlighted in green lists the types of selected source and target artifacts allowing the user to easily inspect candidate trace links as well as provide feedback on the inferences.
when a developer clicks on the feedback link for a given pair of artifacts a popup window allows them to select one of the likert options delineated earlier.
finally the traceability page also allows developers to view artifacts that are not linked to any other artifacts and thus may be suspicious.
additional screenshots detailing the workflow of the comet plugin are available in our online appendix .

comet s complexity scalability .we have designed thecomet plugin and library to facilitate easy integration into modern automated ci cd systems via a set of higher level apis that abstracts much of the complexity of the model for most users while still providing mechanisms for advanced users to tweak parameters.
furthermore comet was able to be successfully deployed into a commercial ci pipeline for a pilot project with our industrialtable datasets used for comet s evaluation.

we have also designed the comet plugin and library to be highly scalable.
trace link probabilities between each pair of artifacts can be calculated independently making the process highly parallelizable.
thus we implemented parallel process management using theano into the comet library allowing computation to scale across modern multi core machines.
to further optimize performance the comet plugin can makex use of change analysis in git to only recompute trace link values for artifacts that have been altered since the last computation.
design of the experiments to evaluate comet we perform an extensive empirical evaluation with two major goals i evaluate the effectiveness of the four stages ofcomet s hbn in terms of their ability to effectively infer trace links and ii examine whether comet is applicable in industrial workflows.
the quality focus of our study is comet s effectiveness in terms of generating an accurate and complete set of trace links and practical applicability.
we formulate the following set of rqs rq1 how effective is comet at inferring candidate trace links using combined information from ir ml techniques?
rq2 to what extent does expert feedback impact the accuracy of the candidate trace links of comet?
rq3 to what extent does information from transitive links improve comet s trace link inference accuracy?
rq4 how effective is the holistic comet model in terms of inferring candidate trace links?
rq5 do professional developers and security analysts find our implementation of the comet jenkins plugin useful?

experimental context .

subject datasets .the context of this empirical study includes the eight datasets shown in table .
six of these are taken from the open source coest community datasets .
these datasets represent a set of benchmarks created by the research community and widely used as an effective assessment tool for automated traceability techniques .
in order to maintain the quality of our experimental subjects we do not use all available projects in the coest repository as we limited our studied systems to those that i included trace links from requirements or use cases written in natural language to some form of code artifact ii were written in english and or included english translations and iii had at least 1k loc.
we utilize two datasets to investigate and tune the hyper parameters of comet s hbn albergate and the rq tests dataset of the ebt project.
we utilize the other six datasets for our 879icse may seoul republic of koreak.

the subject system called libest is an open source networking related software project which was created and is actively maintained by engineers at cisco as an implementation of rfc enrollment over secure transport .
we derived the ground truth set of trace links between rq src and rq tests for this dataset in close collaboration with our industrial partner.
first one of the authors carefully created an initial set of trace links.
then an engineer working on the project reviewed the links and confirmed or denied a subset based on their availability.
the author then revised the links using the engineer s feedback and this process continued over several months until the ground truth was established.
the libest dataset is available along with all of our experimental data to facilitate reproducibility .
.
.
studied ir techniques .the base first stage of comet s hbn is able to utilize and unify information regarding the textual similarity of development artifacts as computed by a set of ir ml techniques.
while there is technically no limit to the number of ir ml techniques that can be utilized we parameterized our experiments using ten ir techniques enumerated in table .
the first five techniques are standalone techniques whereas the second five are combined techniques utilizing the methodology introduced by gethers et al.
.
this combined approach normalizes the similarity measures of two ir techniques and combines the similarity measures using a weighted sum.
we set the weighting factor for each technique equal to .
as this was the best performing configuration reported in the prior work .
we explain the differences between the technique employed by gethers et.
al.
and comet in sec.
.
the other parameters for each of the techniques were derived by performing a series of experiments on the two tuning datasets and using the optimal values from these experiments.
for all ir techniques we preprocessed the text by removing non alphabetic characters and stop words stemming and splitting camelcase.
we performed trials for each technique involving lda and chose the number of topics that led to optimal performance on our tuning projects.
to aid in experimental reproducibility complete configurations for each technique are listed in our online appendix .
.
rq comet performance w combined ir ml techniques to answer rq we ran the first stage of comet s hbn on our six evaluation datasets using the ten ir ml techniques enumerated in table .
however as explained in section .
in order to accurately estimate the likelihood function ywe need to choose a threshold kifor each ir technique that maximizes the precision and recallof the trace links according to the computed textual similarity values.
to derive the best method for determining the threshold for each ir technique we performed a meta evaluation on our two tuning datasets.
we examined five different threshold estimation techniques i using the mean of all similarity measures for a given dataset ii using the median of all similarity measures across a given dataset iii using a min max estimation iv a sigmoid estimation and v link estimation link est where an estimation of the number of confirmed links for a dataset is made based on the number of artifacts and a threshold derived to ensure that the estimated number of links is above that threshold.
we performed each of these threshold estimation techniques for all studied ir techniques across our two tuning datasets and compared each estimation to the known optimal threshold.
we used the optimal technique across our two tuning datasets as reported in table .
to aid in reproducibility we provide a detailed account of these experiments in our online appendix .
to provide a comparative baseline against which we can measure comet s performance we report results for the best performing and median of the studied ir ml techniques optimally configured for each dataset.
we chose to optimally configure the baseline techniques even though such configurations would not be possible in practice due to the absence of a ground truth in order to illustrate how close comet can come to the best case baseline scenario .
to provide a comprehensive comparison of comet to a state of the art technique for candidate trace link generation we reimplemented the dl based approach proposed by guo et al.
.
however it should be noted that the intended purpose of this dl approach and comet differ.
the dl technique proposed by guo et al.
was intended to be both trained and evaluated on a single project that contains a set of pre existing trace links the model can be trained upon and was quite effective in improving the accuracy of trace links in this scenario.
however as pre existing trace links may not always exist comet does not require them for analysis.
instead our experiments aim to illustrate that comet can accurately infer trace links when tuned on one small set of projects and applied to others.
therefore we design an experimental setup where both techniques are applied on projects without pre existing trace links.
thus we train the dl approach on our two tuning projects using the optimal parameters reported in .
our main goal in comparing with this dl technique is to illustrate the performance of a recent ml based technique applied to comet s intended cold start use case.
in order to measure the performance of our studied techniques for inferring trace links we utilize three main metrics precision recall and average precision ap similar to prior work that evaluates automated traceability techniques .
given that candidate link generation techniques infer a probability or similarity that a trace link exists a threshold similarity or probability value must be chosen to make the final inference.
in order to summarize the performance of our studied techniques we calculate the average precision as a weighted mean of precisions per threshold ap n rn rn pnwhere pnandrnare the precision and recall at the nth threshold.
thus the ap provides a metric by which we can quantitatively compare the performance of different approaches.
for the results of comet we report the highest ap achieved by the posterior estimation techniques outlined in sec.
880improving the effectiveness of traceability link recovery using hierarchical bayesian networks icse may seoul republic of korea .
.
in addition to ap we also provide precision recall p r curves to illustrate the trade off between precision and recall at different threshold values.
curves further away from the origin of the graph indicate better performance.
in lieu of a non parametric statistical test as suggested by recent work we perform a confidence interval analysis between our baseline techniques and stage ofcomet by calculating the standard error across different threshold values applying bootstrapping where necessary.
thus if one technique outperforms another within the bounds of our calculated error it serves as a strong indication of statistical significance.
.
rq comet performance w expert feedback collecting actual developer feedback on trace links for each of our test datasets was not possible given the time constraints on developers from our industrial partner and we did not have access to the developers of the other projects.
thus in order to evaluate stage ofcomet s hbn we simulated developer feedback by randomly sampling of the artifact pairs from each studied subject and used the ground truth to provide a confidence level for each of the sampled links.
to accomplish this we provided the model with a confidence value cof .
if a link existed in the ground truth and .
if the link did not exist.
however even trace links derived from experts can be error prone.
hence we performed three types of experiments to simulate imperfect links being suggested to our model.
that is for the set of randomly sampled links we intentionally reversed the confidence values according to the ground truth for and of the sampled links respectively to simulate varying degrees of human error in providing link feedback.
in other words we sampled a small number of trace links from the ground truth and then used these links to confirm deny links predicted by comet i.e.
if a ground truth link existed and comet predicted it then it was confirmed .
because developers may not be correct all of the time we simulated this by randomly flipping the sampled ground truth which has a similar effect to a developer incorrectly classifying certain predicted links.
we set the value for the belief factor of the developer feedback .
.
for these experiments we illustrate the impact of developer feedback on ap and p r curves for only the sampled links.
in addition to the baseline ir techniques described in the procedure for rq we also compare our results from stage of the model to stage to illustrate the relative improvement.

rq comet performance w transitive links to measure the impact that transitive links have on the trace link inference performance of stage of comet s hbn we examined the impact of transitive links between requirements as described in sec.
.
.
we utilize transitive requirement links rather than transitive links established by execution traces as only one of our datasets libest had executable test cases.
to derive the transitive relationships between artifacts we computed the vsm similarity among all source documents for each dataset e.g.
requirements use cases and explored two values for the threshold .
and .
.
we derived these thresholds by examining the total number of transitively linked requirements in our tuning datasets to achieve a balance between too many and too few requirements being linked.

rq comet industrial case study given that the ultimate goal of designing comet is for the approach to automate trace link recovery within industry we perform a case study with our industrial partner.
this case study consisted of two major parts.
first we conducted a feedback session with six experienced developers who have been contributing to the libest subject program.
this session consisted of a roughly minute presentation introducing the comet jenkins plugin.
then the developers were asked to use the plugin which had been configured for libest and evaluate the links and non links for which the model was most confident i.e.
the highest and lowest inferred probabilities .
then after using the tool they were asked a set of likert based user experience ux questions derived from the sus usability scale by brooke .
additionally participants were asked free response user preference questions based on the honeycomb originally introduced by morville .
second we conducted semi structured interviews with two groups consisting of roughly engineering managers who specialize in auditing software for security assurance.
during these interviews a video illustrating the comet plugin was shown and a discussion was conducted with the questions illustrated in fig.
.
we report results from both studies.

statistically significant degree according to the confidence intervals.
in some cases such as for itrust libest and etour stage of comet significantly outperforms the median ir ml baseline and approaches the performance of the best ir ml baseline.
fig.
5a illustrates the p r curve for the itrust project with performance that outpaces the best ir ml technique particularly for lower recall values.
comet also outperforms the state of the art dl approach across all subjects likely because the dl approach had difficulty generalizing semantic relationships across datasets.
these results signal remarkably strong performance for comet s stage model.
recall that the stage model only utilizes observations taken from the set of ten ir ml techniques introduced in sec.
.
thus the fact that the stage model was able to consistently outperform the median ir ml baselines and in some cases nearly match the best ir ml baseline.
this indicates that comet s hbn is capable of effectively combining the observations from the underlying ir ml techniques for improved inference power.
this is significant as currently practitioners cannot know a priori which ir ml technique for traceability will perform best on a given project without pre existing trace links.
thus by combining the collective information of several ir techniques comet s first stage hbn is able to perform consistently well achieving reasonably high performance across projects lending to the credibility of using comet for projects that do not contain preexisting links.
.
rq 2results comet stage performance the ap for for stage of comet across all subject programs for both and error rates is given in table .
the results indicate that stage of comet s hbn is able to effectively incorporate expert feedback to improve the accuracy of its trace link inferences as the stage model dramatically outperforms the median and best ir ml techniques as well as the first stage of the model with a simulated error rate of .
even for the larger error rate of we see stage outperform stage for libest rq src libest rq tests and ebt while it slightly underperforms the stage model for the other subjects.
these results illustrate that stage ofcomet s hbn is able to effectively utilize expert feedback to improve its inferences even in the presence of significant noise.

this table also includes the median of the baseline ir ml techniques as well as the comet stage model ap results for the set of links affected by transitive relationships hence the differing stage columns .
the results show that in general for .
forcomet s stage model the accuracy of comet s inferred trace links improve with four of the six datasets showing improvements.
for .55the results generally exhibit similar or slightly worse performance compared to stage .
the fact that the higher value of led to better performance improvements is not surprising as this parameter essentially controls the degree of relatedness required to consider transitive relationships.
thus a higher value of means that only highly similar transitive requirement relationships are considered by comet s model.
using a lower value for this parameter might introduce noise by incorporating transitive relationships between artifacts that don t have as high a degree of similarity.
the libest rq src dataset exhibited decreased performance for .
however this is likely because the requirements for this industrial dataset are based on formal format from the internet engineering task force ietf .
the somewhat repetitive nature of the language used in these requirements could lead to non related requirements being transitively linked leading to a decrease in performance.
this suggests leveraging transitive relationships between requirements leads to larger performance gains for more unique language.
overall our results indicate that comet s stage model improves the accuracy of links for a majority of subjects.

rq 5results industrial case study fig.6provides the responses to the likert based ux questions from the six developers who work on the libest project after interacting with the comet plugin.
overall the responses from these developers were quite positive.
they generally agreed the comet plugin easy to use and understand but more importantly generally found the accuracy of the inferred links and non links to be accurate.
additionally we highlight representative responses to the user experience questions in this section and provide the survey questions with response summaries in our online appendix in accordance with the nda established with our industrial partner.
overall the developer responses were encouraging indicating the practical need for approaches like comet.
for instance one developer stated their need for such a tool i really want a tool that could look at test cases and requirements and tell me the coverage.
that way the team can know whether we are missing functionality or not.
another developer explained the need for a feature that incorporates developer feedback stating the importance of the ability to describe or explain how the code matches up with the code for future reference.
discussion comments about such explanation as different developers might see links that others don t whereas another developer stated being able to provide feedback is useful and seeing it update the percentage immediately was nice.
this indicates that the support for developer feedback and responsiveness of the comet plugin inherently useful.
developers also found the traceability report to be useful with most criticism suggesting practical ui improvements.
for instance developers appreciated the fact that there were the three different options for viewing the traceability between different and the ability to bring up the specific requirement quickly in the same window.
.
these responses illustrate the utility that developers saw in the comet plugin.
given that these developers had little automated support for traceability tasks they appreciated any automated assistance.we also collected feedback that validated the importance of the practical use cases that the comet plugin enabled.
in these interviews the teams generally stated that comet would be very useful for code auditing as one manager stated that it would allow compliance analysts to links look at the code and validate .
furthermore a team responsible for security audits of systems found an interesting use case for comet that is often overlooked in traceability analysis.
that is they were interested in code and requirements that are not linked to any other artifact as such artifacts are likely to be suspicious and should be inspected further.
in this case comet s inferences of non links would be just as important as the inferences of links.
overall the interviewed teams saw great promise in comet and expressed interest in adoption.
threats to validity similar to past work on automated trace link recovery approaches our work exhibits two main threats to validity.
the first of these threats is to external validity.
we utilize a limited number of systems to carry out our evaluation of comet and thus it is possible that our results may not generalize to other systems.
however the systems utilized in our evaluation have been widely used in past work and are of varying sizes and domains.
we also examine one industrial grade open source project developed by our partner.
the second threat to validity that affects experimental evaluation concerns construct validity and more specifically the accuracy of the ground truth for our subjects and our implementation of the dl approach by guo et al.
.
we cannot guarantee that the ground truth links for all of subjects are perfectly accurate.
however the ground truth sets for the coest datasets have been accepted by several pieces of prior work .
the ground truth for libest was derived by a team of the authors and was validated with the help of industrial developers working on the project see sec.
.
.
we re implemented guo et al.
s dl approach closely following the details of the paper although a full replication was not possible due to previous use of proprietary industrial dataset.
we will release our code for this approach to aid in reproducibility.
another potential threat to validity is that our simulation of developer feedback in answering rq 2is not representative of real feedback.
due to constraints on developers time we could not use real feedback however we believe simulating a small number of links using the ground truth complete with error rates represents a reasonable approximation.
conclusion future work we have presented comet which takes a probabilistic view of the traceability problem and models the existence of traceability links using a hierarchical bayesian network.
we have shown that comet performs more consistently than ir ml techniques and has promising industrial applicability.
we plan to adapt comet to new information sources investigate tailoring comet s analysis to infer security related links and further deploy the comet plugin with our industrial collaborators for feedback.
