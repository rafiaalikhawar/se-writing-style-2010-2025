.
control basedself adaptivesystems in recent years control based self adaptive systems became a research hotspot for its lessburden on the developers mathematicalandsoftwareknowledgetodesignad hoc self adaptation solutions.
filieri et al.
first propose a methodology i.e.
the push button method to implement control sass whichincludesasystematicdatacollectionandmodelfittingprocedure a.k.a.
system identification and a control theory guided controller designing procedure a.k.a.
controller synthesis .
the identificationprocedureenablestheautomaticconstructionofan approximatemodelforthemanagedsystem andthesynthesized controller provides theoretical guarantees to the derived managing system sbehaviorincontrolling adaptation.
specifically insystemidentification control sassassumethat the managed system s behavior can be captured by aquantitative nominalmodel toimproveproductivityandcopewithinfinitekinds of environmental dynamics.
a nominal model describes the relationship between the managed system s output the controller s output and the environmental input.
many types of nominal models havebeenproposedtosupportself adaptationinvarious scenarios including linear time invariant system linear time varyingsystem andnonlineartime invariantsystem .
incontrollersynthesis control sassleveragevariouscontroltheoretical techniques to design the optimal controllers for various scenarios.
two of the most prevailing techniques are proportionalintegral derivative pid control and model predictive control .
a controller s workflow resembles the conventionalself adaptationmechanismthatconsistsofcontinuous adaptation loops of monitoring analyzing planning and executing.
a controller s behavior should be subject to the control properties forexample thesasoproperties i.e.

here weusetheswatsystemtoexplaintheconceptsofcontrolsass.
swat is a fully operational scaled down water treatment plant that produces doubly filtered drinking water.
swat consists offivewater processingtanks aswellasthepipesconnectingthose tanks.thein comingvalveandout goingvalveofeachtankcanbe controlled remotely.

tobuildsuchaself adaptiveswatsystemfollowingthecontrolsass methodology we can use the following linear time invariant systemto describe the swat insystemidentification.
braceleftbigg vecx k a vecx k b vecu k y k c vecx k where k denotes a serial number of the adaption loop.
for the variables vecx k describes swat s current running state i.e.

the parameters in equation includinga b andc are identified for thesystem since theirvalues cannot be measured directly.

based on the identified parameter values swat s developers provide a suite of well designed controllers to enable the system s adaptation to different environmental situations.
these controllers leverage both control theory and rule based domain knowledge to guide the control strategies of various valves.
concretely there are a total of six controllers.

model deviation in control based self adaptivesystems modeldeviation underminescontrol sass.modeldeviationisthe mismatchbetweenthenominalmodel sidentifiedparametervalues and its actual values at runtime.
the occurrence of model deviation may invalidate the theoretical guarantees provided by control theory and could potentially cause the abnormal behavior of a control sas.
letusconsidertworeal worldcasesofmodeldeviationinswat.
the first one is reported by adepu et al.
that network attacks could cause swat s abnormal behavior .
for instance if the controller s signal of turning on a valve is blocked or tampered with thevalves openingtimewillbechangedaccordingly.then whenthecontrolledtank swaterlevelexceedsanalarminglevel the corresponding controller will still control the valves according to the unchanged bvalueandcause tankoverflow.
inthesecondcase thephysicalconditionofswat spipesand valves will also lead to model deviation.

as we discussed in section the challenge is to balance the detection s timeliness and accuracy.
existing works fail to balance this in detecting model deviation.
for the sliding windowbased approaches that have been exploited long by self adaptive researchers theirperformancelargelydependsonmanual or empirical settings e.g.

for those newly proposedlearning basedapproaches theyusually combine multiple test results for improving their detection accuracy which prolongs their detection delay.

first mod2 fundamentally decreases its detection delay by deriving the nominal model s parameter values withbayesianestimation.second mod2improvesitsestimation accuracyanddetectionaccuracywithtwosupportingtechniques namely uncertaintycompensationand saferegion quantification.
third mod2 further reduces the time overhead of its estimation anddetectionbykalmanfilterandprobability basedquantification respectively.

to improve its accuracy the approach requires a priori information about the parameter sdistribution i.e.

bayesianestimation works inan iterativemanner.ineachiteration wefirstcomputea priordistributionoftheconcernedparameterthatmatchesthepastobservations and the identified distribution.
then the prior is combined with the current observationsto obtain a posterior distribution which is reportedas the currentestimationvalue.

modeldeviation .
we focus on two types of model deviation discretebehaviorandinaccurateenvironmentalinteraction following the two reported cases in our motivating example of swat.
one occurs when a controller produces its control signals e.g.
block or tamper with the instruction to open the valves and the other occurs when the managed system receives the control signals e.g.
water flowchanging dueto physical abrasion .
basedonthetwotypesofmodeldeviation inthiswork wefocus onthedeviationofthemanagedsystem scontrollabilityfeatures i.e.
the parameter b and assume that the managed system s delay and observability features i.e.
parameter aandc are comparatively stable.
recent literatures report and validate the deviation ofthe controllability features.
wealsoassumethat b i isaunaryparameterforeaseofpresentation.nevertheless ourapproachcanbeappliedtoamultinary parameter.environmental uncertainty .
environmentaluncertaintyisthe known unknown information at runtime .
as a result one has to model the target uncertainty first before addressing it.
in thispaper weassumethattheenvironmentaluncertaintycanbe described by a linear time invariant model or a normal distribution.
the former is a widely used approach in describing uncertain environmentalinputbythecontroltheory andthelatter is a typical setting for describing uncertainty s influence among self adaptive systems .
anadaptation supervision mechanism to address the problem of model deviation this paper proposes an adaptation supervisionmechanismtosupervisetheexecutionof control sassasshowninfigure .intuitively weaddedanewparallelsupervisionloop toacontrol sas.thesupervisorcontinuously monitorstheadaptationloop.whenmodeldeviationisdetected thesupervisorimmediately fallsback toasafer butlessefficient mandatorycontrollerandrecoverstothemaincontrolloopafter successfulmodelre identification.
the supervisor consists of three major components a modelguided deviation detector mod2 which is this paper s primary focus amandatorycontroller andaswitcher.underlinedblocks infigure 1denotethesenewlyaddedcomponents.
in the adaption supervision mechanism we first require the system designer to provide a mandatory controller that guarantees minimalsystemfunctionality i.e.
mandatoryrequirements even on nominal model deviation.
mandatory controllers have been extensively studied by the community of control sass e.g.
by adoptingarchitectural guided orgoal driven rules .
withbothcontroltheory basedoptimalcontrollerandmandatorycontroller the switchercoordinatesthemonthemod2.the switcher immediately changes the adaptation loop from using the optimal controller to using the mandatory controller on model deviation to reduce the unpredictable influences to a minimum.
the switcher is also responsible for consistently conducting model re identificationandturningbacktotheoptimalcontrollerwhen the abnormal situation has disappeared e.g.
the network attack of 171timely andaccuratedetectionof model deviationin self adaptive software intensive systems esec fse august 23 28 athens greece swatwasblockedbyafirewall .theswitchercanbeimplemented following the pushbuttonmethod .
therefore thedesignofanefficientandeffectivemodel deviation detector our mod2 should be the key point.
mod2 model guided deviation detector thethreemajortechnicaldesigns andcontributions oftheproposedmod2are mod2directlyestimatesthenominalmodel sparametervalues by modeling the nominal model s parameter bas atimevariant stochastic variable b k .
in contrast with existing work whichismostlybasedontheobservableoutputs y k this white box approach accelerates the model deviation detection andimproves the accuracy.
mod2compensatesenvironmentaluncertainty inthenominal modelbyintroducingcompensationtermstoreducetheconsequences of measurement errors yielding improved modeldeviation estimation accuracy.
mod2 adopts the kalman filter afastbayesianestimator toaccelerateitsestimation onthe parametervalues.
mod2directly quantifies the nominal model s theoretical safe regionwithout the need for calibrating an empirical threshold based on execution traces of the managed system.
by usingthenecessaryconditionsunderwhichmodeldeviation canmakethecontrollerbehaveabnormally mod2directly and thus timely reports model deviation with sufficient probabilisticconfidence.
thesetechnical details are elaboratedas follows.
.
parameterdeviation estimation wefirstdescribetheconcernedmodelparameter basatime variant stochasticvariable b k b k b k b b k q k where the parameter s deviation is described as the sudden changes of centripetal force that driveb k away from identified b. the parameter s inherent fluctuation is described as a random walk procedure the step of which subjects to a normal distribution q k .
if the system is free from model deviation i.e.
thevarianceof q k equalstothevarianceof b k which can be acquiredalongwiththe identification of b. combiningequation 1andequation 2enablesmod2toestimate thevalueof b k inabayesianapproach.specifically inthe i th adaptationloop apriordistributionof b i iscomputedthatfitsthe previousposteriordistribution b i andidentifiedvarianceof q k according to equation .
then mod2 calibrates the posterior distribution of b i by updating the prior distribution of b i with the current observation i.e.
vecx i vecu i andy i according to equation .
notethatwemightnotbeabletoobservethevalueofsystem state vecx i directlyinsomecases.wealsousebayesianestimation toestimate vecx i svalue.inthissituation eachiterationofbayesian estimationhastwosteps.
mod2firstestimates vecx i svalue by treatingthepreviousestimated b i asanobservation.then theobtained vecx i isusedtoestimatethecurrentparametervalue b i .
.
uncertaintycompensation due to various environmental uncertainties a direct estimation ofb i svalueisusuallyinaccurate.toreduceuncertainty based errorsintheestimationsof b i werefinethenominalmodelby compensating for environmental uncertainty and accelerate our estimationwiththe kalman filter.
usingcompensationtermstorefineanominalmodelisawidelyusedtechniqueinthecontroltheorycommunity .however one has to carefully design the effective compensation terms.
here we introducethreedifferentcompensationterms.oneisthemeasured environmental input a k which can be used to posterior calibrate ourestimated b i svalue.weusealineartime invariantmodelto describe the influence brought byenvironmental input.
the other two compensation terms w k andv k capture the influences of measurement errors on the managed system s internal state and external behavior respectively.
according to our assumptions we depictw k andv k as normal distributionof variance wandv.
then the nominal model equation is refined with three compensation terms as follows.
braceleftbigg vecx k a vecx k b k vecu k a k w k y k c vecx k v k where is the coefficient of the linear model that describes a k .
thevalueof whichisacquiredduringsystemidentificationalong withothermodelparameters.
basedonequation mod2furtheralleviatestheimpactofmeasurementerrorbytransformingthenominalmodeltodifference equations.intheoriginalnominalmodel themeasurementerror onparametervalues e.g.
a ismultipliedbyothervariables e.g.
vecx k .asaresult alargevariablevaluewouldamplifythemeasurement error and make the following estimation less accurate.
mod2 uses the difference equation to address the impact of this multiplier effect.
if the managed system s behavior is free from severechanges avariable svaluesintwoconsecutiveadaptation loopsshouldnotdifferalot andthedifferenceequationcan thus alleviate the multiplier effect.
otherwise it could be easier for us to detect.
in this paper we use var k to denote the difference between variable var s values in the k th and k th adaptation loop i.e.
var k var k var k .
thus the difference equations ofthe nominalmodelare listedas follows.
braceleftbigg vecx k a vecx k b k vecu k a k w k y k c vecx k v k notice that if the controller s control signal keeps unchanged thedifferenceequationsareineffectivesincetheestimated bwill beeliminatedbymultiplyingzero vecu k vecu k vecu k .
in this situation we use the original nominal model to estimate b k svalueinstead ofthe difference equations.
with those compensation terms introduced it would be extremelytime consumingtoperformtheoriginalbayesianestimation.mod2acceleratesitsestimationbyusingkalmanfilter 172esec fse august 23 28 athens greece yanxiang tong yiqin yanyan jiang chang xu chun cao andxiaoxingma a more efficient linear quadratic estimation approach.
conceptually kalman filter works by updating the prior distribution of b i with the latest observation only i.e.
vecx i vecu i andy i insteadof re calculatingthepriori withall historicalobservations i.e.
vecx vecx i vecu vecu i andy y i .
mod2 s kalman filter parameter estimation also follows an iterative manner as the original bayesian estimation.
however it can give a more accurate normal distribution of the estimated parameters by filtering the effectsofcompensation terms i.e.
a i w i andv i .
.
saferegionquantification once the distribution of b i is estimated mod2 has to check whetheritsuffersmodeldeviationornot.wecombinethenominal model listed in equation 4with a theoretical safe region and use a cumulativedistributionfunctiontocalculatetheprobabilitythat b i sactualvalueexceedsthesaferegion.unlikeexistingworks thatuseamanualorempiricalthreshold mod2 ssaferegionrepresentsthenecessaryconditionunderwhichthecontroller sbehavior is guaranteed by control theory.
as a result mod2 would distinguishthe normal executions fromthe abnormalones even though theexecutionshavenotbeenempiricallyexploredandmakesits detection more accurate.
itisthecontrol theory which helps developersdesign the original controllers that shapes the safe regions for the derived controllers.
a controller s safe region can be captured by either formal analysis or experimental study.
for pid and mpc controllers their saferegioncanbetheoreticallyderivedbyfrequencyresponseanalysis and linear matrix inequality respectively.
how to captureatheoreticalsaferegionisoutofourscope.ifitisextremely hard to capture the theoretical saferegionofa complex controller we will turn back to empirical study or statistic analysis on the execution traces.
formally parameter b s safe region bcan be defined as the interval between a lower bound l band an upper bound u b. given a controller s safe region b b i s cross border detection can still be inaccurate due to the estimation error of b i s value.
most existing works combine possible results in different adaptationloopstoimprovetheiraccuracy whichinevitablydelays their detection.
mod2 s estimated distributions of the parameter value naturally combines the past observations and avoid using multi timedetections.
mod2 uses a probability based approach to detect b s deviation with a confidence interval ci.
the probability that b i s value falls within the safe region l b u b can be calculated by a cumulative distribution function as shown in equation wherefb k x isb k sprobability densityfunction.
particularly the estimated b i s distribution in our case is subject to a normal distribution i.e.
b i n i p i .
if the derived probability p i exceeds a confidence interval ci mod2 will report model deviation and trigger the switchingofadaptation.
p k l b u bfb k x dx mod2 also uses an active detector to handle the situation when the optimal controller produces no control signal by using hypothesis testing to reveal possible model deviation.
we use normaldistributiontodepictthevariationproperties e.g.
residuals ofthe managedsystem soutputwhennocontrolsignalcomesanddetect model deviation by checking whether the measured variation is consistent withthe pre identifieddistribution.
.
discussions on mod2 assumptions and limitations .
in section .4we listed our assumptionsinmod2design.now wediscussthelimitationsbrought bytheseassumptions aswellasthepossiblesolutionstofreeour approach from theseassumptions.
first weassume thatthe managedsystem snominalmodelis describedasaltimodel.ourapproachcanbedirectlyextended to other types of nominal models since the three major technicaldesignsofmod2areindependentofthetypesofthenominal model.
other types of models might make kalmar filter less effective due to their more complicated forms.
however extended kalman filter would alleviate this by supporting non linear or time variant nominalmodels.
second weassumethatthedeviatedparameteristhecontrollability parameter i.e.
b only and the parameter has a unary description.
since our parameter estimation on b k requires no more than the identified value of the other two parameters i.e.
a andc mod2 can also be extended to detect model deviation on one ofthese two parameters.
however detectingmodeldeviation on multiple parameters is challenging and remains open.
as we explainedpreviouslythat b sunarydescriptionisfortheeaseof discussion only mod2 can be applied to a multi unary parameter.
in fact in our later experiments we already run mod2 to detect modeldeviation onbinary parameters withsubjectswat .
third weassumethatthecompensateduncertaintytermscan bedescribedinnormaldistributions.thoughnormaldistribution can be applied to most types of uncertainties reported by recent literature our approach can adaptto other typesof uncertainty models by estimating model parameter value using other filters such as particlefilter.
parameterasstochasticvariable .
tothebestofourknowledge all existing works treat the nominal model s parameter as a deterministic variable.
different from these pieces of works mod2 considerstheconcernedparameterasastochasticvariable whichis the key to the estimation in our approach.
besides the parameter s mean value derived through system identification we additionally use the parameter s variance to make our estimation robust in handling the parameter s inherentfluctuation.
leveragingtheparameter svariancedoesnotbringasignificant burden to our approach.
in fact during system identification such varianceinformationisoncecollectedbuteventuallyoverlooked.
in system identification the parameter s value is derived based on a collection of execution traces of the managed system.
since different traces could infer different candidate parameter values linear regression is introduced to predict a parameter value that best fits all execution traces.
conventional system identification onlyreportsthisfittedvalue andthecandidatevaluesaresimply discarded.however whenthenominalmodel sparameteristreated as a stochastic variable those candidates actually reflect the inherent inflection of the parameter.

threatsto validity one major concern on the validity of our empirical conclusions istheselectionofevaluationsubjects.weonlyusethreesubjects as the managed systems.
this might harness the generalization of our conclusions.
a comprehensive evaluation requires a full understandingof themanaged systems as wellas theirsuitable control theory derivedcontrollers.thisrequirementrestrictsourchoice of possible experimental subjects.
nevertheless we believe that our selected subjects are representative of their different platforms including network systems and cyber physical systems and architectures including single controller and multiple controllers .
moreover all of the selected subjects are widely used by other selfadaptationresearchersastheirexperimentalsubjectsormotivating systems.
another concern is about injecting model deviations in the positiveconfigurations.sincewecannotdirectlymanifestthesubject system scontrollabilityfeatures wecanonlymodifyitsparameters or inputs to simulate model deviation.
this might make our experimental settings less realistic.
to address this problem we carefully design the injected model deviations.
for swat the model deviationisbasedonthereportedphysicalabrasion andnetwork attacks .
for rubis the model deviation is designed accordingtoreportedfailuresinwebservicesystems .andforvideo encoder we use real world video streams to simulate the model deviation.

together with these works that address slight deviation of the model parameters we can achieve model deviation free self adaptation forcontrol sass.
the key component of our proposed mechanism is a timely and accuratedetectorformodeldeviation whichissimilartotheworks onabnormaldetection.manyresearcheffortshavebeencontributed to both control theory community and self adaptation community.

qinetal.usecontextinformationtorefinethederivedinvariants and combine multiple testing results to improve the accuracy of abnormal detection .
aswe discussedinsection the majordifference betweenour mod2 and these approaches is that we directly estimate the values of nominal model s parameters instead of monitoring the system s output values.
by so we reduce the delay time for model deviation detection.

however the focus of our mod2 is on the uncertainty s impact on the nominal model s parameters which is addressedbyour parameterdeviation estimationtechnique.
conclusion in this paper we present an adaptation supervision mechanism withtheadditionof supervisionloop foralleviatingtheimpactof model deviation in control sass.
the key to our mechanism is a noveldetector mod2 whichcombinesdifferenttechniques includingparameterdeviationestimation uncertaintycompensation and safe region quantification to balance the detector s timeliness and accuracy.
we conduct experiments to show the effectiveness of mod2andtheusefulnessofmod2 basedadaptation supervision mechanism.
