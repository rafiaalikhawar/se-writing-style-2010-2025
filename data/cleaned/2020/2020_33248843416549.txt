concepts thissectionintroducesandformalizesallconceptsusedinthecontext of the implementation.
.
foundation sentences.
we denote sentences as s s where s is the set of all sentences called the corpus and a sentence s can be causal or non causal.
causality.
causalsentencescontainacausality c c.weintroducethefollowingpredicatetoexpressthecausalityofasentences predicate explanation causality s c c cis the causality of sentence s s a causal sentence and its conveyed causality is illustrated in the following example sentence the application is terminated when the xbutton is pressed.
causality the x button is pressed the application is terminated therelationofcausalityisreducedtoitsmostsimpleform consisting of a cause and an effect phrase.
extracting these two phrases fromthe sentence is subject to the causality extraction.
.
formalization structure.
a sentence written in natural language can be processed by natural language processing nlp tools in order to de rivesyntacticandsemanticinformationaboutthesentence.asentence can be structured in two ways by constituency or dependency.aconstituencyparsergroupsadjacentwordsintogrammat ical units and builds a tree structure where the root node representsthefullsentence.adependencyparseralsoconstructsatree structure butinthiscasetheinnernodesofthetreearenotchunksgrouping words or other chunks into units but rather the words itself.
a word w 1is the parent node of a word w2ifw2is semantically dependent of w1.
the root node of the semantic structure is the root dependency which is usually the sentence s predicate.elementaltotheidentificationofcausalsentencesinourapproach is the syntactic structure which will be denoted as t tand applicable to the following predicates structureof s t t tis the structureof sentence s sinternal representation.
a sentence s sis formalized by nlp tools into an internal representation.
this internal representationof sentences consistsof the following aspects words each word contained in the sentence in order of ap pearance with a corresponding part of speech tag indicating the wordsrole within the sentence constituency structure adjacent words clustered together to chunks of words which represent a specific grammatical unit dependency structure semantic relations of words to each other an example for a sentence formalized into the internal representation is given in figure .
the tree structure composed of grey nodesrepresentstheconstituencystructure whereeachnodecontains its constituent tag.
the list of white nodes represents the wordsofthesentenceannotatedwiththeirrespectivepart of speechtag.thelinesconnectingthewordnodesrepresentthedependencystructure where each label on the connection represents the de pendency relation type.
structuralequivalence.
thepremiseofourapproachisthatsimilarlystructuredcausalsentencesalsohavetheircause andeffectphraseslocatedatsimilarpositionswithinthesentence.thispremise will be explained in detail in section .
.
two tree like structures are equivalent if both structures contain the same nodes in the same order.
furthermore a structure t tis the subtree of a structuret2 twhent1contains all nodes in the same order as t2andpotentiallymore butnotnecessarilytheotherwayaround.
we introduce the following predicate subtree t1 t2 structuret1 tisa subtree of structure t2 t for example the structure depicted in figure is a subtree of thestructure in figure but not a subtree of structure in figure .
hence subtree t t2 but notsubtree t1 t3 because t3lacks a node with the tag sbar as the firstchild of the rootnode.
cause effect graphs.
cause effect graphs are used to represent thecausality whichasentenceconveys inaformalized graphical notation .
in our approach we limit the extent of cause effect graphs to their most simple form consisting of two nodes one representing the cause and one the effect of the causality relation.cause effectgraphswillbedenotedas g gandareapplicableto the following predicate conveys g c cegg gconveys causality c c for every causal sentence there exists a cause effect graph thatconveys itscausality s s c c causality s c g g conveys g c note that the cause effect graph is not necessarily equivalent tothe causality.
ensuring that a cause effect graph extracted from asentence actually represents the causality of that sentence is the center of the challenge of correct causality extraction.
.
phrase extraction methods other attempts at causality extraction covered the part of phrase extraction by selecting certain semantic elements from the sen tence for example taking the two noun phrases np 1and np 2of the sentence.
introducing phrase extraction methods is necessary 563figure internalrepresentation of a natural languagesentence formalizedvia constituency and dependencyparsing figure syntactic sentence structure t1ofsentence s1 figure syntactic sentence structure t2of sentence s2figure syntactic sentence structure t3ofsentence s3 forourapproachfortworeasons first toprovideindependenceof semantic information the extraction of phrases must be based onsyntactic or lexical information.
second the extent of the phrase whichrepresentsapartofthecausality shallbearbitrarytoensure thatthecausalitypatternsmeettheneedsfortherequirementsen gineering process.
an example from the prominent semeval task set of annotated sentences isthe following sentence sentence the current view is that the chronic inflammationinthedistalpartofthestomachcausedby helicobacter pylori infection results in an increased acid production from the non infectedupper corpus region of the stomach.
causality infection inflammation the causality relation annotated in the semeval set of sentences is semantically correct but causality detection algorithmstrimmed to identifying causal relations of this type are restrictedto ignore a lot of data in comparable sentences.
without claimingto define the borders of causality in a linguistic or philosophical scope it is feasible to expect a more encompassing phrase from a causality phrase extraction method for example as follows sentence the current view is that the chronic inflammationinthedistalpartofthestomachcausedbyhelicobacter pylori infection results in an in creased acid production from the non infected upper corpus region of the stomach.
causality helicobacter pylori infection chronic inflammation in the distal part of the stomach thecontextofcausalityextractioninrequirementsengineeringis to extract phrases from a natural language requirements artifact 564that can be reused to generate test cases possibly even automatically.
the information value of an extracted causality is highest when the extraction is not limited to the two events in a causal relation represented by a single word but includes all relevant in formation like participating actors and conditions.
this becomesevidentinthefollowingexample whereasentencefromthepure dataset of requirements artifacts is annotated by a causality which only takes into account the connected events sentence if registration is not successful an audible and visual indication shall be provided.
causality registration indication thecausalrelationoftheregistrationandtheindicationisevident but vital information is lost in the extraction process.
this vital information is necessary to more precisely define the initial situation and the expected result of described context.

.
causality patterns a causality pattern combines the recognition of a causal sentence with extraction of a cause and effect phrase from this unknown sentence.thisconnectionisbasedonthegrammaticalequivalenceto a previously known and processed causal sentence example.
a causality pattern consistsof three elements signature asubtreeofasyntacticsentencestructure which is the indicator forcompliance to a sentence phraseextractionmethod analgorithm whichextractsthe cause and effect phrase when applied to a sentence accepted sentences a list of all causal sentences that arecomplianttothepatternandapplicablebyitsphraseextrac tion method the signature associated with a causality pattern is similar to the syntactic structure t tof a sentence as it represents a sub tree of a syntactic structure.

a causality pattern can be generated from a causal sentenceandamanuallycreatedcause effectgraph.thesignature is extracted from the sentence s syntactic structure to represent its grammatical structure and the phrase extraction methods are generated from the elements of the cause effect graph which are located within the sentence.
the generation and maintenance isfurtherexplainedinsection4.
.theacceptanceofasentencebya pattern is determined by evaluating compliance and applicability which are explained next.
compliance.
compliance between a sentence and a pattern determines whetherthesentencebelongstothegrammaticalequivalenceclasswhichthepatternrepresents.asentenceiscompliant toapatternifandonlyifthesignatureofthepatternisasubsetof the sentence structure.
thisis formally expressed as s s p p t t2 t signatureof p t1 structureof s t2 subtree t1 t2 compliant p s our approach explores an incremental signature the pattern s signature consists of as many nodes necessary such that the fol lowing two conditions hold the pattern s signature is a subtree to the structure of all accepted sentences 565figure signature tp2of a hypotheticalpattern p2 the pattern s signature is not a subtree to the structure of all non causal sentences and causal sentences of different patterns.
thiscanbevisualizedwhenreviewingexistingexamples assume sentences2with structure t2visualized in figure is causal and sentences3with structure t3visualized in figure is not causal.
then a pattern p2would minimally require a signature tp2as visualized in figure to differentiate the two sentences.
since tp2is a subtree of t2 sentence s2is compliant to pattern p2.
sentence s3 is not compliant to pattern p2 becausetp2is not a subtree of t3.
note that the pattern p2would also differentiate between s2and s3if it had a the signature t1shown in figure but this signature would not be minimal because it contains more nodes than necessary.theconditionsensurethatonlysentencesofsimilarsyntactic sentencestructurearecomplianttoapatternandthereforeeligible to be accepted.

we invite fellow researchers to inspect and use our implementation for furtherstudies.

when using the operation testingthe system is providedonlywithasentence.ifthesentenceiscausalanditssyntactic structure is already covered by a causality pattern the system willattempttogenerateacause effectgraphfromthesentenceusing the phrase extraction methods associated with the pattern.
if a sentence is not correctly processed meaning that a causal sentenceiseithernotrecognizedascausaloranon causalwrongfullyrecognizedascausal providingamanualcorrectionwillresultin a training operation to generate a new or adapted pattern.
thecause effect recognition is the core of the cerec system and tasked with the maintenance of pattern correctness which is indetail explained in section .
.
this system contains three major elements nlpunit usedtoformalizenaturallanguagesentencesinto the internal representation mentioned in section .
commandgenerator usedtogeneratephraseextractionmethods mentioned in section .
database of patterns contains all generated causality patterns whereeachpatternhasthestructuredescribedinsection .
furthermore the cerec system keeps track of all discovered non causal sentences as non causal sentences are not associated with any pattern they are stored by the system directly which is ofimportance for the maintenance of pattern correctness later described in section .
.
we use the opennlp and maltparser for the nlp unit.
.
maintenanceof pattern correctness principles of maintenance.
in order to ensure the correctness of thedatabaseofpatterns asetofprinciplesmustbeupheld.theseprinciples formalize how the training data both causal and non causalsentences constructstheknowledgedatabaserepresented by the existing patterns.
the most basic principle is the core assumption of the syntactic cause effect recognition approach causal sentences of syntacticsimilarityarelikelytohavetheircausalphraseslocatedatthesame position within the sentence which is the foundation of pattern baseddetectionandextractionalgorithms .thesecausal phrases are therefore retrievable by the same phrase extraction methods.
thisderivation can be denoted as follows s s c c p p causality s c compliant p s applicable p s thisprinciplejustifiestohavesentencesofsimilarsyntacticstructureacceptedbythesamecausalitypattern.allacceptedsentences of a pattern are compliant to the signature of a pattern and thereforesharesyntacticsimilarities.thismakesitlikelyforthephraseextraction methods associated with the pattern to extract the correct cause effect graph.
the second principle is that every already discovered non causal sentencemustbenon complianttoeverypattern whichformallytranslates to p p s s c c causality s c compliant p s 566toensurethatalreadydiscoverednon causalsentencesarenot compliant to a newly introduced pattern each signature must be specified in a way to comply to both principles of maintenance.
theprocessofachievingthiswillbetechnicallyexplainedinnext section and brought into context in section thereafter.
signature specification.
an important process for the maintenance of pattern correctness in regard to incremental patterns isthe specification of a pattern s signature.
the incremental nature of the signature which defines the grammatical class of each patternandisusedtodetermineasentence scompliancetoit derivesthat the structure consists only of as many nodes such that it fulfillsall principles of maintenance.
the overall goal of the machine learning algorithm is to identify all sentences which are applicable to the same phrase extractionmethod.
to ensure that as many sentences as possible are identifiedbytheirrespectivecausalitypatterns thepattern sidentifying signature must be minimal in size of nodes each additional node risksthatasentence which would beapplicable bythe phraseex traction method of the causality pattern is not compliant to the patternanymore becauseonenodeofthesentence sstructuredifferentiates itfrom the pattern s signature.
the specification process is applied when a sentence is compliant to a pattern but the sentence is not applicable to the pattern sphraseextractionmethod thereforeviolatingthefirstprincipleofmaintenance.
a sentence which is compliant to a pattern but not applicablebyitsphraseextractionmethodwillbereferredtoasan intruder because the sentence is falsely compliant to the pattern.
an intruder can be causal ornon causal causal intruders are compliant to a pattern but the phraseextraction method of the pattern does not extract the de siredcause effect graph non causal intruders are compliant to a pattern althoughthey should never be anintrudercanonlybedetectedifhisactualcausalityisprovided.
knowing the actual causality of a sentence requires semantic do mainknowledge andmustbeprovided bya human eitherbeforehand when preparing training samples or as an correction during the online usage of the system.
if an intruder is detected the pat tern s signature must be more specific in order to prevent the pattern s compliance to the intruder.
this correction improves the causality detection and extraction of the cerec system in provid ing furtherdata forthe machine learning algorithm.
thespecificationofthesignaturecantaketwoforms inthemost generalform additionalnodesareaddedtothepattern sstructure.
these nodes are taken from the set of accepted sentences in order to maintain compliance of the accepted sentences.
the algo rithm specifically searches for a position in the signature whereall accepted sentences contain the same node while the intruding sentenceisdifferent.thisnodeisidentifiedasandifferentiatorbetween the accepted sentences and the intruder.
adding the differ entiatortothepattern ssignaturewillmaintainthecomplianceto the accepted sentences while revoking the compliance to the intruder.
during this process the pattern s signature incrementallyreconstructsthe structureof the accepted sentences.
the other form of specifying a signature is enforcing additionalconstraintsoncertainnodesofthepattern ssignature.theimple mentation explored in our approach uses lexical constraints ex plicitly causal cue phrases like because or if are highly eligibleindicatorsfordifferentiatingbetweensyntacticallysimilar but causallydifferentsentences.alexicalconstraintaddedtoanodeofthepattern ssignaturemeansthatanysentence thatiscompliant mustalsocontainthisspecifickeywordasawordnodetransitively parented by the node to which the constraint isapplied.

the most precise specifica tion is applied.
training causal sentences.
when training a causal sentence in thecerecsystem asentencealongsideacause effectgraph whichconveysitscausalityrelation isgiven.thefirststepofthesystemis to check if any existing pattern is compliant to the given sentence.
ifnopatternisfound thenthegivensentencestructureisnoveltothesystemandneedstobeestablished.anewpatternisgenerated in the following steps first an identifying signature is associated with the pattern.
following the nature of the incremental signatures thissignatureinitiallyconsistsjustoftheminimalrepresentation of the structure of its first accepted sentence the root nodeofthesentence sstructure whichisans nodeidentifyingthetree as structure of a sentence.
withjustthisminimals nodeasasignaturethenewpatternwould violate the second principle of maintenance as all previously discovered non causal sentences would be falsely compliant to the pattern since every sentence s structure is rooted in the s node.
thisisovercomebyapplyingthespecificationalgorithmdescribed intheprevioussection thepattern ssignatureisspecifiedagainsteverypreviouslydiscoverednon causalsentence untilnonon causalsentenceiscomplianttothenewpatternandthereforethesecond principle upheld.
next a phrase extraction method is tailored to retrieve the cause effectgraphthatconveysthesentence scausalityrelationfromthe sentence.
this is done by dynamically constructing an algorithm asdescribedinsection3.
.inalaststepthegivensentenceisaddedasanacceptedsentencetothenewpattern asthissentence saffiliation with the pattern isconfirmed.
thetrainingalgorithmisdifferentwhenanexistingpatternisfound to which the causal sentence is compliant.
two cases are possiblefrom here if the sentence is also applicable to the phrase extractionmethodassociatedwiththepattern thenthiscausalsentenceis already covered by the cerec system and correctly recognized.
thesentenceisaddedtotheacceptedsentencesofthepatternand adds no new pattern to the database.if the sentence is not applicable to the phrase extraction method associated with the pattern to which the sentence is compliant then the sentence violates the first principle of maintenance thesentenceiscomplianttoapattern butnotapplicablebyitsphrase extraction methods.
567thisisresolvedbyspecifyingthepatternagainsttheintrudingsentence and creating a new pattern for the causal intruder.
the resultwillbetwopatternswithverysimilarstructuresassociatedto them but different enough to differentiate the accepted sentences of the original pattern from the intruding sentence.
the new pat tern will be provided with a specific phrase extraction method to preserve the firstprinciple of maintenance.
trainingnon causalsentences.
whentrainingacausalsentence in the cerec system only a sentence is given.
the first step of the systemisagaintocheckifanyexistingpatterniscomplianttothe given sentence.
ifnopatternisfound thenthenon causalsentenceiscorrectlydis carded.thecerecsystemaddsthesentencetoitslistofnon causal sentences for furtherprocessing.
if a pattern is found to which the sentence is compliant then thesecond principle of maintenance is violated.
this is resolved by specifying the structure of the compliant pattern against the noncausal intruder.
the specification process results in the incrementaladditionofnodesorconstraintstothepattern ssignature until the intruding sentence is no longer compliant to the pattern andthe second principle of maintenance therefore upheld.

rq2 effectiveness ofthe algorithm with previous training the study of rq2 simulates the use of the system in an environment with previous training which means that causality patternsalreadyexistatthestartoftheevaluation.tosimulatethis eachoftherequirementsartifactswastestedasinrq1 butonlyafterthe system has been previously trained with all other artifacts beforehand effectively starting the training with all patterns extracted from the other artifacts.
the results are shown in table on the right side.
compared to the results of rq1 the effect of previous training of the cerec system is not entirely positive the precision has in creased partially which means that more of the compliant sentenceswereactuallycausalandrecognizedsuccessfully.thiscomes atthecostofapartiallydecreasedrecall whichmeansthatlesssentenceswerecomplianttopatternsingeneral.intotalthesechanges result in no overall improvement of the f score compared to rq1.
the training beforehand established a large set of patterns based on a corpus vastly outnumbering the sentences contained by the artifact under test.
these patterns have undergone a multitude of specification processes as described in section .
which accounts for the increase in precision of the overall algorithm.
on theotherhand theincreasedspecificityofpatternscauseslesssentences of the artifact under test to be compliant.
this represents that the specification process is focused on preventing false positives hence reducing the recall.
the evaluation of rq2 shows that the system does not yet profit from an increased beforehand training which leaves room for im provingthescalabilityoftheapproach.reevaluatingthefocuson precision by balancing the specification process more in favor of recall is to be explored in future approaches.
