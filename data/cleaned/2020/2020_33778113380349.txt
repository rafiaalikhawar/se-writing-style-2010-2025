introduction smartphones bundled with mobile applications have become indispensable.
as mobile users rely heavily on their smartphones for their daily tasks the reliability and usability of mobile applications are essential to ensure a satisfying user experience.
according to a recent survey of respondents have experienced a problem when using a mobile application and of them will retry an app once or twice if it fails to meet their expectations.
hence there isarisingdemandfortestingandanalysistechniquesformobile applications.
several automated techniques have been proposed for analysis testing and repair ofmobileapps.however theseautomatedtechniques have not been widely adopted due to several reasons.
firstly these techniquesmainlyfocusonfindingcrashesandfailtofindother typesofbugs e.g.
ui relatedbugs .secondly priorstudiesrevealed that most app developers prefer manual testing compared to automated testing for finding bugs in their apps due to reasons such as lackofknowledgeoftestingtools and learning curve ofavailable tools .thirdly accordingtooneofthesestudies app developers prefer reading automatically generated tests written in natural language.
however existing automated testing techniques could only generate tests expressed in low level events e.g.
using adbcommands that are difficult for developers to understand.
forlargesoftwareprojects likemozilla andeclipse thereexist up to thousands of bug reports written in natural language.
hence priorapproachesonduplicatebugreportsdetectionexploitthesimilaritiesbetweenbugreportsforbuglocalization .infact manysimilarbugreportsexistnotonlywithinthesameproject but also across different software projects especially for android apps.

to facilitatecollaborative bugfinding we adaptthe driver navigator metaphor of pair programming by emulating the role of a competent pair programmer via developers of other similar applications.

in thecoder vs auto issues setting the driver provides appa as a query and our issue recommendation system buginewill automaticallyidentifyrelevantgithubissuesbyselectingissues from anothersimilar app for appa.

github andgithub classroom github6is a social coding platform built on top of the git versioncontrolsystemandsupportspull basedsoftwaredevelopment.

.
the coder vs coderssetting in the coder vs coders setting we assume that both the driver and the navigators are programmers who belong to the same organization but each of them may develop a different app.
a recent studyofopen sourceandroidappsingithubshowsthatthemajorcontributorsforanandroidappalsoownedaroundfiveother repositories .
this suggests that our assumption developers of different apps may belong to the same organization as other developers generallyholds.
figure shows the overall workflow for the coder vs coders setting.
the collaborative bug finding process starts with a programmer a the driver posting a github issue iforappain the team discussion page step 1in figure .
after reading i another programmer within the same organization the navigator could readthegithubissueandthinkaboutwhether iisapplicablefor the appappnavi ator in which appnavi ator nequalappa step2 in figure .
this step requires the navigator to think creatively about whether there exist some similarities between appaand appnavi ator thatmayallow itobereproducibleon appnavi ator we leaveitup tothe navigatorto definehis orher ownnotion of similarities .
if the navigator has successfully reproduced the issue ini then he or she will post the new issue jto the team discussion step3in figure .
we call this a pair sharing withibeing the originallysharedissueand jbeingthederivedissue.theprocess repeats when another member of the organization posts a new github issue that isdifferentfrom iandj.

this step is similar to step in figure where creative thinking is required.
doescollaborative bug finding helps to discover new bugs?
before evaluating the general applicability of collaborative bug finding for testing android apps we first study the general feasibility of collaborative bug finding as an approach that helps in constructing test cases for android apps through different degrees of interactions.
our goal is to evaluate whether reading the bug reports written by others about another app another app plays the role of a competent pair programmer could lead to the creativethinkingofsimilartestingscenariofortheappundertestand eventuallyleadtothediscoveryofnewbugsfortheappundertest.

to increase the number of discovered bugs via collaborative bug finding we posted an assignment via github classroomthat required students to write tests for their selected apps using two strategies method1 coveringcodechangesforrecentcommit wecallthis strategyregression inspired and method the coder vs manualissuessettingofcollaborativebugfinding refertosection3.3more details .
we compare these two strategies because both techniques rely on another similar app for constructing test cases i.e.
code changes relies on a different version of the same app whereas collaborative bug finding uses a similar app as driver .

using the coder vs manual issues strategy students are required to select five issues from an app within the same category and five issues from a different category app the category of an app is defined in this link9 .
for each selected issue i students need to manually check whether they could iandwritea newderived issue issue that are inspired by i .
to collect students feedback for these two strategies we asked students to answer the question which method do you think is more effective in finding newbugs?why?explainthereasonintermsofefficiency timetaken and effectiveness likelihood of finding new bugs .

answer to rq2c out of students prefer collaborative bug finding over regression inspired approach.
however students admitted that searching for relevant issues could be time consuming.
issuerecommendation algorithm based on the students feedback on the weakness of the codervs manual issues setting we propose bugine an approach that automatically selects relevant github issues for the app under test appaso that developers for appacould focus on the creative thinking step to derive specialized test scenarios.

building a database ofgithub issues.
to build our database we first obtain a set of open source android appsbycrawlinggithub.ourcrawlerselectsanapp abasedon thenumberofstarsingithub thenumberofreviewsand thenumberofdownloadsingoogleplay thenumberofgithub issues and its category.
for each selected app we extract all its issuesandcollectedthe metadataofeachissue e.g.
title author numberofusercomments labels issuestate body commitsha etc.
.wealsodownloadeditssourcecodefromitsmasterbranch for subsequent steps.
this results in a total of issues from different applications that provide different functionalities e.g.
cloud client file explorer web browser notes picture gallery githubclient etc.
.
.
data pre processing as all the github issues in our database are written in natural language weusenaturallanguageprocessing nlp techniques topre processthembeforestoringthemintoourdatabase.wealso perform similar pre processing for all the xml files.
specifically we perform the following steps tokenization we converteachissueintolistsof words tokens .
stopwordsremoval stopwordsarecommonlyusedwordswhich donothavecompletelexicalmeaning e.g.
the is that .we use the pythonnltklibrary to remove stopwords.
convention unification considering the naming convention of different android ui components bugineuses humps a python library that converts strings between snake case camel case and pascal case to unify the different naming conventions usedinvariablenaming.wereplaceeachunderscorewithwhite spaceandseparate eachcomposite word.
stemming lemmatization stemming reduces inflected words to their base form whereas lemmatization groups together the inflected forms of a word so that they can be analyzed as a single item.weusestemmingandlemmatizationforreducinginflectional forms ofthe parsedtokens.
after the data pre processing we convert the corpus into token streams whichwillbe usedin the subsequent step.

extracting app descriptionfiles.
the user interfaces of android apps are commonly defined in xml layout files .
these files contain the definitions for the interface elements and their structures.
android resources are the additional filesandstaticcontentusedintheappcode e.g.
bitmaps .resourcescanbereferencedviatheirresourceids.theautomatically generated file r.javacontains allresourcesandtheir ids.
inthisstep bugineidentifiesandparsesallthexmlfileswithin thefolder src main restogenerateappdescriptionfiles.wealso discard element styles e.g.
colors and fonts which are not essentialtoappsandretainonlytheimportantattributesthatdescribe app behaviors.
for each pair of apps appa appb we compare andmatchtheirappdescriptionfiles.thisdescriptionfileisused for classifying the category of the app we assume that if the sets of ui components in appaandappbare similar then appa andappbare of the same category and generating candidates search keywords for identifying the relevant github issues.
then buginetransforms these app descriptions into query phrases by summarizing the common parts in the two app description files.
table shows the naming information in the xml files that we usedtoextractuicomponentsthatarecommonbetweentwoapps.
this informationhelps us toconvert for eachxml file each view andeachresourcein appqueryto the query of the form xml file name view name resource name similaritymeasures.
weusetwocommonlyusedsimilaritymeasuresforcomputingtextsimilarities.tomeasurethesimilarities between the query and github issue titles we use overlap coefficientthat computes the overlap between two finite sets xand y .

to measure the similarities between the query and the text bodiesofgithubissues weusethen gramsimilaritybecause ithas beenwidelyusedinmodelingnaturallanguage overlap coefficient does not consider context i.e.
the surrounding words butthetextbodiesusuallycontaindetailedinformationandformal structural sentences.
for the same reasons we also use n gram for calculating the ui components similarities.

ranking relevant github issues.
the goal of this step is to produce a ranked list of relevant github issuesfor appquery.inprevioussteps weobtainsimilarappsfor appquery.
we use each query phrase extracted from the app descriptionfilestosearchforrelatedissuesandorderedtheresults by their importance relevance and reproducibility.
we use several factors to rank the relevant issues.
a key factor that determines the quality of a github issue iis how well the test scenario has been described in i. an empirical study on apache mozilla and eclipse shows that developers expect a good bug report to includestepstoreproduce observedandexpectedbehavior and stack traces.thestudyshowsthatadetailedbugreportcanhelpdevelopersin narrowing down the search space for bugs and save time on fixing bugs.
based on the results of this study we design the metrics used to evaluate the quality of eachissue.

we use both hit all and hit overlap for finding the string similarities because we believe that if all the searchkeywordsappearinthecorpus hit all thenthetextshould be given additional weights.
the hit hot words factor assigns a 1342collaborative bugfinding forandroid apps icse may seoul republic of korea higherscore togithubissueswith wordsthatrepresentthecharacteristicsof agoodbugreport .

the approach closest to bugineisthe advancedsearchfeature in github that canbe used tonarrowdownthesearchforissuesrelatedtoandroidappsand filter the issue status the number of comments the date of the last update and the label of each issue.
however there is no direct method to filter issues from android apps search for the ui componentsforanappnor selectthecategoryofanapp.hence we could not find any suitable baselineapproaches.

conclusion we proposecollaborative bug finding an approach that promotes the discovery of new bugs via different degrees of interactions between driver and navigators.
in the coder vs coders setting programmers within an organization communicate by sharing their newlyreportedgithubissues.inthecoder vs manual issuessetting adeveloperfor appaselectsseveralissuesfromsamecategory app andfromdifferentcategoryapp toderive specializedtest scenarios for appa.
meanwhile in the coder vs auto issues setting we introduce bugine an approach that automatically recommends relevant github issues for the app under test.
our evaluation of allsettingsofcollaborativebugfindingshowsthatithelpsinthe discovery of new bugs.
specifically it helps in finding five bugs via pairsharinginthecoder vs coderssetting.inthecoder vs manualissues setting students reported new bugs.
meanwhile bugine helps the discovery of new bugs.
the relatively high number of newly found bugs confirms that collaborative bug finding is a promising approach in testingandroid apps.
we believe that this work opens several opportunities for future research reusingbugreportsfromdifferentapps.

noveltestgenerationapproach.
insteadoftestinputgeneration we reformulate the test generation problem as bug report recommendation problem.
as bug reports are written in natural language our approach may help in relieving the burden of developers in learning a new android testing framework or apis.
meanwhile our evaluation shows that the types of bugs found via collaborative bug finding are mostly non crash related whereas existing automated testing approaches from android apps focus on finding crashes.
moreover prior testing techniques that extract specifications from code comments in natural language indicate potential benefits in improving automated testing with test oraclesobtained from bug reports.
hence we believe that our approach is complementary to existing automated android testing approaches.
we leave as future work the investigation of whether collaborative bug finding can be combined with automated android testing approachesto increasethe number of bugsfound.
