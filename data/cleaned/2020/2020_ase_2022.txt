acm isbn iiii message from the chairs on behalf of the entire conference organizing committee it is our great pleasure to welcome you to the th edition of the ieee acm international conference on automated software engineering ase .
the ase conference series is the premier research forum for automated software engineering research and practice.
each year it brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss foundations techni ues and tools for automated analysis design implementation testing and maintenance of large software systems.
we are glad that we were able to organize the conference in person this year after years of virtual editions due to the pandemic.
ase was held between october th and october th in the beautiful oakland center at oakland niversity in michigan sa.
although the conference was in person we used virtual and hybrid tools to expand the in person experience and include participants who were not able to attend in person for various reasons such as visa delays.
this publication contains the proceedings of ase .
the first and the last days of the conference were allocated to workshops tutorials and the doctoral symposium.
the main conference was held from october th to october th and featured three keynotes as well as technical experience new idea 6ournal first demo industry showcase poster late breaking result and student research competition papers.
the goal of ase is to support developers with automated solutions for the construction and evolution of modern ever more complex and critical software systems.
the conference technical program features the latest development in the area of automated software engineering including but not limited to research on applications of machine learning to automated software engineering automated program synthesis and repair mobile application development verification and validation program analysis security uality assurance and of course different types of software tools.
ase has been supported by many organizing committee members including numerous members from oakland niversity which has a strong presence in software engineering research seven of more than faculty members of the computer science and engineering epartment are actively involved in software engineering research as evidenced from their recent ase tse tosem icse and fse publications.
we thank all organizing committee members for their support making the conference a success the program included three exceptional keynote talks mark harman and inna vortsova iautomated testing as roduction simulation research opportunities and challengesj ivii margaret anne storey ifrom automating software engineering to empowering software evelopersj ionel riand iautonomous systems how to address the ilemma between autonomy and safetyj a new record number of submissions has been received in almost every track of ase with a total of papers submitted.
this includes papers submitted to the main research track papers submitted to the nier track h to tool emonstrations h to industry showcase h to journal first to ate raking results and h to students research competition.
the research track followed a double anonymous review process in which manuscripts were anonymized at submission.
authorsk identities were only revealed for accepted papers upon conclusion of the review period.
out of submissions to the research track four submissions were re6ected due to ma6or double anonymous and formatting violations.
the remaining submissions went through a thorough review process h another record for the ase conference series uring this process each submission was reviewed by at least three rogram committee members and was intensively discussed online.
at the end of the discussion period submissions were accepted conditionally provided that the authors ade uately address the reviewersk comments in the revision.
overall this careful and thorough review process resulted in the final selection of papers accepted to the research track.
our sincere thanks go to caroline emieux and andrea stocco who served as review rocess co chairs and helped monitor the uality of submissions and reviews all members of the rogram committee and all the authors for their hard work and contributions the ase 6ournal first track accepted ase relevant papers from several top software engineering 6ournals including automated software engineering journal ieee transaction of software engineering acm transactions on software engineering and methodology empirical software engineering journal and journal of systems and software.
this is a new record number as well and we hope the ase 6ournal first track will continue to grow in popularity.

e ective iccresolution requires precisely identifying entry points analyzingdata values of icc elds modeling related framework apis etc.due to various control !ow and data !ow related characteristicsinvolved and the lack of oracles for real world apps the compre hensive evaluation of icc resolution techniques is challenging.to ll this gap we collect multiple type benchmark suites with4 apps covering hand made apps open source and commercialones.
considering their di erences various evaluation metrics e.g.
number count graph structure and reliable oracle based metrics are adopted on demand.
as the oracle for real world apps is un available we design a dynamic analysis approach to extract thereal icc links triggered during gui exploration.
by auditing thecode implementations we carefully check the extracted iccs andcon rm ones to form a reliable oracle set in which each icc islabeled with code characteristic tags.
the evaluation performedon six state of the art icc resolution tools shows that the com pleteness of static icc resolution results on real world apps is notsatisfactory as up to iccs are missed by tools manywrongly reported iccs are sent from or received by only a few yepang liu is a liated with the research institute of trustworthy autonomous sys tems guangdong provincial key laboratory of brain inspired intelligent computation and department of computer science and engineering of sustech.

.a comprehensive evaluation of android icc resolution techniques.
in37th ieee acm international conference on automated software engineering ase october rochester mi usa.acm new york ny usa pages.
introductionandroid programs are composed of four types of basic components.each component is a single module and components communicatewith each other through the inter component communication icc mechanism.
to gure out the control and data!ows between thesource and target components users can use icc resolution toolsto extract icc related information.
the most widely used icc reso lution tools areepicc andic3 .
they model the icc relatedframework apis and perform a data !ow analysis to resolve theicc eld values whose results can be used to construct the com ponent activity transition graph ctg atg .
some works use the constructed transition graph to help the program behaviorunderstanding and others use it to help automatic testgeneration.
besides there are various icc related vulnerabilitiesthat have attracted the attention of researchers including inter component privacy leak permission leak andase october rochester mi usa jiwei yan shixin zhang yepang liu xi deng jun yan and jian zhanginter app collusion .
with wide usage in various sce narios both the soundness and completeness of icc resolutionresults have great impact on its applications.in android an icc message is represented as anintent object which contains a set of intent elds.
to obtain the sourcecomponents of iccs we need to nd the control!ows from entrypoint methods to theintentobject sending statements where theentry method may be user customized ones that are di cult tobe identi ed.
and to nd out the target component the values ofcarried intent elds should be carefully analyzed.
as many codecharacteristics are involved when identifying the source and targetof icc messages resolving iccs with high precision is a challeng ing task.
during analysis the imprecision in any step i.e.
whilehandling any code characteristic may lead to either false positives fps or false negatives fns in the nal results.
moreover thesefns or fps may be propagated upwards as icc resolution usuallyworks as a fundamental module e.g.
more than half of fns inlogextractor are icc related as it invokes the icc resolutiontoolic3 .
actually for both the users and developers of iccresolution tools it is hard to know whether the reported iccs aretrustworthy or not and the root causes of precision loss.
therefore to gure out that a comprehensive evaluation focusing on androidicc resolution techniques is required.there are several o the shelf benchmarks that can bereused for icc related evaluation.
they are designed by researcherswho want to measure tools e ectiveness when encountering icccode snippets.
although widely adopted it is questionable whetherthese hand made apps could represent complex real world ones forthey are designed only with a few code characteristics.
for a morepractical evaluation based on real world codes there are two chal lenges.
lacking proper metrics is the!rst challenge.
when evalu ating apps without available ground truths many works measure and compare the number of resolved icc links instead.the number based comparison is e ective only when the toolsunder evaluation rarely report nonexistent iccs i.e.
fps.
how ever according to the further experimental results on hand madeapps fps exist for most icc resolution tools which makes thenumber based comparison less convincing.another challengeisthe lack of high quality benchmark suites.
a high quality bench mark suite requires both the representative test inputs i.e.
androidapps and available test oracle i.e.
ground truth iccs.
to gure outthe di erent behaviors of tools when resolving iccs with variouscode characteristics both the icc related code snippets and theinvolved code characteristics should be identi ed and labeled foreach icc in the test oracle.
such information can also help develop ers to nd real world instances for each unhandled characteristic and give directions for tool updating.
however there are no suchcharacteristics labeled benchmark suites up to now.in this paper we focus on the comprehensive evaluation ofwidely used icc resolution tools and pick six state of the art onesas the evaluation subjects.
we collect multiple type benchmarksuites with apps including hand made app sets large scalereal world ones as well as a compact but representative datasetwith reliable oracles with which we can observe tools performanceon di erent app sets.
for di erent benchmarks we adopt di erentevaluation metrics in which thenumber basedmetrics have weakcredibility but strong versatility so they t all the benchmarks thegraph basedmetrics require that iccs are actually designed forreal mobile users so they are suitable for real world apps but nothand made ones and theoracle basedmetrics should be appliedon datasets with available oracles and code characteristic labels.for hand made apps we can easily label their iccs as well as theicc related code characteristics.
as oracles for real world apps areunavailable we design a dynamic analysis approach to collect asmany real icc links as possible because the dynamically triggerediccs are not limited by the complexity of static code characteristics.first we adopt the gui exploration approach to trigger iccs whichcovers .
app components.
by monitoring the execution tracesof apps we propose a speci c icc extraction approach consider ing the icc launching characteristics.
and to ensure the reliabilityof collected iccs we combine automatic result lters and carefulmanual code auditing.
finally we successfully map iccs tocorresponding code snippets and label the involved code character istics which form a reliable benchmark with iccs extracted fromreal world apps.
the apps icc oracles and their code characteristictags are all publicly available here .through the evaluation we have the following observations.first tools behave inconsistently on multiple benchmarks whichre!ects the necessity to construct reliable oracles on real worldapps.
especially the completeness of icc resolution results on real world apps is not satisfactory.
up to iccs are missed bytools for their inadequate analysis of speci c code characteristics.second many fake iccs are sent from or received by only a fewcomponents and number based metrics could not identify them.with the help of graph based metrics we can quickly identifya set of wrongly reported iccs.
besides most tools su er fromthe ine ciency problem when working on complex real worldapps.
users don t know when the analysis will nish and have toterminate it with no output.
finally based on the evaluation results we recommend typical scenarios of tool usage and summarize eightcommon fn fp patterns in icc resolution.contributions.the contributions of this work are threefold we construct multiple type benchmark suites for icc resolu tion which contain both hand made apps designed with speci ccharacteristics and real world apps with complex icc implemen tation and propose a dynamic icc extraction approach to obtaincharacteristic labeled oracles for representative apps.
we propose a uni ed icc resolution comparison framework anddesign speci c metrics for multiple type benchmark suites.
we carry out in depth evaluations on six popular and state of the art icc resolution tools clarify the strengths and weaknessesof each tool summarize the root causes that lead to precisionloss and discuss the directions for further improvement.
icc resolution an overviewthis section gives an overview of the icc mechanism the state of the art icc resolution tools and the widely used evaluation metrics.
.
overview of icc mechanismthere are four basic components in android apps includingactivity service broadcastreceiver andcontentprovider.for the convenience of communication among app components theandroid system provides the icc mechanism.
an app componentcan create anintentobject and send it to the android system.along with the intent both the basic icc elds e.g.

the system resolves the value of these leds to infer thetarget components.
fig.
displays the overview of the icc sendingprocess with ve commonly used characteristics in icc resolution.callback entry.unlike java programs there is no main methodin an android applications.
instead each component has a set ofentry methods including lifecycle methods e.g.
oncreate andcallbacks e.g.
onclick .
both of them are invoked by the an droid system in response to gui or system events.
the callbackrecognition is challenging for callbacks could be registered in an droid framework classes or libraries implicit callback registered incode of application package dynamic callback or declared in thexml les static callback .
and the icc invocation may be hiddenbehind a series of complex callback triggering.calling context.
the data extraction of the intent object eldsis essential to icc resolution.
considering both the intent objectitself and the data of intent elds can be passed among function calls a context sensitive inter procedural analysis should be performed.fragment.
fragment is a dynamically loaded building block ofan app s user interface which is hosted by an activity or anotherfragment .
in fig.
the source component rst loads an innerfragmentf i.e.
invokes its callbackc.
then fsends anintentout in one of its methods which is reachable fromc.
in this case without fragment modeling the entry point tracking analysis mayterminate at the lifecycle method of a fragment but miss the actualentry method in its host activity.implicit match.
there are two types of intent.
for explicitintent their target components can be obtained by analyzing thevalue of the class or component name related elds.
for implicitintent the values of elds e.g.
action and category that are relatedto implicit matching will determine the destination class.atypical icc.
for each icc it will be delivered to the androidsystem through speci c api i.e.
the exit point.
besides normallyused icc sending apis likestartactivity there are manyatypical icc related apis in the android framework whichalso work as exit points although the o cial android documenta tion does not speci cally discuss them e.g.
sendintent .
theseatypical iccs can also establish icc links and should be concerned.
.
existing tools and application scenariosresearchers have proposed many works that apply the icc resolu tion results.
one of the most popular application scenarios is secu rity property checking especially privacy leak detection.
in the be ginning the intra component leak detection is concerned.considering that many sensitive data are passed by icc messages researchers extend the approaches to support inter component leakdetection includingiccta amandroid anddroidsafe .besides privacy leak icc resolution also relates to permis sion leak inter app collusion etc.
another typical scenario are gui testing e.g.
using the con structed transition model to guide the target directed test genera tion and generating the storyboard of apps .with the wide usage of icc we start a systemic investigationaround icc resolution from two well known works ic3 andepicc .
among all their citations we rst lter the workswithout mentioning the tool name explicitly and get citationworks uponic3and forepicc.
then we lter the non englishpapers repeated ones and degree thesis.
papers that just introducetools as related works are also removed.
totally we get worksthat utilize or extendic3and papers forepicc.
six works arefound implementing icc analysis modules by themselves insteadof usingic3 epiccfor e ciency or e ectiveness reasons.
and veworks develop standalone icc analysis tools.moreover we observe that both the analysis frameworkgator and an early toola3e provide atg analysis functionality.according to the above investigation ten state of the art toolsare discovered in which iccmatt and raicc are omittedfor requiring source code and only generating refactored appli cation but not icc links.
the rest ones are listed as follows.

in the same year epicc reduces the discovery of icc to an instance of the inter proceduraldistributive environment ide problem.ic3 is anenhanced tool based onepicc which uses a generic solver to in fer possible values of complex objects in an inter procedural !ow and context sensitive manner.gator is a programanalysis toolkit that performs static control !ow analysis on an droid apps .

multiple type benchmark collectionin this part we introduce the collection of multiple type benchmarksuites including hand made and real world apps.

.
test suites for hand made apps.for hand made benchmarks we prefer the ones used in existing evaluation approaches whichare carefully designed with speci c characteristics.
by reviewingthe literature that have benchmarks proposed ve hand madebenchmarks with apps are collected asbenchhand.
droid bench bend in paper is a benchmark suite that is de signed for evaluating the information !ow analyzers.
it contains18 icc related apps in its icc category folder.
the benchmark icc bench beni in literature is an icc speci c benchmark which contains apps for testing icc resolution capabilities.
thestoryd bench bens in literature concentrates on twoicc related characteristics fragment and inner class that are notwell addressed by toolic3.
it designs test apps around themspeci cally.
as previous benchmarks do not take the atypical iccinto account work designed test apps as raicc bench benr to supplementbend in which various atypical iccusages are provided.
and iccbotbench bent in paper is a compact benchmark with one app which considers varioustypical usage of fragment loading and data passing among methods.the icc related key characteristics used in these benchmarkscan be categorized into several classes including the control !ow related characteristics callback entryandfragment data !ow related ones calling contextandstring operation icc behavior related implicit match atypical iccanddynamic broadcast receiver as well as other class related library.

test suites for real world apps.as existing works performevaluations on real world datasets varying from to apps a comprehensive evaluation of android icc resolution techniques ase october rochester mi usatable characteristic speci!c code inbenchhandcharacteristicbendbenibensbenrbentsumbasic28151026fragment004048callback entry016401131implicit match51301928calling context00150924atypical icc00023023library500005dynamicbr120003str operation110002sum1440382533150we collect open source apps from f droid and com mercial apps from google play as a large scale benchmarkbenchlarge.
all the apps are randomly downloaded from the mar ketandrozoo .
however it is hard to obtain the complete oraclefor up to apps.
thus we decide to construct oracles for real world apps on a compact subset of real world apps.
considering therepresentativeness of test suites we prefer the apps that suit guiexploration as well as the ones that may have more icc links.
first we pick all the apps that are used in a recent dynamic explorationwork all of which can pass the instrumentation process andare suitable for exploration.
one app is dropped for its source codeis unavailable by now so the iccs of it are di cult to be con rmed.besides we consider the downloaded apps inbenchlarge.
for thee ciency of manual auditing with source code only the f droidapps are taken into consideration.
we rst analyze the number ofcomponents in each app and pick the top apps.
then we lterout the apps that failed the instrumentation and the duplicated onesthat are variants of the collected ones.
we also drop the social mediaapps that require a real identity.
finally we got apps benchsmall proper for oracle construction whose size rangesfrom 1m to 93m the average number of github stars is andthe average number of components is .
after collection we havethree benchmark suites with apps including a hand madeone a large scale real world one and a compact real world app set.
.
oracle constructionfor the hand crafted apps inbenchhand we perform manualreview on code to obtain the ground truth oracle.
however thespeci cations for real world apps inbenchsmallare not availableto the third party testers which means the ground truths can notbe obtained.
an alternative is to manually collect a subset of realiccs as an under approximation of the ground truth for evalua tion which is sound but incomplete.
to guarantee the usability ofthe constructed oracle the oracle obtaining approach should bepractical and thereliabilityof each icc should be con rmed.forpracticalicc collection the instrumentation based dynamicanalysis can help to obtain candidate iccs.
after inserting method level probes into apk les we can automatically collect the run time information during gui exploration and then analyze thecomponent launching orders from logs.
on one hand it is applica ble for any app that allows apk modi cation and repackaging.
onthe other hand the dynamically triggered iccs are not limited bythe complexity of static code characteristics i.e.
the correspondingcode snippets are with high diversity.
since dynamic analysis maynot be able to trigger allintents it would introduce bias to theresults.
to improve the overall coverage we combine the results ofstate of the art gui input generation tools and manual exploration.first we utilize the gui testing toolape to drive the dynamicexecution.
each app is explored three times and each executiontakes one hour.
besides we manually interact with each app forten minutes as a supplement.
overall the dynamic gui explorationcovers components with an average coverage of .
.to guarantee thereliabilityof oracles we lter the icc setwith two steps.
as the class loading orders could not accuratelyre!ect component transitions we can not simply use them to buildiccs.
instead both the lifecycle status of components and the his torically visited component stack should be considered.
besides many lifecycle methods are not overridden by developers thus theexecution of these methods will not be logged.
also componentscan extend their father classes and invoke their lifecycle methods which introduces irrelevant components and messes the event order.furthermore there are several types of speci c lifecycle behaviors e.g.
launch mode or!ags setting will in!uence the loading of his torically visited components.
for these reasons we adjust our iccextraction algorithm to t these problems including ltering thepolymorphic method invocations omitting the non starting call backs of recently launched components etc.
these works can helpus to lter parts of fps and save labor costs in further code auditing.details of the android single and multiple component interactionmodels and the icc extraction process are displayed along with thecollected oracle set in .
by the automatic dynamic log analysis we get iccs as the dynamically constructed oracle.in the next step we manually lter the iccs that cannot be linkedto an intent sending code snippet and con rm the correctness of984 iccs.
first we globally search both the name of the targetcomponent and values of corresponding intent lters declaredin the manifest le for implicit icc by which we can nd theicc sending methods.
then we trace their callers with the helpof the call graph.
if we could nd a trace starting from a lifecyclemethod or a callback method we can nish the search.
note that for callback methods we also need to nd out how the callback isregistered.
if the source component is not registered in the manifest le may be an abstract class we then review the code of theirsubclasses.
and because many iccs are passed through fragments we will search the loaded fragments in the source component andcheck whether an intent is sent by a loaded fragment.
after that if we still cannot nd a code snippet we lter this icc out of theoracle set.
for example we use the order of callback methods todecide the order of the components if an icc is sent by the previ ously started background services the source of the icc may bemisidenti ed.
besides the dynamically loaded code may trigger realiccs during runtime however these iccs cannot be recognizedby static icc resolution tools.
other reasons like unmodeled poly morphic relationships and unexpected app restarting also lead towrongly recognized iccs during the dynamic analysis.
meanwhile some iccs that are hidden behind complex control and data!owsmay be missed.
for example the longest call trace we successfullytracked involves fourteen method calls and nine classes includingthree activities three fragments two adapters etc.
it is di cult andtime consuming to con rm iccs like that.
besides during locatingthe related code snippets for the detected iccs we also record thenewly observed iccs for oracle enhancement.
in this step iccsare manually added after which the number of iccs is .ase october rochester mi usa jiwei yan shixin zhang yepang liu xi deng jun yan and jian zhangtable type and distribution of icc related tagstypedistributioncomponentactivity service broadcast dynamicbroadcast non componentfragment adapter widget other class entry methodlifecycle dynamic implicit static exit methodnormal atypical method callbasic callback listener asynchronous polymorphic library method intent typeexplicit intent implicit intent intent field valuecontext related static value extra data string operation .
for each extracted icc we review its code snippet and point outthe typical characteristics involved.
as shown in we design 25code characteristic tags for each icc and two of the authors labelthese tags together.
table gives the type and distribution of these25 tags involving the type of source or destination components the entry method of an icc invocation how an icc is sent out thedetails of the method calls and intent eld values.
.
metric pickingthis part discusses the metrics that will be adopted in this study.oracle metric.for apps with ground truths the oracle basedmetrics true positive tp false positive fp and false negative fn are the best choices i.e.
which measure whether an icc identi edby the tools has the same source and destination component namewith an icc in the oracle set.
for apps inbenchhand we can obtaintheir ground truths by code reviews and compare their numbers ofthe tp fp and fn iccs.
for the compactbenchsmall as its under approximation of the ground truths is extracted we can get thelower bound of fn iccs when compared with the labeled oracle.number metric.in existing works number based metrics e.g.
the number of reported iccs and identi ed icc elds are usuallyused to evaluate the tools performance on real world apps.
thereason is that number based metrics can re!ect the upper boundof the tp iccs it is useful when there are few fp iccs.
however according to the oracle based results onbenchhand fps exist formost icc resolution tools refer to table .
considering the wellversatility on various datasets we still use number based metrics toevaluate tools performance on all three benchmark suites.
besides to measure the contribution of the number based metrics to the iccresolution results we take the structure of ctg into consideration i.e.
use the graph based metrics as a supplement.graph metric.as the results of icc resolution can be repre sented as a directed graph i.e.
the nodes are components and theedges are iccs we use the average degree metric to obtain the den sity of edges.lmn opq r s in which r is the numberof reported iccs and s is the number of declared components.this metric takes both the number of iccs and the scale of appsinto consideration.
largerlmn opq means more iccs reported which can be used to make comparisons among multiple bench marks.
besides we consider the connectivity of the graph with thefollowing three metrics.
the metricopqrnsntqudenotes the numberof isolated components that do not connect to any other ovnmwxytdenotes the number of components that are not reachable fromthe default entry usually themainactivity andoqzrystxytde notes the number of components that are not reachable from anyexported entry component.
from the users perspective the lowerthese metrics the better ctg connectivity and more functionalitiescould be explored.
there are two possible cases that a componentmay not be linked to any other component.
one case is it is anexported component only for external launch.
in our dataset mostcomponents are either mainactivity or not exported whichshould connect to others.
meanwhile many exported activitiesare not designed for external launch only i.e.
though they canbe launched externally they can also be launched internally e.g.
payment or login activities.
the other case is dead code compo nents that are registered but not used which also rarely happens.therefore we suppose that developers are less likely to design sep arated or unreachable components in their apps on purpose andthe graph based metric can work on most scenarios.
results and analysesthis section aims to answer the following research questions.
rq1 can existing tools analyze multiple type apps with high suc cess rate and e ciency?
rq2 how is the performance of the tools in terms of number graph metrics?
rq3 to what extent can the tools identify iccs in our oracle set?
.
rq1 usability and e ciencyfirst we explore the con gurability of tools.
for the most populartoolic3 there are seven coal models that can be con guredin its source code.
however it brings the extra cost for users tolearn the principle and grammar of coal.
though bothic3lmnoandstorydextendic3 i.e.
are ic3 based tools they do not modifythe inner models.
asic3lmnooptimizes the callback related codesnippets andstoryddirectly invokesic3 they have no extra con g uration item.
forstoryd we remove the code related to the dynamicapp exploration process and only record the statically extractediccs.
toolsgatorandiccbotboth provide various con gurationitems.
by inspecting the argument parsing process ofgator w e nd the implicitintent item relates to icc resolution and set it astrue.
foriccbot we use all its default con gurations.then we compare the success rate during analysis and the exe cution time of tools.
the whole analysis process is performed on alinux server with two intel xeon e5 v4 cpus and gbof memory.
as shown in fig.
onbenchhand all apps can be suc cessfully analyzed within an acceptable time.
on the real world appsetbenchsmall gatoroutperforms others in e ciency whileic3 basedtools are more time consuming e.g.
ic3takes more than sixhours to analyze appsuntimeswidget.
as the users usually invokefundamental tools in limited time e.g.

with such a limit ic3andic3lmnosu er from crash or timeout problems and have alower success rate than others e.g.
they cannot nish analysis forup to and google play apps.
forstoryd though it invokesic3 it bene ts from the minute timeout setting on invoking ic3and light weight self enhancement.
the di erent success rates off droid and google play apps onbenchlargealso indicate that thecomplexity of code can greatly in!uence the results andthe ana lyzing e ciency on complex real world apps requires moreattention.

rq2 use number graph metricsin fig.
we count the number of edges that involve the basiccomponent only c c the activity component only a a andboth the basic component and fragment cf cf on each bench mark.
datasetbenchlargeis separated into two subsets f droidand google play set.
as we can see the behaviors onbenchhandare di erent from the others e.g.
ic3lmnogenerates more iccs onbenchhandwhile generating fewer iccs on the other datasets andthe result ofgatoris the opposite.
the reason is that hand madeapps usually cover the basic usages of one code feature or the com bination of a set of features.
but it is di cult to design speci c codesnippets that can cover the fn fp related complex patterns thatoccur in real world code.
thus benchhandis useful to evalu ate tools e ectiveness on speci!c characteristics while theresults are not representative enough due to the di erencesin code features between hand made and real world apps.on all datasets with real world apps gatorreported the mosticc edges.
especially on the google play dataset it generates morethan edges which is times more than all others.
un fortunately those results are confusing because we do not knowwhether they are caused by better analysis ability or higher fp rates.to gure out that question we evaluate tools with the graph basedmetricslmn opq opqrnsntqu ovnmwxytandoqzrystxyton theconstructed ctgs.

on benchhand.with the labeled oracles table gives theevaluation results on benchmarkbenchhand.
the second columngives the number of iccs in the oracle set or of each benchmark and the other columns give both the number of fp and fn iccs.
itshows that fps happen less often than fns on most benchmarks exceptbent on which toolic3lmnogenerates many fps whileic3andgatoralso generate a few ones.
by reviewing these fp relatedreports we nd that the reachability analysis of methods and thecontext value tracking results a ect the results.
for the reachabilitycomputing some tools rst compute the methods that could reachan intent sending statement and then compute the data valuesthat could be assigned to that intent object.
during the two stepreachability computing the relationship between these contextvalues and the method calls is omitted.
for example in the casestudy in figure the decorator method may be reused by multiplecallers under various contexts which leads to many fps by tools.many iccs are missed onbenras it contains various atypical typesof icc usage which requires the modeling of speci c apis.benialso leads to many fns because it uses several not commonly usedcallback methods.

on benchsmall.fig gives the hot map graph of fn rateresults onbenchsmall in which each unit square denotes the fnrate on one app and the x axis displays the apps that are sortedby the number of iccs in the oracle set.
using reliable oracles with1 edges we nd that around to iccs are missed bythe six picked tools and their average fn rates on apps vary from21 to .that is to say there are still massive fn iccswhen working on real world apps.then we perform pairwisecomparisons to gure out the common and unique iccs reportedby tools.
in fig.
the bottom left gures are about all the reportediccs whose y axis values are the ratios of reported iccs in theunion of iccs reported by two tools.
and the upper right ones onlycount the tp iccs whose y axis values are the ratios of tp iccsin the oracle icc set.
as we can see ic3covers all the reportedand the tp iccs ofic3lmnoon this benchmark and the results ofother tools are all overlapped.
for instance even thoughiccbotcan cover most tps reported by others every other tool can stillreport a few tp iccs that are missed by it.
furthermore the unionof any two tools cannot cover all iccs in the oracle set.fig.

accordingto the results thecallback entryrelated especially the dynamicand implicit callbacks cb iccs and fns are both on a large scale.one reason is callback entry identi cation is a big challenge dueto the various forms of entry declaration.
moreover many othercharacteristics show up together with callback characteristics sothey may be repeatedly counted.
compared with the results onhand made apps the non basic component related characteristicsare popular including the use offragment adapter etc.
whichmeans thatthe icc sending procedure in real world code ismuch more complex than in hand made snippets.
the java speci c characteristicspolymorphicandasynchronoushave greatin!uence on the method control!ow.
many iccs related to themfailed to be extracted.
and characteristics likestring operationanddynamic broadcast receiverare not counted because few fns relateto them in which string manipulations are more often used inmalicious apps but only benign apps are picked in our study.to avoid the mutual in!uences among characteristics we takeeach characteristic as a separated control variable and count theiccs that are only related to it.
for callback related ones we pickiccs that only satisfy one callback type but are not labeled with anyother characteristics.
for other characteristics we omit their call back setting because most iccs relate to callbacks.
as the atypicaliccs are usually related to non activity components their compo nent types are not limited.
the fn and tp results of each tool areshown in fig.
.
as we can see the java speci c characteristicasyn chronousis only concerned by two tools iccbotandstoryd andcharacteristicpolymorphicis omitted by toola3e.
thoughstaticcallbackis not a new android feature ic3 ic3lmnoanda3eallfail with the characteristic.
among all characteristics three havetight relationships with the evolution of the android framework includingimplicit callback fragment andatypical icc which arecalled newly introduced characteristics and others are pre existingones.
by evaluating the number of iccs in!uenced by each singlecharacteristic we nd that more missed iccs are caused by theinadequate analysis of pre existing characteristics than thenewly introduced ones .
so even without consideration of theevolution of the android framework there is still a long way togo to improve the precision of icc resolution tools.
.
observations for further improvementaccording to the above evaluation results we have the followingobservations worthy to be discussed.
for tool developer first the standard evaluation bench mark suites and suitable metrics for fundamental analysismodules are required.as we can see there are great di erencesbetween self made and complex commercial codes.
for further toolsthat work on icc resolution developers could reuse the datasetsand metrics provided in this paper.
for other problems developersa comprehensive evaluation of android icc resolution techniques ase october rochester mi usa dynamiccbimplicitcbpolymnonactcallcontextfragmentatypicaladapterlibraryasyncimplicitstaticcbwidget050100150200gatorgator tpgator fn dynamiccbimplicitcbpolymnonactcallcontextfragmentatypicaladapterlibraryasyncimplicitstaticcbwidget050100150200ic3ic3 tpic3 fn dynamiccbimplicitcbpolymnonactcallcontextfragmentatypicaladapterlibraryasyncimplicitstaticcbwidget050100150200ic3dialic3dial tpic3dial fn dynamiccbimplicitcbpolymnonactcallcontextfragmentatypicaladapterlibraryasyncimplicitstaticcbwidget050100150200a3ea3e tpa3e fn dynamiccbimplicitcbpolymnonactcallcontextfragmentatypicaladapterlibraryasyncimplicitstaticcbwidget050100150200storydstoryd tpstoryd fn dynamiccbimplicitcbpolymnonactcallcontextfragmentatypicaladapterlibraryasyncimplicitstaticcbwidget050100150200iccboticcbot tpiccbot fnfigure number of fn and tp iccs related to single characteristic onbenchsmallcan leverage the dynamic information to help the benchmark con struction for static tools and vice versa.
moreover as the oracles onthe complex dataset are not available it may be helpful to utilize thestructure properties of results e.g.
consider the design intentionof ctgs when evaluating icc transitions in evaluation.
for tool developer second the e ciency of static ana lyzers should raise more attention.e ciency and e ciency induced execution failures usually trouble users .
accordingto our evaluation the e ciency on complex real world apps is notsatisfactory for most tools as some expensive analysis approachesmay bring unpredictable time costs for users and may not bringequivalent bene ts.
a simple but practical strategy is to store theintermediate results during analysis and allow users to see thepartial results at a certain time point.
besides how to e ectivelydistribute computation resources during analysis should be furtherexplored.
for example developers can make a quick scan of codeto decide the order of analysis units e.g.
class or method.
or theycan dynamically evaluate the time cost of each analysis unit andhandle the costly ones speci cally.
for tool user third concerning more about the trust worthy analysis chain.many high level analyses rely on the iccresolution results and icc resolution also relies on the precisionof other modules.
as the imprecision in the low level analysis maybe propagated to the higher level the imprecision in low leveltools may greatly in!uence the nal performance with unclear rootcauses.
thus users should get a comprehensive look at any invokedtools to build a trustworthy analysis chain.
and more experimentalresearchs should be performed to give a many sided overview ofvarious fundamental analysis tools.
for tool user forth keeping aware of your key require ments.according to the results numerous iccs are missed bysix state of the art tools which means there is not a perfect so lution to resolve iccs from complex real world apps.
therefore based on our comprehensive evaluation results users should makedecisions according to their key requirements.
here we give agroup of possible requirements and the corresponding candidatetools in table involving the e ciency completeness soundness scenes to be used and key characteristics concerned.
for example iccbotworks well in terms of both e ciency and e ectivenessand supports all types of components which can be directly usedfor ctg construction.gatoroutperforms other tools in analysise ciency so that it can be used in time conscious scenarios.
for theupdating of ic3 based tools storydandic3lmnocan be adopted asthey concern fragment and entry point identi cation respectively.note thatic3lmnoonly works well on parts of apps and the reasonis unclear.storydprovides dynamic ui reference andgatorhas astatic ui analysis client so they can combine with layout analysis.and if users pay attention to the data carried with icc they cantryiccbot ic3 gator which have such intent eld analysis.table candidate tools with key requirementsrequirement candidate toolsrequirement candidate toolsless time cost gator a3e iccbotic3 based update storyd ic3dail ic3more real iccs iccbot gator storydui analysis storyd gatorfewer fake iccs iccbot storyd ic3intent eld extract iccbot ic3 gatorhigh succrate iccbot storyd a3efragment aware iccbot storyd5 root causes and patterns5.
false negatives in icc resolutionas shown in the pairwise comparison results between tools toolshave their speci c fn icc sets.
by comparing their di erences weseparate fn iccs into two categories missed by parts of tools andmissed by all tools.
for the iccs missed by parts of tools one reasonis the lack of analysis on speci c characteristics e.g.
the omissionoffragmentby gator.
meanwhile the e ciency of the analysisapproach is another reason.
many iccs are missed because sometools cannot nish the analysis within a given time e.g.
ic3reachestimeout on many apps.
by comparing the fn set of tools we ndthat iccs are missed by all tools.
then we analyze the valueof the labeled tags of these iccs compare the distributionof tags on these iccs and on all iccs refer to table and ndseveral tags have a higher ratio on the commonly missed iccs including fragment static callback etc.
based on the icc triggeringpath labeled in our dataset two of the authors discuss how can aspeci c tag characteristic in!uence the identi cation of icc.
finally we nd iccs are layout related involve multiple callbacks 49for inter procedural assignment are about container modeling and we also nd special cases caused by implicit assignment andrecord it.
five common fn patterns are discussed as follows.p1 layout related callback.there are several forms of call back entries related to xml layout les.
the rst line in listing 1gives the normal type of static callback which declares a call back for abuttonwidget.
following a customized viewnavviewis statically declared which indeed has a dynamic callback innavview.classand will send icc in this callback method.

in the android framework the parameter ofonattach equals the host activity of the current fragment which is an im plicit data assignment.
besides the modeling of the fragment loadingbehaviors it also requires modeling the implicit data relationships.ase october rochester mi usa jiwei yan shixin zhang yepang liu xi deng jun yan and jian zhangsupports another implicit way to trigger intents.

without the modeling of adapteroperating apis we can not!gure out which fragment is loaded here.besides multiple types of adapters there are also various types ofdata containers whose modeling is a challenge to both the control ow edge and data value extraction.listing fn container modeling incomponenta.class atotgt publicvoidoncreate mviewpager.setadapter madapter madapter newfragmentpageradapter getsupportfragmentmanager publicfragment getitem intposition switch position case0 returnnewf ... infragmentf.classpublicvoidonattach activity act startactivity newintent tgt.class p5 implicit assignment.in listing componenta!rst loadsfragmentf.

a hybrid approach for inference between behavioral ex ception api documentation and implementations and its applications.
in37th ieee acm international conference on automated software engineering ase october rochester mi usa.acm new york ny usa pages.
introductionapi documentation speci!es the conditions that users must followto integrate apis into their codebase.
speci!cally behavioral excep tion be documentation indicates the circumstances under whichan api throws an exception.
besides allowing users to understandthe apis better api documentation on be also enables auto mated tools to verify program properties .
however the lack ofspeci!cations has hindered software library utilization .
to ad dress that many approaches have been proposed for automated apidocumentation generation.
they can be classi!ed into four catego ries program analysis pa mining software repositories msr rule based natural language processing nlp andmachine learning ml .inthe pa direction dynamic analysis approaches dynamically infer program properties bydetecting data and temporal invariants.
however they require largetest suites which might be incomplete leading to inaccurate results.in contrast static analysis approaches overestimate program behaviors and have high false positives.techniques in msrleverage data mining to derive or check apiusage speci!cations from existing repositories.
they mine the callsites of the apis and focus on the api usage or temporal orders e.g.
ase october rochester mi usahoan anh nguyenet al.sets pairs or sequences of co occurringapis predicates or graphs of apis .
they donot focus on behavior exceptions properties of the mined code.several rule based natural language processing nlp tech niques analyze existing textual documentation toderive the pre conditions based on which they detect inconsis tencies and directive defects in the corresponding source code.they use rules patterns lexical and semantic matching to derivepre post conditions to support testing.
while these approaches donot require large training data the extracted lexical and semanticrules are restricted by the pre de!ned templates and not generaliz able for be documentation.recent advances inmachine learning ml are also applied inspeci!cation mining.
phanet al.
leveragephrase based statisti cal machine translation smt to derive be speci!cation from code.however it treats code as texts without considering structure.otheradvanced ml approachesincludingdeep learning dl mod els e.g.
tree based transformer dual task learning neuralnetwork machine translation are used for the generalpurpose of code to text or text to code translations.
however theseapproaches cannot directly be extended for the translation betweenbe documentation and source code for the following reasons !rst they require a large amount of training data which is not viable assoftware libraries often lack such speci!cations second theyare not speci!cally designed to exploit the structural informationin either or both be documentation sentences and source code.in this work we proposes!
!g a hybrid structural and sta tistical machine translation approach that supports bi directionalinference between be documentation and its corresponding imple mentation.
we consider an api method to possess two levels ofabstraction its implementation and documentation.
both serve asimilar purpose i.e.
the be documentation in the natural languagedomain outlines the behavior before or after the api method iscalled and the respective be part of source code in the program ming language domain describes the exception behavior.to overcome the aforementioned issues we customize modifyan smt model and enhance it with the structural information fromboth documentation and source code.
besides enabling learningin a low data setting this reduces the burden of mapping translat ing the structures as in the sequence based dl models.
moreover it provides the exibility over the rule based nlp approaches inlearning implicit translation rules in both directions.the key idea ins!
!g is to carry out translation via divide and conquer in a syntax directed fashion that is similar in spirit tosyntax directed program editing to improve editing correctness.
forcode be documentation we take advantage of well structuredsource code to generate the clausal structure of a sentence in bedocumentation.
next for each syntactic code structure we usephrase based smt to produce the translated clause in the documen tation.
finally the translated clauses are merged according to theclausal structure to produce the!nal be documentation.
for bedocumentation code we!rst parse the sentences and normalizethem into the clause trees that represent the conditions for the apistated in the documentation.
we then generate the syntactic unitsin source code corresponding to those clause trees and use thephrase based smt to produce the code for each clause.

.1divide and conquer bidirectional translation.feed ing the entire be sentence code as is to a model would burden it withimplicitly learning the structural mappings.
in a low data setting this is ine cient.
instead we utilize phrase based statistical ma chine translation smt with a structure based divide and conquerstrategy.
this is achieved by breaking the given be sentence codeinto smaller fragments translating individual fragments and!nallymerging the results into the!nal translated be code sentences.
.
.2structural translation.instead of letting the model learnthe structure mappings to enable structural translation we takeadvantage of the structure information in be sentences and becode by splitting them into the smaller document clause trees andcode clause trees.
smt is used to learn and translate the phraseswithin the clauses in the trees.
such a design choice helps us inavoiding the use of complex models in structure learning.
.
.3implicit learning of translation rules via statisticalmachine translation.while the structure translation is per formed deterministically!rst smt is used later to learn the map pings between the words phrases in a clause and the code token s sequences in an expression.
smt is data driven helping learnthe translation rules implicitly without having to explicitly specifythem as in the rule based nlp approaches.

!g approach overviewfigure showss!
!g s overview with two processes.
intrain ing we take the corpus of the api methods with be documentationand source code parse the documentation to extract the clauses andbuild the clause trees to represent the conditions for the api statedin the documentation.
we also parse the code to extract the excep tional ow graphs and build the code clause trees representing theexception conditions.
clause trees in both sides are serialized intosequences to train the corresponding phrase based smt models intwo directions.
the documentation and code sequences are usedaccordingly for source and target in each direction.forgenerationfrom doc to code we parse the be sentencesin javadoc to extract the clause trees and convert them into thecode clause trees.
we then feed the texts in each document clauseto the trained smt model to produce the translated code for eachfigure 3a documentation clause tree.orbeginindex is negativebeginindex is larger than thelength of this string objectfigure 4a code clause tree.
beginindex 0beginindex lengthclause.
finally we merge and serialize the translated code for allthe clauses into the!nal result.
a similar process is performed forcode to doc model in the reverse direction.
documentation code clause treesa challenge as using phrase based smt for doc to code is the gen erated code with incorrect syntaxes .
for example the conditionto throwstringindexoutofboundsexception if beginindex is negative orlarger than the length of this string object would be translatedintobe inindex len th.
the reason is that the subjectbeginindexdo not need to be repeated for the part larger than thelength of thisstringobject however in source code we need to havebe inindex len th.
to overcome that we use tree structured rep resentations for the texts for the be conditions and for the sourcecode.
for the apisubstring the condition of the exceptionstringindex outofboundexceptionto be thrown is either thebeginindexis negative or it is greater than the length of this string object .
the conditions canbe expressed in two forms texts in documentation e.g.
in english and expressions in source code e.g.
in java logical expressions .
.
document clause treewe aim to convert the clause describing a condition e.g.
the condi tion if clause in the documentation into a tree structured form calleda documentation clause tree.
in a clause tree the root and theintermediate nodes are either the connective words and or or and the leaf nodes aresimple logical clausesthat cannot be brokenfurther into a conjunctive via and or disjunctive via or of anyother clauses.
an example of a simple logical clause simple clausefor short is beginindexis negative .
another example is beginindexislarger than the length of this string object .
a simple clause often hasthe syntactical structure of eithernounphrase verbphrase adjectivephraseornounphrase verbphrase nounphrase.
on the other hand a clause treerepresents acomplex logical clause representing a condition withconjunction s and or disjunction s among simple clauses and orother complex clauses.
an example of a complex logical clause complex clause for short is a clause tree rooted at an or node which has two children figure .
the!rst child of the root is thesimple clause beginindexis negative and the second one is the simpleclause beginindexis larger than the length of this string object .
thealgorithm to parse documentation into clause trees is in section .
.ase october rochester mi usahoan anh nguyenet al.figure 5a parse tree.
.
code clause treewe parse the code to build a tree for the condition for each exception.the tree is adapted from the structure of a java logical expression.in this representation which we refer to asa code clause tree a leafnode is an atomic java logical expression that cannot be furtherbroken down into a conjunctive or disjunctive of any other logicalexpressions.
the root or an intermediate node is a logicaland or a logicalor operator see an example in figure .
clause extraction algorithms4.
extracting documentation clause treeslet us explain hows!
!g parses an api documentation tobuild the clause trees for relevant exceptions.
for example forsubstring beginindex the pair isstringindexoutofboundexceptionand theclause tree in figure .
if the api method is relevant to multipleexceptions there are multiple pairs of exceptions and clause trees.s!
!g processes the tagsthrowsandexception.
for each tag itextracts the exception s name and the condition clause after thekeyword if to build a clause tree for that exception.s!
!g !rst identi!es the code elements embedded within the documenta tion such as the method s arguments and!elds and replaces themby special tokenscodewith indexes for their identi!cations.
therationale for this step is that if they are kept intact the names ofthe code elements could be mistakenly treated as regular englishterms by the nlp parser to be used for text analysis later.
next s!
!g uses the stanford nlp tool to parse the text into aparse tree with the part of speech pos tagging.
in the case ofcomparative sentences s!
!g heuristically moves prepositionalphrases e.g.
than the length... to be a child of the node of therelated comparative adjective e.g.
greater instead of being a childof an adjective phrase as in the nlp parse tree.
the parse tree forour running example is shown in figure .listing shows the pseudo code for our clause tree buildingalgorithm.
it!rst decides if the given parse treeptis the case ofa conjunction or disjuntion sentence.
if it is the case s!
!g identi!es the corresponding connective wordccat the highestlevel in the parse tree.
the stanford parser annotates such connec tive words with the labelcc coordinating conjunction .

for example after enhancing we have the parsetree for beginindex is larger than the length of this string object .the subtreetafter being enhanced becomes complete is used in arecursive call at line .

extracting code clause treeslet us explain how we build the clause trees for corresponding code.we!rst build an intra procedural pdg ipdg for the body of theapi.
we inline the methods called in the ipdg section .
.
andpartially evaluate the expressions with concrete values resultingfrom method inlining section .
.
.
we then extract the partsof pdg that lead to exception exit points to construct the inter procedural efg section .
.
.
finally we collect the conditionsin the efg to build the code clause trees of logical expressions section .
.
.
next let us provide the details of these steps.
.
.
method inlining.to be complete in detecting exceptional ow paths we need to perform inter procedural analysis.
the pdgfor the body of an api might contain calls to other methods whosebodies contain control conditions and exception exit points.
in fig ure the methodget index callsrangecheck index to check the controlconditionindex sizebefore throwing an exception.
in this work instead of supporting inter procedural analysis we inline the pdgsof those callees to reveal all the conditions and exit points.
the inlin ing process stops when there is no callee or the bodies of the calleesare not available i.e.
calling to a method in an external library orcalling to a native method.
we also stop inlining if encountering arecursive call.
inlining is realized through the connections of thepdg mof a methodminto the pdg of its caller.
.
.
partial evaluation.when inlining min the calling contextof the methodmin its caller could help partially evaluate expres sions in m. for example substring begin callssubstring begin end inits body and passes the!eldcountas the second parameter in theplace of the formal parameterend.
the exception handling occursin the body ofsubstring begin end .
thus during inlining the expres sionend countbecomescount countand can be evaluated tofalse.
thispartial evaluation helps eliminate infeasible paths and or simplifythe control conditions in detecting the exceptional ows.
.
.
exceptional flow graph extraction.after building intra procedural pdgs performing method inlining and partial eval uation we extract the efg.
an efg of an api is a slice of theconstructed pdg leading to all exception exit points.
we considerallthrowandassertstatements as exception exit points.
we do notconsider method invocation nodes because they would or wouldnot lead to an exception.
using conditions along the paths that itis not sure if they lead to exception would result in preconditionsstronger than needed.
.
.
condition abstraction.the preconditions extracted from theimplementation could be invisible from outside of the library e.g.
client code due to information hiding.
for example we could getheader.next headerin whichheaderis a private!eld.
however we aimto derive general preconditions accessible from client code.
there fore we need to perform the abstraction step on the conditions.predicate method replacement.we overcome the aboveproblem by searching for a predicate method that is equivalentto the expression containing a private member and then replaceit.
for example the private!eldsizeon line of figure can bereplaced with the predicate methodsize lines .the search is performed by comparing the pdg of each expres sion with the pdg of each predicate method in the library in casethat a predicate is a static method in another class .
we only searchfor predicate methods that have no side e ects.
the attributekeyisused as label when comparing data nodes.
we use an approximatemethod to e ciently compare graphs via vectors.argument replacement.the variables expressions passed asparameters of an api could be named di erently from the names offormal arguments of the api.
thus we abstract the formal argumentnames by its position in the argument list.
we use thesymbolicnameargito denote thei th argument in the argument list of the api.for example the labelindexof noded1is abstracted intoarg0becauseit is the!rst argument of the api.
we use the def use relation viatherefedges to identify the
