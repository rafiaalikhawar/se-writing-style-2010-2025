introduction during programming developers must name variables functions parameters etc.
the appropriateness of a name changes over time during the software evolution.
for example a good function name can degrade into a poor one when the semantics of the function change or the function is used in a new context.
poor names make programs harder to understand and maintain leadingtomisusesanddefects .findingconsistentnames forprogramconstructshasalwaysbeenacynosureinthesoftware industry.
methods are the most minor named units for indicating the program behavior in most programming languages thus they are particularly important .

more consistent with other names in the same project or the codebase.
especially when collaborating they need to obey a project s coding conventions.

proposed an ir based approach to detect and rename inconsistent method names.theyidentifytheinconsistentmethodnamesbycomparingthenamesretrievedfromthemethodbodyvectorspacewiththose retrieved from the method name vector space.
for the inconsistent names their model recommends the potentiallyconsistent names by referring to the names of similarly implemented methods.
however inmanycases eventhemethodswithsimilarbodycodecanbe named differently because they might belong to different projects ieee acm 44th international conference on software engineering icse authorized licensed use limited to lahore univ of management sciences.

besides by retrieving names from similar methods the model cannot suggest neologisms.
