there has been considerable prior research to understand the characteristicsofprojectsthatsucceedinattractingandonboarding new contributors as well as the barriers faced by people placing their rst contributions in open source projects .

attractingnewdeveloperstocontributetoanopen sourceproject is an important part of the project s sustainability and the early stage of developer involvement in the project.
researchers have identi edseveralfactorsthatshouldhelpwithattractingandonboarding new developers.

our work provides an alternative perspective tounderstanding the new contributors to a project by shifting the focus from the project itself to the characteristics of potential contributors.
our results also connect to the research on social media promotion foropen sourceprojectsandopen sourceprojectdi usionin general as we show that the characteristics of the community that the promotion reaches impact the successful attraction of new contributors.wefurtheridentifyseveralsuchcharacteristicsthat open sourcepromoters maypay attention to.
theoreticalframeworkand research hypotheses ourstudyinvestigatestherelationshipbetweencharacteristicsof a project s labor pool and its ability to attract new contributors.
asmentionedabove wede nelaborpool asthesetofdevelopers active in the overall open source ecosystem around the same time that a given project could plausibly attempt to recruit new contributors from.
that is in our de nition labor pools are always tied to speci c projects.
for example we expect that a text processing project slaborpoolisdi erentfromabioinformaticsproject slabor pool althoughthe twomay overlap if for example they involve applicationsofmachinelearning.inaddition werequireanotion ofplausibleawareness ofthefocalprojectfromdevelopersinthe laborpool.indeed attheveryleast onewouldneedtobeawareof aprojectandpossibleopportunitiestocontributebeforedeciding to do so.we discuss our operationalizationlater insection .
.
withthisde nition wehypothesizeaboutdi erencesintendencies to join i.e.
start contributing changes to a focal project for developers in the labor pool and the relationships we theorize the directionofin uenceaswell betweensuchfactorsexternaltoa projectandtheproject ssuccessatattractingnewcontributors.we will operationalize and more formally test these hypotheses below in section .
note also that we use the terms developer andcontributorinterchangeably andinclusivelyofalltypesofcontribution not justcode.
to begin with the size of the project s labor pool at some point in time should be an important predictor of the number of new contributors the project engages in the near future.
a larger labor pool size should indicate that more developers are aware of the project thusthepossibilitythatsomeofthosedeveloperswillbe interestedto contributeincreases.therefore we hypothesize h1.the number of developers in a project s labor pool is positively associatedwiththenumberofnewcontributorstheprojectreceivesin thenearfuture.
for potential contributors in the labor pool a social connection with current project developers should reduce their uncertainty about the project as they may trust the information about the project provided by their friends and may be in a betterposition toevaluatetheoutcomeofcontributing .inaddition familiarity 1althoughinouroperationalizationbelowweconsideronlycontributionsintheform of commits including pull request commits to keep our analysis tractable.

we thus hypothesize h2.the strength of social connections between existing project members and others in the labor pool is positively associated with the number ofnew developerstheprojectreceives in thenearfuture.
the development of open source software is skilled work.
to providevaluablecontributionstotheproject developersneedtobe familiarwiththeprogramminglanguages technologies andcoding styleintheproject andalignwiththeproject sgoalsandother suchconstraints.therequirementfortechnicalprogrammingskills is often a barrier for new contributors to join a project and the contributionsof people withless ofa trackrecordofactivity in open source are also less likely to be accepted .
going one step further wehypothesizethatit snotenoughtohaveopensource contributionexperience butratherthattheexperienceshouldbe technically relevantto the focal project h3.thedegreeofsimilarity or t betweenthetechnologiesusedina projectandthetechnicalbackgroundofthedevelopersintheproject s labor pool is positively associated with the number of new developers theprojectreceives in thenearfuture.
finally contributing to open source projects takes a lot of effort .giventhattheamountoftimeanyonecaninvestin contributing to open source is unavoidably limited at the very least by the laws of physics one can expectthat the total number ofprojectsonecanjoinshouldbelimitedaswell.andwhileitis common for people to contribute to multiple open source projects evenduringthesameday andone scapacityfor multitasking across projects increases when the projects share the same programminglanguages therecanstillbemoreprojectsavailable than one hascapacity for.
therefore a developer part of thelabor poolofmultipleprojectsmaybeforcedtochoosefromamongthem.
stated di erently a developer s tendency to join a project may not only be in uenced by the characteristics of the focal project but alsobytheamountofother competing projectsthedeveloperis exposed to.
as competition for new contributors can exist between projectswithoverlappinglaborpools we hypothesize h4.aprojectwillengagefewernewcontributorsinthenearfuture the more overlap there is between its labor pool and labor pools of otherprojects.
h5.theprojectwillreceivemorenewcontributorsifitisrelatively attractive compared to other projects that developers in its labor pool arealsopossiblyexposed to.
we describe our study design for testing these hypotheses next.
methods this section rst gives the high level intuition behind our research design andthen dives intothe technical details for eachstep.
.
keystudydesign decisions andtradeo s testing the hypotheses above requires a macro ecosystem level analysis.
given a focal project at a given time we need to operationalize its laborpool from among thosepeople active acrosstheentireopen source universe atthattime h1 h2 .then forevery suchperson weneedtomakeinferencesabouttheirpastexperience withdi erenttechnologiesacrosstheopen source universe.
we then need to use these estimates to compute the people s technical twiththefocalproject h3 aswellastocompute pairwise their technical t with all other available projects in the open source universe to identify the ones which might be competing for their attention h4 h5 .
giventheobviouscomputationalcomplexityofsuchanalysis we made several tradeo s between computational feasibility on the one hand and realism and statistical power on the other hand.
this resultedinthe following three key study designdecisions.
study context the python ecosystem.
to keep our analysis tractable we choose to analyze only one open source ecosystem thepythonprogramminglanguageecosystem butconsider all projectspartoftheecosystem.pythonisamongthemostpopular and widely used programming languages in open source and it is the language behind libraries and frameworks used in a diversity of application domains.2at the same time the python open source ecosystem contains a large set of projects enabling ustodrawconclusionswithhighstatisticalpower.thus astudy of the python ecosystem provides important practical implications andalsosigni cantscienti c value.
labor pool sampling frame the co commit network.
we operationalizethelaborpoolofafocalprojectatagiventimebased onrelationshipsbetweennodesintheproject s collaborationnetwork.nodesinthenetworkrepresentindividualdevelopers and edges indicatethatthosetwodevelopers made commitsto a same project in the same time period i.e.
a co commit relationship.
for simplicity wecomputethecollaborationnetworkinyearlysnapshots witheachsnapshotcapturingtheactivityintherespective previousfullcalendaryear i.e.
from1stofjanuary 1to 31st of december .
we construct the network startingfrom thesetofallcontributorstothefocalprojectinyear .thenwe expand outwards to include all their collaborators from all other projects each contributed to in year .
then transitively we collect all their collaborators in the sameyear 1andso forth uptothreehopsawayfromthestartingsetofthefocalproject s contributors.
the goalhereisto approximate the numberof developers who mightbeawareofthefocalprojectatagiventime awarenessisa rst step towards deciding to contribute.
clearly there are myriad onlineando inewaystolearnaboutnewprojects includingsocial media recommendationsystems directlyfollowingotherdevelopersonsocialcodingplatformslikegithub meetings andmanyotherchannels .
identifying the exact set of developers who are aware of the projectatagiventimeisimpossible.instead weuseco committing relationships as a proxy for awareness of the focal project.
prior researchsuggeststhatthecollaborationbetweendeveloperscreates opportunities for communication and the information about a projectislikelytodi useasaresultofdeveloperinteractions .

co committing to a common project does not guarantee direct collaborationorinteraction butisaprerequisiteforbothfor contributors who make changes to a project s codebase at the very least it provides an opportunity for interaction and direct collaboration.
moreover not all such co committing relationships will result in information about the focal project being di used especiallyasthenumberofhopsfromthefocalproject sdevelopers increases.
however we expect that on average the more such opportunitiesforinteractionexist themorelikelyitbecomesfor information aboutthe focal projectto be di used.
this operationalization also has the advantage of being agnostic totheplatformwherethesourcecoderepositoryisbeinghosted therebyallowingustomoreeasilyscaletheanalysisbeyondany singleplatformwhereadditional platform speci cformsofinteraction could alsobe considered e.g.
interactionsvia issuetracker comments.
while currently the dominant one github is not the only platform for hosting open source.
labor pool operationalization people one hop away from current project contributors in the co commit network.
to further reduce the computational complexity of the analysis weoperationalizethelaborpoolofafocalprojectatagiventime only as the set of developers within one hop away from current project contributors in the collaboration network who have never contributedto the projectbefore.the rationaleistwofold.
first informationdi usiontheorysuggeststhattheclosernodes are to the information source in a network the more likely they aretoreceivetheinformation .thus onecanexpectthat awareness of the focal project should decrease substantially the more hops away one is from the focal project s current developers.
this is consistent with prior software engineering research reporting a relatively low tendency to join the focal project in thefutureforpeoplewhosawitmentionedontwitter thereisarguablyconsiderabledistancebetweenafocalopen sourceproject hostedonthe githubplatform andan averagetwitter user.

overviewoftheanalysis given these key design decisions we structure our study in two parts as summarized in figure .
both parts involve regression models explaining the tendency and number of new developers joining projects in a next time period as a function of the sets of factors we formulate explicit hypotheses about via their correspondingvariablescomputedinacurrenttimeperiod.inthe rst part we take a developer centric view from the perspective of an individual developer they typically have a choice of projects theycouldcontributetoandarangeofprojectsthey reinthelabor poolfor basedonpastcollaborations.inthesecondpartwetake aproject centric view aggregating individual level e ects to the level of the whole ecosystem to reason about project labor pool characteristics andcompetition e ects.
first we estimate the relative importance of the three sets of factors we formulate explicit hypotheses about6 the strength ofsocialconnectionstoexistingprojectmembers h2 the tbetweenone stechnicalbackgroundandthefocalproject h3 and theamountofcompetition orchoiceonehas betweenavailable projects with similar technical t h4 h5 at the individual level.todothis westartbycomputingadataframeof labor pooldeveloper focal project pairs with measurements ofthe relevant variables details below for every developer in a given project s laborpool acrossallprojectsinoursample wealsorecordabinary outcomevariableindicatingwhetherornotthatdeveloperjoined the project in the next period.
using this data we then construct a logistic regression model explaining the developers tendency to joinafocalprojectinthenextyearasafunctionofthevariables of interest the labor pool is operationalized as described above i.e.
peopleone hopawayfromthefocalproject sdevelopers.we refer to variations of this logistic regression model under di erent speci cations as individual models .
note that the goal here is not to make individual predictions aboutanyonedeveloper stendencytojoinagivenprojectinthe next time period.
rather the goalistoestimatethe relativeimportanceof the three sets of factors of interest on average across a large sample such that we can reuse these weights i.e.
the estimatedvcoe cients from the logistic regression model in the 6excluding h1 whichrefersto the laborpoolsize ratherthan its composition.secondpartofouranalysis.forexample weestimatehowmuch the technical background t explains the joining tendency of an averagedeveloper compared to the strength of social connections and the amount of competition from other projects over a large sample.
because we estimate the logistic regression over a very largesample wecanassumethatthesecoe cientsarestable 7so we estimate only one set of individual models8to be used as input for the secondpart.
next welift9theindividual levelanalysistotheprojectlevelby estimating regressions that explain the number of new developers joining projects in a next year as a function of their labor pool characteristics and control variables in the current year.
we refer tothesemodelsas projectmodels andweusethemtoformally test allour hypotheses h1 h5.
to ensure the robustness of our conclusions we repeat this analysis for all the complete pairs of consecutive years in our data from2015 2016to2020 .intheend wequantifytheamountof variance that the labor pool characteristics explain when modeling thenumberofnewcontributorsaprojectwillreceive interpretthe results anddiscuss the implicationsof our ndings.
.
data collectionandfiltering we mine our data from the world of code woc dataset which contains the git commit traces for all public projects hosted on github gitlab bitbucket sourceforge and many other smaller ones.
we expect that world of code should give better coverage ofopen sourcedevelopmentcomparedtootherdatasetstypically usedinprior research.
tobeginwith wede netheopen sourcepythonecosystemas containing all repositories with over of their les written in the python language.we then applyseveral lters tode noise the data as typicalwithminingsoftware repositories research .
first we lter out repositories with fewer than commits that involve changes to library import statements i.e.
adding or removing dependencies.
this step is needed because we later use this dependency information to characterize the technical needs of projects i.e.
we assume that a project using certain libraries requires contributors with experience in those libraries.
we chose thethresholdarbitrarily balancingadesiretoretainalargesample on the one hand with an attempt to lter out trivial projects code dumps homework solutions etc and a need for enough data for the subsequent embeddings based approach to work.
similarly we lteroutdevelopersfromlaborpoolsiftheyauthoredfewerthan commits that involve changes to library import statements for analogous reasons.
as a robustness validation we run the same analysis over datasets where projects and authors with less than commits that involve change of packages are removed and the results are qualitatively similar see the replication package for validation study .
second we made sure to use the de aliased activity records fromthe worldofcodedataset whichprovidesbothraw dataon commit authors as well as data on de aliased commit authors after mergingdeveloperidentitieswhentheyusedi erentaliases see 7wediscuss robustnesschecks for thisassumption below.

similarly to the individual model we restrict our sample to only active projects i.e.
having at least one commit in year as projects that are inactive for more than one year should have lower probability of attracting new contributors in the next year compared to active projects and we do not want our sample to be biased by the large number of inactive projects which attract no new contributors.

in model i we include social and technical variables that correspond to h2andh3.
both the social connection between potential new developers and the existing developers and the technical similarity between potential developers skill sets and the project s technical requirements are statistically signi cantly and positively associated to the likelihood of individuals joining new projects whichcon rmsh2andh3.
in model ii we include the competition e ects on the basis of modeli asdiscussedin h4andh5.h4iscon rmed asindicated bythenegativee ectofvariable numberofcompetingprojects log which suggests that the more projects a developer was potentially exposed to the more labor pools they are part of the lower the likelihoodthatthe developerwill joinanyspeci coneofthem.

to better analyze the impact of social technical factors on individual joining tendencies we examine project developer pairs where the developer belongs to the project s labor pool and is a potential new contributor.
we categorize these pairs into four groups based onwhetherthe developer s technical similarity to the focal projectandtheirsocialconnectiontoexistingdevelopersareabove orbelowthemedianvaluesobservedinoursample.wethencalculatethejoiningprobabilityforeachproject developerpairwithin each group.

labor poolas animportant factorfor project sustainability the prevailing empirical studies on open source sustainability and attractingnewcontributorsinparticular havefocusedonthein uence of project level characteristics.
in our paper we provide an alternative ecosystem levelperspectivebysuggestingtheproject s laborpoolas an importantfactor.
thelaborpoolofaprojectcorrespondstothecommunitiesof developersthatmaybeofhelptothedevelopmentandmaintenance of the project.
they consist of developers who learn about the project through many possible channels like recommendations fromtheirfriendsorcollaborators exposureonsocialmediaspaces recommendation systems web search engines and many others.
they are the contribution resources potentially accessible by the projectat agiven time.
considering labor pool factors following a methodology similar to ours can help open source stakeholders to better understand andpredicttheamountofcontributionsprojectsmayhaveinthefuture which helpswiththe projectmanagementand resourceallocation.
moreover users who are seeking sustainable open source projectstoadoptcanuselaborpoolfactorstobetterevaluatethe sustainabilityofcandidate projects.
.2thesizeofthelabor pool is important but itisnot all that matters it is not surprising that expanding the size of the project s labor pool helps to attract new developers which is why so much e ort has been devoted to promoting open source projects to a larger audience .
however ourresults indicatethat the characteristics of the developers in the project s labor pool in addition totherawnumberofdevelopers alsohaveasigni cante ectto explainthe number ofnewdevelopers that aprojectwillreceive.

the relationship betweenprojects andthe success ofopen sourceecosystems the signi cant competition e ects between projects revealed by our models suggest that the attraction of developers to projects isnotalocalquestion.giventwoprojectswithoverlappinglabor pools any e ort to make one project more attractive is likely to have a negative e ect on the sustainability of the other when they are competing for the same e ort pool.
this ndingraisestheimportantquestionabouttheallocation of e ort among open source projects and the role of individual projects in the success of the open source ecosystem.

to validate the in uence of labor pool factors we use a negative binomialregressionmodeltoestimatethenumberofnewdevelopers that a project receives with all the independent variables the same as the ordinary least squares ols regression used to report the main result see replication package.

despite this inconsistency the e ective labor pool size with the individual model of full variables still shows a signi cant positive e ect and the akaike information criterion aic valuedecreaseswhenaddinglaborpoolvariables whichindicatesbettermodel t.therefore weconcludetheresults withnegativebinomialregressionaregenerallyconsistentwiththe ols regression.
conclusions in this work we show that an open source project s labor pool de ned as the set of developers who are possibly aware of the projectandmayserveaspotentialfutureprojectcontributors isan importantfactorthatcanimpactprojectsustainability.wefound that adding the labor pool factors being both the amount and characteristics of developers in a project s labor pool explains more variance compared to baselinemodels that only include project characteristics.
we also show that the technical t the social connection and the project competition e ects are three factors that can a ect how developers move between projects.
our workcontributestothescienti cunderstandingofwhatleadsto the attraction of new open source developers beyond individual project level factors and provides important implications to opensourcestakeholdersforbetterprojectpromotionandcommunity management.
