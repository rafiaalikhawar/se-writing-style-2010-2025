background topic models are statistical techniques that are commonly used for discovering latent topics in text collections.
in topic modeling atopic can be described as a collection of words which representathematicconceptinacorpus anddocumentsinthecorpusare representedas probabilisticdistributions overthese topics.in what follows we introduce the most commonly used topic modelingapproach lda and its extension the keyword assisted topic model keyatm .
.
latent dirichlet allocation lda introduced by blei et.
al lda is an unsupervised technique for modelingtopicsinacollectionofdocuments.ldautilizeswordco occurrenceinformationinordertogrouprelatedwordsintoasingle topic.
to infer topics from a corpus of documents lda represents documentsasrandommixturesoverlatenttopics.formally lda calculatestwodirichletdistributions theword topicdistribution kfortopickandthedocument topicdistribution dfordocument d.thehyperparameters and aretypicallyusedaspriorsfor and .foreachword iinthedataset thetopic ziisdrawnfromthe ddistribution and the word wiis drawn from the zidistribution.
lda s usecases include traditional topic extraction for long texts tagrecommendationforsearchengines softwaresystemscategorization andbuglocalization .despiteitsadvantages ldasuffersfromseverallimitationswhenit comes to processing online user generated text.
for instance in the context of app feedback analysis mobile app reviews are often short personal and contain colloquial terms.
thus they are too semantically restricted for complex distributional approaches suchas lda to operate leading lda to generate random topics or even overfit the data .
furthermore lda by design tendstogeneralizeoverlargertopicsinordertobettermodelfrequently occurring words.
therefore more specific and nuanced topics are often left ignored .
this limitation is critical for user reviewanalysisasusefulinformationinuserreviewsistypically domain specific .
.
keyword assisted topic modeling keyword assistedtopicmodeling keyatm isanoveltechnique thathasbeenproposedtoimproveupontraditionaltopicmodels such as lda .
the key idea behind keyatm is that it incorporates user defined seed words for topic word distributions.
each potential topic can be supplemented by specific keywords thatarebelievedtodescribeatheme.formally keyatmmodifies the traditional lda algorithm in two ways the word topic distribution kis replaced with a mixture oftwodistributions aseed topicdistribution sand aregular topicdistribution r.theseed topicdistribution can only select words from the initial seed set while the regular topicdistributionmayselectanywordsinthecorpus including the seed words.
the parameter kcontrols the probability of drawing a word from either sor r. todrawthedocument topicdistribution d foreachdocumentd a binary vector vecbof the length s number of seeded topics is generated.

inparticular toaddressthedomain specificityproblem keyatm utilizes a binary vector vecbwhich elevates the less common topics for the provided seed words.
these seed words can be extracted in advancebasedonexpertopinioninordertosupplementkeyatm with a high level overview of the user review corpus.

by combining seeded and regular distributions keyatm generates more cohesive and focused topics overcoming the main limitation of using lda to model semantically restricted user reviews.

.ourapproachcanbe dividedintothreesteps.inthefirststep weapplyseveralheuristics to extract informative user reviews.
in the second step we preprocess and summarize extracted reviews in order to generate a representative set of important keywords or seeds for the corpus.
in the third step seeds are fed into keyatm to generate a topic distributionoverextractedreviews.inwhatfollows wedescribe each of these steps using illustrative examples.
.
informative review extraction mobileappreviewsvaryinquality.previousresearchhasshown thatappreviewsdonotfollowawell definedstructureandoften containspellingfluctuations colloquialterms andspam .
therefore a large proportion of app store reviews is simply uninformative .
as topic models are particularly susceptible to generating uninterpretable topics from semantically poor documents the first step of our approach is to improve the quality of our review corpus by filtering out uninformative feedback.
to detect informative reviews we adopt guo and singh s approachforsynthesizingpotentiallymeaningfuluserstoriesfrom mobileappreviews .auserstory canbedefinedasarelationship between an action that a user took and a problem that an app produced in response to that action.
such stories describe users experiences and outcomes when interacting with their apps.
forexample a user might complain that their navigation app loses gpssignal whenindrivemode.
suchastory contains potentially usefulinformationforappdevelopersasitoutlinesthecondition indrivemode underwhichaproblem gpslostsignal occurred.
thesestoriesarecommonlypresentinlow starappreviews one andtwostars giventhatappproblemsareoftenaccompaniedby lowratings .ourexpectationisthattopicsmodeledafter reviews with user stories will be more coherent and thus more interpretable.
to identify reviews that might contain user stories common temporal conjunctions are used including words such as after as soon as before every time then until when whenever while andduring.
temporal conjunctions indicate temporal and causal ordering of events that was found to be particularly helpful for mitigating problems of text sparseness .
for example consider the four app reviews in example .
r1 r2 andr3are informative reviewsthatcontainuserstoriesintheformofaction problempairs temporalconjunctions areunderlined .
r1describesanaction of scrollthroughthepages andaproblem a crash.suchareviewcan helpatopicmodeltobuildasemanticassociationbetween crash andscrolling.
r4is a false positive.
example r1 this app crashes when i scroll through the pages.
r2 theywant yourssn beforeyoucaneven look.it s definitely a scam.
r3 to verify identity it requires u take a picture but thenimmediately crashes.
r4 still waiting after a month to be approved.
.
seed generation under this step of our approach we seek to generate sets of representativeseeds keywords fromextracteduserreviews.tocorrectly modeltheunderlyinglatenttopicstructure thesekeywordshave to be representative of as many themes in the review corpus as possible .
therefore the keyword generation process requires a prioriknowledge of the domain of interest which might not be always readily available .
for example to model the representative topics of app reviews in the domain of investing apps the researcherhastoknowthespecificthemesthatusersdiscussinthe reviews andthe corresponding keywordsto generalize overthese themes.extractingsuchkeywordstypicallyinvolvesmanuallyclassifying userreviews into representative topics which nullifies the advantageofunsupervisedtechniques.toaddressthislimitation in our adaptation of keyatm instead of determining seeds manually we use extractive summarization.
a summary can be described as a short and concise description that encompasses the main themes in a collection of documents .inextractivesummarization textartifacts e.g.
reviews comments andtweets whichcontainthemostimportant keywordsinthecorpusareextractedaspotentialsummariesofthe entire corpus.
in a sense each generated summary represents a potential latent theme in a collection of documents thus can be used to provide representative keywords seeds for keyatm.
common extractivesummarizationtechniques suchashybridtf.idf andsumbasic have beenapplied tosummarize unstructured online user feedback e.g.
tweets youtube comments and user reviews and have been shown to achieve very high levelsofagreementwithhuman generatedsummaries.basedon theseobservations inouranalysis weutilizesuchtechniquesto extract the initial set of seeding keywords from the corpus.
togeneratesummariesfromappuserreviews hybridtf.idf isoftenutilized.tf.idfconsistsoftwocomponents tf term frequency or how many times a term appears in a document and idf inverse document frequency or how much infor mation a term provides.
tf.idf based methods have shown ac ceptable accuracy levels across a variety of text summarization tasks .
however short texts such as user reviews poseauniquechallengetotf.idf.inparticular becauseshorttextscontainonlyahandfulofwords theprobabilityofindividualterms occurringmultipletimesinasinglereviewislow.therefore the majorityofwordsareassignedthesametfvalue.hybridtf.idf addressesthisissuebycalculatingtermfrequencyasthenumber of times a term tappears across all reviews divided by the total number of terms in the review collection.

anoptimal similarity threshold can be determined experimentally based on the desired uniqueness of summaries.
to illustrate our summarization step consider the summaries in example generated for a dataset of reviews sampled from the domainofinvestingappswithathresholdof0.
notwosummaries should have a cosine similarity greater than .
.
each summary encompasses a separate topic such as taking money from a user s account s appcrashing s problemswithsellingastock s and issues with customer support s .

topic generation sinceeachsummarysuccinctlydescribesaseparatetheme seeds are generated by obtaining distinct terms from the processed summaries.forexample theterms great need customer and support are extracted from s4to describe a theme discussing issues with customer support.
these seeds are then supplied to keyatm for the topic modeling step.
our assumption is that these terms canprovide enough semantic information for keyatm to be able to generalizeoverthewholedatasetofextracteduserreviews.inwhatfollows weempiricallyevaluateourassumptionusingtwodatasets of mobile app reviews.
evaluation in this section we illustrate the operation of our proposed topicgeneration approach over two datasets of user reviews sampled from the domains of investing and food delivery apps.
we further evaluate our generated topics by comparing them to the topics generatedbylda.ourmainresearchquestionis how well does our approach perform in comparison to lda?

intrinsic npmi is calculated based on the co occurrence of topic words within the corpus.
in contrast the extrinsic strategyuses external datasets of human produced textual knowledge such as wikipedia to compute words co occurrence and thus semantic relatedness of words.
intrinsic npmi scores computed over the corpus can show how well the model learned the underlying data or the extent that generated topic models accurately represent the content of a corpus.
extrinsic npmi on the other hand shows how common generated topics are in daily language which can be analogous to how a human examining the quality of topics would decide whether they are coherent or not .

for example table presents the top topics in termsof coherence generated for the reviews in our datasets.
topic 3of the investing app reviews is about losing money due to pricefluctuations on a trading day.
however only a handful of words hinting toward that specific topic were provided to the model sell stock and lose.
nevertheless the model correctly identified the main idea of the topic and discovered new related words.

nevertheless the model was still able to create a topic with a high coherence score.an interestingcase is topic2 from theinvesting domain noneofthekeywordsappearedinthetop 10wordsofthe topic however thetopic sthemeisinterpretable pointingoutto user interface ui problems.
in fact this topic which was obtained withk 10doesnotappearinlda stopicsatallforthesimilar values of k .
this shows that our approach is able toextractunderrepresentedtopicsfromasemantically restricted corpus where lda typically fails.
as expected smaller sets of focused keywords seeds produced the highest quality topics.
a large number of general keywords still managed to produce coherent topics although such keywords arelesslikelytoappearinthetop 10listofthetopic.thissuggests that the quality of the resulting model is influenced by the quality of the supplied keywords therefore the main effort should be focusedontheprocessofimprovingtheseedingwordsforthetopics.

in particular lda has long been used to provide supportfor basic software engineering activities such as requirements traceability buglocalization coderetrieval andmostrecently mobile app review analysis.
however lda s performance has always been hindered by the limited semantic and syntactic natureofsoftwareartifacts whethersourcecode bugreports requirements specifications or software user reviews .
our proposed approach aims to address these challenges by assessingldatoproducemorecohesivetopicsthatcanbepointed out by a few important words extracted from the corpus.
such words can be automatically determined using basic text summarization techniques that have been shown to achieve high levels of agreementswithhumangeneratedsummariesovercollectionsof software user feedback .
this relatively simple methodology can overcome the limitations often associated with other expensive solutions such as using machine learning to tune lda s parameters thus enabling the development of more practical software engineering tools.
in terms of practical impact our results highlight the need for a more nuanced and domain aware approach for extracting information from user reviews.
similar to existing topic modeling and text classification algorithms our approach can facilitate a transition from domain knowledge torequirements specifications.
however the key advantage of our approach over existing techniques is that it can provide more fine grained requirements information and avoid the need to manually label a subset of reviews.
the information obtained from keyatm can then be effectively used by app developers.forinstance developersofinvestingappsmayobserve that ui topic is a major concern of investing app users thus concentrate their development effortsto improve user experience byextractingreviewswheretheuitopichasahighprobability and maybe even derive a more nuanced set of keywords e.g.

after the release of their app developers can further monitor user feedback and reallocate their resources more efficiently to quickly address any emerging user concerns.

however there are no robust optimization methodology available for every parameter for every scenario.
therefore we applied a standard procedure of training several models with various kparameter values until the best results were obtained.
another internal validity threat might stem from the apps selected for each domain.
while we acknowledge that there are dozens if not hundreds of apps available under the investing and food delivery domains most of these apps do not have a sufficient number of reviews.
including such less popular apps would be problematicasthegeneratedtopicswouldbebiasedtowardapps with more reviews.
nonetheless we acknowledge the fact that the results of our analysis might not necessarily generalize over other apps in our domains or over other domains.
construct validity is the degree to which the various performance measures used in the study accurately capture the concepts theypurporttomeasure.aconstructvaliditythreatmightberaised about the reliability of the coherence measures used to evaluate thequalityofgeneratedtopics.toaddressthesethreats weused two types of intrinsic and extrinsic coherence measures that are based on the semantic relatedness of topic words.

conclusions inthispaper weproposedanapproachforanalyzingmobileapp user feedback using keyword assisted topic models.
the proposed approach relies on a set of seeding words keywords extracted from the corpus to generate more cohesive topics.
we showed that these keywords can be automatically extracted from the corpus usinggeneral purposeextractivesummarizationtechniques.the proposed approach was evaluated using two datasets of user reviews sampledfromthedomainsofinvestingandfooddelivery apps.theresultsshowedthatourproposedkeywordassistedtopic modelingapproachwasabletosignificantlyoutperformldaon both intrinsic and extrinsic measures of topic cohesiveness.
