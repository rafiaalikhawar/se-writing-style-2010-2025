deepstability a study of unstable numerical methods and their solutions in deep learning eliska kloberdanz department of computer science iowa state university eklober iastate.edukyle g. kloberdanz cape privacy kyle.g.kloberdanz gmail.comwei le department of computer science iowa state university weile iastate.edu abstract deep learning dl has become an integral part of solutions to various important problems which is why ensuring the quality of dl systems is essential.
one of the challenges of achieving reliability and robustness of dl software is to ensure that algorithmimplementations are numerically stable.
dl algorithms require a large amount and a wide variety of numerical computations.
