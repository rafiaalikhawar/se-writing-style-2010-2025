as programming is not a common skill recruiting programmers as participants in large numbers is challenging.
platforms like amazon mturk or qualtrics offer to recruit participants withprogrammingknowledge.asthisisself reported participants withoutprogrammingexperiencecouldstilltakepart eitherdueto amisunderstandingortoobtainthestudycompensation.ifthese participants are not detected the data quality will suffer.
to tackle this danilova et al.
developed and tested screening tasks to detect non programmers.

introduction user studies can be an important tool to examine the issues of certain programs.
however recruiting participants for developer studies may prove difficult especially if participants must possess programming skills for the studies.

whereas these participants would be identified relatively quickly during practical tasks online surveys may onlyinclude multiple choice questions and participants without programmingskillscanthreatenthevalidityofthesestudies.however these participants might be filtered out during the survey process using tasks that are easy to solve by programmers but difficultfor non programmers.
these tasks should make sense in an on line survey and require as little time as possible to be solved by programmers.
sixteen multiple choice questions have already been developed and tested by danilova et al.
in .
they tested the tasks with programmers and non programmers.
as programmer we refer to participants as defined by danilova et al.
participants with programming skills from previous studies and participants who haveworkedwithimperativeprogramminglanguages e.g.
java c python .theyalsosimulatedan attackscenario whereparticipants without programming skills should try to guess the correct results.
thus halftheparticipantsofthenon programmerswereencouraged to use any help for solving the tasks.
requirements for the tasks were ahigh success rate for programmersand a low success rate for non programmers even in an attack scenario.
in addition participants with programming skills should be able to solve thetasksrelativelyquickly.danilovaetal.recommendedasetofsix taskstobeusedforfilteringnon programmersinonlinesurveys.
the most reliable screeners however were also those that took the most time.
therefore we investigated the research question can the effectiveness of screening questions for non programmers be improved by introducing time constraints?
in this paper we developed a large set of tasks and tested different time constraints to improve the tasks performance in anattack scenario.
we analyzed which tasks performed well in previous work trying to improve on them.
in addition we included some tasks previously used as a filter in other computer science publications aswellasstrongperformingtasksfromdanilovaet al.
.
we explored the influence of different time constraints on the correctness rate for programmers and non programmers in an ieee acm 44th international conference on software engineering icse icse may21 pittsburgh pa usa anastasia danilova stefan horstmann matthew smith and alena naiakshina attempt to improve the effectiveness of the tasks as a filtering tool.
for this we used three different time constraints prompting the participantstosolvethetasksasquicklyaspossible requiring the participants to solve the tasks within a given time limit and using a control group without any time constraints.
we tested the tasks with computer science students to decide whethertimeconstraintscanbeaddedwithoutaffectingtheprogrammers taskperformance.inaddition weusedthissurveyto filter out tasks with a low rate of correctness.
we tested the remainingtasks with non programmersrecruitedonlinein atimed attack scenario.

one frequently used siteisgithub whichisgenerallyusedtocontactdevelopers usingtheservicesgithubprovides .forexample graziotin et al.
contacted developers on github and recruited them for a study concerning the influence of worker happiness on productivity.
additionally acar et al.
recruited github participants for a study concerning developers performance regarding to security related tasks.

furthermore in murhpy hilletal.recruitedparticipantsfrom three different companies for a study about software developers productivity.
furthermore baltes and diehl compared different recruitment methods.
they examined the recruitment of participants using a personal network of contacts online communities and networks reaching out to companies public media as well as advertising the survey by software developers and ghtorrent wheredata on public github projects is collected.
they recommended usingpublicmediaandadvertisingthesurveybyothersoftwareengineers as the most efficient strategies.
they additionally proposed to use crowdsourcing platforms e.g.
clickworker amazon mechanical turk and commercial recruitment services but also mentioned concerns regarding the suitability of those services for therecruitment of software developers.
anotherapproachusedfortherecruitmentofdeveloperswas theusageoffreelanceplatformsforstudies .however yamashitaandmoonen expressedconcernsregardingtherecruitment on the freelance platform freelance.com as all skills areself reportedbythemembers.they therefore suggestedthe use of skill tests to validate research findings.
.
programming skills an instrument to evaluate the participants java programming skills was created and evaluated by bergersen et al.
using a set of programming tasks.
the purpose of the instrument was to aidrecruitersinfindingthemostskilledprogrammersinagroup of job applicants.
they conducted a two day study including professional java developers.
however time limits for the tasks ranged from to minutes per task making them too long to includeinanonlinesurveyandthusarenotsuitableforfiltering outparticipantsquickly.
feigenspan et al.
used program comprehension tasks to analyze the self reported programming skills of students.
in a surveytaking40minutes theyfoundacorrelationbetweentheparticipants performanceandtheirself reportedlevelofexperience.
while some program comprehension tasks were used in this paper the goal was to identify participants without any programming skillsinstead of measuring the skill level.
balebako et al.
examined the security behavior of app developers.

ensuringcomparabilitywiththebaselinestudy.
first ithad to be ensured that participants were similar in skill level to the programmerspreviouslyrecruitedbydanilovaetal.inthebaseline study so that the new tasks could be compared to the old ones.
this was achieved by comparing the results of the programmer group from the baseline study with the results of the basegroup of thisstudyforthesixbaselinequestions seetable1 .inaddition thetimetakentosolvethetaskswascomparedforonlyfourofthe tasks as participants in the baseline study solved two tasks on the same source code and time was nor recorded separately.
when comparing the correctness of the two groups with the kolmogorov smirnov test none of the tasks showed a statistically significant difference.

non programmers timed attack scenario the attack scenario from danilova et al.
showed that by using ascenariowithunlimitedtimeconstraints non programmerparticipantswereabletosolvethetaskswithhelp.thecorrectnessfor programmers decreased significantly in neither the no limitnor thecountdown scenario.
thus both scenarios might be suitable to filter outnon programmers.asthe countdown scenariodeliversaclearcut offpointforallparticipants itshowsmostclearly whether the participants could have solved the tasks within the timelimitornot.incontrast participantsinthe nolimitgroupstill could spend extra time double checking their answers and thus increase the time required to solve the task above the cut off point.
forthisreason alltasksintheattackscenarioweretestedwitha countdown timer and non programmer participants had the same timelimitto solve each task as the programmers.
as participants with programming knowledge may be erroneouslyfilteredoutbytaskstoodifficult onlytheoneswithhigh success rates among programmers were included.
for this the rate ofthecorrectnessofallprogrammers answersinthepreviousstudy was calculated.
was defined as the cut off point as it keeps thenumberofprogrammersfailingthetaskslowwithoutexpecting the programmers to give perfect answers.
thus we included source.usage recursive boolean rec.lang compiler recursivefunction3 recursivefunction4 and ide.known as tasks in the survey.
additionally arrayandprimewere included as theyreach ifrounded to theclosest whole number.
recursivefunction1 which would fall in the latter category was not chosen as the correctness in the countdown scenario was below andahighsuccessratefromguessingwastobeexpectedin the attack scenario on the yes or no task.

asparticipantsin theattackscenariousedbydanilovaetal.
workedonthetasks boolean compiler recursive and sources.usage without a timelimit we examined the influence of the limit on the success rate.
the baseline participants without a time limit performed betteron all four tasks.
however participants with a time limit were quicker on all four tasks suggesting that our participants would have required additional time to solve the tasks to their satisfaction.
it strengthens the assumption that introducing a time limit decreases the chance of success for non programmers on the tasks.

however pr ogrammers time is valuable and should not be wasted on screener tasks taking much time.
our analysis indicated that the time required to solve screener tasks could be reduced by using time constraints without decreasing the rate of correctness.
participants without programming skills performedsignificantlyworseonthetimedtasksbothcompared to our programmers and the baseline non programmers without a time limit from .
our non programmers searched the web less frequently and had to guess or trust their knowledge more often than the baseline attack scenario group without a time limit.
these results showed that the introduction of the time limit and the newsuggestedscreenerquestionshelpeddecreasethesuccessrateof non programmers thus improving the tasks introduced in for filtering outnon programmers.
in the following the setup of the tasks as a filtering instrument for online surveys is discussed.
first we outline which tasks we wouldrecommendforresearchsurveyswithprogrammers.second we argue for the usage of a time limit for the tasks.
finally we discuss how many of the tasks we would recommend using in a survey.

thus we would not recommend them for the instrument.
further the tasks compiler andrec.lang bothhaveasuccessrateofover40 indicating that a larger number of non programmers are familiar with the terms or can look them up and answer these questions quickly.

setup of the instrument some possible setups of the instrument are discussed here as a recommendation.
while researchers are free to choose and discard tasks to their liking it is advisable to randomize which tasks are shown if participants are likely to communicate and share their solutions.in addition presentingmultiple taskscanimprove the instrument saccuracy withtheconsequencethatittakeslongerto solve the tasks.

our analysis showed that researchers should use filter methods ifthereisanydoubtontheparticipants programmingskills.we presented six screener questions that could be used either all or selected for research surveys with programmers.
we suggest using either one two or three questions in a combination with a preference for the second option.
the exact method however should be chosenaccording to the researchers requirements.
