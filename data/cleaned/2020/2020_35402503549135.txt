previous studies have reported andinvestigated thelimitedadoptionof sdaandinvestigatedthedeveloper sperspectiveonsecurity.however assoftwaresecurityseemstoincreasinglygainmorespaceamongdevelopers responsibilities further studiesareneededtoinvestigatethisleft shift.inparticular inthis paper we focus on the current state of security during code review accordingtopractitioners.ourdefinitionofsecurityisrootedin the definition of software vulnerabilities.
in fact ensuring security during code review means finding and proposing fixes for security vulnerabilities in the code under review to avoid turning the applicationinsecure .moreover findingsonthistopiccanprovide insightfor practitioners organizations andresearchers.developers and other software project stakeholders can use our insights to improve their code review practices to better ensure security during code review.
organizations can use evidence about developers challenges during code reviews to update and improve their approaches and methodologies toward achieving and maintaining secureapplications.finally researcherscanfocustheirattention ondevelopers challenges to facilitate secure code review.
we set up our investigation as an explorative study.
thus instead of starting with preset hypotheseson how software security isorshouldbeaddressedduringcodereviews weinvestigate the developer s perspective on assessing software security duringcodereview theexpectationsandsupportthatcompanies and projects have on this process and what problems software engineers face when evaluating software security duringreviews.

among the survey respondents report being software esec fse november14 18 singapore singapore larissabraz andalberto bacchelli developers currently have three years or more of professionaldevelopmentexperience and62 conductcodereviews at leastseveral times per week.
our study reveals that most participants develop securitysensitivesoftwaresystems yet whenaskedwhichissuestheyfocus onduringcodereview only9surveyrespondentsexplicitlymention security.only afterwe mention security respondentsstate to alwaysconsider it during code review.
this stark mismatch may indicate that security is not a priority during review and may be assessedlessfrequentlythanreported.moreover developersmay disregard security aspects during reviews due to their assumptions aboutthe security dynamicofthe applicationthey develop.
concerningcompanies mostrespondents workforcompaniesorprojectsthatexpectdeveloperstoensuresecurity including through code review.
however the vast majority of the respondents think that companies should do more to support secure practices.
for example respondents are not acknowledged for performing secure code reviews.
moreover two thirds of the respondents state that companies do not provide security training ratherjustallowdeveloperstoacquiresecurityskillsbythemselves duringworkinghours reportedby95 respondents .
indeed whenitcomestochallengesofensuringsecurityincode review respondents mostly report lack of training and knowledge as the main issue they face mentioned by respondents .
second the use of third party libraries is problematic because they are not always present in the code developers maintain thus checking them actively during code review is not possible mentioned by eight respondents .
finally some respondents explained that code reviewis not theideal phase ofthe development process to detect vulnerabilities.forinstance somevulnerabilitiesrequiretheexecutionofthecodetoappear.moreover developersfindithardto identifyinteractionsamongpartsof codethatcouldhave security implicationsat low level inspections.
based on the findings of our study we propose a series of recommendations andareas for future research.
backgroundand related work in this section we review the software engineering se research literature on topics investigating software security and the developer relatedfactors that influencevulnerabilitydetection.
security in the development lifecycle.
in the mcafee institution reported that daily billion malicious scans look forvulnerabletargets and780thousandrecordsarelosttohacking.
however security experts still have to motivate and convince developersoftheimportanceoffindingvulnerabilities .later gitlab performed a survey with over respondents from countries .in theirsurvey securityexpertsreportedthatitisa software developer s job to develop secure code but only less than halfofthe developers can actually detectvulnerabilities.
securityoftenfailsbecauseuserseithermisunderstandthesecurity implications of their actions or turn off security features toworkaroundusabilityproblems .infact securityusability issuesalsoaffectdevelopers.forinstance storinguserlogindata and authenticating users is prone to security issues due to the highcomplexityofthetechnologiesandconceptsinvolvedinthe process .usabilityissuesexistinginsuchsecurityapisforcenon security expert programmers to misuse these apis and introducesecurityvulnerabilitiestoapplicationstheydevelop .

moreover woon and kankanhalli reported limited adoption of sdaand a lack of studies exploring the phenomenon.
later xie et al .

semi structuredinterviewdesign weperformedthefirstpartofourstudyasasetofone to one semi structuredinterviews withprofessionalsoftwaredevelopers of different backgrounds.
semi structured interviews use of an interviewguidethatcontainsgeneralgroupingsoftopicsandquestionsratherthanapre determinedsetandorderofquestions .
they are often used in an exploratory context to find out what ishappening toseeknewinsights .theguidelinewas iteratively refined after each interview particularly when developers started providing answers very similar to the earlier ones thus reachingasaturationeffect.themainpathofthefinalinterview guideline has 28questions.
table 1shows two of the questions we askedparticipantsduringtheinterviews.following wedescribe the guideline smain points.

for instance we remind them they were allowed to stop the interview at any moment and also skip any question they did not feel like answering.
we also explain that there were no right or wrong answers.
following we start recording the interview and ask the participants questions about their background such as their current role and how many years of experience in programming they have.

rq .securityduringcodereviews ourfirstresearchquestionseekstoinvestigatethedeveloper s perspective on software security and whether the developers in fact assesssoftware security duringcode reviews.
security focus during code review.
when asked as an open question what they focus on during code review only out of the182 surveyrespondents explicitlymentioned security.instead other non functional qualities of the code were mentioned more frequently e.g.
23respondentsreportedperformanceasanissue they focus on during code review .
however after being prompted about vulnerabilities respondents reported to alwaysconsider securityduringreviews.mostsurveyrespondents reported they can decide what aspects issues to inspect during reviews i.e.
intheend ensuringsecurityduringreviewsistheirchoice and ofthemstateitistheirresponsibilitytolookforvulnerabilities duringreviews.
during the interviews two interviewees mentioned without being prompted tofocusonsecurity.
i4explained thereare collateral effectsthatcan be undesirablefor thechange...like performance security maintainability testability extensibility.
all these thingsthatcanbetestedandgenerallyaretested.
eightintervieweesreportedtobefamiliarwiththetermsoftwarevulnerability andprovidedtheirowndefinition which wasinline withours in allcases seesection .
.thiswasalsothecaseof i1 whoreported to have a security background.
the two remaining interviewees initially reported no familiaritywith theterm but agreed with the definition we provided.
one of them further explained that they wereinitiallyunsureaboutthecorrectdefinitionoftheterm but our definitionconfirmedtheir initialopinion.
after being prompted about software vulnerabilities five more interviewees highlighted the importance of considering security 814esec fse november14 18 singapore singapore larissabraz andalberto bacchelli during code reviews.
out of these five interviewees i7stated i consideritalot becauseialreadyworkedforcompaniesthatwe had problems related to it the security of the data big companies.
surveyparticipantsandintervieweesusedvarioustermsintheir answers refer to the application s security.
this was the case of the previous answer given by i7where they mentioned security of thedata when asked whether theyconsidersecurity during code reviews a follow up question to the discussion on the software vulnerability definition.
in fact vulnerabilities in the code may lead to insecure data for instance a use of a broken or risky cryptographicalgorithm cwe327 flawinthecodecanlead to the exploit ofsensitive data.
moreover twointervieweesreportedusingautomatictoolsto detect software vulnerabilities not only during code review but overall during development activities.
for instance i2said this is automaticallychecked.thereisatool ispartoftheautomatic check if that change that i am introducing if it is exposing any credential if there is any hardcoded password if i let any security permissionleak.

the familiarity of our study s participants with security and itsconcepts plays an importantroleinourresults interpretation.amongthesurveyrespondents stated to be unfamiliar or unsure about the term software vulnerability while145reportedbeing familiar withit.
two interviewees reported to not be familiar with the term softwarevulnerability.yet theydemonstratedtobesecurity aware afterlisteningtothesoftwarevulnerabilitydefinition.exceptfor i1 whoreportedtohaveworkedwithsecurity theinterviewees pointed up not being security experts.
i5explained is a topic that mostofengineers tendto not look toomuchintoit.
observation .
developers are familiar with the term software vulnerability and acknowledge the importance of ensuring security during code reviews.
yet the vast majority of participantsmentionedsecurityasakeyfocusduringcode review only after weexplicitlyasked them about this topic.
developers assumptionsaboutapplication ssecurity.
theinterview format allowed us to reveal potentially dangerous assumptionsdevelopersmake.intotal sevenintervieweesassumedthat security is the responsibility of another software component or team.forinstance i1explained idonotworrymuch ... iamsupposingthatanotherpartofthesystemalready dealt with it like already dealt with the securityand at this point i am relatively secure and should not worry much about it.
i9 stated iammoreafront enddeveloper wedeallesswithsecurity matters.
i think should be more for the back end right?
they deal more with data.
in addition i6said i am a back end engineer ... i am not a front end person i do not have front end expertise so verifying accessibility for example issomething i could not easily do.
twointervieweesrevealedthatbecausetheydevelopinternal code they do not extensively consider security during code review.

in our survey themostfrequentlymentionedchallenge mentionedby44respondents is insufficient security knowledge and training.
for instance r35said lackofknowledgeaboutthecurrentvulnerabilitieson the language framework libraries of choice and r86explained that developers often lack the low level and or platform expertise necessary to detect some vulnerabilities.
r15explained needs specialized knowledge exploit techniques and it can be hard to convince colleagues that there is a security in their code without a demo if they do not havethenecessaryknowledge.
surveyrespondentsalsomentioned thatvulnerabilitiesmightnotbeeasytoidentifyduringthereview vulnerabilitiesarenotalwaysobviousjustfromlookingatcode sometimes slip through the cracks even when best practices are followed r86 .
respondents were also skeptical about developers abilities to learnandperformsecurecodereviews.forinstance r154explained dedicatedsecurityexpertsarenoteconomicallyviableformost smaller companies teams project.

addressing this issue requires better tool support static code analysis and improved frameworks libraries api sothat developers have less opportunity to mess up.
vulnerabilities are hard to detect and keep up with.
the nature ofsoftware vulnerabilitiesalsoimpactsitsdetection.intotal nine survey participants reported that vulnerabilities are subtle anddifficulttodetect evenwhenthebestpracticesarefollowed.

for example r31reported the ever changing development landscape new vulnerabilities are found in third party packages every day as a challenging factor to ensure security duringreview.
lackof codebase knowledge.
lack of codebase knowledge was mentioned nine times.
survey respondents reported lack of knowledge about applications architecture domain and components interaction as factors that influence the detection of vulnerabilities during reviews.

a change in developer s perspective on security.
in the past developers have shown an it is not my responsibility attitude towards software security and limited adoptionof secure development of applications sda .
however software security seems to be gaining more space among developers responsibilities.
in fact a study reported that developers care more about securitythanotherreliabilityissues.followingthistrend ourresults suggest a change in developer s attitude they state it is their responsibility to ensure security duringcode reviews.
818esec fse november14 18 singapore singapore larissabraz andalberto bacchelli securityneedstobebettermotivated.
eventhoughdevelopers seem to have changed their attitude towards security recent research has also provided initial evidence that security is notinthedevelopers mind bydefault whenreviewingcode.our results corroborate this evidence we found that developers do not have security in mind when describing their code review practices.
a reason for this might be that developers lack motivation to be concernedaboutsecurityduringreviews.indeed companiesand projectsexpectdeveloperstoensurethesecurityoftheirapplicationsandallowthemtoacquiresecurityknowledgeduringwork hours but they do not provide the means for that e.g.
security training and workshops.
moreover leaders do not acknowledge developers that dosecure code reviews.
this situation raises questions on the effectiveness of how companiesmotivatedevelopersinthesoftwaredevelopmentprocess especiallyatcodereviewtime.organizationsmayconsiderincorporating explicitreward systemsfordevelopers whoensure security in the applications.
for instance the vulnerability reward program rewards any bug bounter who report vulnerabilities in google ownedandalphabetsubsidiarywebproperties.inspired bythisinitiative companiesandprojectsmaycreateprogramsto reward developers who detect vulnerabilities through code review.
assumptions may hurt security.
developers make securityassumptions during code reviews.
for example braz et al .
reportedthatreviewersjustifiednotdetectingvulnerabilitiesbecause they assumed the change author had already considered the application s security.
in line with their findings our study participants assumethatsecurityistheresponsibilityofanotherapplication s component or team.
for instance back end developers reported assuming security as a front end responsibility while front end developers reported theopposite.
however developers need to be careful and spread awareness around these assumptions so that they donot end uphurtingthe application s security.

participantsmainlyreportedinsufficient security knowledge as a challenge when considering security duringcodereview.ourresultsalignwithpreviouswork in which developers reported lack of knowledge as the reason for not finding vulnerabilities in a code review task.
these results strengthenthequestionsonthesecurityeducation orlackthereof thatdevelopersarereceiving.tocreateadifferentapproach educationalinstitutionsmayintroduceorgivemoreattentiontosecurity inthesoftwareengineeringundergraduateandgraduatecourses.
forinstance in2004 ateamfromtheusnavalpostgraduateschool wonthe capturetheflag tournamentatdefcon theworld smostpopular hacker convention .
to learn security students and developers must be able to switch from their traditional conditioning to theattacker swayof thinking .

although previous research has provided evidence that on campus security courses still have better results than security moocs developers can still benefit from them.

this way even large companies do not have enough security experts to revieweverychangemadebydevelopers.infact onlyone thirdof our survey respondents reported having a security team in their companies projects.
as a solution teams can select a developer to increase their security expertise and propagate their knowledge to other team members through code reviews.
owasp suggests that companies not only have a security team but also a further groupofdeveloperswithaninterestinsecuritythatcanactasteam localsecuritysubjectmatterexperts smes takingpartinthecode reviews .
