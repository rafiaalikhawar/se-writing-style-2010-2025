unfortunately existing automated approaches for traceability suffer from practical issues.

1coest center of excellence for softwaretraceability esec fse november14 18 singapore singapore liming dong he zhang weiliu zhiluoweng andhongyu kuang unfortunately researchers have also found that high quality trace links are difficult to manually recover and maintain due to the large size of potential trace links among different artifacts e.g.
requirements issues andcode andthefrequentchangesin software artifacts caused by a more iterative development process.
theubiquitousadoptionofversioncontrolsystems e.g.
github and issue tracking systems e.g.
jira is now the common practice for developers to tag code commits with issue ids during their daily development tasks in a real world project managed by the software repository.
these explicitly tagged trace links between source code e.g.
recorded by commits and system functionalities e.g.
described by issues tagged with new feature or bug thus lay a good foundation for learning based approaches to support automated traceability tasks for real worldprojects indicating an appreciable save of human efforts when the project keeps evolving.
totacklethisproblem asignificantamountofresearchhasbeen conducted with a goal of helping developers recover traceability automatically .theseincludeprobabilisticapproaches information retrieval ir techniques the vector space model vsm latent semantic indexing lsi latent dirichlet allocation lda jenson shannon model js etc.
and learning based approaches machine learning and deep learning to recover the missingtrace links.
advancesinautomatictraceabilitytechniqueshavebeenachieved and most of them evaluated in oss projects and also gradually applied to industrial projects with positive improvements .
many existing studies use datasets gathered either from the center of excellence for software system traceability2 e.g.
academic led projects or fromfree and opensource oss community projects .
we found however that automated traceability techniques are not well validated empirically especially in industrial environments.
even with rapid progress in learning based technologies industry partners are struggling to integrateautomatedtraceabilitypracticesandintegratetheminto theirdevelopmentprocesses .therefore westilllackenough knowledge about the practical reasons for underperformance of automatedtraceability approachesinindustrialprojects.
thus the goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of learning based automated traceability approaches in real world projects.
in order to better understand how automated traceability worksfordifferenttypesofprojectsindifferentcommunities we firstevaluatetheperformanceoflearning basedtrace linkclassifiers using six oss projects from github and ten industrial projects from our collaborative organization.
we seek to characterize the severity of the underperforming trace link classifier and to identify potential problems for outcome prediction through our study.fromtheanalysisofoverallperformanceondifferentcommunities i.e.ossandindustrial datasets weobservedthattwo classic challengesare most relevant to hinderreal worldprojects traceability prediction data imbalance andsparseness.
to meet these two challenges in traceability research we found that the semi supervised learning ssl algorithm is efficient to solvetheproblemsofbothimbalancedlabelsandinsufficientsample labels for many practical applications at the same time .
in particular ssl algorithms can be used to augment the training set theaddedsamplesareassignedpseudo labelsbasedontheoriginal labelled data model.
ssl has also been extensively studied in class imbalance scenarios in recent research.
researchers suggestthatleveraging unlabeled databyssl and self supervised learningcan benefitclass imbalancedlearning.
hence inlightoftheaboveissues wepresentedaframework based on the semi supervised pre processing for learning based traceability splint to address the data imbalance and sparsity problemthatexistinlearning basedtraceabilityapproaches and furtherenhancethetraceabilityscenariosforreal worldsoftware projects.weemployedssl toupdatethetrainingsetand adjustedclass balancingself training cbst adjust strategiesto rebalancethetrainingsetdistribution.further toaddressdatasparsity in the feature matrix of trace link classifier we evaluated how features contribute in theprojects from both communities respectively.
the result shows that textual information from software artifacts in industrial projects accounts for the most important features.thus weinvestigatedthesemanticsofsoftwareartifactsand mergedhybridir basedtextual similaritymeasures intosplint.

firstly we reviewed data provided by one of our collaborators a leading global supplier of information and communicationtechnology ict andsmartdeviceswithoperations in over countries and regions.
to conduct our investigative study we selected of the initiatives that enable access to software repositoriesandmeetthe following criteria the projects chosen are representative of the key product services developed by our industrial collaborators e.g.
platform app themetadataofsoftwareartifactsisavailabletousandcan be taken from associatedsoftware repositories continuous release versionsofthe projectare available.
itisgenerallythecasethat appprojectsprovidedirectservice to external users.typically theyupdateartifactsfrequently have larger project sizes more iterative development processes and more involved engineers which lead to poor traceability and maintenance.
in contrast platformprojects are mainly focused on internalengineers.duetotheirsmallersize seniordevelopersusually handle artifact managementandmaintenancedirectly.
recently ourcollaboratorsbegantofocusonrequirements tocommitstraceability.theyexpectedthesetracelinkstoimprove the credibility of the software development process.
thus they established a rule that software engineersare unabletoclosea requirement without at least one traced commit.
however we found thatourcollaboratorshadrelativelyweaktraceabilitymanagement for other artifacts especially in issue commit links where tight developmentcycles i.e.
aroundone monthreleasecycles make it difficult to force developers to create and maintain issue defects commit links.
meanwhile the requirements traceability rulehasjustbeenestablished.itis notadvisabletoforcesoftware engineers to guarantee all forms of trace links.
even so managers incollaboratedorganizationsstillseektoassurethequalityofissue trackingsothattheycangovernsoftwareprocessdataandaccelerate software process digitization.

the motivating question weplannedtoexplorethefollowingmotivatingquestionfirstbased ontenindustrialprojectsandsix oss projects.

this is significantlylowerthantheperformancepresentedinpreviousoss projectswithan averagef2 score ofnearly .
for further analyzing the problems encountered by industrial projects we also presented the imbalance ratio for the sampling dataset of each project along the left hand in x axis in figure .
the imbalance ratio is calculated by dividing the number of major classes false links by thenumberofminor classes true links interms of falsedividedby true tracelinks .

dataimbalance.
thedataimbalanceproblemisexacerbated bythetightdevelopmentprocessesforindustrialsoftwareprojects.
ontheonehand industrialprojectsarebusiness orientedwithlimiteddevelopmenttimeanddeadlinesandintensivecodingactivities.
as a result whencompared tothe sixoss projects these projects producedahigherproportionofcodecommitswithfewersource artifacts.weseeossprojectsthathavemaintainedcomparablesize issuesandcodecommitswithroughlyn 000forovertenyears.
in contrast as shown in table most industrial projects have just n ofissueswith n even n of code commits in their shorter history.
as a result the discrepancy in the ratio between source and target artifacts exacerbates the severityofdata imbalance insampling datasets.
second thenatureofsoftwaretraceabilitymakesitlikelythat an issue will be traced back to one or more code commits so all potentialcodecommitsproducedduringtheissuelifecyclewere selected as target artifacts.
in an industrial setting where code commits are made more frequently a greater proportion of code commits will be selected as candidate target artifacts for issues.this will result in a substantial imbalance between candidate links tagged true andthosetagged false .
.
.
data sparseness.
the sparsity of data can be seen from the following twoperspectives.
feature space sparsity the first one is the data sparsity in the extracted feature matrix which impairs the effectiveness of industrialsamplingdatasets.wedonatefeaturesetsas a1toa18 thedetaileddescriptionsshownintable 3asdefinedin .figure2displays the sparsity of each column in the feature matrix null all intwocommunitydatasets.industrialprojectsreturn more sparse process features e.g.
a3 a6 a9 and a12 than oss datasets while textual similarity features e.g.
a17 had more valid values.
as a result industrial projects have trouble offering meaningfulprocessfeatures.
thedefinedfeaturesetsinpreviouswork a1toa18 whichperformwellinsixossprojects however failtocapturethedetailsoftracelinkagesintheselectedindustrial projects.
this is because the recorded information on industrial projects reveals incorrect metadata on derived artifacts and the process features can be incorrect or distorted when compared with whatactuallyoccurs.theassignedauthorsofissuesmay forexample be core developers while the code committers and fixers may go to another developer i.e.
outsourcing developers .

to achieve this goal following the existingwork splintselectedsoftwareartifactsandorganizedthecandidatetracelinksduringdataselection thatis thefirst stageinsplint.next thedataarelabeledanddividedintolabeled andunlabeledsetsrespectivelyinsplint.athirdstageinvolved addingmorehybridsimilarityfeatures duetotheimportanceof semantic information as one major factor for alleviating one of the major limitations discussed in our paper i.e.

the fifth stage comprised semi supervised learning combined with datarebalancing whichisthecoreofsplint.specifically itisused to solve one of the major challenges we discussed in section .
i.e.
reduce the effect of sampling sparsity caused by the low ratio of existing links .
additionally it is used to resolve the problem of data imbalance which is caused by the traceability approaches inherent difficulty and the frequent production of and evolution ofartifactsovertime.insplint cbstideaisincorporatedwith sslbyestimatingthelikelihoodforanunlabeledtracelinktobelong to each class instead of dependent on deterministic labels which might exacerbate the data imbalance ratio of the training set again.

during the data selection phase splint extracts the cleaned artifacts and uses the adjust time based heuristic function is candidate for each project to combine the candidate trace links.
