understanding skills for oss communities on github jennyt.liang university ofwashington seattle washington usa jliang9 cs.washington.eduthomaszimmermann microsoftresearch redmond washington usa tzimmer microsoft.comdenae ford microsoftresearch redmond washington usa denae microsoft.com abstract the development of open source software oss is a broad field which requires diverse skill sets.
for example maintainers help lead the project and promote itslongevity technical writersassist withdocumentation bugreportersidentifydefectsinsoftware and developersprogramthesoftware.however itisunknownwhich skills are used in oss development as well as oss contributors general attitudes towards skills in oss.
in this paper we address this gap by administering a survey to a diverse set of oss contributors.
guided by these responses as well as prior literature onsoftwaredevelopmentexpertiseandsocialfactorsofoss we develop amodel ofskills in ossthat considers the many contexts osscontributorsworkin.thismodelhas45skillsinthefollowing categories technical skills working styles problem solving contribution types project specific skills interpersonal skills external relations management and characteristics.
through a mix of qualitative and quantitative analyses we find that oss contributors are actively motivated to improve skills and perceive many benefits in sharing their skills with others.
we then use this analysis to derive asetofdesignimplications andbestpractices forthose who incorporate skills intoosstools andplatforms such as github.

at the crux of these roles are skills.
skills are critical to software development including the development of oss.
while oss development and software development are similar oss contributors also work in contexts that are unique to oss e.g.

in this paper we investigatetheskillswhicharerelevanttoossandcontributors relationship with skills.we define three research questions rq1what are relevant skills foross?

from the survey data we further investigate contributors perspectivesonskillsinoss namelyhowtheywouldliketoimproveskills andhowthey wouldlike toshare theirskills.
in our study we find that contributors themselves defined skills inossverybroadly whichisamplifiedbythediversesetofroles inoss.thus inthispaper weuseageneralnotionofskills also following prior work .we define skills as anything that anindividualcanactivelyworktoimproveon.
ourdefinition encompassesformalskillsaswellaspersonalattributesofcontributors.
the broader definition of skill is exemplified by this response skills are anything that helps improve the project.
this can includecoding writingdocs researchingbugs triagingincomingbug reportsand requests and releases.
largerprojectsmay also require skills that we see in commercial dev environments such as project management product management and planning release schedules.
and there is also a need for people skills like dealing with conflict between project members enforcing codes of conduct and otherskillsalong those lines.

the remainingskillcategoriesaredirectlyrelatedtoeithertheosscontributor project or community where management related skills cross cut acrossallthree ofthesefunctions.
in analyzing survey responses we find that participants described skills in oss broadly and included formal skills as well aspersonalattributes.thus ourmodelincludes anyinstanceofa skillorattributelistedbyparticipantsthatcouldbeimprovedupon by an individual .

many of these skills were technology related.
basic caret rightprogramming skills suchasdebugging testing andcodecomprehension were the mostcommonly mentionedskillinour model.participantsargued that programming skills were central to oss development being able to write working computer code and tests kind of the backbone of oss.

however a critical component to solving a problem is moving past thinking about the problemanditssolutionsbyhaving caret rightinitiative toexecutesolving the problem.
one contributor summarized the problem solving process succinctly enable you to quickly assess the situation figureout whatneeds to bedoneand just p83 contributiontypes.
thecontributiontypes categoryencapsulates types of contributions to oss projects.
most of these codes were not explicitly mentioned in the literature sources but were elicitedthroughparticipants.
caret rightbugreporting whichencapsulates identifyingdefectsinossproductsandprovidingclearandconcise instructionstoreproduceit aswellas caret rightbugtriaging whichdescribes parsing through bug reports and prioritize them for the project were listedasoss skills.the mostcommoncontributionbrought up by participants was caret rightdocumentation which is essential to teach others howto useoss orcontribute to aproject.

p31 finally knowingthe caret rightorganization ofaproject helps contributors work more effectively by knowing where resources are located in the repository as well as who to ask for help basedonthe team members expertise.
interpersonal skills.
theinterpersonal skills category refers to skills used to interact with others.
caret rightcommunication enabled asynchronous and distributed collaboration p349 and was oneofthemosthighlycitedskillsfromliteratureandbyparticipants.
caret rightcollaboration wasalsoacommonthemefromparticipants.this skill enabled groups of people with different culture timezone and skills p284 to work with one another.

in our study someparticipantsreportedlargelybeingmotivatedtoshareskills tomarketthemselvesandtheirexpertise whileotherswantedadditionalinformationtoevaluatepotentialcontributorsorfindexperts with specific skills.
one could consider revealing some information on skills that contributors are currently learning or improving on for transparency to be inclusive of newcomers and showing a contributor s trajectory.
allowing contributors to display skill dimensions that they want to grow e.g.
in a spider graph on their github profile is a possible strategy to indicate what motivates contributors e.g.
adesire to improve their workingstyles .
another potential application of skills in github profiles could be github s achievement badges which currently only recognizes contributions to specific repositories or participation in github programs.
there is an opportunity for oss platforms such asgithubtoextendachievementbadgestoincludeossskills using the aforementioned miningtechniques see section .
to surface them.
similarly github could develop a certification of skills that could be madedirectlyavailable inauser sprofile.
