introduction more than ever online communication platforms such as gitter slack microsoft teams google hangout and freenode play a fundamental role in team communications and collaboration.
as one type of synchronous textual communication among a community of developers live chat allows developers to receive real time responses from others replacing asynchronous communication like emails in some cases .
this is especially true for open source projects that are contributed by globally distributed developers aswellasfor manycompaniesallowing developers to workfromhomeduetothecovid 19pandemic.conversations from online communication platforms contain rich information for studying developer behaviors.

.
the gitterplatform many oss communities utilize gitter or slack as their live communication means.
in particular gitter is currently the mostpopularonlinecommunicationplatform sinceitprovides open access to public chat rooms and free access to historical data .
considering the popular open and free access nature we conduct this study based on gitter2.
communities in gitter usuallyhavemultiplechattingrooms onegeneralroomandseveral specific topic rooms.
typically the general room contains most of the participants.
in this study we only focus on the general rooms.
in total there are communities in gitter that can be publicly accessed.thetotalnumberofparticipantsofthe2 171communities is733 as ofnov.
.
three main concepts about gitter live chat log are concerned in the scope of this study including chat log utterance and dialog.
in gitter developer conversations in one chatting room are recorded in a chat log.
as illustrated in figure a typical live chat logcontainsasequentialsetofutterancesinchronologicalorder.
eachutterance consists of a timestamp developer id and a textual message initiating a question or responding to an earlier message.
achatlogtypicallycontainsalargenumberofutterances andat any given time multiple consecutive utterances might be possibly respondingtodifferentthreadsofdialogdiscussions.theinterleaving nature of utterances leads to entangled dialogs as illustrated with the two colors in figure .
the two colors are used to highlight utterances belonging to two different dialogs where the links between twoutterancesindicatethe responding relationship.
.
challenges in chat analysis different from many other sources of software development related communication the information on online communication platforms are shared in an unstructured informal and interleaved manner.thus analyzinglivechatisquitechallengingduetothe following barriers.

methodology overview the research methodology follows two phases as illustrated in figure2.
first in the data preparation phase a large scale of developerdailychatutterancesdataarecollectedfromeightactive communities andtherawchatutterancesdataareprocessedand transformedintoassociateddialogsusingtwoapproaches i.e.
manual screening on a randomly sampled small dataset and automated analysis employing the identified best dd model on the whole dataset.
second in the empirical analysis phase further analysis willbedesignedandconductedonthesetwodatasetsinorderto investigate the characteristics and develop a better understanding ofdeveloper live chatdata withrespectto the research questions.
.
data preparation studied communities.
to identify studied communities we select the top most participated communities from eight active domains coveringfront endframework mobile datascience devops blockchainplatform collaboration webapp andprogramming language.
then we collect the daily chat utterances from table the statisticsofthe studied gitter communities community domainentire populationsample population p d updu angular frontend framework22 appium mobile dl4j data science docker devops ethereum blockchain platform16 gitter collabration platform9 nodejs web application framework18 typescript programming language8 total 393esec fse august 23 28 athens greece lin shi xiaochen ye yang hanzhijiang ziyou jiang nan niu andqingwang thesecommunities.gitterprovidesrestapi togetdataabout chatting rooms and post utterances.
in this study we use the rest apitoacquirethechatutterancesoftheeightselectedcommunities and the retrieved dataset contains all utterances as of 2020 20 .
detailed statistics are shown in table where p refers to the number of participants drefers to the number of dialogs and u refers tothenumberofutterances.thetotalnumberofparticipantsfor the eight communities is accounting for of the total population in gitter.
thus we consider that the eight communities are representative ofthe gitter platform.

we utilize spacy to tokenize sentences into termsandperformlemmatizationandlowercasingontermswith spacy to alleviatethe influenceofwordmorphology.
manuallabelingofdialogdisentanglement.
weemploya3stepmanualprocesstogenerateasampledialogdatasetforfurther analysis.
first we randomly sample utterances from each community s live chat log with the intention to trace corresponding dialogsassociated with each ofthe100 utterances.
this stepleads toatotalof 800utterancesfromtheentire1 utterances of the eight communities.
next using each utterance as a seed we identify its preceding and successive utterances iteratively so that wecangrouprelatedutterancesintothesamedialogascompleteas possible.specifically for eachutterance we determine its context byexaminingtheconsecutivechatsinthechatlog andmanually linkittorelatedutterancesbelongingtothesamedialog.then the nextstep is cleaning.
specifically we excludedunreadabledialogs dialogs that are written in non english languages dialogs that contain too much code or stack traces low quality dialogs suchasdialogswithmanytyposandgrammaticalerrors and dialogsthatinvolvechannelrobots.afterthesesteps weinclude additionalsixthousandutteranceswhichareassociatedwiththe initial utterances.
this leads to a total of utterances manuallydisentangledinto749dialogs assummarizedintable1.note that removing bot involved dialogs haslittleimpact onourresults.
first the bot involved dialogs are relatively small in volume.
in our study only one of the eight projects utilizes bots and more specifically only nine out of sampled dialogs are excluded due to bot involvement.
second we observed that the bot generated utterances are rather trivial such as greeting information links to generalguidelines andstatusupdates.
to ensure the correctness of the disentanglement results a labelingteamwasputtogether consistingofoneseniorresearcher and sixph.d.

specifically for eachdisentangled dialog we first identify its initiator and all the respondents.
the initiator is the developer who launches the dialog and the respondents are other developers who participate in the dialog.
then we adda link between the initiator and each respondent.
note that rq2 focuses on exploring responding behaviors i.e.

analysisforrq3 discussiontopic .
ourgoalisidentifying discussiontopicsindevelopers live chat.chatterjee et al.
observedthatlivechatsprovidesimilarinformationascanbefoundin q a posts on stack overflow.
to effectively identify and organize dialog topics we extend beyer et.al s category of question categories on stack overflow .
we choose beyer et.al s category for two reasons.
first since developers use both question and answer forums suchasstackoverflow andlivechattoresolvedevelopmentissues weconsiderthecategoriesofstackoverflowquestions are partially applicable to the dialog topics in live chat.
second beyeret.al s category harmonizes five taxonomies presented in previous studies that are already validated and suitable to the posts ofdevelopers questions.
nonetheless thepredefinedcategoryisnotmeanttobecomprehensive thus weemploya hybridcardsort process tomanually determine the topics of dialogs.
in a hybrid card sort the sorting beginswiththepredefinedbeyer et.al scategoryandparticipants couldcreatetheirownaswell.thenewly createdtopicisinstantly updated into the topic set and can be used by other participants then.theparticipantsarethesameteamthatmanuallydisentangle dialogs andthe labeling processissimilartomanual dialogdisentanglement as introduced in section .

specifically the sorting process is conducted in one round with a concluding discussion session to resolve the disagreement in labels based on majority voting.the averagecohen skappa aboutdialogtopics is0.

analysis for rq4 interactive pattern .
live chat conversations generally servethe purposesof solution explorationanddiscussion stimulation.
to uncover underlying patterns that shape and ordirectmoreproductiveconversations wefirstadoptadeveloper intent codebook and manually label the interaction links that appeared in each dialog.

then we employ an open card sort process to assign an interactivepatterntoadialogbasedonthesequenceofdevelopers intents.
in an open sort the sorting begins with no predefined patterns and participants develop their own patterns.
the two participantsindividuallyassignedpatternstothesamedialogs.the sortingprocess is conductedinmultiple rounds.
in the firstround all participantslabeldialogsofone community with an intensive discussion session to achieve conceptual coherence about patterns.
a shared pool of patterns is utilized and carefully maintained and eachparticipantcouldselectexistingpatternsfromand oraddnew patternnamesintothesharedpool.thenwedivideintotwoteams to label the remaining dialogs.
each dialog will receive two pattern labels and we resolve disagreement based on majority voting.
the averagecohen skappa aboutinteractive patterns is0.
.
after identifying underlying interaction patterns we further exploretheirstatisticalcharacteristicsinaspectsofdistributionand duration.we calculatethe durationof adialogas follows duration te ti whereteisthetimethatthedialogended and tiisthetimethat the initiator launched the dialog.
this metric can reflect the life cycleofone dialog.
notethat tokeeptheworkloadofmanuallylabelingeachdialog manageable weanswerrq3andrq4bymanuallyanalyzingthe sampled dialogs.
we believe that although we could only manuallyanalyzeasmallpercentageofthedisentangleddialogs this datasetsupportsourmethodologyasbeingusefulfordiscovering valuable findings.
results and analysis .
rq1 communication profile toanswerthisquestion weanalyzetwometrics i.e.utterancetime and response time.next we report the results of comparing these metrics acrossthe eightgitter communities.
utterance time.
figure3 a compares the distribution of utterances intensity over hours across the eight communities.
first we identify the peak hours of each community in red dashed circles then highlightthetimewindowsbasedon thepeakhours contained in it with the yellow shade.
we can see that there are threewindowsofpeakhours whicharefromutc9to10 13to14 and18to21.inaddition utc1to6correspondstothelowchattingactivityhours.developersarelessactiveinchattingatthattime.

theaverageresponsetimeis220seconds themaximumtimelagis seconds and the minimum time lag is two seconds.
the peak pointis whichmeansthereare393dialogsthatgotreplies in seconds.
we can see that the time lag largely increases from to seconds and descend in a long tail.
eighty percent of the dialogs get firstresponses in343seconds.

our work paves the way for other researchers to be able to utilize the same methods in other softwarecommunities.additionally ascommunicationisalarge partofsuccessfulsoftwaredevelopment andgitterisoneofthe main platforms for communication of github users it is important to explore how software engineers use gitter and their pain points ofusingit.aimingatpromotingefficientandeffectiveosscommunications we discuss themain implicationsof our findingsfor oss developers communities platform vendors andresearchers.

in figure we reported that there are nearly dialogs are problem oriented.
in the live chat it is important to provideexample codeinproblem orienteddialogs tomakeother developers quickly understand and avoid missing key information.
this finding is also in line with the evidence provided by previous studies on stack overflow.
here is an example of showing d1 hey there anyone has an idea on this issue have quotes showing up in the ui.
i tried to remove it by replacing it in the .ts file...i m not sure what else to try.

particularly the angular community givesgreat importance to example demonstration.
developers are encouraged to create examples via a demonstration platform named plunker .
be aware of low active hours rq1 .
our results show thatdevelopersaremoreactiveduringsometimeslicesinlivechat.
figure3 a demonstrates the most active time slices are utc and corresponding to central european american daytimeorasianighttime.noticeably moredeveloperlivechatting happensonwednesdaysandthursdaysthanonotherweekdays utc whichpossiblycorrespondstocommunication coordination andpreparationforintegration releasedeadlinesonfridays.this observation alsoconfirmsthe commerciallyviablealternative of the oss projects reported in recent studies .
one of the common findings is thatthe traditional notion of oss projects that are driven by voluntary developers is now outdated.
oss has becomeacommerciallyviablealternative andsomeossprojects have become critical building blocks for organizationsworldwide.
for example docker is widely used by software companies around the world5 including adobe at t paypal etc.
therefore instead ofchatting onweekends developerslikely discusstheirproblems inthe live chatonworkdays.
while low active time slices utc mostly correspond to centraleuropean americannighttimeorasiadaytime.incases wheredevelopersfindissuesandneedsupportduringlow active hours wesuggestseveraloptions.first itisrecommendedtosimultaneously post questions to other alternative platforms e.g.
issues and emails.
second they better follow up in live chat if not receiving timely responses to their questions posted during low active hours.
finally employ some automated reminder bot for example to reviewthe listofquestionspostedduringlow active hours.
avoid asking amid ongoing discussions rq4 .
when identifying the unanswered monologues patterns from dialogs we notethat30 ofthemarelaunchedinthemiddleofongoingactive andintenseconversationsonadifferenttopic.insuchcases new questionsareeasilyfloodedbytheutterancesoftheongoingdiscussions.
therefore to increasethe opportunityof gettingresponses developerscouldposttheirquestionsaftertheongoingdiscussions.

platform vendors this section discusses several desired features for facilitating more productive conversations.
specifically these are organized from communication platform vendors perspective in support of more intelligentandproductivechattingoptions leveragingonmining andknowledge sharingofintensive historicalconversations.
highlight and organize conversation topics rq3 .
as suggestedbythepreviousstudy multi dimensionalseparation of concerns is a powerful concept supporting collaborative development by breaking a large discussion down into many smaller units.ithighlightsthattheonlinecommunicationplatformvendors could providesupportfora setofpredefinedpanelsthatfocus on certain topics.
in the results of rq3 we provide a taxonomy of discussion topics in live chat.the online communication platform vendors could refer to this taxonomy to create topic panels.
for example api usage panel error panel background info panel etc.
thesemultiplepanelscouldbringthefollowingbenefitstocommunity members i quickly understanding and retrieving the intents ofthedialoginitiators ii reducinginterferenceandfocusingmore on topics of interest and iii identifying important information reportedbythe developers.

as an example techniquesfor mining live chat have been exploredfor identifying feature requests from chatlogs .
.
researchers research in the se area could dedicate to promote efficient and effective oss communicationinthe following directions.
automaticallyrecommendsimilarquestions rq4 .
existing online communication platforms only record the massive historychatmessages butdonotconsideradeeperutilizationof thosehistoricaldata.actually wenotethatdeveloperspostsimilar questions in live chat sometimes.
in dl4j one initiator posted a question andhegotareplylikethis someoneelseaskedavery similarquestionawhileago.
however itisnoteasyfortheinitiator toaccuratelyretrievethesimilarquestionoutfromthemassivehistorymessages.inaddition somequestionsthatgotunansweredare largely dueto many similar questions beingpreviously answered.
therefore we consider that it will save developers effort if researcherscoulddevelopapproachesthatautomaticallyrecommend similar questionsandthe corresponding discussions.
automatically assign appropriate respondents rq4 .
by analyzingthe dialogsbelonging toexploring solution patterns p1 we note that respondents who are not quite familiar with the technologies related to the posted questions might give ineffective solutions.althoughsuchdiscussionscouldmakedevelopersunderstand the problem better the multiple fail and try interactions still prolong theprocess of issue resolving.therefore to makeconversations more productive it is expected to develop approaches that couldrecommendorassignappropriaterespondentsaccordingto theirhistoricalanswers.
automatically push valuable information to project repositories rq3 .
valuableinformationsuchasfeaturerequests or issue reports either manually annotated by developers or automatically detected by tools needs to be well documented and well traced in the scope of project repositories.
typically code repositoriessuchasgithuborgitlabprovidethefunctionalityofissuetracking.itwouldbemoreefficientifresearcherscouldprovide aconvenientwaytodirectlypushorintegratethevaluableinformationintothecoderepository.inaddition thefollowinglinguistic patterns might be helpful to automatically classify dialog topics.
