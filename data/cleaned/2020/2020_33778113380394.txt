to complicate matters the demographic of app developers has expanded significantly as well app development is no longer the domain of the select few with deep technical skills training and knowledge.
apps are now being developed by a wide range of people with diverse backgrounds.
already in reports showed that of app developers were independent solo developers ieee acm 42nd international conference on software engineering icse icse may seoul republicof korea van derlinden et al.
and more recent reports have shown that solo hobbyistandamateurdevelopersconstitute43 oftheappdevelopercommunity.

solving problems how can i select an ad library with good revenue?
how do i know what clauses to put in a license agreement?
how do i understand what this code does wrong?
whom do i trust to fix this problem?
who can i get to test this?
figure app development activities with typical considerations developers run across adapted from .
yet this increasingly diverse and independent group of developers remains under studied much research e.g.
focusing on experienced well established developers.
research also tended to focus more on whatestablished developers do wrong e.g.
programmingerrors misuseofeitherapis oronlineinformationsources e.g.
stackoverflow whilenoteliciting why they do so.
for instance researchers have shown that copy pasting fromstackoverflowmaybeharmful .therearereasons why developers for developers to throw caution to the wind and do something they mayvery well knowto be less secure.
similarly whiledevelopersmayunderstandthepotentialsecurityimplicationsofallowingthird partycodetoloadintotheirapp and execute the necessary step of monetization brings exactly this threat of dynamic code loading.
with developers often failing to convince users to pay even .
for an app let alone consider subscriptionfeesforaservice manyturntoadvertisementsasa reliable way of income.
an increasing number of these libraries turn outto be malicious e.g.
xavier and igexin .
likewise most people would intuitively avoid accepting gifts from strangers.
or in the context of app development a usb stick from a local user group with a copy of one s preferred platform development tools.
yet as the xcode ghost malware that affected million ios users showed there was a valid rationale behind that many developers lived in areas where they did not have sufficient bandwidth to easily download xcode.
this paper is the first to present empirical insight into the rationale underpinning the various activities in which the ever growing partofthedevelopercommunityofdiverseandindependentappdevelopersengage cf.fig.

developer centredsecurity recent work has started to focus on developer centred security bothunderstanding e.g.
andimproving e.g.
how they engage with security.
much of this work is focused on security surrounding technical code activities e.g.
coding testing deploying or studying developers in traditional larger software development organizations e.g.
.
research has also shown that security knowledge does not guarantee secure software some developers with good understanding of security practices fail to applyit whileotherdeveloperswithverylittlesecurityknowledge somehow builtsecure software .
littleworkhasyetfocusedonthisbreadthofknowledgenow required of developers.
for example a recent survey of security advicemostvisibletodevelopers discussesguidancecentered almost exclusively on code related security concerns.
a recent researchagendasimilarlyfocusesoncodingactivities finding wildlydiffering attitudes towardssecurity inthis taskalone.
in contrast our findings offer support for the position that especially in the app development context characterized by individuals andsmallteams securityvulnerabilitiesshouldbeunderstoodin contextoftherationalefortheactivitiesthatintroducedthem.only by understanding the lack of security rationale can we begin to conceptualize interventions to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
studyi securityrationalesacross app developmentactivities we designed a task based online study to address three research questions do app developers prioritize security during different activities in whichthey engagewhile producing the app?
are activities where security is prioritized informed by a security rationale?
whatexplanationsunderlietherationalesthatdevelopers have for their prioritization?
drawing on examples established in the literature we identified six tasks that reflect the activities that developers typically undertake allofwhichpresentsomeformofsecurityconcern.we provided brief scenarios and a selection of choices some security focused and some not.
an overview of the tasks as they were presentedtoparticipants andhowweoperationalizedwhether participants selection and sorting of choices prioritizes security or not is given infig.

the selectionwasdrawnfromalistofmostpopularplugintypes.of thegiventypeofplugins thestaticanalyzerwithsecuritychecking rulesistheonlypluginexplicitlymentioningsupportforautomatic analysis of code vulnerabilities and its inclusion can reasonably be assumedto follow from an attitude of prioritizingsecurity.
task fixing source code storingpasswordsinplaintextis an obvious security concern which should be avoided.
if participants select any other code fragment they de prioritize security or do not have the expertise and or security focused approach to development .
thus to prioritize security participants should selectthesecurityconcern.anexampleofthecodepresentedto participants oneofthreerandomlyshownvariationstoruleout primingbias is shownin the onlineappendix .
task3 seekinghelponaconfusingapi researchhasshown thatcopypastingsolutionsfromstackoverflowdoesnotbenefitsecurity .
moreover in a secure coding experiment itwas shown that between four groups only allowed to use either official api documentation appdevelopmentbook websearches orstackoverflow it was the group who only used stackoverflow that produced theleastsecuresolutions.incontrast thegrouponlyallowedtouse official api documentation produced the most secure solutions .
thus to prioritize security participants should first read the api s documentation and only as a last resort go to stackoverflow to copy pastean example and not justtrust any example.
task4 seekingtesters researchonapptestingandreleasehas shownthat just releasingappsisfraughtwithissues .using dedicated user groups for testing helps to ensure that usability and security do not oppose each other .
thus app testing via a user group prioritizes a comprehensive testing approach while just publishing the app withoutany testingde prioritizes security.
task selecting an advertisement sdk there has been a steadyincreaseinthenumberofpermissionsusedbyadlibraries .
research has stressed the need to carefully assess the permissions requested by android advertisement libraries before incorporating them to avoid accidentally including malicious libraries.
thus to prioritize security participants should rank analyzing the requiredpermissionsoftheadlibraryhighly viceversa ahigher ranking for including ad libraries at random or including as many as possible de prioritizes security .
task building a so f tware licenseagreement research has shown that prohibiting reverse engineering and bench marking promotesdiscoveryandsharingofvulnerabilitiesinblackhatcommunities while denying this to white hat communities .
thus to prioritize security prohibitions on reverse engineering and or bench marking should not be included.

whatelsecharacterizesparticipants rationales?
thethematic analysis of the rationale data gave rise to several recurring themes thatspannedacrossdifferenttasks.thesearedescribedbelowto allowforfurtherunderstandingofwhydevelopersmayprioritize the waythey do.
caring about users many participants across several tasks reflect on the impact of their decisions on users of the app.
this manifests in altruistic orempathetic context as for example in reflection onthe advertisement andlicensetasks i don t want to putmyusersat riskwithweird permissions.

this was however anecessarycompromiseinordertorevealtheheterogeneityof reasoning thatdevelopers hold fordifferent kinds of tasks.
notably therefore thethematicanalysisofparticipants rationales did not expose any evidence that they considered real world contextsdifferently theirdecisionsweredrivenbypriorsecurity knowledge or some choices were taken to be much more likely or obvious thanothers.

given that study i s findings among a much wider sample of the mobile developer population is inlinewithourkeyfindingsofstudyii asecurityfocusoncoderelated tasks and under appreciation of security impact of other activities we feel confident that the samples of both studies show a valid picture of the typical developers encountered in mobile app development.

however eliciting self reportedexperiencehasitslimitationsasdiscussedbefore and wouldnotnecessarilyenrichthefindings.thus furtherstudiesmay attempt to use objective measures of security knowledge rather than self reported experience in focused task studies to assess whether the level ofsecurity knowledge has aneffecton different tasks.
this was not deemed feasible in the present study due to the need to incorporate a wider variety of tasks which already led to a study with significant duration limiting the potential of recruiting willing participants.

this may indicate that developers do not make the leap of thinking of people and sources they use to aid in their app s development as potentially misguided or even adversarial.

for example p9 made their selection because it d help fix issues i create which is important as a lone dev with nocode review p9 and p24 did so because the static analyzer helps prevent nonobvious security issues.
