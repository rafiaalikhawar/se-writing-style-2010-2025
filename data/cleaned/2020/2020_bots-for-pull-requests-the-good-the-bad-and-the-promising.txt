accomplishing tasks previously solely performed by human developers and interacting in the same communication channelsastheirhumancounterparts botshavebecomenewvoices in the pull request review conversation .
bots even perform more activities than humans in some projects .
nevertheless the introduction of bots can interfere with the community dynamics.
according to brown and parnin the bot interactions on pull requests can be inconvenient leading developers to leave negative feedback or even abandon their contributions.
indeed the literature has shown that bots change the dynamics of collaboration and thatoss developers often perceive their intervention as disruptive and noisy .
on an issue a developer complainedaboutthefrequencyofabot sactions igetabout notifications per day just from those bot actions and there does not seem to be a way to ignore them.
1therefore bots may overburden developers who already suffer from information overload when communicatingonline .
tomakebotsmoreeffectiveatcommunicatingtodevelopers designproblemsneedtobesolvedtoavoidrepetitivenotifications provideconsistencyinthetasksbeingdone andmakebotsadaptive .
designers should envision software bots as socio technical rather than purely technical applications considering human interaction developers collaboration and ethical concerns .
the adoption of bots in oss projects is a recent trend and the literature lacks design strategies that include the end users perspective to enhancethe bots interaction on social coding platforms.
in other domains as it is hard to change third party bots researchershaveproposedmeta botstointegrateandmoderatethe interactions of multiple bots .
we envision a meta bot as a promising approach to mitigate the information overload from existing github bots.
considering this context the main goal of this study is to elicit design strategies to overcome the information ieee acm 44th international conference on software engineering icse icse may21 pittsburgh pa usa mairieliwessel et al.

to answer rq1 we applied design fiction as a participatory design method.
this technique is used to probe explore and critique future technologies .
we recruited practitioners including open source maintainers contributors bot developers and bot researchers toact as designers inthe early stagesof the envisioned meta bot conception.
we presented to participants afi ctional story of a meta bot capable of better supporting developers interactions on pull requests and operating as a mediator between developers and the existing bots.
participants answered questions to complete theendofthefictionalstory raisingconcernsabouttheuseofbots and discussingthedesignstrategiesfor the meta bot.

whichindicatesthatnoiseisacentralproblem.
noise affects both human communication and the development workflow by overwhelming and distracting developers.
complementing the previous literature we provide afi rst step towards enhancing bots communication design thereby overcoming noise.
inothercontexts researchershaveproposedtheuseofametabot to integrate and moderate the interactions of multiple bots.sadeddin et al .
showed that a meta bot could obtain product information from several shopping bots and summarize theinformation before presenting it to users.
previous research also investigated the user experience of single vs. multi botconversationalsystems.inawizard of ozstudy chavesandgerosa foundthatparticipantsreportmoreconfusioninamulti botsce nario than when using a meta bot.
the concept of the meta bot also appears in the literature on software agents.
generalist agents areusuallyreferredtoassuperbotsormeta bots sincethey oftencombinemultipletasksandfunctionalitiesofspecialistagents into a single agent.
given this preliminary evidence obtained in other domains we hypothesize that a meta bot can mitigate the informationoverloadcreatedbyotherbotsaroundpullrequests.

in the following subsections we focus onthepresentationoftheparticipatorydesignfictionmethodology phase i .
we describe the method and results from phase ii in section .
.
phase i research approach we applied design fiction method which has been broadly used in the human computer interactionfi eld .
the design fiction method wasfi rst defined by sterling as the deliberateuseofdiegeticprototypestosuspenddisbeliefaboutchange.
designfi ction can be described as making use of practices such as prototypingandnarrativeelementstoenvisionandexplainplausible futures while reflecting upon the present world .

the speculative nature of this technique amplifies critical views of current social and technological developments creating afi ctional context narrated through designed artifacts .
this approach facilitates exploring boundless thoughts and open discussions on a particular subject .

designfictiondistinguishesitselfintheway thedesignedartifacts bring context specific meaning and social relevance to the envisioned technology .
in this work the use of design fiction enables the practitioners to envision a bot mediator and its environment rather than focusing on the current technical limitations.

the fictional story.
the story description follows the key idea raised by the noise theory of wessel et al .

at that point her team brainstormed and decided to apply some countermeasures to overcome the noise.
their idea was to implement a meta bot to act asamediatorbetweentheexistingbotsandhumandevelopers.wetold participants that thefi ctional story takes place approximately ten years in the future to let them be less constrained by current technological limitations.

sandbox sessions.
we conducted sandbox sessions with a small sample of participants to adjust thefi ctional story and thesession instrument.
we invited three participants who had expe rience contributing to and maintaining open source projects ongithub.
we asked for feedback on the minute video verifying whethertheparticipantscouldcapturetheintendedmessageofthe fictionalstory.inaddition wevalidatedthescriptandconfirmed whether the session wouldfi t in a hour time slot.

277botsforpull requests the good the bad and the promising icse may pittsburgh pa usa phase i design fiction findings in this section we present the strategies to mitigate bots noise derived from the analysis of the participatory designfi ction sessions see section .
the participants discussed several design strategies to mitigate noise created by bots as presented in table .

in summary we found design strategies organized intofi ve categories informationmanagement imi newcomers assistance nai notificationmanagement nmi spamandfailuresmanagement smi and platformsupport psi .inthefollowing wepresent thesefi ve main categories.
we describe the categories in bold and providethenumberofparticipantsweassignedtoeachcategory in parentheses .

thestrategy summarizationof bot comments was frequently mentioned by the participants asawaytomitigateinformationoverload.summariesshouldbe conciseandreportanoverviewofthepullrequeststatus givemea contextreportorsummary.iexpectthemeta bottobejustonepartic ularcommentwithsomepoints.justonecommentwitheverythingasaconsciousreport .howeve r thisstrategyalsoimposessome technical challenges when it comes to implementation.
according to p31 it is difficult to summarize because although the message is created by a bot it s supposedly based on a template.
in terms of its implementation the easiest strategy to reduce noise would be aggregatingbot comments .
in this specific case the meta bot would merge bots outputs into a single commentonapullrequest.thisstrategyisusuallymentionedin conjunctionwith summarizingthebots outputs it could possibly summarize andputtheminasinglemessage .
inbothcases themeta botcreatesasingleoutputforallbots however it does not imply implementing the merging strategy always based on the summarized version of each bot output.another strategy concerned the order that the information is presented to the developers.
participants suggest a prioritization of bot outputs within the summary the meta bot provides suchthat the meta bot has the capacity to treat some bot comments asmoreimportantthanothers.basically participantsmentioned twodifferenttypesofprioritization basedontasks andbased on issues .
for the prioritization based on tasks the meta bot would sort the most important bot comments based on the task implemented in the pull request it would also be able to sort of filteroutwhatisusefulandwhatisnotusefulbasedonthetaskthe developer is actually working on .
the prioritization might alsotakeintoaccountthepullrequestproblemsraisedbybots sortingbythelevelofcriticalityofbotnotifications asmentionedby p21 if any critical problem happens then i would like to be notified withaspecificbotreport iwouldreceiveacriticalnotification.
t o complement prioritization fi ve participants also suggested the categorizationofbotcomments .themeta botwouldgroupthe botoutputsbasedontheirtypes e.g.
testing security information beforereportinginthepullrequest.withacategorizationofbotcomments developers know if need to look at a specific bot comment or not .
to avoid inflating the pull requests with several comments from themeta bot onesuggestedstrategyisto keep the mostrecent information .
participants suggested that the meta bot creates a single comment and keeps updating it with new information fromotherbots themeta botjustcreatesonecommentandkeeps updating it .
it should also keep the comment up to date if commit again the meta bot updates the comment.
if fi xes lint s errors for example the meta bot will remove the warning from the comment.
participantsalsomentionedotheradditionalaspectsofthemetabotcommunicationunrelatedtomitigatingnoise.forexample participantsenvision the meta bot interactingwith users through naturallanguage byprovidinganinterfaceforcommunicating with developers to understand their requests and answer their questions.
to promote diversity and inclusion the meta bot can provideinternationalization and support different languages e.g.
german .
newcomers assistance.
thenewcomers scenariowepresented to participants led them to think about how the information pre sented by the current bots might affect newcomers perceptions andsuccess.
as a result we found four main strategies that might assist newcomers of which explaining rules instructions and requirements was one of the most frequent.
according to participants themeta botcouldguidethenewcomersandinformthem about the project s rules and the requirements to approve the pull request.
for example p13 explains the importance of providing such explanations do not understand the rules yet and...don tunderstandwhichrulesareimportant.
thus themetabotwoulddoanexcellentjobforanewcomerbyexplainingwhythese rules exist .
the meta bot could also refer to the contribution guidelines to assist a newcomer developers fi rst contribution as well as include a welcoming message in the meta bot s commentonnewcomers pullrequest .themeta botmightpostacomment for example hi welcome!
i just saw this is yourfirst contribution.
are you aware of the rules of this repository?
or the 278icse may21 pittsburgh pa usa mairieliwessel et al.
rulesofthiscommunity ?
.thesegreetingscouldbeused to let know that they are welcome into the community however it is also important to keep the message concise and direct the message should be short.
if newcomers see the botseveral times in different projects it will annoy them and they are goingto discard the whole information the bot provides.
concerningthestrategiestodisplaybotinformationtonewcomers participants envision the meta bot providing information interactively .asmentionedbyp5 themeta botmightguide thenewcontributorbyshowingtheinformationfromotherbots stepbystep.
intervieweesdeemedthisstrategyapotentialsolution to reduce the impact of receiving several different bot notificationsatonce.p20offeredanexemplarycaseofhowthisstrategy would apply to a real scenario if the newcomer has not updated the readme or the documentation it shows you need to update the documentation and waits for the newcomer to take action.
whenthe newcomerfi xes the documentation by creating a new commit thebotinformsthedocumentationisnowokayandthenshowsthe next message.
another strategy regards notifying maintainers about new pull requests from newcomers .
since newcomersmightpreferotherhumanstointeract afewparticipantsalso see the meta bot as an approach to ping a developer to look at it aimingat encouragingmorehuman activityfrom the maintainer .
notificationmanagement.
participantsalsoreporteddesign strategies to allow the meta bot to control different aspects ofbots notification.
first the meta bot should notify developers throughapre specifiedchannel whichmeansitwouldsend thenotificationswhereverthedeveloperwantstoreceivethenotification e.g.
email github notifications .
as mentioned by p1 thisstrategywouldhelpthemeta bottosendthenotificationsto a channel that the developers do not ignore.
participants also proposed strategies related to the frequency and timing of notifications.
one approach would be to schedule botnotifications inwhichthemeta botwouldavoidnotifying developersaccordingto customizable timeframesindicatingwhen they do not want interruptions.
this may be implemented forexample using a do not disturb mode.
another approach wouldbe notifydevelopersintheiridletimes .themeta bot would not interrupt the developers during critical tasks do not notify the developer if is aware that is currentlyworking.thatisalsowhatotherhumanswouldnotdo .
inthisapproachthemeta botwouldlearnthedevelopers schedule and adapt to them.
another option is notto notify maintainers untiltheconditionissatisfied .therefore themeta botwould notifythedevelopersonlywhen thepredefinedconditionsaremet asstatedbyp16 iwanttobenotifiedaboutnewpullrequestsafterallmytestshavepassed.andafterthebotscommented andifeverything is green then i want to be notified.
to avoid overload with unrelated notifications we found that it is also important to notify only interested developers .
the meta bot should notify only developers who are interested in monitoring activities related to a particular repository issue or pull request.accordingtop25 forexample maintainersandcontributorshavedifferentneedswhenitcomestobeingnotifiedbybots ifi macontributor iwanttoknowthatnotificationaboutmycontribution.
but as a maintainer i don t need to be reminded about every contribution that happened when i release a new version of my project.
.
spamandfailuresmanagement.
we also identified three designstrategiestoprovidecontroloverunforeseenproblemscreated bybotinteractions.to prevent repetitive bot activities the meta botbotwoulddetectbotsthataregeneratingrepetitiveoutcomesandpreventthemfromactingonpullrequests thiscanavoid duplicate messages and spam it has the ability to control whichbots comment often then it would be easy to say no you alreadyhavethiscommentandiseethatyournextcommentisexactlythe same .therewouldbealsoamechanismfor spammessages notification wherein the meta bot would notify developers about repetitive bot messages that might be considered spam.
and ifthereisabugwithaspecificbot themeta botcan contactthe bot maintainers to provide a bug report .
platform support.
participants envision a few modifications in the platform interface to improve its integration with bots.
one potential modification is to separate bot comments by relegating them to a space reserved for bot interactions.
as statedby p32 developers do not like bots to come in the middle of their conversations.so botshavingtheirownspaceortheirownchannel would be the best .
this dedicated space for bots wouldpresent the bot messages that are dead ended that is the ones that do not require any response from the developer.
addi tionally they suggest implementing mechanisms to collapse the bot outputs then you can collapse all messages.
if you want to read a message you have to expand it .
theparticipantsalsoproposedtheimplementationofa botconfigurationdashboard inwhichdeveloperscancustomizetheir preferencesforviewingbotinteractions.thisdashboardwouldhelp developers who work on several repositories to have a common interfacetomonitorbots actions asillustratedbyp3 when end upwithtonsofrepositories andbotsareworking on it need some overview picture of it.
research question what design strategies can potentially reduce the noise created by bots on pull requests?
as a result of the designfi ction methodology we identified a series of design strategies regarding the meta bot and its in tegration with the social coding platform.
more specifically participants envision strategies for information management newcomers assistance notification management spam failure managements andplatformsupport.
phase ii suitability study in this phase we aim at validating our interpretation of the strategies proposed by the designfi ction participants and evaluating the proposed implementation.
to further refine the strategies elicited via the designfiction method we developed a prototype and collectedparticipants perceptionsofit.understandingtheperceptions of the subject matter experts practitioners who face the problems 279botsforpull requests the good the bad and the promising icse may pittsburgh pa usa in the daily life and have large experience with software bots supportsevaluation of the suitability of the proposed solutions.

prototyping.
wedevelopedaprototypetoreceivefeedback about the most cited strategies.
we applied the prototype to a scenario created from the reakit5project.
this project uses four bots to support the pull request review process and all bots report their outputs using comments on the pull request.
each of them is responsible for a different task codesandbox providesanisolatedtestenvironmentfor the validationof the code modified by the pull request.

implemented prototype.
to offer different views for maintainersandnewcomers wesplittheprototypeintotwodifferent versions theexperts pullrequestinterface seefigure2 designed to support maintainers and experienced contributors and the newcomers pullrequestinterface seefigure3 .infigure weshow howwemappedthestrategiesontotheexperts designedinterface.
first weusedthestrategyof separatingbotcomments ps1 todesign a specific place for bots in the pull request.
we created a new tabinthepullrequestinterface seefigure2 a called botsconversation .
this tab contains all information and events regarding botsinthepullrequest includingatimelineofbotevents.asfor botoutputs wealsodisambiguatethebotparticipantsfromhuman participants as shown in figure d. v figure experts pull request interface inrelationtothemeta botcomments weimplementedthestrategies ofaggregating im2 summarizing im1 prioritizing im4 andcategorizing im6 botcomments aswedepictedinfigure2 c. aggregates allbotsoutputsinoneplace andalso createsasummary withthemostimportantinformationabouteach one.
it then groups them into categories taking into consideration thepriority.t okeepthe mostrecentinformation im5 we include in the summary the latest comment from each bot figure2 b .
the reakit bot for example posted three comments in the timeline of bot events however only one entry appears in the summarizedtable for that bot.
in addition in the timeline of bot events it is possible to expand all bot comments.
we also mapped the aforementioned strategies into the newcomers pullrequest interface.
the differences between those two versionsarerelatedtothemeta botmessage.figure3highlights the designed interface for newcomers.
in addition to the table summarizing the outputs we added a text based message to fulfill the requirement of welcoming newcomers na2 as shown in figure 3a.
beyond presenting a welcoming message designfi ction participantsemphasizedtheimportanceof explainingrules instructions and requirements na1 for contributors who are new to a project.
thus we included a link to reakit s contributing guidelines see figure b .
figure newcomers pull request interface another important distinction is the way the meta bot displays theinformationfornewcomersversusexperts.infigure3 c we present the interactive process of displaying bots information.
insteadofpresentingthecompletesummary themeta botpresents the information one at a time na3 for newcomers.
this approach aimsatguidingthenewcomersthroughtherequirementsforthe pull request we also provided a brief explanation of bot messages foreachstep.toproceedthroughtheinteractiveoutput theuser has to click on the provided links.
there is also an option to see all themeta bot outputs at once.
.

interviews.
we reached out to our participants via email inviting them to provide feedback through an online meeting.
