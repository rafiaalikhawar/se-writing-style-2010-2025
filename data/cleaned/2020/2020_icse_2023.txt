on software engineering icse2023 it has been my great privilege to act as eneral chair for this conference again in somewhat challenging times even if supposedly 3post pandemic .
icse is a primarily in person meeting though we needed to provide remote presentation support for a number of authors unable to attend the conference in person.
the melbourne convention and exhibition centre is designed as an in person venue and while live present a and livestream can be supported this requires considerable extra support and scheduling of the programme.
so saying icse to icse showed the potential of virtual attendance e.g.
for those unable to travel.
this was the second time icse has been held in melbourne australia the previous being in .
icse is the leading and by far the largest conference in software engineering attracting researchers practitioners and students from around the world.
icse2023 is co located with conferences and symposia this year many long established and prestigious venues in their own right.
these include the 4th acm ieee international conference on automation of software test ast the 2nd conference on ai engineering software engineering for ai cain 16th international conference on cooperative and human aspects of software engineering chase formalise 31st ieee acm international conference on program comprehension icpc 17th international conference on software and system processes icssp welcoming back to co location with icse 10th international conference on mobile software engineering and systems mobilesoft 20th mining software repositories conference msr international conference on technical debt 18th symposium on software engineering for adaptive and self managing systems seams in addition workshops are co located with icse2023 running the three days before the conference and on the saturday after the main conference concluded.
a few workshops and co located conferences are running virtual sessions in addition to hybrid sessions.
icse again hosts a doctoral symposium with o v e r p h d s t u d e n t s p r e s e n t i n g a student research competition new faculty symposium artefacts track score student competition student research competition and student mentoring programme.
we were also fortunate to have seven technical briefings accepted and presented during the main conference three days.
xxxvi special programme items this year include an icse showcase where invited presentations from several specialised software engineering conferences have been sought to address some of the historically important and popular areas of se that have in recent times had very few papers appearing at icse.this includes requirements engineering modelling software architecture and formal methods focused papers.
we hope via the s h o w c a s e t r a c k t o s p u r increased submissions and interest from these communities in icse.
a future of software engineering invited speakers track highlights a number of directions in se over the next years from leading established and emerging researchers in these areas.
a post icse future of software engineering proceedings is planned to capture not only these speakers visions but also feedback from attendees from their panel oriented presentation and discussion sessions.
an industry forum aimed at local industry participation attracted a good number of submissions by industry practitioners with optional short paper in proceedings.
a wide variety of diversity and social events have been organised.
these include but are not limited to newcomers to icse women icse lunch l bt4i icse bipoc icse conversation cafp on equality diversity and inclusion edi conversation cafp on wellness in academia book club discussion icse run icse tennis recruitment database recruitment lunch sustainability of conferences and software engineering s contribution to sustainability has become an important consideration.
one issue with running icse in australia is the distance to travel and length of stays needed for international participants.
we highlighted carbon footprint relating to travel chose as our venue the melbourne conference and exhibition centre due to its world leading conference facility energy food and conference support considerations selected local hotels that have demonstrated high commitment to all aspects of sustainability highlighted public transport options close to and far from the venue and enabled remote presentation without need to attend icse in person for those needing or choosing to do so.
i would like to thank my programme co chairs lori pollock and massimiliano di penta for the huge efforts they have dedicated to not must running the technical programme track but xxxviiorganising main conference track sessions many contributions to overall icse decision making and being great fun to work with.

joshua arcia and ita richardson led development of a rich diversity and inclusion programme and even evaluated the conference web site for accessibility and inclusivity.
patricia lago and marcel boehme oversaw sustainability initiatives.
.la tantithamthavorn and laura moreno ensured a very vibrant social media presence for the conference over the past few years.
pick thongtanunam matthias alster and jonny low managed a large number of student volunteer applications and due to the hybrid nature of icse2023 had to train and supply a large cohort of selected student volunteers.
my thanks to li li and niroshine fernando for overseeing the proceedings process and to patrick and lisa from ieee cps for all of their work assembling the icse proceedings with over items no mean feat.
thank you very much to hourieh .halam adeh and chunyang chen who worked with lori max and our icsma team on the icse schedule.

i would also like to thank .athy park from ieee for all of her help and support.
xxxviii thank you to all of the co located event and workshop organisers for all of your efforts that made the icse week programme so much richer.
many thanks to all of the various programme and selection committee members for icse tracks co located events and workshops who donated their time freely to provide feedback to authors.
i want to gratefully thank our many sponsors and supporters ieee computer society and ieee technical council on software engineering acm and acm special interest roup on software engineering the melbourne convention bureau the state overnment of victoria the csiro huawei monash university meta oogle aws monash university dragon testing technology ibm university of melbourne and rmit university.
finally many thanks to all of the submitters and attendees without whom there would not be a conference to organise and run.
enmoy icse2023 john rundy department of software systems and cybersecurity faculty of it monash university australia xxxixmessage from the icse program co chairs welcome to icse it is our great pleasure to introduce the program of the 45th ieee acm international conference on software engineering icse which will be held in melbourne australia on may .
this year the technical track received papers of which entered the reviewing process and .
acceptance rate were ultimately accepted of which after a gatekeeping phase one was withdrawn after acceptance making a total of papers in the program.
in the following we would like to provide some information about the reviewing process.
the role of area chairs and pc members.
since the icse reviewing process has leveraged the help of area chairs.
the role of area chairs is to make sure that submissions belonging to a given research area are treated along consistent criteria and standards common to that area.
considering the increasing volume of submissions for some areas this year we involved ten area chairs david lo denys poshyvanyk myra cohen corina s. pasareanu abhik roychoudhury walid maalem margaret anne storey andrian marcus bram adams and .elly blincoe.
area chairs have provided manyfold and significant support to the whole reviewing process.
first they helped us to assign papers to reviewers and to identify out of scope submissions.
then they supervised the reviewing process for all papers assigned to them identifying the need for additional expertise moderating the discussions and encouraging the convergence toward a decision.
importantly as also happened for icse there was no single paper on which program co chairs had to suggest a recommendation because no consensus had been reached.
this is particularly important because it means that the decision was always taken without having knowledge about the paper s authorship known to program chairs only .
overall each area chair had a workload comparable to those of program co chairs of medium si ed conferences.
they all did a terrific mob and we are extremely grateful to them the icse program committee was composed of pc members with a wide diversity in terms of expertise geographic distribution and gender.
they did an incredible mob in providing timely and constructive reviewers in a relatively tight period of time about weeks and in participating in the online discussion.
overall pc members have written a total of reviews and posted comments.
among the pc members based on the inputs from area chairs and other co reviewers we recogni e the following as distinguished reviewers ammed tahir andreas vogelsang andr em wasowski aurdris mockus bogdan vasilescu brittany johnson caitlin sadowski christine julien diomidis spinellis igor steinmacher jennifer horkoff julia lawall .evin moran .la tantithamthavorn .las stool leandro minku leonardo mariani marcel boehme philipp leitner rachel t oref brill sebastian baltes sebastian proksch and avier franch.
reviewing process.
after a first scrutiny from us program co chairs to check compliance with the format anonymi ation and scope after a plagiarism analysis and after a further scope check from the area chairs when needed each manuscript received at least three reviews.
after a first xlpreliminary discussion which sometimes led to the addition of additional reviews the authors of all papers had six days to read the reviews and provide a response to the reviewers.
reviews were then thoroughly discussed taking into account the authors responses where a response was provided.
for a small subset of papers where further questions emerged during the discussion or further reviews were required a second response period was then opened.
after a consensus was reached for each paper one of the reviewers was also asked to write a metareview explaining the reasons for acceptance or remection also in relation to what has been discussed behind the scenes.
some papers were asked to undergo a gatekeeping process after the notification i.e.
a revised version was re reviewed by a shepherd.
of those were accepted.
reviewing guidelines.
following what was done in the previous icse we provided pc members as well as authors with a detailed set of guidelines with the aim of improving the consistency in the provided reviews setting reviewing criteria along different dimensions technical soundness novelty significance verifiability and transparency and presentation and avoiding wherever possible known antipatterns.
we are so grateful to the authors of the initial sets of guidelines amy .o and jan vahrenhold program co chairs of icer andreas eller and daniela damian program co chairs of icse which we have evolved and adapted to our own reviewing process.
we hope that this initiative continues over future icse conferences it is already happening at the time of this writing for icse .
open access policy and artifacts check.
continuing the tradition of previous icse conferences we adopted the open access policy.
specifically each submitted manuscript was supposed to provide the availability of data a n d o r o t h e r a r t i f a c t s a i m e d at supporting the research reproducibility .
where this was not possible the authors were expected to explain the reasons.
for the first time this year we asked one of the reviewers of each paper to scrutini e the provided artifacts and check whether they are in line with what was declared at submission time.
in our opinion this helped to encourage the submission of complete artifacts and are happy that forthcoming conferences are also adopting this initiative.
distinguished papers.
it is a tradition of si soft sponsored conferences to award less than of the accepted papers with a distinguished paper award.
this year we have selected outstanding papers .

we are confident that these keynotes will be a great source of inspiration for all the icse attendees.
the composition of icse paper sessions.
the icse technical track papers are only one component of the conference sessions.
following the tradition of past icse conferences icse sessions are composed of contributions from other different tracks software engineering in practice seip papers accepted software engineering education and training seet papers accepted software engineering in society seis papers accepted new ideas and emerging results nier papers accepted and demonstrations.
moreover we feature presentations journal first track of papers published in three software engineering journals ieee transactions on software engineering acm transactions on software engineering and methodology and empirical software engineering .
finally for the first time icse features a showcase of best papers from various conferences related to requirement engineering re software architectures icsa model driven development models and formal methods fm .
overall we are talking about an impressive set of contributions besides the paper sessions and the keynotes the main program of the conference includes a talk from the authors of the icse paper that was mudged to be the most influential paper mip after ten years.
the awarded paper is 3semfix program repair via semantic analysis by hoang duong thien nguyen dawei 4i abhik roychoudhury and satish chandra the acm si soft outstanding research award ail murphy university of british xliicolumbia canada and the harlan d mills award recipient david harel wei mann institute of science israel talk an industry forum composed of two sessions featuring talks from practitioners three sessions about the future of software engineering featuring talks from worldwide leaders on how they see the landscape of software engineering is going to change in future years a panel on the early phases of software engineering technical briefings the acm student research competition the student contest on software engineering score and poster presentations of contributions submitted to the poster track as well as papers accepted in all other tracks.
notes of gratitude.
we would like to thank john rundy the icse general chair for his great leadership and support.
moreover we would like to thank daniela damian and andreas eller the icse program co chairs for the precious suggestions provided to us after running a successful conference last year.
above all we would like to thank over authors for submitting their manuscripts to icse .
we hope that the authors of accepted papers will help us to make icse a great engaging and inspirational event.
as usually happens not all authors received good news from us however we hope that their 3not yet accepted papers will benefit from the received feedback and become even better papers.
last but not least we would like to thank all attendees of icse .
we look forward to meeting all of you at the conference and hope you will find the program interesting and inspirational.

ieee road toward dependable ai based systemspaolo tonellasoftware instituteuniversit a della svizzera italiana usi lugano switzerlandpaolo.tonella usi.chabstract with the advent of deep learning ai componentshave achieved unprecedented performance on complex humancompetitive tasks such as image video text and audio process ing.
hence they are increasingly integrated into sophisticatedsoftware systems some of which e.g.
autonomous vehicles arerequired to deliver certified dependability warranties.
in thistalk i will consider the unique features of ai based systemsand of the faults possibly affecting them in order to revise thetesting fundamentals and redefine the overall goal of testing taking a statistical view on the dependability warranties that canbe actually delivered.
then i will consider the key elementsof a revised testing process for ai based systems includingthe test oracle and the test input generation problems.
i willalso introduce the notion of runtime supervision to deal withunexpected error conditions that may occur in the field.
finally i will identify the future steps that are essential to close the loopfrom testing to operation proposing an empirical framework thatreconnects the output of testing to its original goals.index terms software testing deep learning reliability anddependability the work presented in this keynote was partially supported by the h2020project precrime funded under the erc advanced grant program erc grant agreement n. .

ieee engineering as the linchpin ofresponsible ailiming zhucsiro s data61 sydney australiauniversity of new south wales sydney australiaabstract from humanity s existential risks to safety risks incritical systems to ethical risks responsible ai as the saviour has become a major research challenge with significant real world consequences.
however achieving responsible ai remainselusive despite the plethora of high level ethical principles risk frameworks and progress in algorithmic assurance.
in themeantime software engineering se is being upended by ai grappling with building system level quality and alignment frominscrutable machine learning models and code generated fromnatural language prompts.
the upending poses new challengesand opportunities for engineering ai systems responsibly.
thistalk will share our experiences in helping the industry achieveresponsible ai systems by inventing new se approaches.
it willdive into industry challenges such as risk silos and principle algorithm gaps and research challenges such as lack of re quirements emerging properties and inscrutable systems andmake the point that se is the linchpin of responsible ai.
butse also requires some fundamental rethinking shifting frombuilding functions into ai systems to discovering and managingemerging functions from ai systems.
only by so can setake on critical new roles from understanding human intelligenceto building a thriving human ai symbiosis.index terms responsible ai ethical ai trustworthy ai aiengineering se4aii.
introductionwith ai systems amazing and sometimes surprising ad vancement in the last few years concerns about their impacthave also been growing.
at the one extreme people are con cerned with the long term existential risk of artificial generalintelligence.
on the other hand organisations and communitieshave to manage safety risks in critical systems and ethical risksin everyday systems underpinned by ai.
although responsibleand ethical computing research has started since the dawnof computing the increased autonomy the data derived ofteninscrutable models and other challenges that defy meaningfulhuman supervision have rekindled the effort in the form ofresponsible ai.
a two fanged approach characterised the firstwave of this effort.on the one hand there has been the release of high level principles re emphasizing human values and social andenvironmental wellbeings and highlighting some particularlydifficult to achieve properties such as reliability security pri vacy explainability accountability and contestability.
on theother hand algorithmic approaches at the data and model levelalso proliferated.
however a clear gap emerged between thetwo .
organisations need concrete guidance and engineeringpractices to manage the end to end ai system developmentprocess well beyond algorithmic components.
all these nat urally point to the software engineering community steppingup to fill the gap and become the linchpin of responsible ai.however how to approach the challenge is not apparent.the software engineering community itself is undergoing twochallenges.
one is the upending of the software engineeringitself by generative ai including using natural languagerequirements and prompts.
the other is a debate aboutwhether existing software engineering practices can be adaptedto deal with ai systems assuring the desired propertiesembodied in the aspiring principles.
without trying to settlethe debate here i would argue that the generative ai for codingcomplicates the challenge further begging for reexamining theestablished wisdom.while the software engineering community grapples withthe challenges and finds our role the organizations deployingai have to manage the risks.
we cannot simply stop deployingai.
for most mature organisations risk management is at thecore of their business with specific accountability sitting at theboard executive level supported by technical risk assessmentand compliance divisions.
they are not new to uncertaintiesand risks.
but ai risk is sui generis.
first it demands anotherslice of the attention next to the financial legal reputation esg cybersecurity and privacy risks often already managedin silos and consuming separate resources.
and ai risksseem to permeate across all of them.
second the increasedautonomy the murky accountability the powerless human a.k.a liability sponge in the loop and inscrutable modelsare challenging the traditional risk assessment approaches.
forsome organisations systems won t be deployed no matter howmany bias metrics explainable proxy models and testing youthrow at the risk and compliance divisions.
for others aisystems might be deployed irresponsibly causing harm.ii.
anew way of thinkingbut i believe software engineers equipped with advancedai tools can find solutions for responsible ai.
this requiresa shift in thinking beyond the current paradigm.
the nextgeneration of responsible ai engineering methods should havethe following characteristics.define outcomes and boundariesinstead of simply spec ifying problems requirements and specifications.
as aissolve problems autonomously we need new methods thatenable software engineers to work with diverse users andcommunities to select the correct issues define outcomes and32023 ieee acm 45th international conference on software engineering icse .
ieee inclusive goals and boundaries for ai.
this way wecan trust that ai solves problems within acceptable limits.provide an understanding of ai generated solutionsrather than just setting or solving problems.
we need newmethods and ai tools that allow software engineers to inter pret explain and simplify complex ai based and ai generatedsolutions with justified confidence.
these methods shouldencompass the entire life cycle of the ai system and facilitatecommunication with non expert stakeholders.embed observability and monitorability for governance not just for error detection and diagnosis.
with ai solutionsthat can be difficult to understand and implicit requirementsthat can be challenging to validate we need new approachesto observability and monitorability for high risk ai systemsafter deployment.
these approaches should enable meaningfulhuman intervention and allow for monitoring the quality ofdata input for ai which is different from traditional datavalidation methods.
additionally we may need to developnew ways to study and control ai behaviour from the outside similar to how social scientists study human behaviour.with these characteristics and the practical industry chal lenges in mind we have laid a roadmap for software engineer ing for responsible ai .
the roadmap has three focuses.
establishing multi level governance for responsible aisystems.
this connects team level responsible ai prac tices with organizational level governance and industry level standards and regulatory requirements.
setting up development processes that incorporateprocess oriented practices for responsible ai systems.this situates algorithmic considerations and organiza tional policies within the end to end software develop ment life cycle making the software engineering processthe connecting thread of responsible ai.
building responsible ai by design into ai systemsthrough system level architectural styles patterns andtechniques.
this values larger scale reuse and system level thinking making software architecture and designthe centre of the social technical ecosystem.as the first step on this roadmap we have released a setof initial governance process and design patterns to reflect the interconnections including connecting with therealms beyond software engineering.in addition ai itself may play a key role in advancing re sponsible ai engineering methods.
ai can write code directly create intermediate software engineering artifacts for betterverification explain models to human engineers and monitorother ai systems.
ai generated ethical trade offs can also helpclarify human ethical requirements or even shed new light onour own ethical thinking.we are shifting from explicitly designing and buildingfunctions into systems to generating systems by ai anddiscovering and validating emerging functions.
by thediscovery piece software engineering will also take on thespirit of science helping understand human intelligenceand human ai symbiosis.
this is an exciting time for softwareengineering.
