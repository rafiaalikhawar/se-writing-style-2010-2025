such pressures often make coordinating dependency updates and maintaining compatibilitybetweendependencyrequirementsacomplextask especially whenlotsofdependenciesareusedorwhen breakingchanges occur i.e.
changesthat requireusers torefactortheir code.additionally projects can face security vulnerabilities through their dependency supply chain including transitive dependencies where dependencies have dependencies of their own .
cross ecosystem studies of the presence of vulnerable dependencies have highlighted the importance of managing and updating dependencies .
becauseofthecomplexities ofdependencymanagement therehave been calls for documenting all dependencies in a software bill of materials sbom including a us executive order signed in may .1in short dependency management is a complex ongoing problem that has been studiedindi erentways.

open source sustainability.
nearly everything we do on screens from checking email and stock prices to online shopping and reading the news relies on and could not function without open source software .
in npm inc. estimated that on average of the code on modern web applications comes from npm .
while di cult to quantify the economic value of open source is alsosigni cant someestimatethatin2010open sourcesoftware produced billion euros of economic value in europe alone .
nonetheless despitethewidespreadrelianceonopensource thereliabilityandcontinuedmaintenanceofmanyoftheseprojectsisno sure thing this is a key motivation for open source sustainability research.

research supporting the onboarding of contributors has studied the onboarding process the role of sca olding mentoring and social ties and the characteristicsofcontributors who succeeded inbecomingpart ofthe core team .
research on retaining core contributors focused on why they disengage the role of maintaining a healthy community to reduce that risk and the impact of disengagement on the health and survival probability of aproject .
research has also studied the impacts of project and ecosystemcharacteristicsandorganizationalstructuresonopen source projects including the e ect of codes of conduct how badges can be used as a signal to attract new contributors how project and ecosystem characteristics impact maintainer retention and project activity the maintainability and sustainability of projects and the impact of commercialinvolvement onopen sourcedevelopment .
takingastepback wecanobservethatalmostallsustainability research focuses on studying various factors characteristics and phenomena that support the goal of keeping particular projects or ecosystems alive and actively maintained .

they explained that if the software is complete does not interact with other software and does not become insecure itself then the abandonment is not necessarily problematic.

some forms of preparationfocusonmakingiteasiertoidentifyabandonmentand othersfocusonmakingiteasiertodealwithabandonmentwhen it occurs.
additionally some forms of preparation are one time actions whereas othersare reoccurringactions.
amethodofpreparationthatwashighlyregardedandseemedto be relatively successful was minimizing localizing dependency use p2a intheproject scodebase.thisoftenmeant explicitly designing the implementation at the time of dependency adoption in a way that made dependency replacement easier by minimizing the points of contact using an abstraction layer .
for example as much as possible we try to bu er dependencies with abstractionssothatspeci cimplementationdetailsofathird partylibrary aren t scattered through the whole application in di cult ways p7 .
someintervieweespreparedbydirectly monitoringthedependency p2a tokeepaneyeonhowthingsaregoing oftenbylookingatprojectcharacteristicssimilartothosedescribed in sec.

for example we are always conscious of the dependencies and looking closely at them p2a .by remaining aware of the state of the dependency and its community interviewees place themselves in a better position to identify early signals of abandonment whichgivesthemanopportunitytoactbeforeabandonmentand any resulting concrete problems occur if they so choose.
some also prepared by being active and informed members of the community p2b and building relationships with dependencymaintainers p1 oftensotheycouldnoticeissues earlier or have people to reach out to if abandonment occurs.
this often involves at least semi frequent interactions with dependency maintainers or other community members to stay informed of the goings oninthe project and aware of any potentialissues orwarning signs of something like abandonment being on the horizon.

key insights interviewees who prepared for the risk of dependency abandonment often did so by localizing the use of dependencies in their code base by building abstractionlayersorbyremainingawareofthegoings oninthe dependency itself andthe broadercommunity.

solutions to abandonment oncedependencyabandonmentwasidenti ed nearlyallinterviewees deployed some sort of solution to deal with abandonment.
the most common solution was switching to a better maintained alternative p1 .
intervieweesfoundthesealternativesinvariousways.sometimes an issue or pr on the abandoned project included a discussion recommending an alternative.
for example actually i can see now on the is the project dead issue there s someone saying use alternative project whichwasthealternativethatweendedupgoingto p17 .in othercases intervieweesusedsearchenginessuchas duckduckgo forumwebsitessuchas redditorstackover ow packagemanagers such aspypi or even specialized open source library recommendationwebsitessuchas libhunt.com to ndpointerstoalternatives.
anotherintervieweedescribedhowanautomatedwarningabout an abandoned dependency included a list of alternatives which wasusedto selectareplacement p32 .
often the goal was not just to nd another project that had the samefunctionality butthatalsohasasimilarapitomakemigration easierandminimizedisruptiontotheircodebase.forexample one interviewee found an alternative with essentially the same api so the migration entailed basically just changing the namespace on whatweimportthat functionality from p32 .
another common solution was to fork or vendor code p1 2b fromtheabandoneddependency vendoring means incorporating 3rd party software directly into a code base .
for example sometimes we vendor some code which means we ll just directly copy the code and re license it into thepackageitself p1 .adrawbackofthissolutionisthatitcan increase the amount of code a developer is responsible for maintainingovertime.asone interviewee putit ithinkthat slikethe lastthingthatanyonewantstodo justdevelopityourself because thenyou wouldhaveto become theone that maintainsit p31 .
most of the time when interviewees forked a project it was used as a personal fork acting as their own stable version with which they could control and maintain compatibility.
only one intervieweeexplicitlydiscussedmakingahardforkthattheyadvertisedas an alternative for othersto use p30 .
seeking support from others p4 by reaching out to the maintainers or others in the community provided insights into the situation and what potentialsolutions or next steps could be.
in several cases fellow community members had already posted bug xes or pointers to alternative dependencies intheabandoneddependency or createdblog posts explaininghowtomigratetoanalternative.forexample the rst we guredoutis youknow gothroughtheissuelistand seewhat kindofissues peopleare having andif it ssimilarissues i try to talk to them to gure out what the exact xes are and stu like that p10 .
others contribute to the dependency p2a byreachingout tothe maintainer about helpingorproviding maintenance support.
in some cases the old maintainers would respond after several months and in other cases this was notasuccessfulsolutionbecausetheydidnotreceivearesponse.
for example i and others were reaching out to the original maintainer trying to see if we could take it over and he was basically non responsive.
he had originally posted on twitter if you look at that discussion he was looking for a maintainer.
but he just dropped o themap p30 .
another solution used by some was trying to help nd new maintainers p4 by supporting community e orts to recruit new maintainers to take over.
this was often accomplished through discussionsonthe abandonedproject s issue tracker.for example i dsaymystrategyhasbeentoreachouttofolksintheissue tracker and encourage them to rename the project and get something up and running and o er myself for testing if somebody works on it.
so at this point i m just monitoring the situation and trying to encourage others to stepup and workonit p25 .

nudging potential volunteers.
where relevant characteristics of group members are visible nudging people who are in a better position to volunteer and have lower volunteering costs can be an e ective way to encourage creating the public good .
for example a bot could nudge developers who already created an active fork by suggesting they advertise it on the abandoned dependency project.

facilitating and encouraging group discussion.
in general incorporating communication into coordination games tends to improve outcomes and facilitate coordination .
facilitating and encouraging communication between agents increases transparency and awareness of the choices others are making givingpotentialvolunteersmorecompleteinformation thus allowing them to make more educated decisions about whether to volunteer .
this suggests that by improving transparency about what others who face the same abandoned dependency have done or plan to do developers are able to make more informed decisions themselves.
