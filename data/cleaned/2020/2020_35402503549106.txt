existing studies show the evolutionary behaviors of social communities can effectively be described using patterns including split shrink merge expand emerge and extinct.
however existing pattern based approaches are limited in supporting quantitative analysis and are potentially problematic for using the patterns in a mutually exclusive manner when describing community evolution.
in this work we propose that different patterns can occur simultaneously between every pair of communities during the evolution just in different degrees.
four entropy based indices are devised to measure the degree of community split shrink merge and expand respectively which can provide a comprehensive and quantitative measure of community evolution in dsns.
the indices have properties desirable to quantify community evolution including monotonicity and bounded maximum and minimum values that correspond to meaningful cases.
they can also be combined to describe more patterns such as community emerge and extinct.
we conduct studies with real world oss projects to evaluate the validity of the proposed indices.
the results suggest the proposed indices can effectively capture community evolution and are consistent with existing approaches in detecting evolution patterns in dsns with an accuracy of .
.
the results also show that the indices are useful in predicting oss team productivity with an accuracy of .
.
in summary the proposed approach is among the first to quantify the degree of community evolution with respect to different patterns which is promising in supporting future research and applications about dsns and oss development.

https introduction building and maintaining healthy communities around open source software oss projects is crucial because of the socio technical nature of oss development .
cross disciplinary research on developer social networks dsns that emerge from the developers communication and cooperation activities in oss repositories has been conducted by scholars from various fields ever since the early days of the oss movement .
supported by rich empirical evidences it is now widely accepted that the social aspects of oss communities have a strong correlation with and are important indicators of oss projects productivity success and survivability .
while a number of research is about the statistics and patterns of static dsns snapshots there is a series of work that pay special attention to the evolution of dsns around oss projects over time .
by understanding the evolution of dsns we can not only retrospectively reveal the status of a dsn in a given snapshot but also predict the future trends of a dsn based on a comprehensive view of its evolution history .
given the importance of social aspects in oss development as discussed above and because oss development is a nature product of evolution in this work we study the problem of measuring the evolution of social communities around oss projects quantitatively to support in depth understanding of the socio technical aspects of oss development.
esec fse november singapore singapore liang wang ying li jierui zhang and xianping tao existing approaches to study community and network evolution can be categorized into two classes which we refer to as networklevel statistics andcommunity level patterns .
the first class of work uses sequences of statistical metrics over series of temporallyaligned snapshots of social networks to quantify their evolution.
frequently adopted metrics include network diameter shortest path between nodes node betweenness modularity hierarchy centrality etc .
while most of the above metrics measure properties of social networks on a gross level a natural phenomenon in social networks is that interacting individuals form complex structures organized in communities1 .
understanding the communities inside dsns can provide valuable insights about software development.
for instance conway s law suggests that a system s architecture reflects the communication structure of the organization designs it .
although some metrics such as clustering coefficient group degree centrality group betweenness centrality etc are related to measuring substructures or communities in social networks these network level statistics are less expressive in revealing the structure and evolution of communities in dsns.
different from the above work the second class of approaches take the community perspective to uncover the evolution patterns of social networks.
six patterns including growth expand contraction shrink merge split birth emerge and death extinct are used to describe the evolutionary behaviors of communities inside social networks .
these patterns are promising in bringing insights about oss development for corresponding to the evolution of oss projects and members activities .
however the existing pattern based approaches often assign a single pattern to describe the evolution of a community which are limited for several reasons.
first the evolution of a community can hardly be described by a single pattern.
for example a community can expand andmerge simultaneously with new members and members from other communities joining it.
choosing either pattern can lead to information loss in the above case.
in addition matching communities detected in different time steps to identify them as a single evolving community before pattern assignment is not a trivial task .
second the nominal patterns are promising in describing community evolution qualitatively but are limited in supporting quantitative analysis.
third these patterns are restricted to describe the evolution of a single community.
it is difficult to extend the concepts to the network level which is often desirable to gain a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of dsns.
our idea to tackle the above limitations can be described as the community evolution patterns can happen simultaneously between all pairs of communities in consecutive time steps only in different degrees.
following this idea we propose in this paper to quantify community evolutionary behaviors comprehensively by calculatinghow much the communities expand shrink merge and split simultaneously.
as introduced in sec.
the calculation is done by first building a community member migration matrix which captures the dynamics of communities detected in sec.
.
based on the matrix we devise indices based on information entropy to measure the degree of community evolution with respect to the 1for the rest of the paper a community inside a social network refers to a group of interconnected members of the network if not specified otherwise.
refer to sec.
.
for details about the terms used in this paper.four patterns above.
community extinct andemerge are represented by special combinations of the indices.
with this approach the evolution of a community is described by four indices in each step which addresses the challenge of finding a unique most appropriate pattern for community evolution.
it is worth noting that our approach can detect community evolution patterns that are consistent with existing work with a simple set of rules as introduced later.
we present the properties of the indices including the monotonicity and the upper and lower bounds to show that the indices can correctly reveal complex real world community evolutionary behaviors quantitatively.
the advantages of the proposed approach compared to existing work are as follows.
first our approach provides comprehensive information about the evolution of communities.
instead of assigning a single pattern to describe the evolution of a community we use four indices simultaneously to assess the degree of community evolution with respect to the patterns in each step.
recall the example above with the proposed indices we can express the fact that a community is both merging and expanding with degrees specified by the merge and expand indices respectively.
second the indices enable quantitative analysis for community evolution analysis.
in sec.
.
we demonstrate to perform regression analysis with the indices.
we also show in sec.
.
that it is feasible to aggregate the community level indices to describe the overall evolutionary behaviors of communities at the network level which can support quantitative analysis of community evolution at different scales.
in summary while exiting approaches can express community evolution qualitatively with semantic rich patterns the proposed approach takes a step forward to provide more comprehensive and quantitative analysis results which can help oss volunteers and maintainers to gain insight about the current status of oss communities compare between different projects community evolution trends track a project s community evolution over time quantitatively and perform quantitative analysis.
to the best of our knowledge this is the first work to quantify community evolution in dsns with respect to different patterns.
we conduct empirical studies using real world data collected from thirty two projects hosted on github to evaluate the validity and usefulness of the proposed community evolution indices.
more specifically we validate the construct validity of the proposed indices in terms of concurrent and discriminant validity criteria .
the results for concurrent validity suggest that the community evolution patterns detected with the proposed indices is consistent with the ones detected following an existing approach with an accuracy of .
by analyzing the properties of the indices and by calculating the spearman s correlation coefficients of the indices we find that the indices are capable in measuring different aspects of community evolution.
we further demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed indices by studying the correlation between the measured community evolution with oss project team productivity measured by the count of commits .
the results obtained from regression analysis with linear mixed effects models suggest that the indices are good predictors of team productivity with an accuracy of .

2overview of the proposed approach this section presents an overview of the proposed approach.
.
terminology we first introduce the concepts and terms used in this paper.
anoss project orrepository refers to a single repository hosted on oss platforms such as github e.g.
tensorflow tensorflow2.
in comparison large projects e.g.
the mozilla or gnome projects that include multiple sub projects developed together are considered as ecosystems orsuper repositories following .
in this work we focus on community evolution on the project level.
adeveloper social network dsn around an oss project include the participants of the project and their relationships which is typically modeled using a graph model extracted from various sources such as mailing lists version repositories issue and bug tracking systems etc.
acommunity inside a dsn means a group of members in the dsn with strongly interconnected links or share similar features and actions which is also termed as a cluster a an emerging team or a social group in the literature.
we do not use the term to refer to oss communities in the broad sense e.g.
the apache community studied in .
the evolutionary behaviors of communities studied in this paper correspond to the six community evolution patterns studied in which is different from the general concept of patterns of community evolution used in .
.
overview as shown in fig.
the processing pipeline proposed in this work involves three steps.
first as shown in fig.
a and as introduced in sec.
and sec.
given an oss repository we retrieve publicly available data about the conversations correspond to issues and pull requests from the ghtorrent data set and the github graphql api3.
participants of the conversations are recorded to extract the joint discussion relationships.
the records are used to build dsns and to perform community evolution analysis in subsequent steps.
next as shown in fig.
b and presented in sec.
we segment the records with a siding window and build snapshots of dsns from the segments using weighted undirected graphs.
community detection is then performed by applying an extension of the clauset newman moore cnm algorithm for weighted graphs to the snapshots.
finally correspond to fig.
c we measure the evolutionary behaviors including the split shrink merge and expand of the communities detected in consecutive steps with the information entropy based indices proposed in sec.
.
the index values are aggregated to quantify community evolution at the network level before we perform our analysis in sec.
.
dsn and community detection in this work we use a weighted undirected graph g v e u w to model the structure of a dsn where a vertex vi vrepresents a user and an edge ei j erepresents social interactions between usersviandvj.
a positive real valued weight ui uis assigned to each vertex vifollowing eq.
to quantify the user s activeness.
and a weight wi j wis assigned to each edge ei jfollowing eq.
to quantify the strength of social interactions between the users connected by the edge.
the type of social interaction studied in this paper is the joint discussion relationship between users on 159esec fse november singapore singapore liang wang ying li jierui zhang and xianping tao oss platforms such as github.
platform users can post issues and pull requests to an oss repository to ask questions and making contributions .
they can also provide responses by leaving comments under posted issues and pull requests.
we use the term a conversation to refer to the collection of the initial body and all the comments to a single issue or pull request.
there is an edge ei j between two users viandvj if they join the same conversation.
.
construct dsn snapshots we construct a series of dsn snapshots from the conversations of an oss repository.
.
.
data segmentation.
given a series of temporally ordered conversations obtained from a project s repository d d1 d2 dn wheredi ti vi i n records the creation time ti and the set of participants4viof thei th record we apply a non overlapping sliding window of length to divide dinto a series of segments s s1 s2 st .
thet th segment in sinclude conversations created in the t th window i.e.
st di t1 t ti t1 t j t wheret1is the creation time of d1.
.
.
build local dsns from data segments.
for each segment st s we build its corresponding local dsn gl t vl t el t ul t wl t by lettingvl tto include all the participants of conversations in st andel tto include all the joint discussion relationships between the users in vl t respectively.
there is an edge between user viand vjif there is at least one conversation dk stthat both users are participants of dk.ul tandwl tinclude the weights of users and edges in the local dsn which are calculated as follows.
for each edge ei j el t there is a weight wi j wl tthat quantifies the strength of interactions between user viandvj.
letcnti j be the count of conversations both viandvjparticipate in segment st we assign the weight wi jas follows.
wi j ln cnti j we take the natural logarithm of counts to prevent large counts to overwhelm small ones.
from eq.
we have wi j 0ifcnti j andwi j 0ifcnti j .
note we always have cnti j 0ifi j. further we assign a weight ui ul tfor each user vi vl tto quantify the user s activeness in the dsn as follows.
ui ln vl t j 1wi j where vl t is the number of users in segment st andwi jis as defined in eq.
.
intuitively a user with a large weight is a user who actively interactions with many other users and is considered important in the dsn.
the minimal weight of a user viisui 0if the user does not communicate with any other user in the segment.
with the above approach we can extract a series of temporally ordered local dsns gl gl gl gl t from the segments s. 4the participants of a conversation include its author and all of the commenting users.
in this work we omit the duration of conversations and use the creation time to mark the time of a conversation and all the joint discussion relations between its participants.
future work can increase the temporal resolution by building dsn segments using the time of each comment inside conversations when necessary.
.
.
dsn snapshots with aggregated local dsns.
while it is possible to perform subsequent community detection and evolution analysis with the local dsns above it is not trivial to decide the optimal window size for segmentation .
a large window e.g.
from several months to a year allows us to take a comprehensive snapshot of the dsn with rich data.
however it keeps us from performing fine grained community evolution analysis due to the large time gap between consecutive windows.
on the other hand a small window allows us to perform fine grained community evolution analysis.
but a short window may cover too few data to generate a useful snapshot.
to support fine grained analysis with sufficient data we generate dsn snapshots by aggregating multiple local dsns built from one week s data.
we empirically set each snapshot to contain twelve local dsns to cover data in three months.
we assign more credits to recent data than early data in the snapshot by multiplying a decaying factor to the edge weights of the local dsns.
let gl t ibe theithlocal dsn being included in the snapshot for time t we decay its edge weights wl t i with a factor i where is heuristically set toe .
with the above approach we can obtain a series of dsn snapshots g g1 g2 gt by aggregating local dsns.
.
detect communities in dsn snapshots the communities studied in this work are groups of users with close and intensive interactions among each other in a snapshot of dsn.
given the t th snapshot of a dsn gt vt et ut wt g we adopt the extension of the clauset newman moore cnm greedy modularity maximization algorithm to detect the communities within it.
developed from the traditional cnm algorithm for unweighted graphs the extended version of cnm performs community detection on weighted graphs using the strength of connections between nodes indicated by the edge weights.
the result of community detection for gtis a set of nonoverlapping communities ct ct ct ct n wherect i vt contains a subset of users in the social network with strong internal joint discussion relationships5.
communities involve only a single member are removed.
by applying community detection to all the snapshots in g we obtain a series of evolving communities over time c c1 c2 ct ct .
in the next section we propose metrics to measure community evolution in c. community evolution indices based on the temporally ordered series of communities cdetected in the above section this section presents the process and metrics proposed to measure community evolution.
.
community member migration matrix given two consecutive sets of communities in c e.g.
ctandct we compute a community member migration matrix to quantify member migration between the communities as shown in fig.
a .
letn ct andm ct be the number of communities in ct andct without loss of generality we assume n 1andm 5this work focuses on quantifying community evolution based on community detection results.
the proposed indices can also be applied to overlapping communities detected with methods like the clique percolation method proposed in .

twonull communities null t 1andnull t are added to ct andctto include members not involved in these communities.
the null t 1community involves members of a community in ctwho leave the project in time t i.e.

entropy based community evolution indices for a single community in this section we propose to measure the evolution of a single community between consecutive time steps i.e.

while existing works describe community evolution with six patterns including split shrink extinct merge expand andemerge we omit the extinct andemerge patterns because they are special cases of community evolution studied in this work as discussed in sec.

.
.
more importantly different from existing works that assign a single pattern to each matched pair of communities we propose that all the evolutionary patterns can be assigned to a community simultaneously during its evolution with a numerical degree assigned to each pattern.
as a result we can assess the evolution of dsn communities comprehensively and quantitatively without requiring to find the match between prior and post communities.
technical details are as follows.

1shrink index even distribution random distribution even distribution random distribution random distribution figure curves of the split and shrink indices under different conditions specified by m i and i j. the even distribution corresponds to case i j m j m. the random distribution is obtained by randomly assigning i j s values.
clearly we have m j 1 i j .
and we can calculate the information entropy of the normalized weight vector by hct i m j 1 i jlog2 i j withmfixed the entropyhct iis upper bounded by the following maximum entropy obtained when i j m j m h t t log2 m intuitively hct imeasures the degree of ct i s members spread into different communities excluding null t in the next step.
and h t t h ct imeasures the degree of ct i s members gather to a single community in the next step.
both hct iandh t t h ct i are equal or above zero.
based on the entropy in eq.
we compute community ct i ssplit andshrink indices as follows.
the split index ofct i denoted asi ct i measures the degree of separation of its members into concrete communities detected in the next step which is calculated as i ct i i hct i where iis defined in eq.
.
the shrink index ofct i denoted asi ct i measures the degree of its members move to the null t 1community in the next step i ct i i h t t i ct i i where iis defined as follows to guarantee that the shrink index is always positive when m 1and i .
i .5 i m otherwise.

properties of the split and shrink indices.
fig.
illustrates the curves of the indices under varying conditions.
the proposed split index i ct i and shrink index i ct i have the following properties that are desirable when measuring community evolution.
without loss of generality we assume m .
p .i ct iandi ct iarestrictly monotonic increasing functions of m given i and i j m j m. intuitively the property states that when a fixed portion of members in community ct ileave the project i.e.
ifixed and the remaining members of ct iwho stay in the project migrate evenlyto the communities detected in the next step i.e.
i j m j m the split and shrink indices increase with the increasing number of communities detected in the next step i.e.
m .
there are two special cases that we always have i ct i 0andi ct i given anym when i and i respectively.
the two cases mean that a community cannot split i ct i if all of its members leave the project i and cannot shrink i ct i if none of its members leave i regardless the number of communities detected in the next step i.e.
for any m .
p .i ct i i ct iis astrictly monotonic decreasing increasing function of i respectively for i givenm and member migration distribution i j j mwithhct i .
intuitively this property states that the split shrink index decreases increases with the increasing portion of users who leave the project i.e.
i respectively.
for the split index when m or only one of the i j s is one with rest of the i j s equal to zero we havei ct i i becausehct i as discussed later in p .
this case means that a community is not regarded as splitting if all of its remaining members migrate to a single community in the next step regardless the amount of members who leave the project.
for the shrink index i ct i we guarantee that i ct iis a strictly monotonic increasing function of ifor i 0andm 1by introducing the term as defined in eq.
.
p .
givenmand i the maximum split index i ct i i h t t 1is obtained when the members of ct imigrate to the communities detected in the next step with a even distribution i.e.
when we have i j m j m. and the minimum split index i ct i 0is obtained when m 1or all the members of ct iwho stay in the project migrate to a single community in the next step i.e.
there exists a j th community in time t 1that i j 1and i j j j resulting inhct i 0andi ct i .
p .
givenm 1and i the maximum shrink index i ct i ih t t 1is obtained when the corresponding split index is minimized i.e.
all stayed members of community ct imigrate to a single community in the next step.
and the minimum shrink index i ct i 2 ih t t 1is obtained when the members of ct imigrate evenly to communities in time t .
for the special case of m the shrink index is only determined by i. from properties p 3andp 4we can further see that given m the community split and shrink indices vary in the same range given byi ct i log21 m andi ct i log21 m with different values of iand the distribution of member migration specified by i j j m. as a result it is feasible for us to draw meaningful results such as the community shows a stronger trend of splitting shrinking by directly comparing the values of community split and shrink indices.
the above properties are important in understanding how the indices vary with the change of underlying community structures showing that the indices are intuitively correct in describing community evolution.
the proof is omitted in this paper due to page limits which can be found in our online material6.

the merge and expand indices of ct j.next to measure community evolution on community ct j s side as shown in fig.
c we develop the merge andexpand indices ofct jfollowing a similar framework as described above.
themerge index ofct j denoted asi ct j measures the degree of its members that come from different source communities in the previous time step which is calculated as follows.
i ct j j hct j where jandhct jare defined in eq.
and eq.
respectively.
theexpand index ofct j denoted asi ct j measures the degree of its members emerge from null tin the previous step as follows.
i ct j j h t t i ct j j where jis as defined similar to ias follows.
j .5 j n otherwise.
the entropy values in the above equations are computed by h t t log2 n andhct j n i 1 i jlog2 i j where i j i j n i 1 i jis the normalized weights.
the merge andexpand indices have similar properties as split andshrink respectively.
we omit the details to keep the paper concise.
.
.
community extinction and emergence.
with the above indices community extinction and emerges are two special combinations of index values as follows the extinction of a community ct ihappens if all of its members leave the project and migrate to null t which leads to the case that i 1andhct i .
in this case the shrink index takes the maximum value of i ct i h t t i7.
and the split index takes the minimum value of i ct i .
the emergence of a new community ct jhappens if all its members are from null t in which case we have j and hct j .
in this case the expand index takes the maximum value ofi ct j h t t j. and the merge index takes the minimum value of i ct j .
there are more combinations of the index values that form meaningful cases which we leave for our future studies.
.
aggregate indices for all communities following the above process for each community we can obtain indices that quantify its degree of split and shrink with respect to the next step and its degree of merge andexpand with respect to the previous step.
we calculate the aggregated indices for the four patterns across all communities in the snapshot by taking the weighted average of the communities indices where the weight for a community is the sum of node weights in the community over the total weight of nodes in all communities.
we can then obtain 7wheni ct itakes the maximum value we have i .5ifm and i 0if m .
similar for the value of jin the case of emergence .four aggregated indices that measure the overall snapshot level community evolution for each time step.
empirical studies in this section we conduct empirical studies to evaluate the validity and usefulness of the proposed community evolution measures.

preliminaries .

data set.
as summarized in table we collect a data set involving thirty two oss projects on github to conduct the studies.
the projects are randomly selected from a candidate set of popular with stars projects with sufficient data with conv.
that cover different topics including programming language e.g.
rails rails social networks e.g.
sferik twitter database e.g.
apache couchdb mobile e.g.
prinzhorn skrollr etc.
among the projects twelve inactive projects determined following the process in are included to cover projects in different stages.
for each project we retrieve data starting from its earliest record on the platform to the end of may from two sources the ghtorrent database and the github graphql api8.
the data for issue and pull request discussions are extracted for community detection and calculating community evolution indices.
we also retrieve the commit history of the repositories to support correlation analysis between community evolution and team productivity.

.
research questions and organization.
the studies are designed to answer two research questions as follows.
rq .
validity.
are the indices capable to quantify community evolution in dsns?
we evaluate the construct validity of the proposed indices with the concurrent and discriminant validity criteria following existing work and guides .
as defined in construct validity is the extent to which your measure or instrument actually measures what it is theoretically supposed to measure .
in this work we aim at showing the proposed indices are effective in capturing and quantifying community evolutionary behaviors of dsns around oss projects.
first we adopt the concurrent validity criterion to validate the proposed indices.
concurrent validity assesses the ability of a measure to distinguish between groups it should theoretically be able to distinguish between .
in this work we compare the categorical evolution patterns detected following an existing approach with the patterns detected using the proposed indices.
next we evaluate the discriminant validity of the indices which requires the dimensions to be independent or orthogonal to each other.
based on the properties of the indices discussed in sec.
.
.
and by further evaluating the discriminant validity of the measures we aim at showing that the proposed indices are capable of measuring different aspects of community evolution.
unfortunately we are unable to assess the convergent validity of the proposed indices because to the best of our knowledge this is the first work that quantifies the degree of community evolution that include different evolution patterns simultaneously.
besides validity we also study the usefulness of the indices in predicting oss development with the following research question.

usefulness.
are the proposed indices correlated to team productivity?
we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed indices by studying their correlations with project teams productivity measured by the count of commits using regression analysis.
details of the studies and their results are as follows.
.
concurrent validity we evaluate the concurrent validity of the proposed indices by comparing the community evolution pattern detection results of our approach and existing approaches.
we adopt the process proposed in to detect community evolution patterns in dsns which serve as the ground truth for evaluation.
more specifically for consecutive time steps tandt we first calculate the similarity betweeneach pair of communities detected in the two dsn snapshots.
the generation of dsn snapshots and detection of communities are the same as introduced in sec.
to conduct a fair comparison.
slightly different from the original algorithm the size of a community is defined as the sum of its members weights instead of the count of its members.
the similarity of two communities is the sum of weights of their common nodes over the smaller value of the two communities total weights.
we take the threshold of .
proposed in the original work to perform community matching.
based on the matching results we adopt rules in table to determine the evolution patterns for each community.
we modify the rule for determining community shrink by comparing a community s size with its matching community in the next step to make the results comparable with ours.
with these rules for each community we can assign two evolution patterns to it one to describe how it evolves towards the next step which can be extinct split orshrink the other to describe how it evolves from the previous step which includes emerge merge and expand .
an undefined pattern is added to label cases that are not included in the existing set of rules.
for community evolution pattern detection using the indices proposed in this paper we simply compare the index values to determine the patterns of community split shrink merge and expand as shown in table .
for a community say community ct i to extinct the ideal case is that its split index is zero i ct i and its shrink index takes the maximum value i ct i h t t i as discussed in sec.
.
.
.
however this condition is too stringent to effectively detecting community extinction in real world data.
as a result we relax the condition as shown in table that label a community to extinct when its split index is close to zero and its shrink index is close to the maximum value.
the same relaxation also applies to the rule to detect community emerge .
the confusion matrix that compares the ground truth and our detection results is shown in fig.
a .
the overall accuracy of our approach involving all six patterns and the undefined pattern is .
.
because the undefined pattern is not clearly defined in existing work we also evaluate the accuracy by removing theundefined label i.e.
by removing the last column and row in the confusion matrix .
without the undefined label the overall accuracy is .

this is because there is a threshold of .
to filter out matching but less similar communities in the existing approach.
as a result the ground truth is biased to shrink and expand compared to our approach which does not perform filtering.
since there is no evidence showing that the threshold of .
is the optimal one we repeat the test by setting a threshold of .
to increase the chance of community matching when obtaining the ground truth.
as shown in fig.
b we can observe that the detection accuracy with and without the undefined pattern increases to .
and .
respectively.
the above results suggest that with a simple set of rules the proposed indices can accurately distinguish between different patterns of community evolution which are consistent with the results obtained following the existing approach .
we conclude that the proposed indices for community evolution are valid with respect to the concurrent validity criterion.
.
discriminant validity we calculate the spearman s correlation coefficients of each pair of the indices given a project.
spearman s correlation coefficients are selected over the pearson s correlation coefficients because we find that the indices do not always follow normal distributions.
we adopt the rule of thumb in to interpret the correlation coefficients i.e.
thervalues as summarized in table .
it is worth noting that a strong correlation alone does not invalidate the design of the proposed measure because the correlations between community evolution indices are largely determined by the members activities in real world oss repositories.
the phenomenon we would like to observe in this study is that whether there are occasions that the indices are weakly correlated in the real world.
combining the results in this study and the properties of the indices as discussed in sec.
we aim at showing that the proposed indices are measuring different aspects of community evolution.table pairwise correlation of the aggregated indices spearman s correlation coefficient .

over half of the projects only show a moderate correlation between a single pair of indices.
as summarized in the last row of table most of the pairs show a weak but significant correlation with r values below .
.
the merge andexpand indices show a moderate correlation with a rvalue of .
which is at the borderline between a moderate and weak correlation.
an interesting discovery made from the results is that the split andmerge indices show a moderate correlation for most of projects and even a strong correlation for five projects.
the overall correlation coefficient between split and merge is .
suggesting a positive moderate correlation which is statistically significant.
recall the way we calculate community split andmerge and the results of concurrent validity presented above it is clear that the two indices are capable of measuring different patterns of community evolution.
the correlation between split andmerge is a natural result emerges from the issue and pull request discussion activities of the community members.
a possible explanation to this positive correlation is that real world communities often regroup themselves in oss projects studied in this paper.
it is our future work to inspect more patterns of community evolution based on the proposed indices.
.
correlation with team productivity the last study demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed indices in predicting oss project teams productivity.
we operationalize oss team productivity by the count of commits pushed to the repository following existing work .
we perform regression analysis with the linear mixed effects models lmms to study the correlation between the indices and team productivity.
compared to simple linear models lmms allow random effects to be included in the analysis.
in this study the random effects are the effects caused by the differences of oss projects.
for each snapshot extracted following sec.
.
we obtain a sample consists of six variables as follows.
first the outcome variable is the count of commits in a snapshot.
second the aggregated indices for community split shrink merge and expand are used as the independent variables.
log transformation is performed to the above variables to stabilize variance and reduce heteroscedasticity .
finally the project name is included in each sample as the indicator for random effects.
the results are shown in table .
the variance inflation factors vifs for predictors including split shrink merge and expand arebelow .
which are well below the suggested threshold of in existing guidelines suggesting that there is no strong collinearity among the predictors.
the conditional r squared r2c .
is greater than the marginal r squared r2m .
suggesting that the adoption of lmms for regression analysis is suitable.
the results suggest after log transformation all the indices show a significant correlation with team productivity.
three indices including split shrink and merge are positively correlated with team productivity.
it is surprising to find that expand shows a negative effect.
by further observing the coefficients and sum sq.
we can find that split andmerge are more important predictors than shrink andexpand .
a possible explanation to the effects of split andmerge is that members of communities with high degrees of split andmerge are actively regrouping themselves to join issue and pull request discussions which results in productive teams.
and a potential reason for the negative effects of expand is that team performance are known to be influenced by many factors beyond team size e.g.
team diversity developer synchronization etc.
growth in team size potentially increases the communication and coordination costs which reduce the working efficiency.
the above results together with the results in sec.
.
inspire us to explore different combinations of the indices as meaningful patterns and to conduct more studies to understand the effects of community evolution in team productivity and performance in our future work.
in summary the regression model achieves an accuracy i.e.
the correlation coefficient between the actual and the predicted value of the outcome of .
suggesting that the aggregated indices of community evolution are useful predictors of team productivity.
a potential threat to the robustness of the results is that non normality and heteroscedasticity of the residuals are detected.
we consult the literature and conclude that the above results are trustworthy after carefully inspecting the q q diagram.
threats to validity we present a discussion the threats to validity as follows.
internal validity.
we conduct a data driven approach to reveal the correlation between community evolution and oss development such as team productivity.
however there are many other factors that are known to affect or characterize the operation of oss teams .
as a result the conclusions made in this paper do not fully explain how oss teams behave or imply a causal relationship.
instead the proposed indices should be used as useful supplements to existing measures of dsn and community evolution.
external validity.
we select thirty two projects that cover various topics and status in our study.
however the collection of projects is small compared to the number of projects hosted on github and other platforms.
the conclusions made in this paper may not generalize well to other projects.
it is our future work to include more projects in our studies.
construct validity.
the indices are designed on top of the wellestablished theory of information entropy to measure community evolution with clear properties about how their values respond to parameter changes.
we evaluate the construct validity of the proposed indices in terms of concurrent and discriminant validity.
we plan to seek more criteria to validate our approach in the future.
166quantifying community evolution in developer social networks esec fse november singapore singapore related work from a general perspective this work belongs to the series of research about the social aspects of oss development started since the beginning of the oss movement .
in this section we introduce work closely related to this paper.
oss projects are developed and maintained by the collaborative efforts of oss contributors over channels such as mailing lists and on social coding platforms such as github and gitlab.
the interactions of oss contributors naturally generate social networks around oss projects which is refer to as the developer social networks dsns in existing literature .
different types of dsns including communication collaboration and hybrid networks have been extracted by mining developer mailing lists and oss repositories to study the properties and evolution of dsns.
the extracted dsns are often modeled as graphs .
in this work weighted undirected graphs are used to model dsns that reveal the communication structures of oss contributors based on which a series of indices are proposed to quantify the evolution of communities inside dsns.
it should be noted that the proposed approach can also be applied to dsns of other types.
technologies for social network analysis sna are applied to dsns to understand the properties the structures and the evolution of dsns.
readers can refer to for comprehensive surveys for social network and community analysis in dsns.
different from work that performs analysis to static dsns this work focuses on understanding the dynamic evolution of dsns over time.
many studies about dsn evolution are conducted by analyzing the changes and trend in series of dsn snapshots take over time .
network metrics such as network diameter shortest path between nodes node betweenness modularity hierarchy centrality clustering coefficient etc are adopted in existing work to assess the properties of dsns.
there are also metrics developed exclusively to measure software communities .
based on these metrics statistical and data mining technologies are applied to understand the evolution of dsns .
this work is related to the above work in that we propose indices to quantify the evolution of dsn communities which can support further analysis including but not limited to regression analysis and pattern detection as shown in our studies.
different from the above work that takes the network perspective this work takes the community perspective and analyzes the evolutionary behaviors of communities in dsns.
the patterns adopted in this paper that describe the evolutionary behaviors of dsn communities are originally proposed in which involve six patterns as introduced in the rest of the paper.
these patterns are shown to be promising in describing the evolution of communities in various types of social networks such as co authorship phone call and blog networks .
in the authors adopt these patterns to characterize community evolution in oss projects including firefox and bugzilla.
similar patterns are also adopted in to describe the evolution of dsns at the community level.
this work is closely related to the above work in that we also adopt the patterns as the basis to describe community evolution.
different from these approaches that assign a unique nominal pattern to a matched pair of communities in consecutivetime steps we quantify the degree of different patterns which can occur simultaneously during the evolution of the communities.
other differences of this work from the above work include community emerge andextinct are defined by combinations of the indices.
as a result we only include indices for four patterns as introduced in the paper and we do not require to match communities detected in different time steps to recognize them as a single evolving community which is a challenging task that can lead to biases if not treated with caution.
finally we note that the community evolution patterns studied in this work are about the patterns introduced above which are different from the general patterns of oss evolution in existing work which include studies that characterize the process of preferential attachment in oss developers when forming dsns or the stages of oss project evolution etc.
conclusion in this paper we present four entropy based indices to measure the degree of community evolutionary behaviors with respect to patterns including split shrink merge and expand to understand the evolution of dsns around oss projects.
this work bridges the gap between pattern based approaches which can provide meaningful insights about the evolution of dsns from the community perspective and metric based social network analysis which can support comprehensive and quantitative analysis.
the construct validity of the proposed indices are evaluated on a real world data set about the issue and pull request discussions in thirty two oss projects.
the results suggest the indices can accurately capture different patterns of community evolution by achieving a detection accuracy of .
compared to existing work and show weak and moderate correlations.
the results also show that the indices can accurately predict oss team productivity after log transformation with linear mixed effects models.
the proposed indices can be used and extended in many ways to support future studies.
for example we can use the indices to assess and predict the behavior and status of oss teams and projects e.g.
to assess the health of oss teams and to predict oss projects sustainability .
more patterns of community evolution can be developed based on combinations of the indices e.g.
community regroup as discussed in sec.
.
following the way we define community emerge and extinct .
we can also apply the proposed framework to other types of dsns e.g.
collaboration networks to understand their evolution.
