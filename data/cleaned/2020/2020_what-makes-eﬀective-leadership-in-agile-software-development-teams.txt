to find out this study examines agile leadership fromthe perspective of thirteen professionals who identify as agileleaders in different roles at ten different software develop ment companies of varying sizes.
data from semi structuredinterviews reveals that leadership is dynamically sharedamong team members engenders a sense of belongingto the team and involves balancing competing organiza tional cultures e.g.
balancing the new agile culture with theold milestone driven culture .

introductionleadership is one of the key drivers of organizational andproject success .
however agile software development in volves a cultural change that flattens the organi zational hierarchy de emphasizes managers and empowersteams .
one might therefore wonder whether there isleadership in agile teams at all.however management is different from leadership.
lead ership the articulation of an organizational vision introduction of major organizational change providing in spiration and dealing with highly stressful and troublesomeaspects of the external environments of organizations .
in contrast management consists of implementing thevision and strategy provided by leaders coordinating andstaffing the components of organizations administering theinfrastructures of organizations and handling the day to dayproblems that inevitably emerge in the process of strategyand policy implementation and ongoing organizational func tioning .put more simply leadership is getting group members toachieve the group s goals .leadership is a kindof work.even in self organized and self managed agile teams someone is leadership.
indeed many team memberscan dynamically share the leadership work of driving theteam toward its goals.research on leadership in software engineering is scarce.one notable exception is kalliamvakou et al.
s study of mi crosoft managers which concluded that we still don t knowwhat to look for in a great software engineering manager and how to further develop their skills to support the teamsthey manage .
a recent systematic review concludedthat agile leadership research needs further attention andthat more empirical studies are needed to better understandagile leadership in general .
this motivates the followingresearch question.research question what is the nature of leadership inagile software development from the perspective of pro fessionals who identify as agile leaders?here agile software development refers to both the ide ology laid out in the agile manifesto and the specificmethodologies and practices that embody that ideology e.g.extreme programming scrum dual track develop ment .to address this research question we conducted a qualita tive survey a series of interviews of thirteen self described24022022 ieee acm 44th international conference on software engineering icse icse may pittsburgh pa usalucas gren and paul ralphtable participant informationpid org.

next we describe existing re search related to our findings section and then integrateour findings with this work section .
section describesthe study s limitations and section concludes the paperwith some thoughts on future work.
methodthis section explains our approaches to data collection andanalysis.
since our research question concerns the perspec tives of agile leaders we employ a qualitative survey targeting professionals who identify as agile leaders.
.
participantsthe first author approached industry contacts with whomhe had no direct relationship or conflict of interest to recruitparticipants who identify as agile leaders e.g.
scrum mas ters founders agile coaches and various project managers .we focused on agile leaders rather than other professionalsbecause we wanted to understand the leaders perspective.of course comparing the leaders perspective with softwareprofessionals who explicitly do not identify as leaders is apotential extension.
we also wanted participants of differentages from both small and large companies and from differ ent countries to maximize sample diversity a key aspectof representativeness .
moreover we want to investigatecomponents of agile leadership that are similar across thesecontextual characteristics.more formally the recruitment criteria were employeeswho identify as agile leaders companies of different size mix of age and gender and mix of countries andnational cultures.nine men and four women between and years oldparticipated.
six participants were located in the usa threein brazil two in germany one in the uk and one in tunisia.all participants indicated that their teams use an agile ap proach.
participants roles industries organization sizes andmethodological contexts varied see table .
sap americainc.
mediated some of the contacts to the companies four ofthe participants were working on agile sap implementations meaning that they use agile methods in customizing an sapproduct for an organization .
all four also worked onother non sap projects.
.
data collectionthe first author completed minute semi structuredinterviews ten via teleconference three face to face.
he beganby introducing himself and the project getting permissionto record the interview and emphasizing how participants identities would be protected.
the complete interview guideis available in supplementary material see data availability .all interviews were transcribed word for word.
.
data analysisthe data was analyzed using atlas.ti1following the stepsrecommended by braun et al.
read each transcript highlight all statements broadly related to conceptunder investigation i.e.leadershipin this case sort the highlighted statements into categories name each category for each category re read all of its statements together reassess category cohesion and name1 makes effective leadership in agile software development teams?icse may pittsburgh pa usathe first author began by reading all the transcripts andtagging all quotations related to leadership in atlas.ti 176in all.
next quotations were grouped into categories and thecategories were iteratively refined.we applied the two concepts of saturation as described byaldiabat and navenec i.e.
codeandmeaningsaturation.we recognizedcodesaturation when no new codes emergedfrom the last few interviews.
after this step the second au thor audited the categories for coherence.
the categories werethen revisited and rephrased again.
we recognizedmeaningsaturation when we understood our themes well enough tosee their relationship to existing theories in social psychol ogy described in section .
we then integrated our cate gories back into existing theories see section .
the threethemes described next emerged from this synthesis of ourcategories with existing research.
tables showing examplesfor all emerging themes and categories are included in sup plementary material see data availability .
two categories communication and staffing problems were dropped asout of scope for this paper.
the reason they were out of scopewas that the participants who mentioned communicationand staffing problems discussed them as general issues notdirectly related to effective agile leadership.
findingsfigure and table summarize our findings.
briefly agileleadership comprises three dimensions dynamic team leader ship social identityandorganizational culture.in other words we found that agile teams share leadership work rather than having an individ ual leader build a sense of belonging and common purposeacross and within organizational functions adapt their processes to the different cultures whichexist simultaneously within a single organization.
.
dynamic team leadershipten out of thirteen interviewees highlighted that agile teamleadership is only effective when it is shared by the team.
allthe interviewees saw themselves as an active part of obtaininga shared leadership dynamic.
.
.
have team members that take initiative and respon sibility.interviewees emphasized having a team where ev erybody could take initiative.
one interviewee stated thathigh performing individuals do not make good agile teammembers because teamwork skills are more important thanindividual performance.
interviewees also described how teammembers who were initiators could enroll others in leader ship efforts and help make shared leadership a team norm.another interviewee stressed how a single team membercould ruin the team s effectiveness due to passiveness andnot being able to create an active work mode.
this findingmirrors prior research on dysfunctional teams .interviewees felt that complaining was not necessarily detri mental to the team s effectiveness as long as the team mem bers felt like they were in charge of making a change for thebetter.
complaining seems more infectious and destructive ifteams do not have autonomy because they tend to complainabout factors beyond their control.one interviewee explained that teams need some sort ofleadership whether or not they are agile to solve problemseffectively.
this interviewee saw the positive effects of havingall team members be leaders somehow but also stressed thatmany people in industry are used to having managers thatassume responsibility for project failures.
getting people tothink differently about leadership as shared was thereforechallenging.
interviewees perspectives on shared leadershipare complicated by the inability to divide projects neatly intoagile vs. plan driven some officially plan driven projectswere described as being quite agile and vice versa.the interviewees also stressed that there was often a differ ence in that agile methods have more onerous expectationsfor all team members leadership work than plan drivenmethods.
one interviewee was skeptical that agile is good forall projects because agile methods assume that team mem bers are willing to accept responsibility take initiative andmake decisions.people with a mindset of leadership themselves ap pear to focus more on agile principles and less on imple menting user stories as quickly as possible.
teams with suchmembers focused more on being collaborative self organized and seemed more passionate about their work.another interviewee attributed the team members activeparticipation in driving the teamwork to the agile approachto projects.
the motivation to lead was therefore not onlyan a priori property of individual team members but alsoan emerging team norm.
the interviewee emphasized thisdistinction because it implies that it is possible to activateleadership behavior by setting other group norms .
.
.
let team members lead.having members who wantto take initiative is necessary but insufficient.
eight inter viewees indicated that more traditional forms of leadership i.e.
managers surrounding a team could undermine self leadership.
teams were described as needing to feel heardand autonomy not only for technical or engineering practicesbut also for team improvements and other organizationalissues.another key skill that surfaced was a leader s ability totake a step back when leadership can be shared.
this wasdescribed as being tricky because guidance was often neededearly on and it could be difficult to spot when an individualor a team is ready for increased responsibility.
one interviewexplained that especially when leadership is a formal role the people in that role need to actively avoid taking overthe leadership of the team.
some interviewees believe thatstrong formal leadership roles prevent self organization andshared leadership.it was sometimes unclear to interviewees whether individ ual leadership remained because it was needed or for other2404icse may pittsburgh pa usalucas gren and paul ralph figure components of effective leadership in agile software development teams.reasons.
one interviewee described a situation where theirteam s effectiveness was reduced by the manager s unwilling ness to share leadership.
another stressed that leadership when not shared can become destructive.
.
.
step in if needed.two of the interviewees explicitlystated that even if they strove for self organization an ex perienced supervisor sometimes needed to intervene.
oneperson described this as being valued by the teams becausethe ways in which the supervisor could intervene were clear.the other interviewee expressed frustration in having to helpteams make better decisions.
they felt that the team shouldbe ready to accept responsibility faster but were not andtherefore tried to help.
having the support of a senior em ployee was also described as helpful since team memberscould validate issues with that person before feeding theissues back to the team itself.
.
social identityof the ten organizations where our interviewees work or ganizations g i and j embraced agile methods from theirfounding.
in contrast organizations a f and h are largecompanies with a long history of milestone driven softwareprojects.
they were organized around strong functional silos e.g.
marketing production software development account ing finance .
many participants were therefore leadingtransitions from a functional organizational hierarchy to aproject based organization or leading cross functional agileteams within companies that were organized around organi zational functions.2all of the participants viewed cross functional teams withhigh levels of team spirit as advantageous because it helpsmore employees take responsibility.
the participants ex plained that they obtained higher levels of team spirit notonly for their own work context and field of expertise but alsofor other important organizational functions e.g.
finance .none of the participants used the term social identity however they all discussed consolidating stabilizing andanchoring different social categories e.g.
business people de velopers testers .
a person s social identity is the collectionof social categories with which that person identifies .
.
.
build a strong social identity across functions.one ofthe most highlighted benefits of agile software developmentis increased team spirit that is a greater sense of team belonging and social cohesion.
one interviewee explainedhow as members come together from different functionalbackgrounds a strong sense of team spirit i.e.
feelings ofbelonging helps them on board integrate with the team andbegin contributing.
as team membership becomes part ofthe new team member s social identity they are more willingto accept responsibility and do leadership work.another participant highlighted that a separation of roleswithin the team decreased team cohesion.
they thereforefocused on getting team members to realize the value ofsharing all aspects of software delivery instead of focusing on2throughout this paper functions refers to organizational functions e.g.
marketing accounting .2405what makes effective leadership in agile software development teams?icse may pittsburgh pa usatable overview of themes and categories with example quotationsthemecategoryexamples of supporting quotationsdynamicteamleadershiphave team membersthat take initiativeand responsibility another guy said well you won t have the time so i m the scrum master now and that was it .
.
.
theydon t see the scrum master as a person they see it as a role that they all can take.
participant i1 teams that are it right .
.
.
are really thinking about being collaborative and self organized andall those things.
they become passionate about it and really want to do more of it.
participant c1 let team memberslead i guess we were just really lucky with the team members we had.
this was basically also my objective careful!
don t become a project manager don t start planning stu!
don t start assigning or definingtasks.
stay out of that!
participant g3 there are teams that have a strong leader and there the problem is another one which is this wholeidea of having someone telling everybody what to do.
for me it s the leadership will make it the bestor the worst.
participant j step in if needed most of the time we have to interfere as leaders in order to help the team come together and make abetter decision.
participant j1 i could .
and i did.. .
.
and ifthey don t like it they re free to goback to the old one.
participant i1 social iden titybuild a strong socialidentity across func tions a new resource from finance for example didn t used to have much to do with the other functions.now with these meetings and planning they are all one team working together and cheer each other saspects.
participant f1 it s very easy to see that well my part in the project is just coding but that s not quite true.
they get less cohesive by having a clear separation of roles.
participant h create an it andbusiness customerpartnership the business partnership and engagement you create is absolutely tremendous compared to thetraditional approach!
participant b1 so they can again work to be a part of and share the accountability .
i mean for a wholevariety of reasons that involvement of the business partner as a part of the team not them versus us.
participant d build a strong teamidentity it s interesting because when we deploy software in the middle of the day the here actuallycall the other units and say ok we re stopping the software for a couple of minutes for deploying.
sothen everyone stops.
we could do a night deploy but we prefer to do that.
participant h1 the scrum part takes between seven to ten minutes.
then it takes another five to ten minutes to fillout the time and it s in the spreadsheet so then i got to the tab that shows the burn down.
peoplewait for that!
like oooh let s see what the burn down is today!
and then the third part is just anopen forum an open meeting and people sort of take care of things that will only take a short amountof time to discuss.
participant g1 organizationalculturetailored approach i have a kind of waterfall like representation of our sprints and the main milestones and i show that tothem.
but then i just take care of all the requirements from the organization you know at a higherlevel.
the team doesn t have to worry about that stu!.
participant g1 what one individual pilot project starts to practice you always have difficulty scaling that becausethat s what they were and got really good at exactly that specific to that project.
butthat s not necessarily well translated into practice format across the enterprise.
that needs to be moreof the fundamentals and the process behind it.
participant a1 understanding thecompany ecosystem if you haven t brought those people along in your agile journey then subsequently you will have thathurdle to overcome because of the di!erent culture and behaviors.
participant d1 to some people it s a subtle di!erence and they sometimes have a hard time grasping why we don tjust have one list for finance one list for sales ops etc.
but it has been a key drive for us since we haveshared resources to have one cross functional list.
participant f1 adapt to customerculture often they don t want changes as often as we could deliver them.
participant c1 we used to work mostly with start up companies and with start up companies that s a big discussionbecause with a tight budget why would you have layers of tests?
participant j1 adjust old behav ior allowing the team to become a high performance team without the problem of having a lot of politicsinvolved in the execution of the project.
participant e2 waterfall approach provides some very familiar and comfortable handrails called milestones whicheverybody grasps and clings to for life.
participant g1 their individual expertise.
by sharing in different tasks teammembers expanded their social identity to include belongingto a team that was defined by itsgoal rather than itsroles.
.
.
create an it and business customer partnership.moresothan previous approaches agile software development focuseson social identities.
transitioning to agile necessitates defin ing one s work identity based on social categories other thanroles.
in other words agilists are supposed to identify withtheir cross functional team instead of or at least in additionto their role.
for example employees should say i m partof themass effectteam or i m on project urithiru not i m a front end developer or i m a requirements analyst .interviewees consistently described how their teams obtaineda common social identity by sitting and working together.participants emphasized how leaders expanded their teammembers responsibilities by communicating who was re sponsible for what.
one participant described attempting toenroll customers into the team s shared identity.
they feltthat projects in which customers and developers felt like theywere on the same team were more successful.two participants described cases when they did not succeedin creating a common social identity with business people orother external customers.
such situations were described as2406icse may pittsburgh pa usalucas gren and paul ralphleading to team members not feeling prioritized or sharingaccountability for the work being done.
.
.
build a strong team identity.social identity buildingwithin the teams was also described as important.
all practi tioners highlighted the importance of the social ceremonies often taken from agile ceremonies like a retrospective meetingor daily stand ups in creating a shared social categorythat became a part of the individuals social identity.
oneparticipant described a ceremony that was possible to con duct more efficiently but the team preferred deploying codein the middle of the day so that everyone could get togetherand get an important sense of belonging in the team.building a strong and common social identity was alsodescribed as being easier for co located teams which is consis tent with prior research .
two of the participants describedputting extra effort into online ceremonies to engender a senseof belonging in their distributed teams.
.
organizational culturemany large companies do not really want an agile transition.they just want to increase speed and productivity by adopt ing some elements of agile while retaining their functionalsilos and tyrannical power hierarchies.
agile leaders not onlywithin these large companies but also within smaller organiza tions beholden to them therefore have to balance conflictingorganizational cultures the new agile culture and the old milestone driven culture.
this balancing involves tailoringthe agile approach understanding the company ecosystem adapting to customer culture and adjusting old behaviors.all of the participants repeatedly contrasted effective lead ership in an agile context to other leadership behavior theyhad also observed or experienced.
.
.
tailored approach.one common topic was the diffi culty of scaling up small agile pilot projects to other contexts even within the same company.
the larger companies tendedto want a standard set of agile practices but participantsreported that the diversity of contexts hinders a standardizedapproach.
some participants manage this conflict between di versity and standardization by focusing on the agile principleswhile tailoring the practices for each or a few teams.one strategy described by three participants was to trans late the agile principles into the company s context ratherthan rigidly implementing agile practices and rituals.
oneparticipant described tweaking the waterfall model to makeit more incremental as a first step toward agile.
anotherinterviewee claimed that agile was not appropriate for somephases in their development it simply did not fit wherethe company was at the time of the interview.
returning tothe idea of balancing opposing cultures another participantsuggested that agile leaders should shield the team from thecontrol needs of their organizations so that the team canfocus on delivering value.
.
.
understand the company ecosystem.with large scaleagile one participant highlighted the issues with having onlyone product owner for each team since that person strug gled to set priorities for the teams since that person alonecould not balance many different functions e.g.
stakehold ers finance line management .
they instead focused on thefunction and purpose of product ownership and created abusiness council where up to seven people from differentorganizational functions set the priorities together.
one rep resentative from each department e.g.
one from finance onefrom marketing one from operations etc.
met every threeweeks to review all projects and their previous priorities.
thecouncil then created one single list of company prioritiesacross the organizational functions and through the creationof that list removed silos and forced collaboration across thecompany.
this appeared to improve consensus that it wasworking on the most important projects for the company.another participant emphasized that some companies theyworked with as customers did not understand that transition ing to agile development entails a cultural change.
balancingtwo conflicting cultures was described as very importantwithin the participant s own organization but also to cus tomize teams for customer culture.
this internal adaptationrequired much effort because customers that did not incorpo rate and focused on agile principles did not obtain as muchadded values as the ones that did which was described asfrustrating but necessary.participants not only had to see to the teams need tocontextualize but also to balance other functions within thesame company all of them with a different culture.
oneexample being that a development team could have an agilefinancial department integrated into their project so thatthey could make rapid changes to what was being built while others had a more milestone driven external financialdepartment hindering their agility.
.
.
adapt to customer culture.all participants discussedbalancing their internal organizational cultures with theircustomers organizational cultures.
one participant claimedthat their team could deliver updates much more often thanthe customer could handle them.
therefore the participantfelt that they had to be less agile to adapt to their customers.
the implication that agility is determined by release scheduleis questionable but many participants seem to think agilemeans delivering fast and often rather than being responsiveto change .one participant said that agile teams and their stake holders meet and synchronize their expectations instead ofspecifying requirements and then controlling delivery.
theyfelt that this synchronization nurtured more discipline andcommitment in stakeholders.another cultural tension concerned contracting.
one par ticipant complained that traditional fixed price contractshampered agile ways of working which is consistent with pre vious research .
the contracts instead defined whattype of collaboration was possible with the customers andpartly determined how the two different cultures could bebalanced.
what this participant described was contractingbased on the agile principles i.e.
fixed time fixed cost but2407what makes effective leadership in agile software development teams?icse may pittsburgh pa usaflexible scope.
they also had fully dedicated teams for eachproject and avoided developers in multiple teams.
.
.
adjust old behavior.the dialectic tension betweenthe old milestone driven culture and the new agile culture including power values and principles of working existsat both the organizations individual levels.
all participantsdescribed old habits and old ways of working resurfacingcontinuously in the new agile environments.
agile leaderstherefore felt that they needed to guard new work principlesand continuously adjust deviating behaviors.one participant explained that they were so used to the oldways of working that many employees struggled to follow thereasoning behind the new ways of working.
they describedpartially losing control of their project and having to let goof aspects of control that used to be key for them to knowhow to do their job.all participants described working hard to change behavior.one participant claimed that changing the behavior of peoplein their organization was the most challenging part of creatinga more customer value driven company.all interviewees mentioned how effective leadership meantletting go of control and reporting while trusting teamsand focusing on incremental delivery of customer value.
par ticipants reported varying results with about half of theircompanies having reasonably successful translations whilethe other half were still struggling.
.
summaryin summary participants identified three broad capabilitiesnecessary for effective leadership in modern software devel opment the ability to share responsibility and leadership workwith other team members.
the ability to get team members from different func tional silos to identify as members of a cross functionalteam.
the ability to manage ongoing tension between thecompeting logics of the old milestone driven cultureand the new agile culture.
related workthis section summarizes existing literature on leadership insoftware engineering and social psychology.
then in section5 we will integrate the findings from section with theexisting theory and research reviewed in this section.
.
research on leadership in softwareengineeringin software development agilityhas at least three meanings the ability to act and react quickly and easily adherence to the principles laid out in the agile mani festo the extent to which a team implements the practicesassociated with one or more ostensibly agile methods.some agilists believe that agile principles must be imple mented using specific agile practices tailored to their owncontext .
however instead of providing empirical evidencethat these practices increase a team s ability to act quicklyand easily proponents of agile simply redefinedagilityasadhering to their methods .even if we accept that adopting ostensibly agile practicesincreases a team s agility neither the agile manifesto norpopular books espousing agile practices addressleadership in depth or explain how what type of leadershipbehavior is needed over time.
scrum in particular promotes afacilitating role the scrum master and does not acknowl edge the necessity of adapting one s leadership style to one ssocial context .
in reality many companies use a mixtureof methods and adopt agile methods incrementally .most leadership research in software engineering viewsleadership as an individual role .
studies alsoshow how some agile roles include leadership behavior e.g.
scrum masters and agile coaches .some studies investigate specific leadership styles.
for ex ample veiseh et al.
showed that agile leaders are moretransformational.
garcia et al.
found that the effective ness of different leadership styles are independent of thesoftware development process e.g.
agile waterfall .
otherstudies have investigated how leadership styles change asteams mature .
what leadership behavior is neededdepends on individual readiness and the group s devel opment stage .
leadership roles typically become moredistributed as a team matures .andrias et al.
found three leadership styles tigers cranes and elephants in information systems developmentprojects.
przybilla et al.
suggests a research plan anda theoretical model where they want to investigate individualtraits represented by personality traits and cognitive ability and the perceived leadership distribution to explain self organization.
they hypothesize that many individuals wouldbe perceived as leaders in agile teams.
meanwhile moe etal.
argue that agile teams should be trained in leadership.the same authors later studied challenges of shared decision making in agile teams including alignment of strategicproduct plans with iteration plans allocation of developmentresources and performing development and maintenancetasks in teams .we did not find any software engineering studies thatinvestigate social identity see section .
and leadershiptogether.
however developers social identities play a keyrole in the effectiveness of software projects .in contrast much research investigates agile teams self organization and self management .
fur thermore kakar showed that agile teams have higherdegrees of self organization than teams in a more traditionalteam setup.
we extends these works by differentiating leader ship from management and organization.
only one study hasinvestigated explicit leadership aspects of getting teams toself organize but from the perspective of an appointedagile leader.2408icse may pittsburgh pa usalucas gren and paul ralphas early as scholars argued for including culturalaspects in software process improvement efforts .
laterstudies confirmed that considering culture improves outcomesin software process improvement .
others argued thatsocial norms values and beliefs are all important when de ploying systems development methodologies in general and agile software development in particular .
our themeof participants balancing conflicting cultures resonates withthese prior studies.
.
research on leadership in social psychologyearly 19thcentury conceptions of leadership were dom inated by thegreat man theory .3it posits that thesuccess of nations organizations and endeavors is largelydetermined by leaders amazing individuals who changedthe world using inherent talent for leading.
this theory isno longer taken seriously because both of its premises arefalse leadership is a learnable set of skills rather than aninnate talent and that the fate of nations is determinedby multitudinous factors rather than individuals.
criticismof thegreat man theoryis not new in tolstoy wrote to elicit the laws of history we must leave aside kings min isters and generals and select for study the homogeneous infinitesimal elements which influence the masses .hogg et al.
categorize 20th century leadership researchinto seven different focus areas personality traits and individual differences includingthe great man theory a body of research that views lead ership as innate or acquired individual characteristics .
situational perspectives a body of research that viewsleadership as a product of a context which is consideredoversimplified because the characteristics of individual leaderscan also matter .
what leaders do a body of research that investigatesthe actual behaviors of leaders and typically divides leadersinto task focused or relationship focused .
this is problem atic because it ignores the interplay between leader behaviorand context.
contingency theories a body of research that connectssituational and behavioral factors.
the main problem withthese theories is that they are rather static and only focuson one specific leadership behavior in one specific context ata time.
transactional leadership a body of research that fo cuses on the transaction of resources between the leaderand the followers .
these ideas were extended to theleader member exchange lmx theory which positsthat leader follower groups proceed through a series of phasessimilar to tuckman s stages of group development .
trans actional leadership theories are criticized for failing to appre ciate that leadership is a group process .3we preserve the original gender specific name here because it high lights how out dated this theory is.
transformational leadership a body of research thatfocuses on how leaders can transform goals into action usingcharisma.
this work posits that leaders should offer employ ees an identity within the organization such that employeestake personal responsibility for the success of the companyand see company failures as their own .
transformationalleadership improves follower performance at the individual team and organizational levels .
however immoral charis matic leaders may use power only for personal gain or to pro mote their own personal vision censure critical or opposingviews demand unquestioning acceptance of their decisions use one way communicatio and ignore followers needs .
leader perceptions a body of research built onsocialcognition a branch of cognitive psychology that focuses onhow people process store and apply information about otherpeople and social situations .
for instance leader cate gorization theory posits that our perception of leadershipinfluences our selection and endorsement of leaders .in summary the first three areas do not have much ex planatory power .
transactional leadership has merit while transformational leadership is quite effective but opento abuse.
understanding perceptions of leadership also helpsto explain who people choose to endorse as leaders.most of the leadership studies in software engineering fitinto one or more of hogg et al.
s categories for example leadership as an individual role or the style of beinga transformational leader .
however leadership researchin the 21stcentury has taken new directions.
as we describenext leadership is now seen as dynamic and integrated intothe social process of group formation.
.
dynamic team leadershiprecent studies of team effectiveness suggest that appointedleaders of complex projects create maintain and refine col lective systems of meaning and expectation which in turn guide the behavior of individuals .
this different perspec tive of leadership entails less control and direction and moreof the leader s developmental and instructional capabilitiesapplied over time .members of effective teams share leadership dynamically that is the distribution of leadership work among team mem bers is constantly in flux.
the team constantly adjusts basedon their circumstances what leadership work is being done who is it and how they are it.
ford suggestsreplacing the termleadershipwithleadingshipto capture thefact that it is a shared property of the team rather than aproperty of designated leaders .these ideas have existed in parallel with some of theprevious leadership theories described above for example cranach suggested that leadership is a function of groupaction in .in summary leadership is a kind of work a shared func tion of driving the work forward toward the team s goal which teams share.
teams constantly adjust their sharedleadership work to their changing circumstances.2409what makes effective leadership in agile software development teams?icse may pittsburgh pa usa4.
social identity theoryabove we described hogg et al.
s sevenhistoricalareas ofleadership research.
hogg et al.
s point in categorizing leader ship research thusly is to contrast these historical views witha contemporary social identity theoryof leadership .whereas all seven historical areas assume that leadershipis an individualrole social identity theory models leader ship as arelationshipwhere group members can influenceeach other to adopt and perceive as their own new values attitudes and goals.a person ssocial identityis the part of their sense ofself that derives from group membership that is their self categorization into different social groups .
effective lead ership transforms individual action into group action thatdefines group membership.
leadership is anidentity func tion it consolidates stabilizes and anchors the group s iden tity .
for example the congruence between the socialidentities of leaders and followers leads to higher ratings oftransformational leadership .social identities also play an important role in how peo ple collaborate.
to collaborate effectively teams need tocreate a common social category.
team members donothave to abandon their prior social categories to identify withthe team rather they create a new social category for thecross functional team .
for example if some membersof a software development team are also part of group thatpromotes devops across the organization they need not sup press that part of their social identity to feel like part of thesoftware team as well.
furthermore the new social categorydoes not require commonalities beyond team membershipto take hold.
for example the team members can all havedifferent hobbies nationalities belief systems or interests.however the more a person identifies with one socialcategory be it a role or a team the more they exhibit inter group bias that is favoring the groups we are part of the in group over others the out group .
inter groupbias has both positive and negative effects for example inter group bias can magnify team member s motivation but itcan also lead employees to put their team s best interestsahead of the organization s .
.
organizational cultureorganizational culture refers to the pattern of beliefs val ues and learned ways of coping with experience that havedeveloped during the course of an organization s history andwhich tend to be manifested in its material arrangementsand in the behaviours of its members .
culture is widely studied in many fields including anthropology management political science and sociology.
for the purposes of this paper however the key point is that leadership and social identity are inseparable from culture .organizational culture is a particularistic system of sym bols shaped by ambient society and the organization s history leadership and contingencies differentially shared used andmodified by actors in the course of acting and making senseout of organizational events .
rather than a single monolithic culture organizations can have a mishmash ofconflicting cultural views .
any nuanced understandingof leadership in agile teams therefore must be situated in theorganization s ongoing cultural conflict.
.
summaryin summary leadership research has evolved considerablysince the 19thcentury.
three recent trends in leadership re search help explain leadership in agile software development social identity helps explain how leaders get individualsto feel like part of a team and accept responsibility dynamic team leadership helps explain how leadershipwork is shared among team members the idea that leadership is inextricable from culturehelps explain how leaders balance conflicting culturesassociated with agile and milestone driven processes.more broadly increased focus on people and their inter actions is a core dimension of transitioning to and main taining agile software development.
leadership is part ofthis increased focus on human factors.
next we will furtherintegrate our findings back into recent leadership research.
discussionthe main contributions of this paper the concepts illus trated by figure resonate well with recent studies onleadership in social psychology most of which have not pre viously been applied to the software engineering context.
.
dynamic team leadershipour findings suggest that leadership in cross functional agileteams is dynamically shared many team members acceptresponsibility take initiative do leadership work and fur thermore who does what leadership work changes over time.this resonates with research on dynamic team leadership which has found that effective leaders develop and guide teammembers instead of controlling or directing them .
agileteams appear to need leadership that consistently adapts totheir evolving situation agile team members need to activelydrive teamwork.our results suggest that self appointed agile leaders letother team members take on leadership work when they theothers are ready to do so.
not allowing team members totake on leadership work and drive the teamwork forwardappears to inhibit the development of the desired agile teamdynamic .
having traditional managers in or around teamscan therefore prevent them from becoming agile.agile methods frequently prescribe self managed teamsrun without interference from external leaders.
however both our findings and existing research on dynamic teamleadership suggest that external or appointed leaders creating maintaining and refining expectations for the team can bebeneficial .2410icse may pittsburgh pa usalucas gren and paul ralph5.
social identityour findings suggest that building a strong social identityacross functions such that employees identify with their newteam in addition to their old role is important for effectiveagile leadership.
initially participants added to their col leagues identities by simply designing cross functional teams.having team members from different functions collaboratingwas described as one key to breaking the silos and focusingon increased customer value.our results are consistent with prior findings in psychologythat designing teams is a kind of leadership behavior .the positive effects of cross functional teams are also wellknown and include increased organizational learning jobsatisfaction and overall effectiveness .
the agile leaderswe interviewed described creating a sense of belonging andshared responsibility not only within teams but also withcustomers and other organizational functions.our interviewees emphasis on building a strong teamidentity i.e.
clearly defining a social category for the team is consistent with the main premise of social identity theory our membership in groups is a major part of who we are andhow we fit into our social world.
our interviewees descriptionsof how employees identify with different roles and teams areconsistent with the idea that an individual s social identitycomprises many social categories .furthermore synthesizing prior literature with our findingssuggests the following recommendation.
new team membersdo not have to abandon their prior social categories to identifywith their new team.
instead of trying to remove a person sprior social category e.g.
a software tester we simply addthe cross functional team identity e.g.
i m a member ofteam eta .
the different categories do not interfere witheach other and trying to suppress aspects of a person ssocial identity is problematic.
moreover developing employ ees social identities can decrease inter group bias and makecollaboration more effective across the organization .
.
organizational culturelike prior software engineering research on culture our findings suggest that transitioning to agile software de velopment is inextricable from sifting organizational cultures.realizing the benefits of agile software development requiresmore than just implementing agile practices and processimprovements the organizational culture has to change fromone of individual leaders commanding and controlling to oneof decentralized dynamic team leadership.
that is why ourparticipants focused on implementing agile principles tai lored to their specific contexts rather than inflexibly rollingout a standard set of agile practices.furthermore the agile leaders saw themselves as shieldsbetween the new agile cultures of their teams and the old milestone and function oriented cultures in their surroundingcompany ecosystems.
this shielding resonates with priorpsychological literature on how understanding organizationalculture is essential to making sense of the organization shistory its leadership and events .
even the participantsfrom the smaller companies contrasted effective leadership inagile teams to other leadership behavior.consistent with prior research on agile transitions our results show that agile leaders perform a cultural bal ancing act across the organizational functions to facilitate atransition toward agile processes.
more general research onorganizational culture similarly shows that a multitude oforganizational cultures existing simultaneously within largeorganizations.
multicultural models are needed because largeorganizations have problems of cross cultural conflict .when a company adopts agile the new agile culture musttherefore be balanced with existing and sometimes conflict ing cultures.
for example some of our participants describedadapted to their customers culture by decreasing their releasefrequency.
.
answering our research questionthis study sought to address the question what is the na ture of leadership in agile software development from theperspective of professionals who identify as agile leaders?
putsimply our answer is as follows.agile leadership is dynamically shared among team mem bers engenders a sense of belonging to the cross functionalteam is inextricable from organizational culture and of ten requires balancing competing organizational cultures.
.
implicationsthe above findings have several implications for researchers professionals and educators.future research on leadership in software engineering shouldbe more connected to recent research in social psychology andorganizational behavior.
what makes a good agile leader?
is the wrong question because effective agile teamsshareleadership work.
counter intuitively to understand whatto look for in a great software engineering manager andhow to further develop their skills to support the teamsthey manage we need to conceptualize leadership asa property of a team rather than an individual.
once weunderstand that leadership is a kind of work rather thana kind of person we can recognize that the effectiveness ofsoftware engineering managers depends on their ability to get employees to identify as part of team get teammembers to accept greater responsibility and managecultural conflict.
indeed transitioning to agile developmentmay increase the importance of these aspects of leadership.the proposed model explains that as organizations grad ually shift to agile they must balance competing cultures including conflicts between teams within teams and evenwithin individuals.
practitioners may benefit from collabo rating with academics on this because theories of leadershipare challenging to digest and apply.meanwhile educators may find the proposed model use ful for teaching agile project management a problematicsubject for many software engineering educators especially at the graduate level.
the model can be used bothto explain to students the relationship between management2411what makes effective leadership in agile software development teams?icse may pittsburgh pa usaand leadership in self managed self organized software teamsand to frame class discussion of taking on leadership workand responsibilities.
limitationsbeing purely qualitative we examine this study s limitationsthrough common qualitative categories including credibility resonance originality usefulness and transferability .credibility is the degree to which findings are demonstrablygrounded in observation.
we provide detailed analysis tables see data availability showing how each theme and categoryis grounded in specific interviewee statements.resonance is the degree to which findings make sense toparticipants.
we assessed resonance usingdialogical interview ing a technique in which during interviews the interviewerreformulates the interviewee s statements in the interviewer swords to synchronize their interpretations and co constructmeaning .
this technique was used throughout the in terviews as interviewee expressed something that seemedimportant to them.
it lead to many small improvements andrevisions to our understanding of the interviewees perspec tives which filter into the emerging themes in many smallways.originality is the degree to which the study produces novelconcepts.
while the themes that emerge from this study mapinto existing theories in social psychology this is the firststudy to show that leadership is present in and critical for self managed agile teams.
although dynamic team leadershipand social identity are widely researched in social psychology this is the first study that demonstrates that these theoriesapply to and are useful for understanding software teams.usefulness is the degree to which a study s results can beapplied by someone e.g.
practitioners researchers .
section5.
describes the potential uses of our findings by researchers professionals and educators.
the conceptual transition fromleadership as a role to leadership as a shareable form ofwork has the potential to spawn a new direction in research education and practice.transferability is the degree to which other researcherscould apply a study s proposed concepts in different con texts.
transferability is an alternative to generalizability forqualitative studies that do not statistically generalize froma sample to a population.
the mapping of our findings intoprior theories which apply across diverse contexts suggestshigh transferability.
however agile leaders are scarcer thandevelopers and much scarcer than consumers so we were notable to find as many participants as we would have liked.
weattempted to mitigate bias among participants by recruitinga diverse group in terms of gender race nationality job de scription company size and industry.
future research couldimprove confidence in the transferability of results by investi gating agile leadership from the perspective of professionalswho donotidentify as agile leaders and professionals from awider variety of organizational contexts.moreover the analysis may be colored by the first au thor s experiences with agile leadership at volvo cars specifi cally the first author s practical experience with agile cultureclashes may have affected the coding of the data.
we at tempted to mitigate this threat by having the second authoraudit the coding.
similarly both of the authors have back grounds in social psychology which could affect the degreeto which our findings converge with existing psychologicaltheory in ways we can neither perceive nor mitigate.
conclusions and future workthis study was motivated by the three realizations lead ership is crucial for projects and organizations little re search has investigated how leadership works in self managedagile teams and software engineering research has notembraced recent advances in psychological research on leader ship.
we therefore conducted a qualitative survey of thirteensoftware professionals who identify as agile leaders.
our maincontribution is the model of agile leadership shown in figure .briefly the model suggests that leadership is a kind ofwork rather than a job role self organized self managedteams dynamically share leadership work among team mem bers employees are more willing to accept leadership workand responsibility when they identify as belonging to theirteams and effective leadership often involves balancingconflicting cultures e.g.
agile vs. milestone driven .this qualitative study aims to explain rather than predict.future work could quantitatively assess the antecedents andconsequences of effective leadership using validated scalesfor concepts including social identity or explore under researched aspects of leadership such asprototypicality theidea that more typical team members are better at leader ship work and inter group bias favoritism toward one steammates in software teams.software engineering researchers need to get better at in tegrating theories and findings from reference disciplines andcollaborating directly with scientists from other disciplines.while cross disciplinary research is intrinsically challenging software engineering is intrinsically interdisciplinary.
there fore only by appreciating research from other disciplinescan we effectively understand explain predict and prescribesoftware engineering phenomena.data availabilitysupplementary materials including our interview guide de scriptions of participants organizations and analysis tablesare available at in terview transcripts have not been published to mitigate re identification risk.acknowledgmentswe would like to thank our participants for investing theirtime and effort to make this work possible and alfredogoldman and richard torkar for their support.2412icse may pittsburgh pa usalucas gren and paul ralphreferences khaldoun m aldiabat and carole lynne le navenec.
