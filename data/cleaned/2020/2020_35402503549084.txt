introduction proficientprogrammersareessentialforprovidingthecriticalinfrastructure and functioning applications for our modern society .
although the learning strategies education and pathwaystobecomingaprogrammermaydiffer thegeneralexpectationis that withmore time andexperience a programmer should generally become more proficient.
for example many research studies of programmers use years of experience education level or employment status as foundational measures for proficiency.
while all these choices are sensible they allimplicitlyencodetheexpectationthathigherproficiencyshould correlate with more experience.
however inpractice reportedobservationsviolatethisexpectation.
hiring managers and technical founders report that they routinely encounter engineers with years of experience who couldn tcompetentlyprogram who strugglewithtinyproblems and senior engineers whocan twrite basic code .
the original creator of the infamous fizzbuzz interview question only did so after seeing that the majority of comp sci graduates...andself proclaimedseniorprogrammers haddifficulty solving simple problems in a timely manner.
research has also found that in companies the seniority level showed little correlation to actual programming skill and programmers with thiswork islicensedunderacreativecommonsattribution4.0international license.

to this end we have identified correlates of high programmer efficacy as well as experience measures that provide a stronglinkto efficacy.
in summary we make the following contributions acombinedeegandeye trackingexperimenttoinvestigate programmer efficacy withadiverseparticipant pool.

our aim is to incorporate measures of programcomprehensionfromtheseexperimentsintoasinglecoherentstudyasshownintable .wespecificallydesignedourstudy tobetterunderstandprogrammerefficacyacrossawiderangeof experiencelevelsinthecontextofprogram comprehensiontasks.
programmer efficacy is therefore the independent variable for our experiment.
we operationalize programmer efficacy as follows programmer efficacy number of correct code comprehension tasks completion time in minutes note that programmer efficacy captures both the speed and correctnessofaparticipant sbehavior.duetothestrictone hour 1efficacyspecificallyreferstotheabilitytoquicklyproducetheintendedresult.notably thisdiffers from expertise whichinvolvesadditionalfacets suchasdeep knowledge effort and masteryof skills.

our definitionofprogrammerefficacyeliminateseffectsarisingfrom a difference in the number of attempted tasks and is in line with prior work .
to guide our experimentdesign regarding dependent variables we definedseveral research questions whichwe introduce next.
.
reading behavior rq several studies have shown that experienced programmers show a differentreadingbehaviorthannovicesbasedoneye gazemeasures.
the reading behavior describes a programmer s eye movements while they are comprehending a source code snippet.
therefore we state the following research question rq1do differentlevels of programmer efficacy exhibitdifferences in reading behavior in terms of navigation strategyandcode element coverage ?
operationalization.
forrq1 weadopt7measuresthathavebeen identifiedintheliterature inalongitudinalstudy almadietal.observed differences inthe navigationstrategy at the token level .
specifically they analyzedfixation durationandhow likelyit was that a participant re fixated on a token.
experts showed significantlyshorterfixationdurations alowerchanceofrefixatingon a token and a higher chance to skip tokens.
likewise aljehane et al.
found differences between novices and experts in terms of code element coverage .
it refers to the number of elements on which a participant fixates during a task in contrast to the total number of code elements.
they found that novices read in particular more methodsignatures variabledeclarations identifiers and keywords.finally busjahnetal.havealsoidentifiedadifferencein code elementcoverage inthatnovices fixatemorecode elements thanexperts .theyalsoidentifiedadifferenceinthe reading order.
however our replication study revealed that this effect is principallydrivenbytheexecutionorderofthesnippets .as our snippets are not balanced for thisaspect we will not consider readingorderasameasure thesestudiesuseddifferentmeasures topinpointtheparticipants readingbehavior.inourstudy weaim at answering how programmer efficacy affects reading behavior acrossalldescribedmeasures to increasecomparability.

cognitiveload rq similartoreadingbehavior previousstudiesfoundthatdifferent levels ofprogramming experiencecanbe distinguishedby theobserved neural correlates of cognitive load which leads us to our nextresearchquestion rq2do differentlevels of programmer efficacy exhibitdifferences inneuralcorrelates of cognitive load?
operationalization.
related to rq crk et al.

similarly lee et al.

we analyze both powerbands and theratiomeasureinourstudytobetterunderstandthelinkbetween programmer efficacy andcognitive load.
.
experience measures rq finally wefocusonprogrammerefficacyasadistinguishingfactor betweenour participants.prior research mostcommonly uses rather simple experience measures to separate participants e.g.
years of programming .
in this vein we pose our last research question rq3do different levels of programmer efficacy correlate withcommon measures ofprogramming experience?
operationalization.
many commonly used experience measures canbeinconsistentintheirpredictivepower whichledustouse programmer efficacy as the distinguishing factor.
in rq we analyze widely used experience measures3and distill the relevant measures that correlate best with the observed programmer efficacy.

we chose a design so a participant completes four programcomprehension tasks and one search task.

discussion.
our experiment highlights two fundamental problems for studying programmers.
one issue is that programming issuchadiversefieldwithdifferenttechnologiesthatrequiredifferent skill sets so it is incredibly difficult to accurately measure aprogrammer sexperience.therefore manyresearchersrelyon simple measures such as years of programming.
however this can become problematic if the difference between the selected measure and theactualproficiency level becomes a significant confounding factor .
our experiment in line with prior research underlineshowlimitedcommonexperiencemeasuresareinpredictingprogrammers efficacy.thus futureresearchmustcarefully consider collecting more comprehensive experience data in particular when using it to separatethe participants intogroups.
while thismaynotbecompletelynewinsights ourexperimentfurther corroborates this critical point.

perspectives and conclusion measuring programming experience.
for future studies one major obstacle is to select the correct measure of programming experience.cognitivepsychologyhasinvestigatedtherelationship between experience and expertise in many fields beyond programming .oneconsistentfindingisthatthelengthofexperience canbepartofexpertise aspeoplecontinuetoacquireskill but isnoteverything .inprogramming studiesfromthe1990sidentifiedasimilareffect inthattherearetwoelementsatplay thetime and learning .
in our questionnaire we aimed to capture many aspectsofprogrammingexperience includingmeasuresoflearning butalsoregardingcontentcreationandwork timedistribution.
one themethat consistently showedastrongconnection withobserved efficacy is the eagerness of learning and inquisitiveness.

psychology describes this conscious effort to keep learning asdeliberate practice .
it also highlights that not necessarily the length of practice but the intensity and goal orientation is critical toachieveexpertiseinatopic .theeffectofdeliberatepractice has been observed in programming education and practice as well.
for example students show higher ability when participating in programming competitions .

they considered theabilitytolearnasmoreimportantthantechnicalskill .this was later confirmed in an experimental setting in which company seniority level showed little correlation to actual programming skill .
overall the results of our experiment underlined that the learning component is a highly relevant measure to capture efficacy which leads us to suggest it as important measure s for future experiments.

experience expertise and efficacy are three dimensionsofcharacteristicsofprogrammersthatarenotwellunderstood.

commonly used experience measures do not correlate well to observed efficacy.
instead we underline to use self estimation and learning eagerness as more accurate measures for programming experience.
despite encouraging results future work shall explore programmer efficacy in more detail.
for example the link between reading behaviorandcognitiveloadcouldbeexploredtounderstandcausalities.
is the more efficient reading strategy of programmers with high efficacy the cause for lower cognitive load orvice versa?
