but our field s understanding of what motivates people to contribute to oss is still fundamentally grounded in studies from the early 2000s.
with the changed landscape of oss it is very likely that motivations to join oss have also evolved.
through a survey of oss contributors we investigate shifts in motivation from three perspectives the impact of the new oss landscape the impact of individuals personal growth as they become part of oss communities and the impact of differences in individuals demographics.
our results show that some motivations related to social aspects and reputation increased in frequency and that some intrinsic and internalized motivations such as learning and intellectual stimulation are still highly relevant.
we also found that contributing to oss often transforms extrinsic motivations to intrinsic and that while experienced contributors often shift toward altruism novices often shift toward career fun kinship and learning.
oss projects can leverage our results to revisit current strategies to attract and retain contributors and researchers and tool builders can better support the design of new studies and tools to engage and support oss development.
index terms open source motivation incentive i. i ntroduction much has changed since the early days of open source software oss from the type of products it creates to who participates e.g.
individuals industry consortia companies to how it operates e.g.
industry funded projects foundations social coding platforms .
oss today enjoys a place of distinction in producing key technologies and providing learning and career opportunities.
with such drastic changes to the status of oss along with the clearer path to personal economic gain that it now affords it is likely that what motivates people to join oss has evolved since the early days.
our current understanding of what motivates individuals to contribute to oss however remains largely rooted in research from the 2000s when oss was still in its infancy .
this dated understanding of motivation can make our community and research efforts to attract sustain and improve diversity in oss projects ineffectual.
therefore it is time we revisit the fundamental question of what drives people to contribute to oss today giving us a two part research question rq1a what motivates contributors to oss today?
rq1b how has motivation to contribute shifted as oss has matured?
besides understanding what motivates individuals now so we can better support them we also aim to identify the ways in which people s motivations have shifted in response to the changing landscape so that oss communities can rethink their strategies to attract and retain contributors.
shifts in motivation occur not only because of changes to the oss landscape but might also reflect the journey an individual makes and their growth since first joining .
currently we lack an understanding of the differences in motivation for the early joiners compared to those who are well entrenched in oss.
to support both the attraction of new members and the retention of existing contributors we need to understand how the motivation changes after the members join oss.
this leads us to our next research question rq2 how does motivation to contribute to oss shift as oss contributors gain tenure?
what motivates people and shifts their motivation as they gain experience in oss may also depend on their individual characteristics gender degree of experience primary type of contribution code non code and so on.
for example research has shown women enjoy other types of contributions such as documentation or community management over code hacking .
research has also shown that coders and noncoders follow different career pathways .
therefore knowing what motivates people with different individual characteristics can help us in better supporting a diverse community.
this brings us to our final two part research question rq3a how does motivation to contribute differ for diverse characteristics?
rq3b how do shifts in motivation differ for diverse characteristics?
to answer our research questions we conducted an online survey revisiting the questions used to measure motivation in three seminal papers hars and ou lakhani and wolf and ghosh et al.
.
the responses from oss contributors indicate that indeed motivation has shifted as oss has matured and that individuals motivations evolve as they contribute to oss.
as v on krogh et al.
famously reported it is10462021 ieee acm 43rd international conference on software engineering icse .
ieee not the immediate and isolated outcome that matters the carrot but how the individual subjectively holds outcomes and actions to be consistent over time the journey toward the end of the rainbow .
understanding what motivates people should include not only the immediate carrots but also the larger quest of an individual as they continue to grow and reach for the pot of gold at the end of their journey.
a deeper understanding of motivation and satisfaction can help oss projects in identifying strategies to lower contributor turnover and improve productivity as identified by literature on motivation in software engineering .
we hope that our insights on the shifting state of motivation help our research community create more nuanced approaches to attract and support a diverse set of contributors to oss.
ii.
r elated work motivation has been a frequently studied topic in software engineering a systematic literature review found papers on this topic published until .
in this literature review was updated to add additional papers .
the literature shows that proper management of motivation and satisfaction helps software organizations achieve higher levels of productivity avoid turnover budget overflows and delivery delays .
sharp et al.
provide a comprehensive overview of the motivation models used in software engineering and propose a new model by leveraging previous results from the literature.
more recently sach et al.
analyzed data from interviews with professional software engineers and suggested that there has been a trend toward more sociallyoriented motivators in software engineering.
other works such as franc a et al.
found a variety of factors that influence work motivation and job performance in the software industry.
however motivation in software industry settings may not necessarily apply to oss .
oss contributors have a high degree of autonomy intrinsic motivation and selfdetermination .
motivation to contribute to oss was extensively studied in the early 2000s.
many researchers were intrigued that highquality oss was developed volunteerly by qualified young motivated individuals .
hars and ou ghosh et al.
and lakhani and wolf conducted broad web based surveys to collect motivations of oss contributors in a twoyear period from .
other surveys from the early 2000s focused on specific communities such as linux and apache .
since these initial surveys which are still considered state of the art researchers conducted studies focused on specific communities .
other researchers focused on the motivation of specific contributor profiles such as newcomers one time code contributors quasi contributors and students .
researchers also investigated the relation between motivation and other constructs like retention task effort intention to contribute and participation level .
specific types of motivations were also investigated .
v on krogh et al.
surveyed the literature to aggregate the studies about motivation in oss published until .they identified ten motivation categories grouped as intrinsic internalized extrinsic and extrinsic.
intrinsic motivation moves the person to act for the fun or challenge entailed rather than in response to external pressures or rewards .
in contrast extrinsic motivations are based on outside incentives when people change their actions due to an external intervention .
developers can also internalize extrinsic motivators in a way that they are perceived as self regulating behavior rather than external impositions .
these internalized extrinsic motivations include reputation reciprocity learning and own use.
essentially the broad research about motivation was conducted before the professionalization of open source development the increasing involvement of corporations and the rise of social coding platforms.
much of the work focused on sourceforge github was launched in and became the dominant open source hosting site around .
therefore it is time to revisit replicate and extend previous research on motivation to contribute to oss.
furthermore investigating the shift of motivation which is core in our study was not the focus of any previous work.
iii.
r esearch method to answer our research questions we administered an online survey to oss contributors.
in the following subsections we describe our approach and instrumentation.
a. selection of previous surveys to select prior surveys to help design our study we searched for broad surveys with a high number of citations on google scholar and selected the surveys conducted by lakhani and wolf citations and hars and ou citations the search was conducted in may .
we also included the survey conducted by ghosh et al.
as it was performed during the same period as the others but collected a significantly higher number of respondents compared to and respectively .
we searched for complementary information that was not available in the manuscripts such as full instruments data sets and technical reports with more details about the studies.
additionally we wrote to the previous surveys authors asking for additional information however we did not receive an answer.
b. identification of similar questions as we wanted to compare our results to the previous surveys but did not want to ask the participants redundant questions the next step of our method was identifying similar questions.
we used negotiated agreement to group questions or categories in the case of that could be considered similar.
for example we grouped peer recognition hars enhance reputation in f oss community lakhani and get a reputation in os fs community ghosh .
three researchers experienced in qualitative methods and oss performed the initial grouping of the questions.
they leveraged the description provided in the original papers and supplementary materials to disambiguate the meaning of the motivation factors and 1047questions.
they kept meeting and discussing until reaching an agreement.
after that four other researchers three academic and one practitioner validated the grouping.
we ended up with questions extracted from the previous surveys.
c. definition of motivation factors after identifying similar questions we decided to group them into higher level constructs to narrow down the analysis.
to the best of our knowledge the literature review conducted by v on krogh et al.
is the most comprehensive investigation of motivation in oss since they aggregated motivation factors found in primary studies published until .
therefore we employed this work as our theoretical framework to guide our analysis.
in it the authors grouped the motivation factors in ten main categories namely ideology altruism kinship fun reputation reciprocity learning own use career and pay.
to map the questions to the categories we followed the same process described in the previous step.
when grouping the items we noticed that the items did not completely cover the fun category.
to cover this gap we added one question to represent this category to our set i have fun writing programs.
therefore our motivation questionnaire ended up with items listed in table iii.
after the informed consent we asked two open questions about motivation to contribute to oss.
the goal was to collect spontaneous answers before presenting participants with the list of motivation factors.
to understand the shift in motivation rq2 we asked participants why they first began and then continued contributing i what motivated you to start contributing to free open source software f oss projects?
and ii why do you continue contributing to f oss projects?
as v on krogh et al.
s literature review considered only papers published until these open questions also helped us to evaluate to what extent the categories proposed by v on krogh et al.
cover current oss contributors motivations to contribute.
likert scale questions on a new page we presented the items from the previous step to identify the contributors motivations.
we presented each item as an option to complement the sentence i contribute to f oss because... the items followed a point likert scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree with a neutral option and i m not sure.
the list of items was randomized for each respondent to avoid ordering bias.
the exact question wording is provided in our supplementary material.1we also added an attention check item this is a verification question please answer strongly agree.
and a question to collect other potential motivations not covered by the items are there any other reasons for contributing to f oss that we haven t covered above?
.
demographics the last part of the survey comprised demographic questions project s they contribute to the most time since the first contribution initial and current financial relationship to oss paid unpaid initial and current type of contributions main occupation gender identity country of origin and residence and age.
questions were optional to increase the response rate by making respondents more comfortable .
moreover to encourage participation we offered the participants a chance to enter a raffle for us .
to enter the raffle case they needed to provide an email address at the end of the survey.
after it was proofread by all researchers and tested in multiple browsers and devices we invited seven participants to pilot the survey so we could collect feedback and measure the time to answer.
no modification of the survey was necessary and we discarded these initial answers.
d. recruitment similar to previous surveys we opted for a broad distribution of our survey.
we avoided scraping email addresses from software repositories because this practice has been condemned by oss communities and can violate the terms of service of the platforms and some regional data protection laws.
instead we focused on increasing the number of responses and the sample s diversity by employing several strategies.
first we formed an international and diverse team of researchers who are originally from south america europe and asia and were working at the time of this study in north america europe south america and australia .
seven researchers work in academia with extensive experience with oss and one researcher is a practitioner working in an oss company.
the researchers sent direct messages to their contacts and posted ads on social network websites.
second we advertised the survey on social media sites namely twitter facebook reddit linkedin and hackernews.
to reach a broader audience we paid to promote our posts on twitter facebook and reddit.
these sites are largely used by our target population .
when the site allowed we also shared our posts to groups related to oss development.
finally we asked our personal contacts to share our posts and distribute our message for example on twitter our posts were retweeted more than times .
the survey was available between june and july .
we received non blank answers and after filtering the data as detailed in the next subsection we ended up with valid responses.
the link posted on twitter was the origin of almost half of our answers.
the link that we sent to our contacts which they probably forwarded to their colleagues as we requested was the origin of of the answers.
links posted on oss related discussion lists and reddit were also a common origin of our responses.
e. filtering we filtered our data to consider only valid responses.
we dropped answers that failed the attention question cases and checked for answers with the same choice for all likert scale questions removed .
we then analyzed the time to complete the survey to remove lower outliers removed .
we manually inspected the open text questions looking for senseless and inappropriate answers removed .
then we filtered our data looking for potential duplicate participation even though 1048the survey platform qualtrics has mechanisms to prevent multiples responses from the same participant.
we started looking for identical and similar emails removed .
finally since this study s target population comprises oss project contributors we also inspected the answers to the question about years of experience in oss to filter answers from participants with no experience removed .
after applying all the filters we ended up with valid responses.
f .
data analysis likert scale questions we used the likert scale items to compare our results to the previous surveys rq1 .
we ranked the questions based on the number of respondents who agreed to each motivation checking agree or strongly agree .
we then compared each previous papers ranking with a corresponding ranking of our answers built by excluding the items that did not match those from the previous study.
we detail this analysis in section v a. open questions to address rq2 and rq3 we analyzed the answers to the open questions about motivation to start and to continue contributing.
we categorized the answers based on a card sorting approach .
we used the categories from v on krogh et al.
see section iii c as a seed to the classification.
we discarded four responses that left blank the answers about their motivation to start and motivation to keep contributing.
however we kept two cases in which respondents provided motivations only for one of them the motivation to start in both cases .
the whole process was conducted using continuous comparison and discussion until reaching consensus.
to include an outside view we invited a researcher who had not participated in the method s initial steps to pair with one of the previous researchers.
these two researchers jointly analyzed two sets of answers to establish common ground discussing the applied codes.
then each researcher analyzed the remaining answers independently and discussed the disagreements until reaching consensus.
finally a third researcher inspected the classification.
table i presents representative examples for each category.
during this process we decided to include two new categories that did not fit well in v on krogh et al.
s classification gsoc google summer of code and coursework.
the literature about joining oss via gsoc and course assignments suggests that there are multiple motivations associated with these reasons to participate .
segment analysis to analyze how the reported motivation differ according to individual characteristics we segmented our sample based on experience in oss experienced fourth quartile years of experience vs. novices first quartile years of experience age older median years old vs. younger median years old and role coder code developer or code reviewer as one of the top activities vs. non coder other activities .
g. replication package a comprehensive replication package including our anonymized dataset instruments and scripts is stored in thezenodo2open data archive.
iv.
p articipant demographics our survey received valid answers.
in the following we report the demographics of the respondents.
no questions were mandatory so not all categories sum to .
the demographics are presented in table ii.
we received answers from residents of five different continents with a broad age distribution.
the majority are men and coders matching previously reported distributions of oss contributors .
the population is also diverse in terms of the projects to which they contribute.
the respondents reported contributing for example to the linux kernel kde debian kubernetes libreoffice mozilla php laravel drupal debian tensorflow apache projects firefox homebrew arduino eclipse joomla django wordpress javascript libraries python libraries and r packages.
the projects are diverse in programming languages age community size organization and governance model.
regarding the financial relationship with oss most respondents reported being unpaid and only reported that they receive at least some money to work with oss.
on average the respondents spend hours per week min hour median max and have years of experience with oss min year median max .
v. r esults a. rq1a what motivates contributors to oss today?
figure shows the answers to the likert scale items about what motivates oss contributors grouped as per v on krogh et al.
s categories.
figure shows agreement among participants that intrinsic motivations especially fun altruism and kinship are key motivations on average and of the respondents agree or strongly agree that they contribute to oss due to these motivations.
this is reflected in p164 s excitement of contributing to oss discovered linux and open source in general when i was a student in the 90s.
sending a patch across the ocean just seemed very exciting and p30 s altruistic vision to spread knowledge which i think that contributes to make a society better .
internalized extrinsic motivations learning and reciprocity are also important factors.
an impressive of respondents figure g agreed that they contribute because oss allows them to learn and improve their skills as p75 explained i continued contributing to oss projects because it was a good source for learning new things.
extrinsic factors like career and pay paint a contrasting picture.
while participants agree that oss presents opportunity for professional growth with only disagreement figure1 i only mention payment as a motivation and disagreeing with q20 and q21 respectively figure j .

.
.
students were encouraged to make contributions p230 a university class about f oss p150 finally some of the original motivations for contributing to oss ideology own use show mixed responses.
some aspects of ideology such as opposing large companies and proprietary software were not as popular as other motivations which could be a result of large companies recent embrace of oss.
on the other hand the philosophy that source code should be open still remains strong figure a .
as p140 said i believe in the free software philosophy.
own use is a mixed bag.
scratch your own itch was a keyrallying call in the early days of oss and is still a motivating factor for some as p140 said i contribute for my own purposes.
however the sentiment has changed.
the two ownuse questions with the biggest difference in opinions are q18 and q16 in figure h .
q18 relates to people seeking help from the community to realize their idea.
while about find this to be the case a larger majority show people joining existing communities.
interestingly about find proprietary software to be limited q16 at least in providing q3q2q1 a ideology intrinsic q6q5q4 b altruism intrinsic q8q7 c fun intrinsic q10q9 d kinship intrinsic q11 e reputation internalized extrinsic q12 f reciprocity internalized extrinsic q13 g learning internalized extrinsic q18q17q16q15q14 h own use internalized extrinsic q19 i career extrinsic q21q20 j pay extrinsic fig.

the same level of features as p63 mentions depending on proprietary software was severely limiting and possibility as with oss we can fix our own bugs.
motivations to contribute intrinsic and internalized motivations explain what drives most of the contributors today.
on the extrinsic end career is relevant to many contributors contrary to paywhich only explains why less than one third of the respondents contribute to oss.
b. rq1b how has motivation to contribute shifted as oss has matured?
to analyze the shifts in motivation in relation to previous surveys we do not directly compare the percentages since each survey measured or aggregated the data in slightly different ways.
for example lakhani and wolf report the percentage of individuals based on their top three motivations whereas hars and ou report the percentages of the individuals who ranked high or very high on each motivation subcategories.
to provide a basis for comparison we pairwise compare relative rankings considering exclusively those questions that appear in both surveys generating one relative ranking of our results for each comparison table table iii .
for each previous study we compare the ranking extracted from the original paper to a relative ranking of our results which excludes the questions not present in the previous study being compared.
results show social aspects have gained considerable importance.
deeply enjoying helping others q6 was ranked inthe7thposition in hars et al.
s survey and 2ndin our relative ranking.
kinship q9 ascended in the ranking from the 6th to3rdplace when we compare to hars et al.
and from 7th to3rdcompared to lakhani et al.
s results.
these questions were not asked in ghosh et al.
s survey.
there was also a shift in the relative importance of reputation q11 .
this motivation was ranked 10th last in lakhani et al.
and 11th second to the last in ghosh et al.
and moved up to the first half of our relative rankings 5thand 6th respectively.
however the same trend does not hold when comparing to hars et al.
there was a change in the opposite direction for the motivations related to scratch one s own itch own use .
the question related to needing the software was ranked 4th in hars et al.
and 7thin our relative ranking.
in relation to lakhani et al.
needing the software to work was ranked 3rd and for non work purposes was ranked 4th in our relative ranking these items dropped to 7thand9th respectively.
several motivations are consistently top ranked in all surveys.
learning q13 was ranked first in our survey hars et al.
s and ghosh et al.
s rankings whereas it was ranked 2ndin lakhani et al s. intellectual stimulation q8 2ndin our overall ranking sharing knowledge and skills q4 3rd in our overall ranking participating in the oss scene q10 5thin our overall ranking and belief that source code should be open q1 5thin our overall ranking were also top ranked in previous surveys.
alternatively we can observe that financial reward being paid to contribute and selling products and services was bottom ranked for all surveys.
shifting motivations through time some motivations to contribute to oss have stood the test of time learning fun knowledge sharing and a belief that source code should be open all core tenets of oss.
others have seen a marked difference.
social aspects e.g.
altruism kinship and reputation have gone up in the ranking whereas participating in oss to scratch one s own itch has dropped.
c. rq2 how does motivation to contribute to oss shift as oss contributors gain tenure?
to analyze the shift in motivation from the perspective of the contributors we asked two open ended questions about what motivated them to start contributing and why they continued to contribute.
we qualitatively analyzed the answers using v on krogh et al.
s categories as seeds following the procedures described in section iii f2.
figure shows how the motivations of our respondents shifted and table iv shows how often each motivation was cited as a reason to start and to continue contributing.
fun was mentioned by more participants .
as a reason to continue than to start .
.
the frequency of mentions to altruism also increased from .
to .
.
reputation kinship and reciprocity also had noticeable increases.
finally we noticed that paywas a more common reason to continue than to join shifting from .

we highlight the cells in which the motivation changed from one half to the other with a minimum difference of three positions.
on the opposite side own use experienced the largest drop decreasing from .
to .
.
ideology also lost positions decreasing from to .
summer of code programs andcoursework also were more common reasons to start than to continue contributing.
in terms of individual migrations the contributors who joined motivated by own use commonly migrated to intrinsic and internalized extrinsic motivations altruism .
learning .
fun .
and reciprocity .
.
similarly of those who started because of pay extrinsic migrated to internalized motivations and of those who started because of career extrinsic migrated to intrinsic or internalized motivations.
the same happened for summer of code programs and coursework.
finally those who started in oss because of ideology migrated to reciprocity altruism .
and pay .
.
the full list of migration flows is available in the supplementary material.
shifting motivations in self journeys contributing to oss often transforms extrinsic motivations to intrinsic ones.
whereas ideology own use or education related programs can be an impetus to join oss individuals continue for intrinsic reasons fun altruism reputation and kinship .
d. rq3a how does motivation to contribute differ for diverse characteristics?
table v presents the odds ratio for different subgroups of respondents reporting each motivation factor as a reason to continue contributing to oss survey open question .
experienced developers have higher odds to report altruism .6x pay .2x and ideology .6x than novices.
on the other hand novices have greater odds to report career 10x learning .5x and fun .5x .
fig.
.
motivation migration flow.
the size of the boxes on the left represents the number of contributors with the motivation to start and on the right to continue contributing to oss.
the width of the connections is proportional to the number of contributors who shifted from one motivation to the other.
the odds that contributors who are years or older report payandaltruism are .1x and .1x higher than for younger contributors.
respondents younger than have higher odds to report learning .3x as a reason to contribute.
the odds of fun motivating coders were 4x higher than non coders.
still non coders have higher odds of mentioning ideology .5x as a motivator probably because of the type of activity e.g.
advocates and evangelists .

note odds ratio greater than means that the first segment has greater chances of reporting the motivation than the second.
ratio less than means the opposite.
the motivations were coded from the survey open questions.
individual characteristics affect motivations social and philosophical factors such as ideology and altruism as well as payare reported more often by experienced developers whereas professional factors e.g.
career learning and fun are more common among novices.
e. rq3b how do shifts in motivation to contribute differ for diverse characteristics?
to understand how shifts in motivation relate to individual characteristics we segmented the data from table iv reasons for starting to contribute and reasons for continuing to contribute as reported in the survey open questions .
table vi shows the result of this segment analysis.
there was a considerable increase in altruism for experienced respondents years of experience in oss and a steady number if not a slight decrease for novices years of experience .
the low number of novices whostarted because of altruism is also noticeable.
the same trends are observed when analyzing the respondents age.
paywas also a common reason to continue for experienced respondents.
on the other hand just a few young respondents joined oss because of career but many of them shifted towards this motivation the number doubled when analyzing career as a reason to continue.
fun also retains more young and novice contributors than older and experienced ones.
we also segmented the data according to the contributors role.
more coders shifted their motivations than non coders.
the only case where we observed a higher increase for noncoders was for altruism.
an interesting finding here is that none of the non coders mentioned career as a reason to join oss but two continued because of this motivation.
on the other hand the decreases in ideology andown use were more common for coders.
finally we analyzed the differences by continents.
overall the shift in motivation was similar for north americans south americans and europeans we did not analyze the other continents due to their low number of responses .
we found more noticeable differences for the shifts to intrinsic motives altruism fun and reciprocity which were bigger for north americans than for europeans and south americans .
shifting motivations in demographics shifts in motivation as individuals continue to contribute are similar across demographics.
one notable difference is in experience experienced contributors continue because of payoraltruism but novices pursue for career.
vi.
d iscussion we used v on krogh et al.
s work as our theoretical framework to analyze our data.
v on krogh et al.
reviewed the literature published until primary studies .
while analyzing the responses to our open questions more than answers per question the ten categories proposed in their work were adequate for coding the reported motivations.
the few exceptions were google summer of code and coursework with a few mentions each.
summer of code programs intend to attract contributors to oss and joining such programs involves several motivations such as money reputation learning and intellectual stimulation .
contribution to oss has also been investigated as a way to foster learning and attract new contributors .
next we discuss some of the key findings in our survey results.
scratching one s own itch is not as big.
we observed a relative decrease of own use both when comparing to prior surveys and analyzing the contributors shifts regardless of their individual characteristic.
those who joined oss for own use related reasons often shifted to altruism learning fun and reciprocity i.e.
intrinsic internalized motivations.
therefore we could observe that intrinsic motivations have gained importance as oss matured.
learning is still a strong motivator.
learning continues to be a top motivator it was top ranked in ours and in prior 1053table vi number of individuals who started!continued because of each motivation by personal characteristics .

in each cell the number on the left represents the number of responses mentioning the motivation as a reason to start while the number on the right as a reason to continue.
we excluded from the table the gsoc andcoursework categories due to the limited number of respondents.
we also excluded the continents and genders for which we had few responses.
we highlight in blue red those cases in which we observed an increase decrease of at least when comparing the second number motivation to continue in relation to the first motivation to start and at least individuals.
surveys.
in fact it was ranked as the second most mentioned motivation to join and the first to continue.
this shift towards learning was observed for all individual characteristics except for experienced contributors.
it is reasonable to expect that highly experienced contributors years are core members who benefit less in terms of learning but continue to contribute because they are paid or can help others.
payment and money are still not pervasive.
we expected financial reward to be a common motivation considering the increased involvement of industry .
however it was bottom ranked in our results.
nevertheless as one could expect the shift to this motivation was more common for experienced contributors.
there is a shift from extrinsic motivations to intrinsic ones.
our results align with self determination theory which helps to understand the dominant role intrinsic motivation plays.
schmidt et al.
argue that individuals have a natural tendency to strive for a balance of externallyrewarded labor and intrinsically rewarding leisure.
research shows that after an initial extrinsically motivated and challenging endeavor motivation may shift towards a rewarding and intrinsically motivated task .
franc a et al.
show that motivation and job characteristics e.g.
pay and recognition directly influence happiness and job satisfaction which affects the intention to stay.
according to these authors although work motivation and job satisfaction are distinct they are closely connected via a feedback loop through a selfregulation process .
our results reflect this movement with oss contributors shifting their motivation towards intrinsic or internalized factors.
experienced members motivations shifted towards altruism and social interaction.
our results are also in line with socioemotional selectivity theory sst which proposes that with age the relative importance of goals shifts as a function of future time perspective .
according to this theory younger adults focus more on future oriented and horizon expanding goals like acquiring knowledge whereasolder adults focus more on present oriented and emotionally meaningful goals such as maintaining high quality social bonds .
indeed our older and experienced respondents often shifted their motivation to altruism related motives.
on the other hand younger adults and novices gravitate towards self related motivations.
therefore improving social aspects of the tools and projects can help retain developers as they age and become more experienced.
indeed our study found that social aspects such as helping others and working in teams gained considerable relative importance compared to surveys from the early 2000s.
our results are also consistent with the findings from sach et al.
who reported people as a common motivator.
the emergence3of social coding platforms may explain this shift.
these platforms offer a variety of social features and helped change the culture of oss from a hacker oriented group to a collaborative community with lower barriers to entry and better support for newcomers .
novices want to promote their career with oss.
our results also show that young and novice contributors often shift their motivation towards reputation and other careerrelated motivations.
this may relate to the new landscape of oss in which companies are key players.
moreover novices may use their oss contribution history as a portfolio and potential employers are increasingly referring to online contributions when making hiring decisions .
a. implications and future work to oss projects and tool builders experienced contributors often shift their motivation towards altruism valuing present oriented and emotionally meaningful goals such as maintaining high quality social bonds.
oss projects willing to retain these experienced contributors who tend to be core members or maintainers could invest in strategies and tools showing how their work benefits the community and society such as who uses the developed features.
1054in response to the increased rank of i deeply enjoy helping others q6 in table iii github and other platforms could offer social features to pair those needing help with those willing to help highlight when a contributor helped someone and make it easier to show appreciation to others similar to stars given to projects .
projects and tool builders should also continue to facilitate collaboration and awareness in response to the increased relevance of i like to work with this these development team s q9 in table iii .
to attract and retain novices who might become the future workforce projects could invest in promoting career fun kinship and learning which are particularly relevant for novices and young contributors see rq3a b .
mentors can leverage these motivation factors to design or adapt specific strategies .
tools like visual resume can help novices promote their career by building their portfolios based on their contributions.
non coders also play important roles in oss communities and their motivation also shifted towards career after joining.
their contributions should also be recognized in these enhanced portfolios.
current developer profile aggregators based on oss data still focus on programming alone e.g.
conceptualizing skills in terms of a list of programming languages .
adding non coder contributions to such aggregators would be an important step towards recognizing a more diverse set of contributions.
although diversity positively impacts oss projects most of the contemporary oss projects lack diversity .
it is important for oss projects to understand and support contributors with different motivations.
oss communities may also invest in extrinsic motivation initiatives to attract contributors.
this will pay off since we observed that contributors will often progressively shift toward intrinsic motivations.
in that sense coursework and summers of code programs can be interesting doorways for oss therefore communities should put effort into welcoming students and applying to programs like gsoc.
to educators employers increasingly refer to online contributions when making hiring decisions.
oss offers great potential to train the next generation of professionals .
young and novice contributors often shift towards professionally important motivations such as reputation and career.
educators should offer coursework related to contributing to oss and discuss contribution to oss as part of software engineering training.
to researchers motivation shifts have been poorly investigated in the oss literature.
previous research has shown that motivation affects behavior task effort retention and participation level.
further research is necessary to understand how the motivation shifts that we identified impact these constructs as well as disengagement and career trajectories.
researchers can replicate our study and further explore our data which has been made available in our replication package.
finally future studies can investigate the reasons behind the shifts and trends we observed.b.
threats to validity sampling bias.
in our case random sampling is not viable since there is no single list of all oss contributors.
we combined multiple strategies to reach a broad and diverse sample as explained in section iii d. as described in section iv we achieved a diverse population in terms of countries projects contribution roles etc.
although the distribution of countries resembles the distribution of oss contributions there is a risk of a country bias.
in terms of countries usa was dominant in north america while germany uk and spain are the most represented in europe .
we also have a small low number of women and non binary respondents which mirrors our population s characteristic lack of diversity .
furthermore we acknowledge that our sample may be biased in unknown ways and our results are only valid for our respondents.
sample size.
we answered rq3 by segmenting the dataset to analyze motivations and their shifts.
in so the dataset gets divided into smaller groups which could pose a challenge for statistical analysis.
however the group sizes we have at least responses per group are sufficient for the conservative fisher s exact test the underlying significance test used in the odds ratio analysis rq3a .
in the descriptive analysis rq3b we highlight only the most expressive shifts those changing at least .
response biases.
as in any survey method our work can have recall bias respondents answer only what they recall and not necessarily what was most important to them in the past.
recency and salience can also affect the respondents answers.
we aimed to reduce priming respondents with specific motivation factors by first presenting them with open questions which allowed us to collect spontaneous answers.
survivability bias.
we focused our study on current oss contributors.
the motivations of those who tried but abandoned contributing may differ.
self selection bias.
participants decided whether they wanted to participate in the survey and this may have influenced our results.
although most international oss projects adopt english as their primary language the language of the instrument may have influenced the willingness to participate of non native speakers.
future studies might translate our survey and investigate regional differences.
inappropriate participation.
as described in section iii e we employed several filtering and inspecting strategies to reduce the possibility of redundant participation and fake data however it is not possible to claim that our data is completely free of this threat.
construct validity.
to enhance construct validity we based our survey on previous instruments.
however these instruments were not formally validated and may inadequately measure a given motivation.
to mitigate this threat we employed pilot studies to test and collect feedback about our instrument.
subjectivity.
we employed qualitative procedures to classify the answers to the open questions and map questions from the previous surveys.
these procedures are subject to subjectivity interpretation bias.
to mitigate this threat we employed 1055multiple researchers with diverse backgrounds constant comparison and negotiated agreement.
all the researchers have extensive experience both in qualitative methods and oss.
vii.
c onclusion the sands of motivations shift over time and differ across demographics.
to answer our research questions we employed one of the most comprehensive surveys about motivation in oss encompassing questions from three seminal studies.
results show that social aspects such as helping others teamwork and reputation have gained importance while some intrinsic or internalized motivations are still prevalent such as learning fun and altruism.
interestingly oss contributors often join because of extrinsic factors but continue because of intrinsic factors.
oss projects can leverage our results to devise and review strategies to support each person to achieve their goals resulting in more people engaging in oss communities.
our results also shed light on the association between demographics and motivations which as fostering diversity is highly relevant to oss communities is important to consider in further research.
