introduction empirical research across disciplines is nowadays driven by the availabilityofbigdataandmethodstoprocessandanalysethem efficiently.
in empirical software engineering massive data from softwarerepositoriesandonlinecollaborationtoolsarewidelyused toinvestigatesocialandhumanaspectsinsoftwaredevelopment.
this intersects with computational social science which uses big data to test hypotheses about individual and collective human behaviour originally developed in sociology social psychology or organisational theory.
data driven studies of developer productivityinlargesoftwareprojectsareanexemplarycaseofhowresearch inempiricalsoftwareengineeringcanadvancecomputationalsocial science.
the question of how factors like e.g.
team size influence theproductivityofteammemberswasalreadyaddressedbymaximilien ringelmann in .
in social psychology his finding that individual productivity tends to linearly decrease with team size is known as the ringelmann effect.
in software project management asimilarobservationisfamously paraphrased as brooks law .
here the anecdote that adding manpower to a late project makes itlater capturesthattheoverheadassociatedwithgrowingteam sizescanreduceteamefficiency.studiesofcollaborativesoftware projectsfoundevidenceforastrongringelmanneffectfordifferentteamsizes programminglanguages anddevelopmentphases .
otherstudies however foundapositivelinearorevensuper linear relationship between the size of a team and the productivity of its members .
thefactthatdifferentworksstudyingthesameresearchquestion yield qualitatively different results despite applying similar methods to data from similar or even identical sources should concern us.referring tothe massive number of projects commits or developers covered in their studies authors often corroborate their findings by the size of the data used to obtain them thus implying thattheanalysisofbiggerdataautomaticallyyieldsmorereliable insights.
this points to an important general issue relevant forempirical research beyond software engineering apart from advantages in terms of coverage resolution or statistical confidence theuseofbigdata alsointroduces new threatsforthevalidityof results.
to address this issue in this work we explore four challenges in the analysis of big data.
we study those challenges in a massivegithubdatasetandarguethattheyarelikelytoexplain ieee acm 44th international conference on software engineering icse icse may21 pittsburgh pa usa gote et al.
conflicting results on the ringelmann effect that were reported in recent works.
a first challenge is the quality of big data that rather than being carefully collected and curated to address a specific research problem are often incidentally generated as digital exhaust of largeonlineplatforms.inempiricalsoftwareengineering thisholds for massive data on software repositories harvested from online platformslike e.g.
githuborsourceforge.whilemassiverepositorydatapromiseinsightsintouniversalsofcollaborativesoftware development they are known to suffer from various quality issues.
these originate e.g.
from the inclusion of repositories that do not relate to software projects projects whose development history is onlypartiallyrepresentedinthedata orambiguitiesthathinderthe reliable identification ofdevelopers .
thisposesparticular problemsforstudiesaddressingtheeffectofteamsizeondeveloper productivity whichrequirereliabledataon collaborative projects thatprovideacompletepictureofdevelopmentactionsattributable to individual team members.
asecondchallengeis population validity whichdetermines whether findings obtained in a given data sample can be extrapolated to a larger population.
on the one hand for reasons of computational efficiency researchers often base their results on asubsetoftheobservationsavailableinmassivedata whichcan introduce biases that question population validity.
on the other hand wecannotnecessarilyavoidsuchbiasesbyusingallavailable datasincepopulationvaliditydependsonthepopulationforwhich wewanttoansweragivenresearchquestion.inmassiverepository data using full information on all githubprojects may be justified if we want to answer a question about the population of github projects.however ifweusedataon githubtoobtaingeneralisable findingsonhowthesizeofsoftwaredevelopmentteamsaffectsthe productivity of team members we must carefully select projects to avoid biased samples in which either small or large teams are overrepresented.
athirdchallengeis constructvalidity whichincludestheissuethatrichandbigdataprovidevariousoptionstooperationalise researchquestionsorhypotheses.whetherornotthespecificoperationalisation chosen by a study is valid to address a research questionisanimportantissuethatinfluencesthevalidityofresults.
inthecontextofdeveloperproductivity dataonsoftwarerepositories is an example of high dimensional and time resolved data.in such data productivity can be measured in various ways and analysescanbeappliedfordifferentlevelsoftemporalaggregation whichis likely to affect the results.
finally omitted variable bias is a fourth challenge that limits the reliability of findings if relevant variables are excluded from an analysis.technically thisisageneralchallengethatisnot dueto thecharacteristicsofbigdata.weneverthelessconsideritinour work because high dimensional data are likely to contain variables thatcanbeusedtoaddressthisissue.inthecontextofbrooks law we can think of multiple explanations for an observed relationship between e.g.

by reducing or increasingthemotivationofteammembers.analternativeexplana tioncouldbeanadditionalvariablerelatedtothesizeofateam and developers productivity suchase.g.

a lack of control for such variables not only introduces biasesintheinferenceoftheactualrelationshipbetweenvariablesofinterest.itcanalsoleadtotheidentificationofspuriouscause effect relationships that negatively influence decision making.
the four challenges summarised above question both the internalandexternalvalidity ofempiricalresearchinsoftware engineering whichcanexplainwhyworksstudyingthesamequestioninthesamedataarriveatdifferentconclusions.focusingon theoperationalisationofbrooks law inthiswork weshowhow toaddresstheminmassive githubdata.ourcontributionsareas follows playto address the challenges of dataquality andpopulation validity we create a large curated data corpus on open sourcesoftware oss projectsthatfacilitatesthestudyof theinfluenceof team size on both individual and collective productivity.
the projects included in this corpus are systematically chosen based on i transparent filtering criteria thatavoidcommonperilsingithubmining and ii a stratifiedsamplingthatsupportsunbiasedanalysesoftheimpactof teamsizeondeveloper productivity.wemakeboth our corpus and the pipeline to filter sample and processdata based on ghtorrent a database freely available forresearchers.

acknowledging that productivity is a multidimensional phenomenon we select a set of eight code and commit basedproductivitymeasures.westudytheircrosscorrelation to answer which of the measures are likely to be interchangeableandwhichcaptureindependentdimensions of productivity.
playaddressing omitted variablebias wefinallystudytowhat extent changes in productivity can be causally explained by the collaboration structure of projects rather than team size.
building on a recently developed method to construct timeevolvingco editingnetworksbasedon gitrepositories we investigate eight network metrics whose choice is rooted in social capital theory.
we study the cross correlation of thosemetricstoidentifywhichofthemcaptureindependent dimensions.
playwe apply our methods to study the ringelmann effect incollaborative software development based on the corpus and methods developed above.
we find a strong and significant negative relationship between team size and individual productivity that can beexplained basedon changesin the collaboration structure of software teams.
we further show thatafailuretoaccountforthechallengesoutlinedabovecan lead to spurious results that suggest a positiverelationship.
in summary we study challenges that can explain the disagreementbetween recent studies of developer productivity in massive repository data.

it further highlights general pitfalls in big data analysis andshowsthattheuseofbiggerdatasetsdoesnotautomatically leadto more reliable insights.
systematic construction of data corpus we first introduce a framework to select and mine projects from githubthat can be used to address the first two challenges of data quality andpopulation validity.
we use it to systematically sample oss projects covering the entire range of team sizesongithub.
we further extract time stamped editing events that we use to investigate whether collaboration structures can explain teamproductivity.
.
dataquality to select suitable projects from github we propose the project selectionand samplingpipelineshown infigure1.
asafirst step we need to gain access to the information required to apply our selection criteria.
because github s rest api is rate limited to requests per hour1 retrieving the metadata of more than million repositories hosted on github becomes untenable.
we therefore usethedatabasemadeavailablebythe ghtorrent project whichhascrawledmostof github srestapiusing donatedapikeys.weusethelatest1availabledumpfromjune2019 that contains data on a total of more than million repositories.
asasecondstep wedeterminewhichprojectsinthe ghtorrent database are suitable to study collaborative oss development.i th a s alreadybeenreportedbytheauthorsof thatthemajorityof projects on githubare either personal inactive or very small and shouldbeexcludedwhenanalysingcollaborativesoftwaredevelopment.
we adopt the filtering criteria proposed by the authors of namely excluding repositories with a single developer fewer than commits or a span of fewer than days between the first and last commit in the repository.
the resulting data set reducestoaround4.5millionossprojects i.e.
.
ofall ghtorrent repositories.
in other words following at least .
of the repositories in the latest ghtorrent database are not suitable for studyingcollaborative software development.
wefurtherimproveonthesefilteringcriteriainthefollowing two ways.
first githubis frequently used for applications not related to software development such as free file storage or web hosting .
our own analysis revealed a substantial number of popular repositories2not representative of collaborative software development e.g.
tutorials on git code snippet repositories or git based clocks which are updated with a new commit every second.
excluding these repositories is crucial to avoid misleading results.
second as a result of the functionality to forkany public repository githubcontains a substantial amount of repositories that are inlargepartsexactcopiesofotherprojects.wedropallrepositoriesthataredesignatedas forkstoavoidbiasesfromanalysingthesame commithistory multiple times.

this underlines the importance of proper data selection when analysing collaborative software development on github.

project activity.
to avoid issues that could arise from mixing activeprojectswiththosewheredevelopmenthascededlonginthepast wefocusonprojectsthatareactivelydevelopedatthetimeofourstudy.weregardaprojectasactiveifthelastcommitwasmade after may .
to ensure this we take a two fold approach we firstselectprojectsfrom ghtorrent thathavearecordedcommit activity after may .
in a subsequent step we then use thegithubrestapitofilterthoseprojectsthatadditionallyhavea recorded commit after may .
project size.
to facilitate an unbiased sampling of projects based on team size we first need to determine the size of a development team.forossprojectswithoutformalteammemberships thisis a challenging task.
the authors of found that the probability of making future contributions to an oss project drops below afteraninactivityofapprox.42weeks.basedonthisfinding we 264icse may21 pittsburgh pa usa gote et al.

table shows the number of projects for different team sizes whereteamsizeiscomputedforthelatestavailable294 daytime window.
the project counts are reported for ten log2 spaced strata which yields a distribution where the team size roughly doubles for each consecutive stratum.
the resulting distribution is rightskewed where the vast majority of projects have small team sizes.
a uniform sample from the complete set of projects would thus primarilyselectsmallprojects whichwouldfailtocoverabroad spectrumofteamsizes.toremedythis wesample28projectsfrom eachstratum where28isthesizeofthestratumwiththefewest projects.
while sampling we ensure that all sampled projects are softwaredevelopmentprojectsandcontinuetobe activelydeveloped at the time of mining.
we further remove duplicate projects that originatefrommanualclonesofotherrepositories.weachievethis by applying the following selection criteria project purpose.
to identify a project s purpose we query the githubrest api to obtain the most recent information on all consideredprojects.wefirstensurethatallsampledprojectsare softwaredevelopmentprojectsandcontinuetobeactivelydeveloped at the time of mining.
we consider a project as a software development project if at least of the code in the repository is writteninthe17programminglanguagessupportedbythecode analysis tool lizard .
in total the languages supported by lizardaccount for over of the code submitted to github .
deduplication.
finally our set of projects still contains duplicate repositoriesthatoriginatefrommanualclonespushedtoadifferent repository rather than using the fork mechanic recorded in the ghtorrent data.
removing these clones is an important challenge when selecting repositories for analysis and independent data sets listing duplicate repositories have been developed .
unfortunately these data sets were not yet available at the time of our analysis.therefore wemanuallyremovedtheclones retainingthe originalproject that was cloned.
thetwo selection criteria require us to query the githubrest api or perform manual filtering respectively.
due to the api sratelimit thismeansthatneithercanbeperformedatlargescale beforesamplingprojects.instead theyneedtobeperformedduring the sampling process.
we treat all strata equally and apply the additionalselectioncriteriatothesampled28projectsfromeach stratum.asshowninthefinalcolumnoftable1 thisyieldsbetween and projects for each of the ten strata resulting in a total of projects with a total of more than developers and over million commits step in figure .

mining co editing networks from git repositories weminealleditsandco editsforthefullhistoryofthe201projects usingtheopensourcepythontool git2net .besidesco editing relations wealsoextractbothcommit andcode basedproductivity measures.
to this end we apply lizard and an optimised version of multimetric to the source code before and after each change.obtaininghighlygranularinformationonthedevelopment processofover200ossprojectsrequiressubstantialcomputational resources in our case over million cpu hours.
therefore we performallcomputationson256computecoreswithinatimeframe of over six months on the eth zurich scientific compute cluster euler.
an additional challenge in the analysis of gitrepositories is theneedtodisambiguatecommitauthors.thisstepisnecessary asdeveloperscanmakecontributionsusingdifferentcredentials e.g.
duetospellingerrorsinusernamesortheuseofnicknames.considering different aliases as different users would lead us to overestimatetheteamsizeandunderestimatetheproductivityof developerswithmultiplealiases.wethususetherecentlyproposed toolgambit to disambiguate all developers in all repositories.
uponmanualinspection wefoundthatsomeprojectscontain very large commits originating from code imports or automated code refactoring tools.
such mostly automated commits are notrepresentative for the coordination requirements between devel opers.
however due to their size they could lead to a bias oursubsequent analysis.
therefore as a final data cleaning step we drop outliers by excluding all commits outside the .5th and .5th percentile regarding their total levenshtein distance.
a complete list of projects as well as anonymised raw data of all projects considered in our analysis is archived on zenodo.org3.
operationalising productivity and collaboration structure to study how team size affects the productivity of oss projects we need to operationalise i the size of oss teams and ii the productivity of oss teams.
in addition we aim to understand how coordination between different team members affects this relation.
therefore we need to also operationalise iii the collaboration structure of oss teams.
we base our operationalisations of all three concepts on the editsandco editsobservedwithinnon overlapping42 weektime windows.
as discussed in section .

ensuring that the time window is divisible by full weeks is essentialtoensurethattheweeklyproductivitypatternspresent ongithub do not bias our results.
in the next three sections we will discuss each of the operationalisationsin detail.
.
team size ossprojectsutilisetheprinciplesofopencollaborationtocreate newsoftware.thismeansthattheyrelyoncontributionsofloosely coordinated participants who differ significantly regarding the size of their contributions.
contributors can further join and leave the team at any time.
due to this method of collaboration no organised ledgers listing the members of oss teams exist.
this makesoperationalising the size of such teams non trivial.
theconsensusofpriorliteratureisthatallindividualscontributing to an oss project should be considered as team members .
withthiswork westudytheproductionofcodeartefacts.therefore we operationalise team size as the count of all individuals who contribute code to a project within a given time window.
this includesalldevelopersadding modifying orremovingcodefrom theproject s codebase.
.
productivity measures before discussing how we operationalise team productivity we needtopreciselydefinethisterm.productivitycapturesoneaspectofthebroaderconceptof teameffectiveness.here teameffectiveness is defined as i the productive output of the work group ii the effectivenessof processesto maintaintheteam s capabilityinthe future and iii the satisfaction of group member s personal needs .
with our study on team productivity we focus on the firstaspect.specifically weassesstheinput outputrelationconsidering the size of the code changes made by an oss development teamas a function of the team s size.
tooperationaliseteamproductivity weneedtodefinemeasures thatallowustocapturethesizeofachangeinaproject scodebase.
for this many different measures have been proposed in the literature.
addressing construct validity we consider eight productivity measures and investigate the extent to which they provide independentinformationontheconstructofproductivity.wefurther carefullyinvestigateand assesshow these measures interrelate.we categorise our eight productivity measures as commit or code basedmeasures .commit basedmetricsrelysolelyonthe sizeofthechangeswithinarepository e.g.
thenumberofcommits thenumberofchangedlines orthenumberofmodifiedcharacters.
commit basedproductivitymeasuresrequirelowcomputational effort and are independent of the programming language used in a repository.
however by not assessing the content of a repository s code they do not allow us to distinguish e.g.
between lines of codeorcommentsthatareadded.therefore wealsoconsidercode based measures that take these aspects into account.
these include measuresbasedonthenumberofmodifiedlinesofcode nloc thenumberofcodetokensorfunctions changesinmccabe scyclomatic complexity or the halstead effort .
we provide a complete overview of the productivity measures considered in our studyintable2.wecomputeproductivityforeachtimewindow andnormalisetheproductivity by the respective team size ts .
to illustrate how different productivity measures can introduce the challenge of construct validity consider the exemplary python code shown in figure .
we start with version one of a file that containsthreelinesoftextwithatotalof53characters whitespaces included .creatingthisfilefromscratchwouldrequirethree line modification events i.e.
three line additions where lines and contain actual code and line contains a comment.
therefore the number of line modification events is three while the lines of code nloc istwo.intheexample wehavehighlightedallcodetokens.
to compute the halstead effort we need to distinguish between tokensthatareoperandsandoperators.thesearehighlightedin blueandred respectively whereasallothertokensareprintedin purple.intotal wehave12tokens.with aandb thecodecontains 2 distinct operands that appear a total of n2 times.
we further have n1 operators that are all different from each other i.e.
1 .
the halstead effort to create this file is thus defined as e n1 n2 log2 1 2 1 n2 2 .
finally the file only has one function without any branches resulting in functions cycc .
withthefirstmodification weaddasecondfunctionimplementing the multiplication of two values.
the bottom left green box in figure shows the productivity of this change.
the code based productivity measures are computed as the productivity difference tocreatethetwoconsecutiveversionsofthefile.forthecommitbasedmeasures thecontentsofthetwofilesarecompareddirectly.
withthesecondmodification wemergethetwofunctionsintoone.
despitetheincreaseincharacters thetokenandfunctioncounts and the halstead effort of version three are lower than those of version two.
if measures such as the number of functions or the cyclomatic complexity were to only increase this would make the code difficult to maintain and prone to bugs .
therefore we also consider contributions reducing code complexity e.g.
by consolidating functions or refactoring code as productive.
we achieve thisbycomputingtheproductivityofamodificationastheabsolute valueoftheproductivityvaluestocreatetheversionsbeforeand aftertheobserved change.
thissimpleexampleshowsthatoureightproductivitymeasures can yield considerably different results.
this prompts the question ofwhichmeasureweshoulduseasatargetvariablethatweseek to explain through the set of features identified above.

in conclusion all considered productivity measures have different motivations.
some analyse the source code at various levelsof detail while others aggregate information at the level of linesor commits.
despite those differences and the strong differencesshown in the example in figure in our corpus of projects and when computing average developer productivities across teams all productivity measures are highly correlated.
.
collaborationnetworks of oss teams addressing the challenges of omitted variable bias we explore how the collaborationstructure of teams might modulate team productivity.
in this way we capture team characteristics beyond mereteam size highlighting additional variables that we need to control for when studying brooks law in rich data.
the inclusion of additionalmeasurescapturingcollaborationstructurewasmotivatedby whichfoundthat ateam snetworkstructureaffectsthe slope oftherelationintheirdata.therefore forthiswork weconsider network based measures that fit this prior work.
in addition we also includesoftware engineering specific measures.

the definitions above enable us to capture the collaboration structure of software development teams in a multi dimensional featurespace.similartotheproductivitymeasures wefindthatthe distributions of some network measures are highly skewed.
therefore we again apply logarithmic or square root transformations.
we report the applied transformation for all measures throughout theremainder of this manuscript.we next aim to select a minimum set of features that capture independent dimensions of collaboration networks.
for this westudy pair wise correlations between all features identify clus ters of highly correlated features and select one representative featurepercluster.whilewecouldinsteadusedimensionalityreductiontechniqueslikeprincipalcomponentanalysis ourapproach provides the advantage that it allows us to analyse interpretable network features rather than principal components.

for all downstream analyses we select team size ts mean indegree ind and the foreign modification ratio fmodr from the set of network measures i.e.

for this we apply linear and polynomial regression models to different productivity target variables where we additionally use the network metrics identified in section section .
as control variables.

we fit a linear cycc ts and a polynomial modelwithmaximumdegreetwo cycc ts ts2 toourdata.
thelinearmodelenablesustoinferapossiblerelationshipbetween teamsizeandproductivity.themodel cycc ts ts2isthebasis to test for the existence of an optimal team size which is captured by the existence of a global maximum of the quadratic function.
the linear model yields a significant negative relationship between ts and productivity as reported in table 3a.
similarly as shownintable3b wefindasignificantnegativecoefficientforts2 for the quadratic model.
this means that on average individual productivity decreases with team size.
that said all coefficients for ts in the quadratic models are positive andthecoefficientsforcyccandhaleffarealsosignificant.
this means that these models can be represented as inverted parabolas e.g.
as shown by the red curve for cycc in figure 4a.
the maxima of the parabolas for cycc and haleff provide some evidence for an optimal team size of or team members respectively whichisroughlyinlinewiththeoptimalteamsizeof suggested by .
however we argue that the key insight of this result is not the exactteam size for which the maximum is reached whichislikelyanartefactofthesimplifiedmodelusedfor ouranalysis.instead thekeyinsightisthepossibleincreaseinindividualproductivityforverysmallteams comparedtotheanalysed range from to members with decreases thereafter.
due to the large amount of remaining variance and the small slope of the parabolaaroundthemaximum interpretingaspecificnumberas optimalteamsizeislikelytobemisleading.wefurthernotethat fortheregression analyses using theremaining productivity measuresastargetvariables thecoefficientforteamsizeisinsignificant.
hence despite the coefficients being consistently positive these models do not provide sufficient statistical evidence to conclude an increaseinindividualproductivityeveninsmallteams resulting in an overall negative relation between productivity and team size.
importantly the models considered so far only partially explain the variance in the relationship between productivity and teamsize.
this can be seen from the low r2values of less than in table 3a and b. moreover figure 4a shows that especially forsmall teams the productivity of team members varies over four decades.
this suggests that additional aspects other than team size have a substantial influence on the productivity of developers.
we thusconsiderregressionmodels that additionallycontrol for the networkfeatures identifiedin section .

moreover the foreign modification ratio has a strongnegative relationship with productivity.
adding a quadratic term ts2 to the model i.e.
prod ts ts2 ind fmodr wefindthatcontrarytobefore thecoefficientofteamsizeremains negativeandsignificantwhileteamsizesquaredisinsignificant see table3d .thus thenon linearrelationshipbetweenproductivity and team size found in table 3b does not persist when accounting forthemeanindegree and foreign modification ratio.
in conclusion in a large scale study using collaborative githubprojects sampled in a systematic and unbiased fashion acrossdifferentstrataofteamsizes weconfirmthenegativerelationshipbetweenteamsizeandproductivityfoundbypriorstudies.
thisnegativerelationshipisrobustagainstthechoiceofproductivity measure and persists when controlling for the team s collaboration structure.
only considering team size as a predictor our data provide some evidence for an optimal team size of or membersfortwooftheeightoperationalisationsofproductivity.
however for six out of eight productivity measures the optimal productivityperteammemberisreachedforateamsizeofone.this finding is further supported by the fact that the squared team size has no significant relationship when controlling for other network measures.
as mentioned above our results suggest that the mean indegree ofdevelopers ispositively relatedtoproductivity whileteam size is negatively related to productivity.
importantly the regressionmodels considered so far assume that the effect of the team sizeon productivity is independent of the mean indegree and viceversa i.e.
theireffectispurelyadditive.however itisreasonable to assume that the productivity of developers in a team with dense collaboration structures is more strongly affected by team size comparedtoateamwhereeachdevelopercollaborates onaverage with few other team members.
this motivates a last experiment where we includean interaction term that capturesthe combined effect of team size and mean indegree as an additional variable prod ts ind ts ind fmodr the results in table 3e suggest a negative coefficient for this interaction term.
however the effect is only significant for comms and nloc.the analysisof the marginal effect of the mean indegree on the relationship between team size and productivity is shown in figure4b.inlinewiththepositivecoefficientofthemeanindegree wefindthatdevelopersinteamswithlargermeanindegreetendto bemoreproductiveonaverage i.e.linescorrespondingtolarger meanindegreestendtohavelargerintercepts butnegativeslopes .
moreover asshownbythenegativecoefficientoftheinteraction term thenegativeeffectofteamsizeonproductivitygrowswith the mean indegree i.e.
lines corresponding to larger mean inde grees tend to have steeper negative slopes.
the whisker plot infigure4cfurtherrevealsapositiverelationshipbetweenthesizeof a team x axis and the mean indegree of developers y axis i.e.
developers in larger teams tend to edit code of a larger number of other developers.
this positive relationship specifically holdsfor smaller team sizes while the mean indegree in larger teams withmorethanapproximately50developersissimilar.importantly the fact that i developers in larger teams tend to have a higher indegree and ii developers in teams with higher indegree tend to be more productive does notimply that developers in larger teams are onaverage moreproductive.thisisconfirmedbythenegative coefficients of team size in all our regression models as well as the clearnegative marginal effects shown in figure 4b.
we note that the positive relationship between team size and themeanindegreecouldexplainthepositivecoefficientfortsin table 3b that suggests the existence of an optimal team size.
we further conjecture that this non trivial finding could be a reason why empirical studies that do not account for the distribution of team sizes in githubrepositories and thus inadvertently focus onprojectswithsmallteamsize erroneouslyfindapositiverelationship between team size and productivity.
specifically projects 270icse may21 pittsburgh pa usa gote et al.
withsmallteamsizestendtohaveasmallmeanindegree which corresponds to a line with smaller intercept and negative slope in table 3b.
conversely teams with larger team sizes tend to have a larger mean indegree which corresponds to a line with larger intercept and negative slope in table 3b.
the failure to control for this effect can lead to a reversal of the relationship between productivityandteamsize i.e.
awrong positiveslopefortheeffect iserroneouslyfound.thiscanbeviewedasaspecificinstanceof simpson s paradox where the aggregate effect in a sample that combines data from different groups of projects i.e.
teams with different mean indegrees can be positive even though a negative relationship holds for each group separately.
limitations and threats to validity afirstthreattothevalidityofourresultscouldbetheoperationalisation of productivity.
to guard against this we have studied eight different measures that capture different notions of productivity.
a commonissueof productivitymeasures thatare basedon commit logdataisthattheydonotaccountforthestructureofcontributed code.
to guard against this issue and appropriately value commits thatdecrease the complexity of code and thus make it more main tainable we consider measures that account for tokens functions andcontrol structures.
a second aspect that could potentially influence our results is the method toassess the size of a softwareteam.
we compute the team size at a given time tby counting all developers who have made a commit up to weeks before t. this approach to infer the teamsizeisnecessarysincethereisnoformalisednotionofteam size ingithub.
the specific choice of this time window is based on theinter committimedistributionfor githubprojectsfoundin .
wehavetestedtherobustnessoftheresultsbychoosingadifferent windowsizeoftwoyears.duetothecomputationaleffortthatis due to the recalculation of all network metrics a comprehensive study of different window sizes was beyond the scope of our study butcouldbe an interesting question for future work.

addressingtheissueofomittedvariables ourregressionmodels explain roughly of the variance in the relationship between teamsizeandproductivity which considerablyimproves thevariance explained by prior studies.
nevertheless there is additional variance in the relationship that we cannot explain.
this could either be due to the stochastic nature of the underlying process or the existence of additional variables that are not included in our models.
