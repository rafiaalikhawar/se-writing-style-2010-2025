reducing implicit gender biases in software development does intergroup contact theory work?
yi wang coco labs beijing university of posts and telecommunications beijing china wang cocolabs.orgmin zhang shanghai key laboratory of trustworthy computing east china normal university shanghai china zhangmin sei.ecnu.edu.cn abstract the software development profession suffers from severe gender biases which could be explicit and implicit.
however se literature has not systematically explored and evaluated the methods for reducing gender biases especially for implicit gender biases.
this paper reports on a field experiment to examine whether the intergroup contact theory could reduce implicit gender biases in software development.
in the field experiment undergraduate students taking a project centric introductory software engineering course were assigned to teams with different contact configurations.
we measured and compared their explicit and implicit gender biases before and after contacts in their teams.
the study yields a rich set of findings.
first we confirmed the positive effects of intergroup contact theory in reducing gender biases particularly the implicit gender biases in both general and se specific contexts.
we further revealed that such effects were subjected to different contact configurations.
the intergroup contact theory s effects were maximized in teams where the number of females is greater than or equal to the number of males.
when the female is the minority group in a team contacts among members contribute to reducing male members implicit gender biases but fail to result in the same scale of effects on female members implicit gender biases.
the findings provide insights into using intergroup contact theory in reducing implicit gender biases in software development contexts.

https introduction biases against female developers are prevalent in software engineering .
these biases could be explicit and implicit .
se industry and researchers have spent a tremendous effort in reducing gender biases and made significant progress.
many software organizations and engineers now can deal with explicit gender biases properly and resist their impacts on decision making at least partially.
however there is still a long way to go to build an environment free of gender biases in software development partial due to the subtle implicit gender biases .
implicit gender biases are not only prevalent among software engineers but also have significant impacts on their decision making in various software development scenarios for example assessing job candidates and evaluating developers contributions .
what is even worse it seems that software engineers implicit gender biases are more substantial than the general public s indicating this problem may not be well addressed in software development organizations .
therefore developing empirically validated systematic knowledge of effective interventions for implicit bias reduction is necessary and urgent.
given that the idea of implicit gender biases comes from social psychology explicitly theory based interventions for reducing such biases should be pursued following social psychology s traditions .
such theory driven methods have been proven to be effective in many social scenarios .
among many theories having the potential to reduce implicit gender biases reduction the intergroup contact theory1proposed by gordon w. allport in his influential book the nature of prejudices has many advantages.
first intergroup contact theory has been demonstrated to be effective in dealing with many social biases in many social sectors since its initial proposal in for example biases towards social groups such as people with autism lgbt racial groups etc.
second it does not rely on forcing people to change their prejudices but takes an indirect way through utilizing the natural contacts in interpersonal interactions to reduce people s prejudices .
third it could be conveniently implemented in an intergroup female vs. male team which fits the nature of software engineering where work activities are organized in team collaboration.
lastly compared with bias reduction methods at an individual level intergroup contact theory focuses on a group of people enabling it to reduce a large population s biases .
1the group here refers to a social group e.g.
women men african american etc.
esec fse november virtual event usa yi wang and min zhang thus it could be a good potential intervention for implicit gender biases reduction in software development.
however applying gender bias reduction interventions based on intergroup contact theory has not yet been empirically evaluated in software engineering contexts.
we do not know if it would work as expected.
thus evaluating its general effectiveness should be the top priority of the research.
so our first research question is rq1 is intergroup contact theory an effective intervention for reducing implicit gender biases in software development contexts?
moreover there are many possible intergroup contact configurations when implementing intergroup contact theory .
when dealing with gender related biases a type of configurations has particular importance is the gender compositions in a team i.e.
which gender forms the majority group in a team.
previous literature has shown that it could significantly influence the biases towards females in a mixed gender team .
thus we may also need to further identify which intergroup contact configuration s would maximize intergroup contact theory s effectiveness.
thus we have the second research question rq2when applying intergroup contact theory for implicit gender biases reduction in a software engineering team how do intergroup contact theory s effects vary under different contact configurations regarding gender compositions?
to answer the above questions we conducted a field experiment with a sample of undergraduate students enrolled in two cohorts of an introductory software engineering course at a large northeastern university in the united states.
leveraging the week long team project component of the course we assigned the participants into project teams.
teams implemented intergroup female and male contact with different configurations of gender composition.
the remaining teams consist of participants of the same gender hereby forming the control sample.
we captured the changes in participants gender biases after the longitudinal contact in their project teams and made a series of comparisons.
the study yields a rich set of findings.
first we confirmed the general effectiveness of intergroup contact theory in reducing gender biases particularly the implicit gender biases in both general and se specific scenarios.
we further found that its effects are subjected to different contact configurations.
the intergroup contact theory s positive effects were maximized in teams where the number of females is greater than or equal to the number of males.
when the female is the minority group in a team though contacts among members did help reduce male members implicit gender biases female members implicit biases exhibits slight increases.
specifically the study s contributions are tri fold drawing from social psychology literature we introduce the concept of intergroup contact theory a theoretical tool in social psychology for biases reduction into se research.
we conduct a large scale theory driven empirical field study with student se teams.
it does not prove the general effectiveness of intergroup contact theory in reducing implicit gender biases in the context of student software engineering teams but also evaluates its effectiveness under different group contact configurations.
we discuss theoretical implications for research into implicit gender biases reduction and practical implications for implementing intergroup contact theory in software engineering organizations.
note that we fully acknowledge and agree that gender is not binary and those people identify themselves as non binary genders also suffer disadvantages in the software development profession.
however in this article we use male vs. female because the vast majority of software engineers identify themselves as one of these two genders and the tensions between these two genders are most prevalent among equality issues among different genders.
paper organization.
the rest of the paper proceeds as follows.

section introduces the detailed design of the study.
section discusses how we analyzed the data collected from the empirical study.
section presents the results and findings.
section discusses implications as well as threats to validity.

section concludes the paper.
theoretical background in this section we briefly review the related theories.
we start from the implicit gender biases theory followed by the intergroup contact theory which is the candidate intervention for reducing implicit gender biases in this study.
.
implicit gender biases both cognitive and social psychology agree on the dual process theory that human reasoning and decision making could be intuitive type process and reflective type process .
both processes are essential in people s cognitions actions and decisions in social contexts including their various biases.
to investigate the biases caused by the type process reasoning and decision making social psychologists proposed the concept of implicit bias .
these biases which lead to both favorable and unfavorable assessments are activated involuntarily and mostly outside of active awareness or control.
for example a team leader in a global software development team may claim and truthfully believe that he or she treats team members from all locations without any prejudices but he or she may always assign easy work to those who in a foreign country where people are assumed to be less competent.
implicit gender biases refer to such unconscious biases related to gender issues.
different from explicit gender biases even people who have such biases often do not know their existence.
however literature has confirmed the prevalence of implicit gender biases as well as their strong impacts on decision making in many domains.
to name a few legal politics business management professional sports health stem and software development .
therefore it is fair to say that achieving gender equality could not be realized without reducing implicit gender biases which often requires much more effort than dealing with explicit ones due to their unconscious nature.

implicit association test iat measuring implicit gender biases.
implicit biases are conventionally assessed using the implicit association test iat .
iat is a chronometric procedure that quantifies the strength of conceptual associations by comparing a participant s reaction latencies across conditions.
in a typical 581reducing implicit gender biases in software development does intergroup contact theory work?
esec fse november virtual event usa iat participants categorize stimuli e.g.
word picture etc.
representing four categories.
let us take the gender career iat as an example to see how it works.
the gender career iat was widely used to assess the bias of associating female with home vs.male with career .
fig.
shows the screenshots of two trials in gender career iat.
the four categories in the gender career iat are female male family career top corners of the screenshots in fig.
.
each category has a few words to represent them for example kitchen is a word stimulus of the category family .
a participant categories them in two different conditions categorizing female andfamily words together with one response key and male andcareer words together with another response key and categorizing female words and career words together with one response key and male words and family words with the other.
career or female family or male her press q for left p for right.
if the red x appears press the other key to make the x go away.
family or female career or male kitchen press q for left p for right.
if the red x appears press the other key to make the x go away.
figure the screenshots of two trials in gender career iat s condition left and condition right .
if an individual performs the association in condition faster than that in condition he or she tends to associate female with home vs.male with career .
thus he or she holds the implicit gender bias that women should value family over career.
the differences in average response latency between conditions indicate the strength of implicit biases which is formally defined as d lc1 lc2 lc1 lc2 with this definition d score s range is usually in the range .
the larger it is away from the stronger the bias it indicates.

implicit gender biases in software engineering.
while the problem of gender biases in the software development profession has been well known implicit gender biases have not received much attention in software engineering literature.
wang redmiles introduced the idea of implicit gender biases into gender studies in se contexts.
they developed two customized se specific iats and used them to demonstrate the existence of implicit gender biases in the software development profession.
their results also suggested that implicit gender biases were hard to overcome in se related decision making scenarios while explicit gender biases negative impacts could be managed.
in their following work they found that professional software engineers implicit gender biases are even stronger than the general public s which further indicates the urgency of dealing with implicit gender biases issues.
however it is fair to say that while se researchers are increasingly acknowledging and concerning implicit gender biases there are few studies focusing on how to reduce implicit gender biases particularly attempting to address this issue in a systematic way.
the study reported in this paper is designed to fill this gap.
.
intergroup contact theory and allport s optimal conditions it is natural to assume that increasing interactions between different groups of people would possibly be helpful to reduce biases under some conditions .
in social psychology such a view is the central hypothesis of the intergroup contact theory proposed by gordon w. allport one of the most influential psychologists in the 20th century in .
since then a bunch of literature across various domains has confirmed that positive intergroup contact does have the potential to reduce explicit and implicit biases.
just to name a few researchers have shown that the effectiveness of contact in reducing biases towards females african american minority religious groups etc .
of course not all intergroup contacts will lead to positive experiences and hereby reduce biases towards a specific group.
for example interactions between groups of different statuses sometimes reinforce biases rather than reduce them.
to maximize the effect of applying the intergroup contact theory certain conditions have to be satisfied.
allport the proposer of intergroup contact theory summarized four such conditions equal status intergroup cooperation common goals and support by social and institutional authorities.
tab.
briefly summarizes the meanings of these conditions and gives some examples or counterexamples.
according to allport s hypothesis and much other extant theoretical and empirical work it is critical to ensure that the designed contact between two groups to realize one or more of these conditions.
contacts occur at an individual level but biases are at a group level.
thus researchers attempted to explain why and how individuallevel intergroup contacts reduce biases.
there are several competing explanations proposed by social psychologists.
for example by synthesizing existing literature pettigrew proposed a longitudinal intergroup contact theory that argues the intergroup contact theory takes a dynamic process consisting of three stages to be effective.
the first is the decategorization stage.
in this stage an individuals personal not group identities were separated from his or her group identities in another group s members cognition thus leading to chances for promoting interpersonal liking towards this specific person.
the second stage is salient categorization in which the individuals social categories become salient to achieve generalization of positive affect to his or her group as a whole.
the last stage is recategorization .
during this stage an individual s group identities are replaced with a more superordinate group he or she belongs to.
other group members change group identities from us vs. them to more inclusive and unified identities.
therefore in addition to allport s original four conditions the designed contact should be longitudinal to allow enough time for team members to walk through these stages.
finally it is worth noting that research into intergroup contact theory is still a fast growing area though the initial idea has been over years old.
for example technologies brought many novel forms of intergroup contact the scope of group became increasingly richer.
we can only briefly review the most relevant yet very small amount of work here.
interested readers may refer to some of pettigrew and his colleagues recent meta reviews .
however the key idea behind various implementations of intergroup contact theory keeps intact.
582esec fse november virtual event usa yi wang and min zhang table allport s optimal conditions for intergroup contact.
condition explanation example e counter example ce equal status the members of the two groups have equal status.
members of one group should not be treated as subordinate.a software development team s project leaders and team members are not in equal status.
ce common goals the members of the two groups should have shared goals which could not be achieved without both teams commitment.members of software engineering senior project team have common goal to finish their project on time.
e cooperation the members of the two groups should work together towards their common goals in a non competitive way.developers and requirement engineers cooperatively to develop high quality software systems.
e institutional social supportthe contacts between the two groups e.g.
cooperation personal interactions should be supported by the institutional and or social authorities.a manager of a global software development team encourages sub teams in two locations to collaborate.
e empirical study desgin in this section we introduce the field experiment design.
the design of the field experiment followed the guidelines and best practices in both social psychology and software engineering .
however please note that field experiment is largely observational by its nature thus usually has less control and fewer random assignments .
.
setting and participants the study was performed at a mid sized university in the united states.
the university had roughly undergraduate students enrolled.
the participants were recruited from the undergraduates who took the introduction to software engineering course during the academic year s fall and spring semesters.
the course was required for students from many computing and engineering schools majors at the university.
every year about students took this course.
it was a project oriented course in which the main component of the course is a team based project.
students were assigned to member teams to deliver an application using the scrum development method.
no matter which major a participant was from he or she was required to finish at least two hours programming courses with grades no lower than c. hence our participants had sufficient technical skills and learning ability to deliver their projects.
because female students only accounted for a small proportion of all course attendees conducting the experiment in one semester could not allow us to recruit enough female participants.
we decided to split the study into two cohorts.
the first cohort happened during the fall semester and the second happened in the following spring semester.
in the first week of each semester we asked if the students attending the course would like to participate in the study.
in the first semester students gave their consent to participate in the study.
however because the study required participants to be assigned to mixed gender teams and the imbalance between female students and male students we could only accommodate of them cohort s sample .
in the second semester students showed interest in participating.
the recruiting process kept the same.
for the same reasons we accommodated124 of them cohort s sample .
together we had a sample of participants in member teams.
we offered to all participants as compensation.
we estimated that the extra time on top of the regular coursework for participation in the study would be less than .
hours sessions of testing implicit gender biases making the hourly rate about .
so enabled us to comply with both federal and state laws regulating minimum wages.
using cash compensation rather than bonus grades of the course also made the study fair to students who optioned not to participate and ensured the voluntariness of the participation.
no other compensation was offered.

experiment overview .
.
experiment conditions.
the experiment had two conditions control treatment .control had two single gender configurations and served as the baselines.
treatment had three mixed gender configurations of different gender compositions.
tab.
shows the basic information of contact configurations.
as it indicates we assigned a code to each configuration.
all f refers to the configuration where a team s four members were all females.
similarly all m refers to the configuration of all male teams.
they are the two control configurations since there was no intergroup contact.
the rest three are the treatment configurations.
f m refers to the configurations in which the female is the majority group females male .
eq g represents the configuration where a team has an equal number of females and males females males .
of course m m refers to the male majority gender composition female males .
.
.
implementing allport s optimal conditions.
the aforementioned four allport s optimal conditions were satisfied in our study.
for the first condition equal status all participants in a team were first year or second year college students at the time of the experiment.
while acknowledging that their social economic background may be different there was not much difference in their statuses within the university.
for the second condition common goals each project team had a common goal of delivering their project with acceptable quality.
the majority of their final project grade was only related to the group performance rather than 583reducing implicit gender biases in software development does intergroup contact theory work?

for the third condition cooperation members of a team had to cooperate with each other to finish the tasks.
the scale of the work and the interdependent nature of software engineering projects required them to collaborate.
peer evaluation among team members also helped to facilitate cooperation.
there was no direct competition among team members.
for the last condition institutional social support instructors explicitly required a team s members to interact with each other.
each team was also asked to invite the instructor to join the team s slack channel so that the instructor could facilitate interactions among team members.
because these projects lasted for weeks we could expect that a team has enough time to walk through the three stages i.e.
decategorization salient categorization and recategorization .

experiment preparation.
the experiment preparation phase focused on recruiting participants and assigning them to teams.
we have introduced the participant recruitment in section .
so we donot repeat it here.
in week participants were randomly assigned to teams by the researchers and course instructors using a random assignment application developed by the researchers.
then we notified team assignments to participants via email.
each email contained a unique access code that helped to track every participant and match him or her to other participants in the same team and configuration.
we did not disclose the study s purpose to avoid the potential biases related to social desirability.
moreover we did not use deception by telling a fake study purpose either.
in the information consent we frankly admitted that the study purpose could not be fully disclosed and assured them that the study had been determined harmless by the governing authorities.
so made this study free of the ethical dilemma and the second guessing effect .
experiment execution.
the field experiment execution phase lasted about weeks from week to .
there were two key data collection procedures at the beginning week and the end week of this phase.
first during week we conducted the before intergroup contacts bias assessment.
each participant finished the first session of online assessment which collected his or her gender biases before intergroup contacts.
participants used their unique access codes to access the online assessment.
they were required to finish the assessment in one sitting.
a daily reminder was sent until a participant finished the session.
then during week the same procedure was repeated for the after intergroup contacts bias assessment.
both the before and after intergroup contacts bias assessments used the same test materials and procedures.
a participant was asked to respond to one questionnaire scale modern sexism scale mss measuring explicit gender biases and finish three implicit association tests assessing implicit gender biases against females of being professionals general career gender career general software engineer se or se team leader se leadership respectively.
their orders were randomized.
experiment warp up.
the last phase wrapped up the experiment.
for the first cohort there was no concrete experiment procedure performed during that phase.
we simply notified them that we would send the debriefing note upon the finish of the second cohort.
we did that to avoid participants in the second cohort learning too many details about the study before their participation.
during 2the week of fall spring break did not count into regular weeks.
584esec fse november virtual event usa yi wang and min zhang the last week of the second cohort we summarized the preliminary results and sent them to both cohorts participants with full disclosure of study purpose and preliminary results.
.
measurements the main constructs of the study are explicit and implicit biases.
we adapted existing psychometric models in social psychology to measure them.
.
.
explicit gender biases.
as we mentioned in section .
.
the explicit gender biases were measured with the modern sexism scale mss .
mss asked participants to respond to statements like it is easy to understand why women s groups are still concerned about societal limitations of women s opportunities .
participants used a point likert scale strongly disagree strongly agree to rate their responses to these statements.
then each participant s responses were converted into a final score.
.
.
implicit gender biases.
three types of gender biases were measured using three iats gender career se se leadership see fig.
.
each of them has two conditions of category associations shown in tab.
.
we used the equation see section .
.
to calculate each participants d scores.
note that the condition 1s in the three iat were consistently against the common social biases.
for most of the participants we expected that condition would result in higher latencies i.e.
lc1 lc2 .
so enabled that most of the participants d scores .
the higher a d score is the more biases against females are.
table the conditions of association in the three iats.
for the word stimuli of each iat please refer to the appendix in wang redmiles .
iat condition c1 condition c2 gender female career vs. female family vs. career male family male career se general female se vs. female non se vs. male non se male se se female se leadership vs. female se vs. leadership male se male se leadership .
collected data in both data collection sessions week and we repeatedly measured explicit and implicit gender biases with the aforementioned measurements.
for each individual we collected score for mss d scores for iats in each session.
thus combining two sessions data each individual s data could be represented by an tuple as follows ew3 ew10 dg w3 dg w10 dse w3 dse w10 dsel w3 dsel w10 where erepresents the explicit gender bias measured by the mss drepresents the implicit gender biases measured by iats d score.
since we were mostly interested in the changes of these measures values after weeks interactions in teams using each measure s value of week minus the corresponding value of week we have a tuple for each participant e dg dse dsel in total there were such tuples.
we were going to use them in the data analysis described as follows.
note that most of the values were expected to be negative because participants were assumed to be less biased after interactions if the intergroup contact theory did work.
therefore the smaller a value is the more positive effect it indicates.
data analysis in this section we outline the data analyses which were performed to answer the two main research questions.
all statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software r .
.
and its associated packages for macos catalina version .
.
.
we followed the asa s principles to report the results and to interpret the statistical significance .
.
tests of homogeneity with the data collected from cohorts and because the data was collected from two cohorts we had to determine if the two cohorts data could combine together before performing the following data analysis.
to do so we performed a series of tests of homogeneity procedures.
we used kolmogorovsmirnov tests to verify if the two cohorts data came from the same distributions.
for example we tested if the first cohort s dg and the second cohort s dgfollow the same distribution.
if they follow the same distributions we could combine them without distinguishing which cohort they came from in the following main effect analyses.
similar procedures were performed for the rest of three measures dg dse dsel .
.
data analysis for answering rq1 since the main goal of the rq1is evaluating the effectiveness of the intergroup contact theory in reducing implicit gender biases the data analysis method is straightforward.
examining the treatment s effect on changes of gender biases values which were repeatedly measured before and after contacts would serve the purpose of evaluating the overall effectiveness of intergroup contact theory.
however we could notsimply use the technique such as t test orone way anova to compare the data between the control and thetreatment .
because individual participants were assigned in teams it is likely that the data collected from participants in the same team are not independent i.e.
there are likely to have some correlations among data cases from the same team.
thus our data is nested data that does not satisfy the independence of observations assumption.
to properly perform the data analysis we resorted to the hierarchical linear modeling hlm technique .
hlm allows retaining data s hierarchical information in the analysis while removing the biases caused by the dependencies among data cases.
in our case we have three nested hierarchies condition configuration and team see tab.
.
we built four hlm models where the four measurements of explicit and implicit gender biases e dg dse and dsel were the dependent variables.
to answering the rq1 we needed 585reducing implicit gender biases in software development does intergroup contact theory work?
esec fse november virtual event usa to focus on the condition control andtreatment .
thus condition as a categorical variable was treated as the fixed effect.
meanwhile theteam was treated as the random effects in the models.
in this analysis we used both control andtreatment s data cases n and built a model for each dependent variable respectively.
the statistical modeling happened at an individual participant level.
we employed r slme4 package to build all hlm models.
.
data analysis for answering rq2 the data analysis for rq2was similar.
we also applied the hlm technique.
in this analysis the four measurements of explicit and implicit gender biases are also dependent variables.
since we were interested in the effects of configuration of different gender compositions we treated it as the fixed effect and team as the random effects in the models.
we used the treatment s data cases only n .
as we did before we used r slme4 package to build a model for each dependent variable.
however we recoded the categorical variable configuration .
we used the numerical values of the number of females in each team to replace the original categorical value.
that is the f m was recoded as the eq g was recoded as and the m m was recoded as .
so allowed us to use one numerical variable in regressions to analyze different configurations effects without adding dummy variables thus providing unified insights of the role of team configurations in the intervention.
.
data availability the data and its descriptions as well as corresponding analysis scripts were made available at other study materials were also included.
results and findings in this section we report the results and findings.
we first report the results of tests of homogeneity with the data cases collected in the two cohorts fall and spring semesters of the academic year which gave permission for the further analyses on examining intergroup contact and its configurations impacts.
we also provide some descriptive statistics to help readers get some intuitive impression of the data.
then we present the details of the hierarchical linear models which could help us answer the two main research questions.

compared with the models which only contains the random effect team all four models have smaller aics indicating that adding the fixed effect condition control treatment yields better models.
for all models we can find that all coefficients of the condition is significant and positive which means that the values measurements tend to be greater in the treatment condition than those values in the control condition.
thus we could say that using the intergroup contact theory intervention brings greater changes to participants explicit and implicit biases3.
to promote an intuitive understanding fig.
plots the pairwise comparisons of the distributions of the four measurements.

simple calculations would determine how much biases the intervention could be able to reduce.
it is easy to conclude that the intervention does help to reduce participants explicit and implicit gender biases.

answers to rq1.based on the above discussions we can answer the rq1as follows in general bias reduction intervention based on intergroup contact theory was effective in reducing explicit and implicit gender biases.
on average it could reduce about of explicit bias and about of implicit biases.
it consistently performed better than the baselines in the control condition single gender teams no intergroup contact .

present the hlm regression models for evaluating the different team configurations effects.
compared with the models which only contains the random effect team all models have smaller aics except for the model of the se general implicit biases column in tab.
.
thus we could conclude that adding the fixed effect configuration femalemajority equal gender male majority yields better models for explicit gender biases and three types of implicit gender biases.
since all coefficients of the configuration is significant we can conclude that different configurations of gender composition have significant impacts on the effectiveness of the bias reduction intervention.
the positive coefficients indicate that having more females in a team is likely to lead to better effectiveness in bias reductions.
as we did before we plot distributions of bias changes in each configuration in fig.
.
we could find that the differences between female majority and equal gender configurations are not quite significant.
both of them achieve relatively good effectiveness in bias reductions.
but in the male majority configuration the intervention s performances are not that good.
we further examine the collected data from the male majority teams.
we notice that the many females in male majority teams have smaller biases changes.
some of their biases even increased.

587reducing implicit gender biases in software development does intergroup contact theory work?

.
answers to rq2.based on the above discussions we can answer the rq2as follows the configuration of gender composition in a team significantly influenced the effectiveness of intergroup contact theory intervention.
the intervention achieved better bias reductions when the females are not the minority of a team.
in a team which has more male than female the effectivenesses of bias reductions might be not comparable to other cases.
discussion .
discussion of findings first this study s findings confirmed the effectiveness of interventions based on intergroup contact theory in gender biases reduction.
it did not only reduce people s explicit gender biases but also helped to reduce implicit gender biases significantly.
by introducing the intergroup contact theory to software engineering contexts we added new tools and brought rich future opportunities for software engineering practitioners and researchers to address implicit gender biases.
note that this study only examined one intervention of intergroup contact theory recent progress in social psychology see section .
allows many different possible interventions.
designing and evaluating novel interventions in se contexts particularly those that can be implemented through online contacts would have important theoretical and practical implications.
second our results revealed that team configurations of gender composition had significant impacts on the effectiveness of the intervention.
we found that the intervention s achieved higher effectiveness when the number of female participants in a team was greater than or equal to the number of male participants.
in this situation almost all members no matter which gender they were had lower implicit gender biases in the after contact bias assessment.
however when females were the minority in a team female and male we observed that some female members gender biases particularly these of se leadership configuration increased slightly or did not achieve comparable decreases as their male peers gender biases did.
the reason a side effect shall be investigated in future work.
moreover we are not sure if such a side effect exists in a larger team that has more than one female but they are still minorities.
though our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the intergroup contact theory we must acknowledge that while contact has shown to be effective there could be potential challenges and difficulties with getting people into contact situations.
for example female software engineers account for a very small proportion in the software development workforce according to .
therefore creating contact opportunities between both genders could be difficult.
on such occasions some alternatives to physical intergroup contacts might provide solutions.
for example as pointed by crisp and other researchers imagined social interactions i.e.
letting people to mentally simulate positive intergroup contacts might lead to reduced biases.
besides social robot techniques may be also helpful .
for instance designing novel interaction experiences with virtual female characters robots may be a good alternative way to simulate the intergroup contactsthat happen in physical environments.
in fact in our study we noticed that many of the interpersonal interactions in the team indeed happened online using tools such as hangout slack etc.
to sum up our work extends se literature on gender biases and sheds new light on how to reduce them through theory driven interventions.
as far as our current knowledge empirically examining implicit gender biases reducing interventions has not been covered in se literature.
this study calls for more future work on leveraging behavioral science to develop evaluate and implement effective interventions to reduce gender biases in software development.
.
practical recommendations the results and findings of this work have immediate practical implications for software development organizations that may plan to implement interventions based on intergroup contact theory to address the problem of implicit gender biases.
the main practical implications and recommendations are summarized as follows software development organizations may leverage intergroup contact theory to reduce implicit gender biases.
in general it could be effective.
when designing intergroup contact it would be better to at least partially satisfy allport s four conditions and allow an extended period for contacts.
using mixed gender project teams would be a good way to implement intergroup contact theory.
however the effects may not be that good if females are the minority group in a mixed gender team.
when face to face intergroup interactions are not possible it may worth trying virtual or simulated interactions.
.
threats to validity similar to any empirical study the work presented in this paper is subject to some threats to validity.
however we have taken multiple actions to ensure the results and findings are free from the most significant threats thus achieving high confidence in the validity of the study.
first from the perspective of construct validity we argue that there is no significant threat.
the main construct of the study is the implicit gender biases.
we used the implicit association tests iats to measure them from multiple perspectives.
the validity of iats has been confirmed by thousands of studies in many disciplines for example management psychology sociology etc.
and also have been tested with millions of participants see project implicit the domain specific se iats were borrowed from literature in which they were developed using strict procedures with the involvement of a professional psychologist see .
the explicit gender bias was measured using modern sexism scales mss which has been proven to be a reliable measure and was widely adopted in thousands of studies .
using standard psychometric models enhances our confidence in construct validity.
however please bear in mind that all psychometric models are nothing more than approximations of the constructs they attempt to measure thus it is not surprising to see the arguments on their validities.
for example yoder mcdonald pointed out some limitations of the mss .
588esec fse november virtual event usa yi wang and min zhang second from the perspective of internal validity we argue that most significant threats have been removed.
multiple measures were taken to remove most of them when performing the experiment and analyzing the data.
for example the participants were randomly assigned to the contact configurations and teams.
we also randomized the order of the three iats.
the week period between two sessions of iats could minimize the learning effect.
besides two cohorts datasets were combined after their statistical characteristics were examined.
however we must admit that we could not control all the factors due to the observational nature of the field experiment .
in addition these factors might interplay with each other thus introducing complicated effects.
for example factors such as participants ages races cultural backgrounds as well as the external relationships developed by them may pose significant threats to internal validity.
future studies in more controlled settings with strictly implemented randomness would help to address these threats.
moreover whether the effects observed in the m m configuration were caused by the fact that the woman being the only one rather than being in the minority needs further clarification .
from the perspective of external validity the main threat might lie on the use of students as experiment subjects.
it restricts the ability to generalize our results and findings to professional software engineering.
the pros and cons of using students or practitioners as software engineering experiment subjects have been well discussed .
given that the study s focus was individual team members interpersonal contact rather than the activity related to technical skills such as programming comprehension it avoided the most significant threat caused by different skill distributions for students and professionals see the first commentary by sj berg and bergersen in .
however that does not mean that the results and findings could be directly applied in professional settings.
thus we urge researchers and practitioners to consider replicate the study in professional development settings.
related work the study connects two streams of research gender issues in software engineering and implicit gender biases in social psychology.
in this section we briefly review research in both streams and position the study reported in this paper in literature.
.
gender issues in software engineering gender issues in software development have been increasingly investigated by se researchers.
the biases towards female developers have been documented in many studies.
lee carver surveyed participants from open source projects .
their results suggested that while the participants were increasingly aware of gender biases in their project a substantial amount of participants still took a gender blind position.
researchers often use publicly accessible behavioral trace data from online repositories to evaluate gender biases and their effects.
for example terrell et al.
quantified gender differences and biases on github by comparing the acceptance rate of pull requests from men and women .
the authors found that a female developer is less likely to get her pull requests accepted when her gender becomes explicit.
recently imtiaz et al.
further examined the publicly visible developers behaviors on github to testedthe hypotheses on the effects of these biases on female developers participation .
by analyzing the dynamics of female developers activities wang et al.
provided an alternative explanation for females low participation in the lens of the competence confidence gap .
stack overflow is another well studied platform.
several studies e.g.
have identified systematic biases towards female members.
the benefits of gender inclusiveness have also been increasingly acknowledged in the software engineering community.
using a large sample project hosted on github vasilescu et al.
demonstrated that gender diversity has a positive association with a team s productivity .
in addition aue et al.
also found that social diversity contributes to project growth in the long run .
researchers also developed a framework and techniques to address gender issues from multiple perspectives.
researchers have explored how to improve women s participation in se education open source development and the professional labor market.
for example researchers at oregon state universities proposed the gendermag approach to improving the gender inclusiveness in end user development .
fairness testing though not only focusing on gender equality provides a unified framework to detect and test software systems for potential discriminations including that against females .
meanwhile since the study using software engineering students as the participants it hereby relates to gender biases work in the broader engineering education domain .
for example mcloughlin summarized three types of spotlighting singling out of women by gender in ways that make them uncomfortable and conducted a longitudinal study to examine how to reduce the type iii spotlighting singling out women with the intention to help them .
her work coincided with our work on emphasizing the naturalness of intergroup contact.
besides it seems that hoeffel s study with engineering students showed the ineffectiveness of that intergroup .
however in her study she did not implement contact but simply asked individuals to self report their experience with female engineers.
indeed she did find having a female engineer in one s family the only meaningful contact in her study resulted in fewer gender biases.
due to the space limitation we cannot exhaustively review all relevant studies in all disciplines.
while se researchers have put a substantial effort into gender biases in software developers we are still in lack of systematic knowledge on the design and evaluation of interventions for reducing biases at the organizational level.
our theory driven empirical evaluated work is exactly designed to fill such a gap.
.
implicit gender biases in social psychology though se researchers have just started investigating implicit gender biases social psychology researchers have built solid work on implicit biases gender and others and how to reduce them.
since section has introduced the basic literature we would focus on a small set of recent work on interventions for reducing biases.
first recent progress in intergroup contact theory shows that the intergroup contacts are not necessarily restricted to face toface contacts in the physical world.
computer mediated online interactions may also serve the purpose of intergroup contacts 589reducing implicit gender biases in software development does intergroup contact theory work?
esec fse november virtual event usa .
when there is no chance to find people from an opposite group imagining positive interaction experience would still be helpful .
some recent work investigates the effects of intergroup contact theory by considering many contextual factors.
for example revealed that negative emotions caused by intergroup contacts might increase biases and lead to discriminations .
even positive experiences may also fail to reduce biases researchers also reported that intergroup contact theory may still work even when allport s optimal conditions were not fully satisfied .
in general intergroup contact theory research becomes more contextual and situational .
this recent progress will guide the practices of applying intergroup contact theory interventions in practices.
social psychologists also developed other methods to reduce implicit gender biases .
one of the frequently used methods is confronting an individual s implicit gender biases.
such a method follows the philosophy that to reduce gender biases acknowledge them first .
confronting methods often have to combine with longitudinal intensive educational interventions to ensure an individual s reflective journey because confronting an individual s implicit gender biases often causes some denial in the beginning or even some interpersonal conflicts .
compared with intergroup contact theory such methods take a long time and consume more resources while offering more effective individualized bias reduction .
it fits for the bias reduction needs of a small number of people in key positions e.g.
policy makers in public sectors .
thus it may be less suitable for software development contexts where organizations aim to reduce a large number of individuals biases with limited resources.
as we mentioned in the introduction the scalability of intergroup contact theory makes it quite attractive for software engineering contexts where organizations may be willing to create mixed gender teams to reduce gender biases at a scale.
concluding remarks this article reports a field experiment that investigates the effectiveness of the intergroup contact theory in reducing implicit gender biases with student se teams.
in the field experiment participants were assigned to teams with five different configurations of gender compositions control all female all male treatment female majority equal gender male majority .
all teams used weeks to finish their team projects which gives those mixed gender teams opportunities to implement intergroup female vs. male contacts.
we captured the changes in participants explicit and implicit gender biases before and after their team projects.
using this data we performed a series of data analysis procedures.
our results and findings confirmed the general effectiveness of the intergroup contact theory as an intervention in reducing implicit gender biases.
we also revealed that effectiveness is subjected to different configurations of gender compositions.
when the number of female members is greater than or equal to the number of male members in a team the intervention could achieve maximum effectiveness.
when there are more males in a team it could reduce male members implicit gender biases but often fail to result in comparable decreases in the female member s implicit gender biases.
our study opens many future research opportunities.
we also plan to continue the work on developing and evaluating methodsfor reducing implicit gender biases.
we have contacted several professional software engineering organizations to negotiate the possibility of replicating the study in their sites.
so helps us to empirically examine the generalizability of our findings.
recently there is also a trend of synthesizing intergroup contact theory with other biases reduction approaches.
moreover intergroup contact theory is not the only intervention that has the potential to reduce implicit gender biases.
there are other approaches that need to be evaluated in software development contexts.
to sum up implicit gender biases and corresponding biases reduction methods should receive more attention in se research.
