previous research on open source sustainability mainly focuses on projects that have already reached a certain level of maturity e.g.
with communities releases and downstream projects .
however limited attention is paid to the development of sustainable open source projects in their infancy and we believe an understanding of early sustainability determinants is crucial for project initiators incubators newcomers and users.
in this paper we aim to explore the relationship between early participation factors and long term project sustainability.
we leverage a novel methodology combining the blumberg model of performance and machine learning to predict the sustainability of github projects.
specificially we train an xgboost model based on early participation first three months of activity in github projects and we interpret the model using lime.
we quantitatively show that early participants have a positive effect on project s future sustained activity if they have prior experience in oss project incubation and demonstrate concentrated focus and steady commitment.
participation from non code contributors and detailed contribution documentation also promote project s sustained activity.
compared with individual projects building a community that consists of more experienced core developers and more active peripheral developers is important for organizational projects.

introduction open source software oss plays a fundamental role in both the computing world and our daily life.
as the advantages of open source model are commonly recognized the number of oss projects is rapidly growing.
according to the github octoverse report from the last five years about million repositories were created in million in million in million in and million in .
however a significant number of github projects die in their first year .
some projects e.g.
course assignments may have no intention of achieving long term sustainability but even with these cases excluded there are still a large amount of oss projects suffering from long term sustainability failures .
if we search over github with the term is this dead more than 329k issues will be returned indicating an enormous interest in whether a project has been abandoned.
the large amount and the high failure rate of oss projects pose formidable challenges toarxiv .06005v4 sep 2023esec fse december san francisco ca usa wenxin xiao hao he weiwei xu yuxia zhang and minghui zhou oss project initiators incubators newcomers and users.
project initiators i.e.
developers who wish to launch and sustain their oss projects may face increased competition and decreased exposure to potential downstream users.
it will also be hard for incubators newcomers and users to locate promising oss projects in their early stages to invest in onboard early or use.
despite the great needs guidelines for oss project initiation come largely from the grey literature with little empirical evidence to support them .
a number of previous studies have investigated how various factors may affect long term oss project sustainability .
however they mainly focus on projects that have already reached a certain level of maturity e.g.
apache incubator projects and investigate factors unavailable or unmeaningful for an oss project in its early phase e.g.
developer and dependency networks organizational ecology number of downloads .
for factors available in the early phase prior studies overwhelmingly focus on technical and process related factors while overlooking participant related factors .
in this paper we argue that early participation plays an important role in determining long term oss project sustainability analogical to how the initial effort of individuals determines the future sustainability of their work teams .
to quantitatively confirm this we ask the first research question using sustained activity as the proxy for sustainability rq1 to what extent can early participation factors predict an oss project s long term sustained activity?
to provide empirical evidence and interpretations for the predictability of early participation in sustained activity we compare variables negatively positively associated with sustained activity and ask the second research question rq2 what early participation factors promote the longterm sustained activity of an oss project?
to answer the rqs we sample github projects from ghtorrent all of which demonstrate signals of continuous development in their first three months and rank top according to multiple popularity and activity metrics.
with reference to the blumberg model we design and extract a set of variables from each project to measure the project s initial participation.
we use these variables and ten other control variables to train an xgboost model that predicts whether the projects will have two years of sustained activity achieving an auc of up to .
.
to identify determinants of sustained activity we further apply lime to generate local explanations for each prediction from the trained xgboost model.
for each variable we divide projects into two groups where the variable correlates negatively positively to sustained activity in the local explanations of lime and compare variable distributions between the two groups to understand the variable s contribution to sustained activity.
the above analysis reveals that early participation factors can indeed be used to predict project future sustained activity and several determinants play an important role.
we discover that the steady attention and commitment of core developers participation of experienced developers especially those with prior experience on projects with long term sustained activity and newcomer attractiveness have a positive effect on future sustained activity.
organizational projects typically require more experienced coredevelopers and more active peripheral developers than individual projects to achieve long term sustainability.
based on our findings we identify practices and strategies effective for incubating sustainable oss projects and provide signals that can be used to recognize long term sustainable oss projects.
our interpretable modeling approach can also serve as a starting point for the development of tools for oss project initiation and selection.
background and related work in the context of oss development the notion of sustainability is multifaceted as is that of success and they share certain fostering factors e.g.
large team size can benefit both project sustainability and success .
an oss project s sustainability indicators may include artifact related indicators e.g.
following a modular and extensible architecture high quality documentation economic related indicators e.g.
well funded low cost of ownership high added value supply chain indicators e.g.
up to date dependencies high number of downstream dependents development activity indicators e.g.
many commits an adequately staffed team influx of newcomers .
among these indicators sustained development activity is an especially strong signal as any piece of software will become progressively less useful if not maintained i.e.
lehman s law .
although development activity has been used as a proxy for both oss success and sustainability chengalur smith et al.
argue that sustainability requires activity to be maintained over the long run whereas success is measured at one particular time point.
in this paper we use sustained activity as the main proxy for studying oss sustainability following previous work .
in recent years the topic of oss sustainability is gaining increasing public attention because a failed oss project can generate a huge impact on our society.
this situation happens because many interdependent oss projects form complex software ecosystems and a large fraction of our modern digital infrastructure relies on such ecosystems .
yet even renowned oss projects suffer from sustainability failures.
for example the log4shell vulnerability in the popular log4j library affects over java libraries in maven central and countless java applications but the library is painstakingly maintained by only four unpaid developers .
due to the high failure rate of oss projects oss sustainability has been a long lasting multi dimensional research topic with a large body of literature.
in the remainder of this section we motivate our research based on two realms of prior work the strategies for improving oss sustainability and the determinants of oss sustainability at either project or individual level .
strategies for improving oss sustainability.
sustainability failures can be caused by many factors e.g.
the departure of main contributors usurped by competitors etc.
and existing studies have focused on various strategies to overcome them.
for example as a good influx of newcomers is often necessary to mitigate the risk of project abandonment studies have investigated barriers to oss newcomer onboarding and explored strategies to help oss newcomer onboarding e.g.
timely responses expert mentoring university courses and task recommendation .
apart from this line of work studies have also shown how well established foundationshow early participation determines long term sustained activity in github projects?
esec fse december san francisco ca usa table variables used in prior studies for modeling oss project sustainability.
due to space constraints we summarize their variables according to the high level constructs used in their paper.

determinants of oss sustainability.
to help stakeholders take timely and proactive action against sustainability risks a number of studies have modeled oss project sustainability in different settings and identified sustainability determinants from different perspectives .
the main variables of interest in prior studies are summarized in table .
we can observe that many variables in prior studies are unavailable in the early phases of an oss project e.g.
population niche user and developer base dependency network metrics and socialtechnical network metrics .
consequently findings related to these variables are only applicable to projects with established communities i.e.
a socio technical network or reached milestones e.g.
releases artifacts downstream projects .
even for the variables available during the early phase prior studies extensively focus on technical and process related variables e.g.
code complexity license features and bug fixes while overlooking participant related factors.
the only exception is wang which investigated the amount of participation and the quality size of the external network as a measure of available resources and social capital at a coarse granularity.
on the other hand participants especially early participants can play a key role in sustaining oss projects as evidenced by previous studies on oss participant motivation and the modeling of individual sustainability i.e.
what drives an individual s sustained participation in oss projects .
for example zhou and modelinginitialparticipationpredicting sustained activitytrain xgboostmodel to predict sustained activity290 255githubprojects sample fromghtorrentwillingness capacity opportunity analyzinglocalexplanationsvariables xgboost lime positiveandnegativelocalexplanationsfigure an overview of the study methodology.
mockus empirically show how the initial behaviors and experiences of oss participants correlate to their sustained participation.
however we are unaware of any prior study carrying out an in depth investigation between early participant factors and long term project sustainability leaving an important knowledge gap relevant for many stakeholders during oss project incubation e.g.
initiators incubators newcomers and users .
in this paper we fill this gap by proposing an interpretable modeling approach that predicts future sustained activity using early participant factors.
our study takes a novel perspective showing that early participation factors can effectively predict long term project sustainability and reveal interesting correlations.
we will discuss in section .
how filling this knowledge gap strengthens previous findings and yields new implications for practitioners.
methodology in this section we first describe how a sample of github projects is collected from ghtorrent to conduct this study.
then we design variables to measure early participation w.r.t.
the blumberg model of performance .
next we introduce how xgboost is employed to predict two year sustained activity based on the variables.
finally we explain how the lime is applied to explain the correlation between variables and the prediction i.e.
two year sustained activity in the trained xgboost model.
an overview of our study methodology is available in figure .
.
project selection in this study we focus on github projects and collect project data from the latest ghtorrent dump version .
ghtorrent provides event timeline data allowing us to reproduce historical project states and collect project variables at any time point which have also been used in previous software engineering studies to retrieve the historical data of github projects .
there are projects i.e.
repositories recorded in ghtorrent.
similar to the dataset filtering process adopted by munaiah et al .
we first remove deleted projects and forks of other projects.
forks are removed because this study focuses on the incubation of a new project at its initial stage note that contributions successfully merged from forks will be considered .
then we filter out projects created before as github only became popular after we also filter out projects created after march as their two year sustained activity status cannot be observed from our dataset.
to filter out projects with no intention of sustaining long term development e.g.
toy projects classwork projects paper 1note that project sustainability and individual sustainability are two different outcomes for which project sustainability is the pre condition of individual sustainability.
studies of individual sustainability are typically conducted in long term sustainable projects whose findings may not be applicable to oss project incubation.esec fse december san francisco ca usa wenxin xiao hao he weiwei xu yuxia zhang and minghui zhou repositories and projects for competitions we only retain projects with a certain level of activity popularity and development time spans.
specifically we compute the 95th percentile of all projects in ghtorrent for the following popularity and activity metrics number of commits pull requests issues forks and stars we only retain projects whose metrics are no less than the 95th percentile i.e.
with no less than commits prs issue fork and stars before the time the ghtorrent dump was collected.
then we further retain projects with a time span of at least three months between the first and last commits which could indicate some intention of sustained development.
after the above filtering steps the final dataset contains projects.
although the above sampling heuristics have limitations to be discussed in section .
the resulting dataset contains mostly engineered github projects with only a few cases of noise e.g.
classwork .
we observe in our dataset that it is common for seemingly abandoned projects to restart development after a period of time.
this observation is consistent with the results of coelho and valente that projects may switch ownership or accept new core developers to get rid of the unmaintained status.
thus it is inadequate to measure the sustained activity of a project with only the first and last commits .
in this study we consider a project as having t year sustained activity if they have commit activity for more than t year s and the median number of commits per month is at least k.kis an adjustable variable and a higher value of kindicates a stricter definition of projects with sustained activity.
we regard the first commit time of a repository as its start time.
table shows the survival status of projects started each year from to march .
the number of repositories started each year that meet our filtering rules peaked in .
for t 2andk we present the ratio and number of projects with sustained activity i.e.
the two year column and projects that are still active within two years before data truncation i.e.
the still active column in table .
we observe that the ratio of two year sustainable projects gradually decreases over years despite the growing number of new github projects per year .
the ratio of still active projects in the last three years is relatively high and fluctuated around before 2to validate dataset quality we sample projects confidence level margin of error and check whether they are engineered software projects following the labeling process in munaiah et al .
.
among them have been deleted at the time of writing six store documents and three are for classwork.
in other words .
of the projects in our dataset are engineered software projects confidence level .

besides the top most widely used programming languages on github are also the most frequently used languages among the selected projects comprising the top languages.
the number of commits for these projects ranged from to with a median value of and a mean value of .
.
measuring early participation in ghtorrent about and of the projects on github have commit activity over spans of one three and five month s .
in this study we measure early participation using development activities from the first m 5month s respectively.
we borrow the model of work performance proposed by blumberg and pringle to identify different dimensions of variables that affect the performance of participants from three different groups core developers peripheral developers and non code contributors.
the blumberg model of performance.
as a classic behavior model in management science the blumberg model of performance proposes that three interacting factors influence the performance and or behavior of an individual willingness capacity and opportunity.
among them willingness refers to psychological antecedents including personality attitude motivational effect etc.
capacity consists of physiological and cognitive determinants such as experience and ability opportunity includes social or technological factors that constrain or enable people s work behavior in an organizational setting.
this three dimensional framework has been used in software engineering studies to predict the likelihood of a developer becoming a long term contributor in oss projects explore why newcomers abandon oss projects and study developer role evolution in oss ecosystems .
core developers peripheral developers and non code contributors .
participants in an oss project may serve different roles e.g.
code contributors non code contributors users potential newcomers and the tasks they perform vary greatly .
in previous work code contributors in oss projects are classified into core and peripheral roles in which core developers are most productive and play a leading role in project development and maintenance .
however other contributors also have their roles to take i.e.
given a large enough beta tester and codeveloper base almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone .
in this study we follow the most common operationalization and distinguish among three types of participants based on their commits to the project.
specifically we consider the participants who made the most commits and whose commit counts add up to over of the total as core developers the remaining participants with at least one commit are regarded asperipheral developers participants who only commented on issues pull requests prs or reported issues are considered asnon code contributors who may give ideas for project future evolution influence development and enrich discussions .
for each project we compute participant level variables as the average of all participants in each group and we expect different groups to have different impacts on long term sustained activity.
in the remainder of this section we introduce how the variables for modeling early participation are defined w.r.t.
the three dimensions of willingness capacity and opportunity.
regarding willingness we focus on variables that represent the strength and trend of willingness.
as for capability we consider both general osshow early participation determines long term sustained activity in github projects?
esec fse december san francisco ca usa capability and project specific capability.
for opportunity we focus on opportunity for newcomers to participate in the project.
we also consider indirectly related control variables.
table summarizes all variables and their definitions.
willingness of participants.
early investment indicates intrinsic motivations to participate which drives developers to sustain contributions in the future .
following previous studies that use effort spent on a project as the main proxy for developers willingness to long term actively contribute we use the effort in terms of cumulative amount andstability to measure the strength and trend of developers willingness.
we suspect that developers whose attention is spread across multiple projects may not be as inclined to focus their energy on a new project.
thus we also use developers level of concentration to laterally measure their willingness to incubate projects.
wp1cumulative effort amount as different types of contributions e.g.
commits issues and comments require varying amounts of effort we measure developers efforts in terms of the average number of different types of contributions made by each group of participants to the project namely number of commits prs issues issue comments commit comments and issue events.
wp2stability of effort we assume that declining commitment may mean a weakened willingness to continue development and a steady stream of contributions implies participants willingness to sustain project development in the long term.
thus we measure the contribution steadiness using the following variables the number of days with commits and the number of commits in the first second half of observation period the median and standard deviation of the commit numbers for each day and the standard deviation of the number of commits made by all code contributors.
wp3level of concentration developers may follow each other and star a repository for multiple reasons e.g.
to bookmark or to show appreciation .
if a developer follows many projects or developers it may indicate their broad curiosity follow ups to new technology or divergent attention.
such a developer may be more interested in and willing to participate in multiple mature projects rather than dedicating as much time and effort as possible to a startup project.
therefore we use the number of developers followed by participants and the number of projects they starred to measure their general level of concentration on github.
capacity of participants.
historical experience is a commonly used proxy to measure developer expertise in previous studies e.g.
code reviewer and crowdsourcing developer recommendation .
therefore we measure how much and how well developers contribute on github by their general oss experience including the cumulative volume of contributions and experience of successfully incubating projects with long term sustained activity.
in addition specific capabilities required by the project can be directly measured through code related variables.
st nciulescu et al.
have identified code related variables that may be associated with project sustainability which will be discussed in detail in section .
.
.
meanwhile developers are usually followed because they are recognized for their historical work so we use popularity to portray developers capability.cp1general oss experience developers with rich experience in oss development and the successful incubation of sustainable projects may be more capable of fostering a project with long term sustained activity.
as previous work shows that experience can be measured in terms of cumulative task performance we extract the following variables to characterize the historical oss experience of project participants the number of commits issues and prs on github number of owned projects and number of owned projects with more than one or two years of sustained activity.
cp2popularity developers are often followed because other developers consider their historical work interesting or useful.
therefore we use the number of followers to measure developers ability to develop useful or interesting projects.
opportunity of contribution.
a major reason for oss sustainability failures is the lack of time interest from core developers and the absence of new developers and an effective way to avoid such failure is to provide opportunities for newcomers to contribute and support their onboarding.
specifically developers may have more chances to contribute if there are more available tasks from open issues.
we are also interested in the impact of using good first issue labels an increasingly popular label intended for marking newcomer friendly tasks .
in addition projects usually provide documents such as readme.md and contributing.md to help newcomers quickly understand project background and contribution workflow.
therefore we use the number and ratio of open issues the number of good first issues the number of lines of readme and contributing documentation to measure the contribution opportunity of potential newcomers.
it should be noted that open issues only represent potential opportunities for newcomers and they may not be suitable for all newcomers because some newcomers may lack the expertise to resolve the issues.
control variables.
some variables are related to inherent properties of developers or projects e.g.
development team size project popularity project owner account type they do not characterize early participation but have been shown to be associated with project sustainability .
thus we include the following control variables in our study the number of members the number of forks project owner account type the number of organizations participants belong to and the ratio of participants showing affiliated companies institutions on their overview page.
.
training an xgboost model given the collected variables our next task is to train a model to effectively predict the project s t year sustained activity.
the problem is basically a binary classification task.
we define project status status as the prediction outcome if a project has sustained activity for more than tyear s we set status and otherwise status .
in this study we use xgboost a library for gradientboosted regression tree learning with clever optimization tricks and efficient implementations for learning and prediction.
we choose to use xgboost because it is highly flexible supporting automated feature selection and the handling of both numerical and categorical variables it has exhibited competitive predictive performance in diverse software engineering prediction tasks and the learned model also outperforms two alternative machine learning models i.e.
logistic regression and random forest in ouresec fse december san francisco ca usa wenxin xiao hao he weiwei xu yuxia zhang and minghui zhou dataset in terms of auc as we will show in section .
.
with current performance we believe the model is able to learn some generalizable patterns worthy of further analysis and interpretation.
.
the interpretable lime approach to investigate how variables contribute to the prediction results of the xgboost model we further interpret the results using the local interpretable model agnostic explanations lime which is designed to explain the prediction results yielded by any pre trained black box machine learning model .
lime has two advantages one is that it is model agnostic i.e.
applies to arbitrary linear or nonlinear classifiers the other is that it allows us to locally analyze the variable contributions of individual samples by local fitting.
for complex nonlinear systems that are ubiquitous in reality the coefficient of a variable is determined by its position in the system that is when the values of other variables are different even if the value of this variable does not change it may have different coefficients.
thus a variable with the same value may have opposite effects on different projects.
for example as shown in figure the standard deviation of commit number per code contributor cmt dev std 4is more likely to have a negative effect on sustained activity when type the project is owned by an organization and is positive for sustained activity when type details are in sec.
.
.
we use the local explanations generated by lime from the xgboost model to analyze the contribution of variables to sustained activity in different project contexts.
given a trained model and a data point lime generates neighborhood data points for that sample and learns a linear model locally on these data points so that the contribution of each variable to the prediction result is locally interpretable within the linear model.
the coefficient of one variable for a data point can be either positive or negative indicating that the variable contributes positively or negatively to t year sustained activity in this data point.
for each variable v to analyze the overall contribution of vto the prediction results on the whole dataset we divide projects into two groups thenegative group where lime returns negative coefficients for vand the positive group where lime returns positive coefficients forv.
the overall value distributions of vin the two groups are compared using the mann whitney u test with bonferroni correction .
we also compute the effect size r and consider the effect size as large when r .
medium when r .
small when r .
and negligible otherwise following common recommendations in applied statistics .
a variable has a large medium small positive effect on sustained activity if the median of v s positive group is larger than the median of v s negative group and its effect size is greater than .
.
.
and vice versa.
results .
rq1 predictive performance we evaluate the prediction performance of our model under differentm tandk.
here the data of projects are collected at their first mmonth s and t year sustained activity is defined with a hyperparameter k. we also compare our model with a number of baselines to demonstrate the competitiveness of xgboost on this problem and investigate the contribution of each variable dimension.
.
.
evaluation metrics.
in our study we consider the area under the roc curve auc as the main evaluation metric because it canholistically measure the goodness of fit and prediction effectiveness at all classification thresholds.
intuitively auc denotes the probability that a random positive sample ranks higher than a random negative sample and it is generally more appropriate to evaluate classifiers with imbalanced data .
we also provide precision and recall at the classification threshold .
as a reference.

though t 2is a longer period for sustained development the model s performance in predicting two year sustainability is slightly lower than that of one year which is also expected as the model needs to predict a more distant future.
at larger k auc becomes better maybe because active projects are more easily identified but precision and recall become worse.
due to space constraints we only report the results for m t and k in the following experiments.
the results are stable across other parameter settings and are provided in the replication package.

.
comparison with alternatives.
to demonstrate the contribution of our variables and xgboost to the final performance we compare our approach with several alternative baselines.
alternative ml models logistic regression andrandom forest are popular models with widespread use in software engineering .
logistic regression is especially popular for empirical analysis .
we employ both models from the scikit learn python package using all our variables as two baselines to showcase the competitiveness of our approach and substantiate its adoption over traditional data analysis approaches.
isolated feature dimension among the variables we propose cmt c p issue c p n cmt actday type and member are also studied by previous work shown in table .
to demonstrate the effect of these variables we show the performance of two alternative xgboost models with only these common variables i.e.
common and with all other variables i.e.
other respectively.
as introduced in section .
the variables are collected from seven sub dimensions i.e.
cumulative effort amount stability of effort level of concentration general oss experience popularity opportunity of contribution and control variables .
tohow early participation determines long term sustained activity in github projects?
esec fse december san francisco ca usa examine the predictability of variables from each dimension on projects sustained activity we show the performance of seven alternative xgboost models each of them using only variables from one of the seven sub dimensions.
previous study we compare our approach with st nciulescu et al.
who proposed using coding process and code quality measures to predict project sustainability.
as shown in table the final model outperforms all other baselines in terms of auc and precision.
although the recall is lower than random forest the higher auc indicates a better overall performance at all thresholds and thus better fitness to data .
without the common variables that are studied in other work the auc of our model is maintained at .

further study is needed to achieve efficient prediction of project sustainability with code related metrics.

with bonferroni correction .
more than half of the tests have an effect size of more than .
which indicates a large difference in the variable values between the negative and positive groups.
in this section we discuss the effect of variables in detail.willingness of participants.
similar to section .
we discuss the effect of variables in the three sub dimensions.
wp1cumulative effort amount as expected we find that the willingness of participants in code contributions cmt c p pr c p is a positive factor for long term sustained activity in project early stages.
the effect of participant willingness in submitting issues issue c p n and adding comments to commits cmt comment c p n is generally negative.
our interpretation is that too many early issues and too much interaction effort in code contributions may diverge participants attention harming sustainability in the long term.
however issue discussions iss comment c p n carry long term benefits.
the reason could be that discussions usually clarify the problem and solution before issue resolvers contribute which thus reduces unnecessary effort.
wp2stability of effort we discover that a steady stream of commits cmt actday has a large positive effect on project longterm sustained activity.
furthermore we find that making most of the commits in the first half of the observation period cmt front and having unevenly distributed commits over time cmt day std has a large negative effect.
however the uneven distribution of workload among developers cmt dev std carries a large positive effect instead which may be because it indicates the presence of highly competent developers and several peripheral developers who are often vital for the incubation of successful oss.
wp3level of concentration we discover that for core developers and peripheral developers both their average number of followed developers following c p and their average number of starred projects star pro c p have a negative effect on long term sustained activity.
however for non code contributors their average number of followed developers following n has a positive effect.
this indicates that the divergent attention of core and peripheral developers may limit their effort and willingness in one single project harming its sustainability.
however participation discussions in issues iss comment n of such non code contributors instead carries a positive effect maybe because those with a broad interest can provide interesting and helpful suggestions.
to summarize early participation from non code contributors and a large and steady coding effort has positive effects on project sustainability while too many early issues commit discussions and divergent attention of code contributors can carry negative effects.
capacity of participants.
we report the effect of variables in the two sub dimensions as in section .
.
cp1general oss experience we find that the number of previous commits and issues cmt all c p n issue all c p n on github generally has a positive effect on long term sustainability as it measures prior oss development experiences.
however the number of previous prs on github pr all c p n has a negative effect.
this may be because prs are often submitted to external projects and thus indicate the developers capacity is distributed among many projects.
furthermore we find that the number of owned projects pro c p n has a large negative effect for all three types of participants while the number of owned projects with one year or two year sustained activity pro oneyear c p esec fse december san francisco ca usa wenxin xiao hao he weiwei xu yuxia zhang and minghui zhou table the definitions of variables and their statistics median mean among different project groups.

rrepresents the effect size r z n means the positive group has higher median for this variable and the effect size is small medium and large respectively vice versa .how early participation determines long term sustained activity in github projects?
esec fse december san francisco ca usa pro twoyear c p has a large positive effect for code contributors.
this indicates that prior experience in incubating long term sustainable projects is a key indicator of code contributors capacity in sustaining an oss project but their capacity does not help if distributed among too many projects.
also owning too many oss projects may imply one s haphazardness in creating projects that are often abandoned rapidly.
cp2popularity as expected the number of followers follower c p n has a large positive effect on long term sustained activity for all three types of participants as a developer s popularity among other github developers is a good indicator of their ability to develop useful or interesting projects.
to summarize we show that participants prior oss experience in coding and incubating long term sustainable projects and their popularity among other developers are positive indicators of their capacity in fostering long term sustainability.
opportunity of contribution.
the opportunity of contribution as measured by the ratio of open issues iss open ratio and the number of lines of contributing file line contributing has a positive effect on long term sustained activity.
one possible explanation is that projects with higher open issue ratios have a better chance of attracting new contributions.
besides more detailed contribution guidelines can reduce barriers for newcomers to contribute.
however more open issues and gfis iss open gfi are usually accompanied by more issues both of which have a negative effect on sustainability activities.
control variables.
consistent with previous findings we find that organizational projects are more likely to have longterm sustained activity.
among other control variables the number of project members member and the ratio of participants showing their affiliated companies institutions on their overview page show comp c p n have a positive effect while the number of stars star and the number of forks fork have a negative effect the number of organizations org c p n has a mixed effect for participants.
our interpretation is that the positive factors often signal a larger development team e.g.
hosted under an organization members affiliations so they are more likely to sustain.
however early stars forks and the number of github organizations do not serve as an indicator of initial projects future sustained activity.
as the largest effect size .
comes from the type variable we are interested in whether the effects of variables differ between projects owned by organizational and individual accounts.
for each variable we divide projects by type and separately investigate the differences between the positive group and the negative group.
after an investigation we find that the most significant differences come from the variables in stability of effort i.e.
cmt dev std cumulative effort amount i.e.
cmt p and general oss experience i.e.
issue all c and pro oneyear c as shown in figure .
compared with individual projects higher cmt dev std is required to have a positive effect on the sustained activity of organizational projects.
this indicates that sustainable organizational projects generally require not only concentrated contributions from core developers but also commitments from peripheral developers.
besides organizational projects have a larger cmt p in the group where it has a positive effect indicating that organizational projects may require more commits from peripheral developers to demonstrate their likelihood of being sustainable.
on the other hand sustainable figure the distribution of variables within the negative red and positive green groups for projects owned by organization accounts and individual accounts respectively.
organizational projects generally require more oss experience i.e.
higher issue all c and pro oneyear c from core developers.
summary for rq2 we find that the following early participation factors promote long term project sustained activity willingness steady attention and commitment from developers participation from non code contributors.
capacity rich oss experience experience in sustaining oss projects and many followers of the code contributors.
opportunity a high ratio of open issues detailed contribution documentation.
to be sustainable organizational projects require more experienced core developers and more active peripheral developers compared to individual projects.
discussion .
comparing findings with prior work as already mentioned in section our work takes a unique perspective which is different from all prior work to the best of our knowledge.
however due to similarities in operationalization our study has yielded some overlapping findings with prior work.
in terms of participant willingness we identify the willingness in code contributions measured by the average number of commits in each participant group as a positive factor.
this finding extends the results of yin et al.
and st nciulescu et al.
showing the total effort of development measured by the number of commits as a positive factor.
however operationalizing development effort with the number of commits could be problematic in mature projects in which merging large contributions into a single commit is a better practice turning the number of commits as a negative factor .
the willingness in opening issues is identified as a negative factor which is in line with valiev et al.
reporting the number of early issues as a risk factor of python package activity.
consistent with the observation of st nciulescu et al.
our results also show that a steady stream of commits cmt actday has a large positive effect on project long term sustained activity.
for the remaining participant factors we are unaware of any prior empirical investigation in the context of oss project sustainability e.g.
the level of concentration and experiences of prior oss incubation .esec fse december san francisco ca usa wenxin xiao hao he weiwei xu yuxia zhang and minghui zhou for the control variables also investigated in prior work their effect is also similar including the presence of an organization and development team size .
we believe the confirmation of prior findings from our control variables could be a signal of validity for our methodology.
.
practical implications .
.
incubating sustainable oss projects.
it is hard to kickstart an oss project it is even harder to incubate an oss project with long term sustainability.
despite the presence of many guidelines in the grey literature they often do not explicitly mention the sustainability problem nor do they provide empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of their suggestions on sustainability.
based on our findings we discuss some practices that may help the incubation of sustainable oss projects.
stability of contributions.
our results for willingness show that not only the large number of commits cmt c p pr c p cmt actday studied before is important for project sustainability but also continued investment cmt day std and concentration small following c p and star pro c p of code contributors.
to maintain stable contributions we suggest that initial project maintainers set clear goals for the project so that developers clearly know what code contributions they can make thus the excessive time and energy spent on the debate after the code is submitted cmt comment c p n can be reduced provide positive feedback e.g.
timely and friendly issue responses iss comment c p n to other developers to motivate them to continue contributing and watch for signs of developer attrition in advance a steady decline in contributions cmt day std and a shift of interest to other projects pro c p n .
welcome to newcomers.
previous studies point out that reporting and resolving issues iss open ratio is an effective way for newcomers to join projects.
we further find that issue comments from non code contributors iss comment n are positively related to sustained activity even if they do not resolve the issue.
it may suggest that commenting on issues is also an appropriate way for external contributors to interact with the oss community.
such interactions can provide feedback to development or lead to future contributions and thus should not be ignored by project maintainers.
some projects may overlook the role of contribution documentation in the early stage .
newcomers may find it difficult to contribute and even wonder if the project is actively accepting new prs .
our results suggest that maintainers should provide detailed contribution documentation line contributing early on which not only lowers the barriers for newcomers to contribute but also expresses the attitude of welcoming newcomers.
competent team.
different developers have different roles in a project and the required effort and experience may vary accordingly.
as far as we know we are the first to characterize the requirements of sustainable projects for developers in different roles.
our results suggest that projects especially organizational projects should pay attention to the retention of experienced core developers with higher issue all c pro oneyear c and active peripheral contributors for higher cmt dev std cmt p .
activity management.
previous studies find the positive effect of making commits and the negative effect of reporting issues on project sustainability .
our results further demonstratethat direct code contributions cmt c p pr c p have a positive effect on sustained activity while other types of activities issue c p n cmt comment c p n iss event c p n gfi do not.
developers can engage in a variety of activities on github projects however their energy is limited.
therefore we suggest that initial project maintainers should be careful not to let these process activities take up too much time and effort since some non code activities take resources and sometimes slow down development activities .
in the initial phase of a project it may be more appropriate to focus on getting things done e.g.
coding and documenting as measured by cmt c p pr c p line contributing than to focus on process reflected by issu e c p n cmt comment c p n .
the latter may introduce unnecessary overhead and harms the motivation of the early development team.
some guidelines suggest labeling good first issues as soon as the project launches .
however only .
of the projects in our dataset adopted the gfi mechanism in their first three months.
even in the projects that have adopted it it may not be as helpful in attracting high capacity contributors gfi has a small negative effect on sustained activity .
further efforts are needed to make it work to help initial projects actually attract valuable newcomers.
.
.
identifying potential sustainable projects.
as open source grows it is likely that multiple github projects belong to the same subfield or provide similar functionality.
for newcomers aspiring to open source development taking part in a project that will die on the vine is not only frustrating but also a waste of time and energy.
for developers deciding whether to use a third party library end users deciding whether to use an oss application and companies foundations deciding whether to invest in an initial project it is also important to identify potential long term sustainable projects from a large number of candidates.
indicators .
based on our results the following indicators can be used to recognize potential sustainable projects at their early stage the contributors make large check cmt c p pr c p and steady check cmt actday cmt day std cmt front code contributions the code contributors have focused attention check following c p star pro c p the participants have rich experience in making commits reporting issues and incubating long term sustainable projects check cmt all c p n issue all c p n pro oneyear c p n pro twoyear c p the participants have many followers follower c p n the project provide a high ratio of open issues iss open ratio and detailed contribution documentation check line contributi ng and the project is owned by an organization account check type and has many members member .
among the signals only cmt c p cmt actday type and member are presented by other work.
our results also reveal that signals in different contexts may need to be adjusted e.g.
sustainable organizational projects are more demanding for developers.
.
.
future research directions.
modeling tools .
our study suggests the development of tools for identifying potentially sustainable oss projects and recommending interventions for improving the long term sustainability in the project s early stages.
our methodology and results provide a promising starting point and interesting implications for tool design.
for example the methodology can be implemented as a tool to aid judgment.
the xgboost model can predict the futurehow early participation determines long term sustained activity in github projects?
esec fse december san francisco ca usa sustainable probability of an initial project and the interpretable lime model can further provide the contribution value of each variable to the sustainability of the project.
newcomers can use the xgboost prediction model to quickly identify potentially sustainable projects from the flood of github projects while project maintainers can monitor their projects and learn how to derive intervention on the projects from the lime model s interpretation.
visualization tools .
also the determinants we identified are often not obvious from the common sources of information while those common ones e.g.
the number of stars are not good indicators of long term sustained activity.
therefore it should also be helpful to have a tool that aggregates and visualizes important sustainability determinants into a central information panel.
other metrics .
apart from the early participation factors that we have investigated factors related to software artifact quality e.g.
code tests may also have an important effect on long term sustainability.
as well known high quality code and tests facilitate long term maintainability so having them is generally recommended for oss project launching .
previous studies have established correlations between code quality metrics and oss sustainability .
but how to apply these code related metrics to learning and predicting sustainability for a larger number of projects and whether there are other code metrics that can predict project sustainability more efficiently deserve future investigations.
in addition projects of different sizes complexities and domains may emphasize different best practices to achieve long term sustainability.
we leave the exploration of this aspect to future research.
organizations and companies .
finally since the presence of organizations and companies has largely positive effects in our analysis we are interested in the underlying mechanisms and the roles that organizations and companies may play during oss launching.
this may provide explanations on why early participation from organizations and companies helps long term sustained activity.
.
limitations correlation and causation.
we applied lime to explain the contribution of variables to the predicted probability from a non linear ml model where lime locally fits a linear regression model for each sample.
similar to regression modeling approaches this approach only detects correlations and does not guarantee causality .
the correlations we discover in this study can serve as hypotheses for future studies that aim to establish causality relationships.
construct validity.
first our definition of sustained activity may not cover all cases in which developers consider a project sustainable .
to mitigate this risk we ensure that the determinants identified from our methodology are stable across different sustained activity definitions i.e.
t mandkchoices .
second while most of the determinants remain stable for one to four year sustained activity see the results in the replication package we acknowledge that several determinants for longer term sustained activity may differ and projects that aim to achieve sustainability over extended periods may need to adjust some best practices.
third our dataset consists of projects with a certain level of activeness and popularity which may limit the generalizability of our findings to projects that do not exhibit clear signals of long term development interest.
however it is worth noting that over half of the projects in our study failed to achieve sustainability beyond two years see table .the focus of our research is precisely on these projects that demonstrate a willingness for long term development but face challenges.
this mitigates the risk of our results being inapplicable to the target projects.
fourth our analysis solely focuses on variables available on github which may not comprehensively capture developers willingness capacity and opportunity.
fifth our dataset selection approach may still involve projects with no intention of long term sustainability and we mitigate this risk with aggressive filtering criteria and a manual evaluation.
the final threat comes from the reliability of ghtorrent which cannot be considered a full replica of github according to previous analysis .
however for our study protocol we believe it is still the best choice and it would be difficult to sample and collect data using only the github api.
external validity.
our study only focuses on github projects and does not consider fork projects.
the findings may not generalize to oss projects hosted elsewhere or oss projects that are initiated as a fork of other projects.
to mitigate the generalizability threat to other oss projects we carefully selected a large scale dataset of top ranked github projects covering a diverse range of software domains.
thus we believe the findings and implications should be applicable to a broad audience of oss developers.
the generalizability threat to fork projects falls out of the scope of our study and future work is needed to investigate sustainable fork .
furthermore the results and recommendations presented in this paper are based on a general analysis of variable contributions and can be applied to most projects.
however they may vary slightly for projects with different backgrounds.
we suggest that initial project maintainers seeking project specific practical suggestions follow a similar methodology by utilizing our interpretive lime model which leads to more precise and tailored recommendations.
conclusion in this paper we propose an xgboost based model that uses early participation factors to predict project s long term sustained activity on a dataset of github projects.
more specifically we measure the willingness capacity and opportunity of participants in the first three months of projects train an xgboost model to predict projects two year sustained activity and interpret the contribution of variables to the prediction outcome using lime.
we confirm that early participation factors can indeed be used for prediction and a number of determinants are identified from our studied factors.
our study provides quantitative evidences supporting the effectiveness of certain practices and strategies on long term oss sustainability which benefits oss practitioners.
we also provide insights for identifying potential long term sustainable projects.
however the topic of fostering oss sustainability early is very broad other potential factors and their interplays may be missed by our study and future research is needed for their investigation.
