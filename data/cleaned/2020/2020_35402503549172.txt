numerous conferences for computer science including thesoftware engineeringfield organizeartifactevaluationswith the goal to ensure reproducibility.
organizers assign badges based on peer review to recognize authors efforts to make their tools and datasets available and reusable and integrate these artifacts into publication processes.
in the software community the artifactevaluation process started at esec fse in and has now spread to become commonplace at most conferences in the area of software engineering and programming languages as well as other communities includinghci communications andsecurity.
as different communities have different requirements regarding research artifacts artifact evaluation organizers use different evaluation methodologies to assess submissions and differentincentive mechanisms to encourage authors and reviewers to participate.

research questions ourstudyaddressesfiveresearchquestionsrelatedtothemeritsof aeforauthors themeritsofaeforartifactusers andhowthese merits for authors and users are linked with ae and publication processes andpractices.

isartifactdevelopment maintenancecontinuedmoreoften for successfully evaluatedartifacts?
rq are successfully evaluatedartifacts more often reused?
rq aresuccessfullyevaluatedartifactsmorethoroughlydocumented?
before we discuss the relevance of these questions for the software engineering community our methodology for answering these questions and the results in more detail we introduce the dataset throughwhichthe questionsare investigated.
.
subjects anddescriptivestatistics the questions in our study are related to the effects of artifact evaluations.
therefore we choose conferences from the se and pldomains thathave implemented corresponding processes.hermann winter and siegmund provide a comprehensive list of such conferences that we use for our subject selection.
as the format and degree of information that conferences provide regarding the conducted ae differs significantly we restrict our study to conferences withproceedings in the acmdigital library dl .
the main reason for this decision is that the acm s guidelines for artifact review and badging4provide a common albeit very general ae framework and that all ae processes adopting this frameworkshouldbecomparableonthatbasis.moreover theacm dl provides uniform formats for proceedings publication metadata and researchartifactslinkedwithpublications which facilitates the creation ofaconsistent dataset.
figure shows the conferences with ae for which we have collectedarticledatafromacm sdlbyconferenceandyear.we refertothecombinationofconferenceandyearas venue.wehadto excludefse2012andmodels2019fromourdataset forfse2012 onlya bestartifactaward wasawardedbytheprogramcommittee.
the number of candidates for this award and the selection process remain confidential.
hence we were not able to identify which articles had evaluated artifacts thatwere considered fortheaward and which had not.
therefore we cannot make any meaningful comparison between artifacts that did and did not undergo an evaluation.
for models only the workshop articles from thecompanionproceedingsareavailableintheacmdl.however there is no information regarding any ae process or evaluated artifacts for these workshops available.
we added ase to our dataset although it did not have a formal artifact evaluation process because available badges were issued for some of the articles and we can therefore assess effects that we attribute to badges rather thanaeprocesses as targetedby rq1.
onthetop of each bar in figure a number indicates the total number of articles in our dataset.
this number may be smaller than the actual number of articles in the proceedings as we exclude keynotes workshopabstracts etc.more precisely we include every article from the proceedings that has an author is tagged as research article or article intheacmdl andhasatotallengthofatleast 4pdfpages.thiscollectionincludesshortpapers asforseveral venuestool papersare short papers that mayhaveundergone ae and hence arerelevantforour study.intotal ouranalysisinthe following sections is based on 3650articles from 64venues.

preparingartifactsforaeentailssignificantamountsofworkfor authors.
however evaluation measures for hiring promotion and tenureoftenarecenteredonthevisibilityofarticles derivatives ofpublicationandcitationcounts notonthevisibilityofartifacts.
whilewedonotendorsetheuseofthesemeasuresforevaluatingcareer advancement it is nonetheless the case that many institutions around the world rely on them and some researchers are forced to optimize towards them.
one hypothesis is that ae positively impacts the visibility of publications .
if this hypothesis holds it may provide authors with a strong incentive to participate in ae.
ifitdoesnot aninvestigationofalternativerewardmechanisms maybe worthwhile.
.
method we measure visibility in terms of citation counts of articles which we obtain from the crossref metadata search10 cf.also .
to link these visibility measures with ae we group articles into four article categories ae with artifact and ae badge functional 11 reusable 12or the old venue specific badges figure1 av.

note that we treat articles that only have an artifacts available badge separately from articles that also have other badges because artifactsavailable doesnotimplyanactualevaluation ofthe artifact 4as discussedfor ase above.

toaccount for confounding factors we further categorizearticlesby a page lengths and b whetherthey are published aspublicorclosed access.inadditiontotheseconfoundingfactors wealsoattemptedto analyze confounding with article topic as per the acm computing classification system ccs .
however we found the spread of ccs topics to be too large to support a meaningful analysis e.g.
theesec fse2020proceedingsfeature75differentccscategories that only apply to one single article that apply to to to and so on.
consequently a stratification of the dataset according to ccs categories would lead to numerous strata with single or fewarticlesand thus impedeameaningfulcomparison.we hence decidedtoexcludetheimpactanalysisforccscategoriesfromour study of confounding factors but kept the data in our artifact .
