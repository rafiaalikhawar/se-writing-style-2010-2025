Abstract —Procrastination, the action of delaying or postponing
something, is a well-known phenomenon that is relatable to all.
While it has been studied in academic settings, little is known
about why software developers procrastinate. How does it affect
their work? How can developers manage procrastination?
This paper presents the first investigation of procrastination
among developers. We conduct an interview study with (n=15)
developers across different industries to understand the process of
procrastination. Using qualitative coding, we report the positive
and negative effects of procrastination and factors that triggered
procrastination, as perceived by participants. We validate our
findings using member checking. Our results reveal 14 negative
effects of procrastination on developer productivity. However,
participants also reported eight positive effects, four impacting
their satisfaction. We also found that participants reported three
categories of factors that trigger procrastination: task-related,
personal, and external. Finally, we present 19 techniques reported
by our participants and studies in other domains that can
help developers mitigate the impacts of procrastination. These
techniques focus on raising awareness and task focus, help
with task planning, and provide pathways to generate team
support as a mitigation means. Based on these findings, we
discuss interventions for developers and recommendations for
tool building to reduce procrastination. Our paper shows that
procrastination has unique effects and factors among developers
compared to other populations.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Procrastination, delaying tasks until later, is relatable to
most of us. Psychologists [1]–[3] and neuroscientists [4] have
explored how procrastination manifests, presenting various
perspectives on procrastination. While Steel defines procrasti-
nation as “a voluntary delay of an intended course of action
despite expecting to be worse off for the delay,” [5], Wolters
et al. frames it as a failure of self-regulatory behavior towards
a desired goal [6]. This psychological phenomenon has been
studied mostly in an academic setting, where studies report
80 to 95% of college students occasionally procrastinate [5]
and 25–50% of college students chronically procrastinate [7],
[8]. Studies also report the various impacts of procrastination
among students, such as higher stress and depression [9] as
well as lower grades and performance [10]. While there have
been anecdotal reports from software developers on procras-
tination and how to overcome the related challenges [11],
[12], procrastination among software developers has not been
studied in detail. Software development is a unique and
important area to explore procrastination. Developers oftenwork long hours on abstract and complex tasks that require
high focus, which puts high cognitive load and stress on de-
velopers, enabling procrastination. Development tasks involve
frequent collaboration among people with varying interests and
skills, and doing so towards building and maintaining massive
intertwined software systems, procrastination by one can affect
all others and the product.
Understanding procrastination in software developers is
important as it might affects developers’ productivity, mental
health, and well-being, as well as the software produced
by these developers. It is becoming increasingly important
to study human aspects of software development such as
happiness [13], work-life balance [14], burnout [15], [16],
and ADHD [17] in the face of high pace development under
immense pressure of job security and uncertainty posed by AI
advances. The goal of this paper is to study the factors that
instigate and the consequences of procrastination, and gather
helpful strategies and techniques to mitigate the negative
effects of this process while letting developers reap the positive
effects. Our investigation involves asking three core questions:
RQ1 How does procrastination affect developer’s work?
RQ2 What factors trigger developer’s procrastination at work?
RQ3 How can developers manage procrastination?
Understanding the effects of procrastination (RQ1) on devel-
opers’ work is the essential first step, as existing research
in other domains shows both negative and positive outcomes
but lacks exploration of its unique impacts on developers.
Exploring the factors that trigger procrastination (RQ2) builds
on this by examining factors specific to software development,
as studies have shown that procrastination varies across work
contexts [18]. Finally, RQ3 helps us to find actionable strate-
gies and insights for the developers to mitigate procrastination.
To answer these questions, we conducted semi-structured
interviews with 15 developers across seven industries. We
validated our findings by member checking with the devel-
opers. Our participants identified various perceived negative
effects of procrastination, but also point to some positive
effects (Section IV). Procrastination has the highest negative
impact on performance, affecting the quality of code and
the ability of the team to deliver features on time. However,
it also has some positive effects on satisfaction and well-
being. Participants also identified several factors that trigger
procrastination, which we categorized into three groups: task-
related (e.g., vague tasks can lead to procrastination), personal

1558-1225/25/$31.00 ©2025 IEEE
DOI 10.1109/ICSE55347.2025.00198(e.g., the mental and physical state of developer), and external
(e.g., communication issues with team members) (Section V).
Finally, we discuss 19 mitigation strategies that help with
procrastination (Section VI), 14 that are reported by our par-
ticipants, and 12 identified by other disciplines like behavioral
science and clinical psychology (including overlap). These
include identifying triggers and approaching day-to-day tasks
with a new perspective. Based on these findings, we discuss
how developers can apply these mitigation strategies, how
tool builders can assist in managing procrastination, and the
productivity implications of procrastination on developers.
II. R ELATED WORK
A. Developer’s work-life
The demanding nature of software development has
prompted extensive studies on developers’ health and work-
life balance. Research highlights the importance of developers’
mental state and happiness [13], [19], [20]. Graziotin et al.
found that unhappiness negatively affects the development
process and outcomes [21]. Benlian [22] reported that agile
practices, while human-centric, can lead to fatigue and reduced
well-being. Sarkar et al. [23] revealed severe (66%) and
frequent (59%) fatigue among developers. Liebel et al. [17]
studied ADHD among engineers and proposed workplace
recommendations. Similar to ADHD and burnout [15], [16],
procrastination also impacts well-being but remains unex-
plored in software development.
B. Procrastination in other domains
Even though procrastination in software development has
not been studied, academic procrastination among students
has been well-researched [24], [25]. A study by Zer et al. [26]
among university students found that procrastination decreases
life satisfaction. However, Hen et al. [27] discovered that while
academic procrastinators desire to change their habits, they do
not report significant feelings of discomfort when procrastinat-
ing. Although research indicates that procrastination generally
reduces academic success, the findings differ for academic
staff. Asio [28] noted that academic staff members often
procrastinate, but this behavior does not negatively correlate
with their productivity at work. Vere ˇsov´a [29] found stress
teachers experience is highly related to procrastination. A
study by Liu et al. [30] on full-time employees in multinational
corporations revealed that life satisfaction, age, and parental
status are predictive factors of procrastination.
Literature often discusses two types of procrastination. Ac-
tive procrastination is intentionally delaying a task, especially
when deadline pressure causes satisfaction [31]. Whereas
passive procrastination is an unintentional delay that leads to
negative effects like reduced productivity [31]. In this paper,
we explore both types of procrastination among software
developers. We will identify its effects, contributing factors,
different types, and potential mitigation strategies.
III. M ETHODOLOGY
We conducted a qualitative study and collected data from
15 professional developers through semi-structured interviews.We then analyzed the data using qualitative coding and vali-
dated our findings by member-checking with the participants.
It is important to note that our findings are based on par-
ticipants’ perceived effects and the factors that trigger this
behavior.
A. Identifying List of Factors from Literature
We reviewed recent literature on procrastination, focusing
on its definitions and influencing factors in computer science
and psychology. Searches were conducted in ACM Digital Li-
brary, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar using keywords related
to “procrastination,” “factors,” and “definitions.” We included
English-language articles from the past ten years, published
in high-quality venues, and relevant keywords in the title
and abstract. A forward and backward citation search was
also performed. We reviewed 29 papers on the definition of
procrastination and seven on factors. Based on the catego-
rization by Nickdoost et al. [32], we grouped the literature
factors into (1) Task characteristics: Task Interest Level [3],
Unclear task [3], [32], Task Workload [32], Task Urgency [3],
Skill Proficiency [3], (2) Internal: Mental State [33], Physical
State [3], [32], Fear of Failure [33], Other Obligations [3] ,
(3) External: Distractions [33]. Additionally, two researchers
identified new factors (task ambiguity, importance and learning
requirements) that they hypothesized to trigger procrastination
in software development.
B. Semi-structured interviews
We conducted 90-minute online interviews to gather data
on participants’ procrastination habits and insights. These
sessions were recorded, transcribed, and de-identified. Partici-
pants completed a screening survey on demographics, attention
disorders (e.g., ADHD), and procrastination factors. Partici-
pants received a $60 USD Amazon gift card as compensation.
Interview Design: Given that procrastination extends be-
yond work life, the interviewer reminded participants to focus
on their role as developers. Participants were assured of confi-
dentiality, and consent for audio recording was obtained. Initial
questions aimed to understand the participant’s work, role as a
developer, typical project timelines, motivation, and the impact
of deadlines. In the core section, participants were first asked
to define procrastination using real-life examples. Concepts
of active and passive procrastination from the literature [34]
were introduced, and participants reflected on these types.
Then, using the obtained list of factors from III-A, we asked
participants whether these factors affect their procrastination
at work,defining it as “putting off work until a later time” for
clarity. The interview concluded with a summary of partic-
ipants’ overall perception of their procrastination habits and
any mitigation techniques they had attempted (all questions in
supplementary [35]). Some main questions are shown below:
How do you define procrastination in the context of work
as a developer?
What makes you choose active procrastination?
What type of tasks are you more likely to procrastinate on?

How does procrastination affect your productivity?
Have you ever attempted to overcome procrastination?
The interview questions and recruitment strategies were
approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).
Participants: We recruited 15 participants (4 women, 11
men) strategically for a balanced gender, experience, work
settings, and industry distribution, as these factors have been
associated with procrastination [36]–[38]. In our study, we
recruited developers from different roles that are involved in
the development lifecycle and not just programming. They
were recruited via convenience and snowball sampling. Table I
lists details of the participants, average age was 31 years,
eight participants had 3–6 years of software development
experience, and seven had >6years. Our exclusion criteria
eliminated participants with self-reported cognitive disorders
and those with <3years of experience, as we posit they may
have confounding factors driving their procrastination.
C. Data Analysis
1) Open Coding: One researcher de-identified and cleaned
the transcript after each interview, and two researchers coded
them using the open-coding method with no prior codes or
factors. Two researchers updated the codebook after analyzing
each interview. For example, in one instance, P4 mentioned,
“Let’s start on the negative side. I think other people are kind
of waiting for you; if the other team is waiting for you to do
something.” This response was coded as causing dependency ;
during thematic analysis, this was categorized under negative
effects, as the participant emphasized the negative aspect
of their experience. To check the reliability of codes, two
researchers performed IRR through multiple rounds of coding
on randomly selected units of transcription until they reached
an agreement of κ= 0.88(p= 1.13e−05). Due to limited data
availability, we coded one participant at a time. To mitigate
this limitation, we performed subsequent rounds of IRR onunits of transcripts randomly selected from participants, in
all subsequent rounds we reach a κ > 0.8. After the 15th
interview, we noticed that we reached data saturation as no
new information or themes emerged from the interview.
2) Analysis: To address the research questions, the re-
searcher used inductive thematic analysis [39] with open
coding (inductive coding), followed by axial coding to identify
the themes [40], [41]. IRR is used in the open coding step of
thematic analysis to rigorously generate reliable codes [42],
which combats interpretability bias in inductive coding. We
only used IRR for the open inductive coding step of thematic
analysis [43] and didn’t use IRR in the theme generation step
(Codebooks and themes in supplementary [35]).
It is worth mentioning that differentiating between prioriti-
zation and procrastination can be challenging, as both involve
decisions about task management and timing. However, they
stem from different motivations and lead to different outcomes.
During detailed interviews, we were able to recognize partici-
pants’ motivations and clearly distinguish these two behaviors.
RQ1: To answer RQ1, we looked into how literature defines
various dimensions of a developer’s work life. Previous studies
have shown that factors such as mental health and productivity
significantly impact developers’ work-life [44], [45]. Building
on this research, we examined the effects of procrastination
on five dimensions of work crucial to software development
adopted from the SPACE framework [46]: developers’ satis-
faction and overall well-being, activity, communication and
collaboration, performance, and efficiency and flow (SPACE).
We conducted a qualitative analysis and found 50 codes
representing the impact of procrastination on developers’ work
lives: 31 codes (62%) indicated negative effects, and 19 codes
(38%) indicated positive effects. Two researchers then grouped
these codes into five dimensions through axial coding. In the
second round, the researchers independently analyzed the 31
negative effects, merging similar effects to finalize 15 distinct
effects. For example, codes like guilt,self-loathing ,shame ,
anddisappointment were combined into emotional distress .
Similarly, two researchers performed independent axial cod-
ing on 19 positive effects and reached eight final themes
for positive effects. For instance, the chance to explore and
alternative solution merged into finding better ideas because
both these codes indicated procrastination give a chance to
find a better solution by exploring other options.
RQ2: To answer RQ2, as a result of open coding, we
identified 37 codes from interviews representing factors that
triggered participants’ procrastination. Then, two researchers
performed axial coding on the 37 codes and came to 18
thematic codes presenting various factors of procrastination.
Further, two researchers categorized these factors into three
groups: Task-related, Personal, and External factors.
RQ3: To find the mitigation techniques, two researchers
coded participants responses to our mitigation strategy ques-
tions and identified 19 codes. Researchers merged techniques
with similar contexts and agreed on the final 14 techniques.
3) Validation: After conducting the qualitative analysis, we
performed member checking with our participants. Our initial
31206findings on the effects and factors of procrastination, as well
as the types of procrastination, were sent to the participants for
feedback. All participants agreed with the results, and seven
participants responded with additional positive feedback, stat-
ing they found our results insightful (see supplementary [35]).
IV. H OW DOES PROCRASTINATION AFFECT WORK?
In the interviews, participants elaborated on their under-
standing of procrastination and its positive and negative effects
on their work. In this section, we discussed the effects in detail;
negative effects are indicated with /times, and positives with ✓.
A. Negative effects of procrastination on participants’s work
We examine the negative effects of procrastination, which
were discussed in the interviews. Table II lists 15 negative
effects with definitions and examples. The Ptscolumn uses
a dot plot to show which participants mentioned each effect:
the first row represents P1-P5, the second row P6-P10, and the
third row P11-P15. The Freq column shows the total mentions
per effect, e.g., /timesPersonal Life Disruption was cited six times
by P2 and P5. Effects are grouped into five work dimensions,
indicated by row separators. We discuss the negative impact
of procrastination for each dimension.
Satisfaction & Well-being. All participants mentioned suf-
fering from /timesEmotional Distress stemming from a nagging
discomfort [P8,10,11], “personal disappointment” [P3], “guilt”
[P9,15], or “frustration” [P12]. Beyond the impact on personal
values, P11 mentioned feeling “social shame” that impacted
their perception of how others judge them: “I don’t know
where shame is coming from other than my sense of feeling
I should be doing this and not being able to fulfill that.”
10 participants experienced high levels of /timesAnxiety & Stress
due to procrastination. Seven participants [P1-3,9,10,12,13]
reported it led to experiencing a “huge amount of stress” [P3]
due to “not starting the task sooner” [P13]. P2 mentioned,
“It could be stressful, like coming up to the deadline for the
thing that you’re procrastinating [on]. It was a lot.” Stress and
anxiety created a downward spiral, intensifying each other
and ultimately causing not being able to finish the task [P3,6].
Three participants [P2,4,5] mentioned frequent procrastination
at work could convert to the habit of delaying things, and over
time, it reduced their /timesWork-life Balance . P2 said,
“If you’re delaying stuff enough and you’re doing it too often,
then you just kind of become lackadaisical.”
Performance. 13 out of 15 participants mentioned four neg-
ative effects of procrastination on the performance dimen-
sion. 13 participants mentioned that procrastination caused
/timesreduced individual performance at work for writing low-
quality code [P1-4,6-9,13,15] or delayed delivery [P2-4,6-
9,13,15]. Further, six participants directly associated pro-
crastination with reduced performance evaluation ratings
[P1,7,9,10,11,15]. P2 explained the relation between procras-
tination and performance, stating:
“I think [procrastination ] affects the quality. And that, in turn,
affects productivity. Because if something has less quality, I’ll
have to work more on it.”Seven participants [P3-5,7,9,13,14] reported procrastination
caused/timesmore technical debt through delays and unresolved
dependencies, hindering “test[ing] or other dependent tasks”
[P5,7,9] and leaving issues unresolved [P13,14]. Eight partici-
pants highlighted procrastination’s role in /timesteam performance
degradation . Three participants [P3,7,12] described how one
member’s procrastination delayed team tasks, negatively im-
pacting the team or business [P2]. P4, a manager, shared
that procrastination in some team members caused the whole
team to wait to “give [them] feedback on the designs” for
subsequent tasks. Participants who experienced these delays
shared that the team “has to work a lot harder to finish the
task” [P10,15] to avoid missing a deliverable and eventually
“hurting the image of the team,” [P12] in other’s perception.
Five participants reported that procrastination at work results
in/timesmissed deadlines . Participants emphasized the notion that
procrastination created a chain of delays, where subsequent
tasks and overall projects “become late” [P1,2,5] or “aren’t
going to be met!” [P1,9,10]. P11 summarized the effect of
procrastination on performance, stating, “Y ou hear of people
getting lower ratings for not having a significant impact through
the year [which] might be a direct result of procrastinating on
important projects.”
Activity. Seven participants directly linked their procrastination
to/timesproducing less code . Eventually, they didn’t have enough
time to implement everything necessary for the task, writing
fewer “lines of code they committed” [P3,5,6]. Participants
noted that this resulted in “finishing fewer features” [P8] or “not
completing the number of story points” [P10] they committed to.
Beyond these, procrastination affects team activities like code
reviews. P9 explained in this:
“If you’re procrastinating on reviewing someone’s code, you’re
not leaving a lot of comments.”
P11 associated procrastination with ”all the [tasks] that didn’t
get done,” resulting in reduced activity.
Communication & Collaboration. 14 participants noted that
procrastination /timesstrained team culture [P2,9,12] and created a
negative social reputation [P2,4,9,13,14] for the procrastinator,
which all generates an obstacle in having effective and good
communication [P1-15] with team members or reduced collab-
oration opportunities with other teams [P2-4,7,9]. Participants
further linked procrastination to lowered quality of team com-
munication due to causing stress [P2,6], inconsistent update
[P4]. P2 elaborated as “[she’s] going to be communicating better
if [she’s] not as stressed because of procrastination ” . Delayed
delivery of a task, or waiting until the last minute, can cause
/timesweakening of trust between coworkers [P4,10,12]. P4 shared:
“I know from now on this person is going to take longer to get
back on something.”
P12 shared how he felt “people lose trust” in his contributions
when he “procrastinates during a collaboration.”
Efficiency & Flow. 14 participants mentioned negative ef-
fects on their efficiency and flow. Nine participants cited the
need to make a /timescompensatory effort for delays caused by
procrastination. When participants’ procrastination made them

inefficient, spending less time than needed on a task during
work hours, they had to spend their non-work time to meet the
deadline. Participants had to “put in all-nighters” [P1,8], “stay
up later at work with coworkers” [P2], and “stay at work after
5 pm” [P7,9,10,13]. P12 indicated that compensation for the
delay was at the expense of his personal time as well.
Nine participants shared how procrastination caused
/timesworkflow disruption . Some participants reported that pro-
crastination interrupted their flow [P1,2,5], while others shared
how procrastination eventually prolonged the flow by “making
more work for later” [P7,10,14]. P11 shared his struggles with
maintaining flow due to procrastination:
“I’m missing out on not sustaining tasks for an hour or two
hours at a time.”
Five participants found procrastination caused /timescascading
of delays throughout the project [P1,6]. Participants mentioned
that delaying one task creates a “domino effect of delays” [P9],
and sometimes “the [task] gets moved to the next sprint.” [P10]
This decreases the efficiency of the sprint and overall project
progress. Four participants shared that procrastination caused
/timesnegative financial implications , including missed deadlinesleading to “financial consequences” [P1], and “less revenue”
for the organization [P7,8,11].
B. Positive effects of procrastination on work.
Table III lists the eight positive effects of procrastination,
along with their definition and examples. Here, we discuss the
positive of procrastination along each dimension.
Satisfaction & Well-being. Overall, 12 out of 15 participants
mentioned one of the positive effects in this dimension.Eight
participants reported improvement in their mental state when
they procrastinated by ✓taking breaks . Taking breaks helped
to“avoid burnouts” [P1,5,15] caused by complex and long-term
projects. It also improved their mood [P7], brought happiness,
and refreshed their mind [P12]. P11 summarized this effect,
stating:
“taking a step away from this and delaying your work on it can
actually allow you to come back with a fresh mindset.”
Four participants found procrastination beneficial when
used as a✓short term stress relief technique. Participants
highlighted the role of following the “immediate feelings and
impulses to procrastinate” [P7] in increasing their “overall sat-
isfaction and well-being.” When faced with stressful scenarios

Short Term Stress
ReliefTemporary relief from stress through brief
avoidance of the task.“I have noticed the benefits would probably be more of a de-
stressing kind of tool . . . short-term de-stressing.” [P5]
 13
Time for Personal

tributing to a better work-life balance.“Meanwhile, someone else is doing the work. So, I’m procrasti-
nating. But, like, I’m benefiting from it indirectly.” [P1]

Increased
ConfidenceEnhanced self-confidence by managing de-
layed tasks in a short time near the deadline.“You get to realize how, like, how good you are at working things
really quickly.” [P1]
 3
PERFORMANCE
Better Creativity Having more time for reflection, exploration
and generating ideas.“During an eight-hour day, aside from a lunch break, taking a
five to ten-minute break every hour can be very beneficial.” [P7]
 9
ACTIVITY
Avoiding Unnec-
essary WorkDelays in addressing a task leads to the issue
resolving itself, saving effort and resources.“Somebody makes a decision that overrides what you were going
to build anyway, where there’s unstable decision making in a
company like that can resolve itself.” [P4]
8
COMMUNICATION & COLLABORATION
Socializing at
WorkEngaging in conversations, and building re-
lationships at work.“If we are really talking about interesting topics and to me, that
is kind of procrastination for work that needs to get done.” [P12]

or complex tasks, participants delay starting the task to gain
short-term happiness [P2,5,11]. However, they noted that “in
the long term [procrastination] probably won’t be good” as it
“decreases productivity” [P2], with P7 acknowledging initial
comfort turning into frustration as deadlines loomed and tasks
remained incomplete. Three participants stated procrastination
helped them to “focus on [non-development] tasks.” [P1] and
have time [P14] for “equally important things from the personal
side,” even at the expense of delaying the task at work [P3].
Two participants claimed “doing a task in a short amount of
time” [P1,15] gives them some “self-confidence” [P15] of being
“capable of doing the task.” [P1]
Performance. Five participants mentioned the positive im-
pact of procrastination on their performance at work. Five
participants credited procrastination with ✓Better Creativity
for their problem or solution approach [P2,3,6]. Participants
found procrastinating on a task earned them “more time to
think a lot about [the task] before actually writing the code” [P2]
and “explore other ideas” [P6]. Participants also shared that
procrastinating by switching to a familiar task triggered a novel
solution in their minds [P7,10]. P10 illustrated:
“[he’s] working on task A, in the back of [his] brain, [he’s]
thinking, maybe [he] could do task B like this, like this, and
[he] already sort of [has] an idea!””
Activity. Five participants recognized that procrastination
helps to✓avoid unnecessary work on tasks: they “didn’t
actually need that feature” [P2], “the group solved the problem
themselves” [P10], or the task was “no longer a big priority”
[P13]. Additionally, delaying tasks due to “unstable decision-
making” [P4] or unclear project scope turned out to be bene-
ficial, as it helped avoid “redoing stuff” [P6].Communication & Collaboration. Three participants found
procrastination increases ✓socializing at work [P5,9,12,16].
P15 elaborated “If you’re procrastinating and engaging in con-
versation with your coworkers, you’re socializing and improving
your social connections.” Participants found spending extra
time during breaks to talk to team members or having lunch
together helped “build their network” [P9] and have a “super
engaged” [P12] team.
Efficiency & Flow. Eight participants experienced increased
short-term✓near-deadline efficiency as their deadlines ap-
proached [P1,7-9,11,13-15]. P7 explained when he procrasti-
nated and “[he is] near the deadline, [he] tries to be as efficient
as possible; [he] spends more time on that.”
/arrow-circle-righ◎Summary: Our findings revealed that procrastination
has both negative and positive effects. It negatively im-
pacted developers’ well-being, leading to lower perfor-
mance, reduced code quality, and fewer delivered features.
However, some participants highlighted benefits, such as
enhanced creativity and near-deadline efficiency.
V. W HAT FACTORS TRIGGER PROCRASTINATION AT WORK ?
To understand how we can mitigate the negative effects
of procrastination while preserving positive ones, we need to
first identify the factors that trigger procrastination. During the
interview, participants identified and elaborated on new factors
that triggered procrastination. From the qualitative analysis,
we identified 22 distinct factors, which we grouped into three
categories as shown in Table IV.
Task-Related factors. All participants noted that their
/bol◎interest in the task influenced procrastination. Three par-

ticipants [P1,10,15] procrastinated more when they lacked
interest or intrinsic motivation [P15], with P5 stating, “I like
coding more than writing, so I procrastinate less on coding.”
Additionally, 13 participants procrastinated more on tasks
they considered of low /bol◎subjective importance or value [P1-
4,6,8,9,11,12,15]. P13 observed, “I’ve seen a pattern that if the
task is not as important as they make it sound, then I tend to
procrastinate sometimes.”
12 participants procrastinated differently based on /bol◎task
difficulty . Some participants procrastinated on easy tasks that
they were confident they could finish quickly or had done
before [P7,9]. Two participants mentioned they started work-
ing early on tasks they “have not done before” [P2] or are
not good at [P8], as it was difficult to estimate how long
the task would take. Whereas six participants mentioned that
they procrastinated on both too-hard and too-easy tasks. P11
clarified, “If the task is super easy or the task is super hard,
I think I’m more likely to procrastinate it.” When a task was
too easy, participants delayed working on it as they could
make a “good time estimation” [P4,5] and were confident they
could finish it in time [P4,13]. Whereas if the task was
too difficult, they delayed it until another developer joined
[P1] or they lost interest in the task [P11]. 12 participants
mentioned/bol◎vagueness in task definitions or project scope
triggered procrastination. Participants specifically mentioned
that committing to a task with “undefined goals” [P2,7] or
“unclear project scope” [P6] is unwise. Participants tended to
delay working on vague tasks until further information was
provided [P3,15] as P15 indicated that:
“I was procrastinating and just waiting for other people to give
me some guideline or instruction.”
Additionally, P12 highlighted vagueness is more prevalent
in the initial phases of the project since “everything is not
well-defined.” Eight participants tended to procrastinate more
on time-consuming [P3,5] and complex tasks that needed more
effort, like “reviewing the whole code base” [P1] or “finding
more information on” task [P10]. Five participants mentioned
that whether they delayed a task was affected by their /bol◎skill
proficiency , e.g., the level of their knowledge of the task [P5]
or skill [P8,9] in the task. P5 indicated that he found himself
procrastinating more on tasks “where [he has] little knowledge
of what [he’s] doing,” while P15 procrastinated on tasks that did
not align with her background. Four participants mentioned
that the learning requirement was another factor; when the
“number of resources” for learning [P1,7] was high, or thecontent was complex to learn [P1,2,14], they postponed it to
a later time. 20% participants mentioned they procrastinate on
a task that doesn’t impact or help a lot of users [P10,12,13].
Additionally, procrastination in two participants depended on
deadlines. For instance, P1 mentioned, “because there are no
fixed deadlines and no strict deadlines, then [he was] delaying
stuff too” [P1]. Another participant mentioned if the task had
a“faraway deadline,” he had a safe feeling of “still having more
time until deadline” that triggered him to delay [P5].
Three participants postponed tasks that had /bol◎dependencies
on others [P4,13,14]. As P13 explained, when ”[she] needs
help from someone, [she] tends to delay just because it depends
on somebody else.”
Personal factors. 13 participants noted distorted /bol◎mental state
gave rise to procrastination. Participants mentioned not being
in the mood to do a task [P4,7,9-11,13,14] or having stress
and anxiety [P5,11,12] provoked procrastination. P5 clarified
that procrastination in such situations is “the shutdown kind of
procrastination. Like [he’s] too stressed. [He] can’t deal with this
[task]” . Compromised/bol◎physical health was also noted by nine
participants as procrastination factor. Sickness [P3,6,10,15]
and fatigue [P2,13] set off procrastination as P13 explained,
“It’s not a task I can do right now because I have had less sleep;
I can’t focus. So I tend to procrastinate.”
/bol◎Uncertainty about how to approach a task also initi-
ated procrastination for seven participants. The uncertainty
stemmed from not knowing “how to start the task” [P1,10],
“how long it will take” [P2,3], or when participants “don’t know
what to do” to finish the task [P4,6,13]. Five participants
reported procrastinating due to /bol◎fear of failure from missing
deadlines [P5,10] or making mistakes [P6,11]. P1 noted,
“When [he] fears [he] may not accomplish [the task] right away,
[he] leaves it for tomorrow and, like, the day after.” /bol◎Personal
duties like parenting [P3,4], personal crises [P12,14], and
family time [P15] were also cited as factors by five partic-
ipants. Four participants mentioned /bol◎fear of judgment from
colleagues as a trigger, such as concerns about being criti-
cized for their knowledge [P2,14] or task performance [P2].
Surprisingly, four participants justified procrastinating until
the deadline as they “respond positively and well to /bol◎deadline
pressure .”Participants intentionally procrastinated to create
urgency [P9,11,14] as pressure brought a sense of “enjoyment”
[P11] or “fun to burn through and get it all done” [P4].
External factors. 12 participants noted /bol◎distraction form
various sources prompted procrastination, like browsing on
71210social media platforms [P1,2,5,6,7,11,14], colleagues dropping
by their desks [P1,2,5,9], and prolonged chat during lunch
breaks [P2]. Additionally, participants found working remotely
caused more distraction, hence more procrastination [P4,15].
/bol◎Relationship dynamics among team members influenced nine
participants’ procrastination. Lack of compatible relationship
between participants and team members [P10] or the manager
[P14] increased the likelihood of procrastination. Participants
elaborated more on this factor by indicating that conflicts
over task implementation [P7-9] or task priority [P12] led to
prolonged unclear projects [P6], which in turn increased pro-
crastination [P3]. Five participants cited that /bol◎task hierarchy ,
i.e., assigned by high-ranking individuals, were prioritized to
avoid delaying critical work [P9,12,13] or to gain visibility
from those individuals [P10,11]. P10 implied
“I’m more likely to procrastinate [on] something that gives me
less visibility to leadership. So if a leader is more likely to notice
the work that I did, I’m not going to procrastinate [on] that”.”
/bol◎Bad communication with colleagues elicited procrastina-
tion in three participants. Participants mentioned that consis-
tent direct communication prevented procrastination [P1,10].
P4 experienced less procrastination, in the office as he could
easily go to talk to his colleagues about tasks.
Procrastination types. By clustering the factors that trigger
procrastination, we identified three additional procrastination
types that further refine active and passive procrastination.
Task Aversion. We observed that participants often engaged
in procrastination when they were adverse to a task. This
aversion could stem from several aspects of the task: lack of
interest, the task’s nature, perceived value, or lack of immedi-
ate rewards. Task Avoidance. Participants reported avoiding
and delaying task due to overwhelming anxiety or fear of
failure, driven by internal pressures affecting their mental state,
rather than strategic or logical reasoning. Strategic procrasti-
nation. Participants also engaged in strategic procrastination,
intentionally delaying tasks not due to distractions or lack of
motivation but as a deliberate strategy to enhance productivity.
/arrow-circle-righ◎Summary: We identified task-related, personal, and ex-
ternal factors triggering procrastination, which manifested
in three forms. Developers avoided tasks that misaligned
with their interests (Aversion), delayed complex tasks to re-
cover mentally (Avoidance), and prioritized high-visibility
tasks while strategically delaying others (Strategic).
VI. H OW CAN DEVELOPERS MANAGE PROCRASTINATION ?
With an understanding of the triggers and effects of procras-
tination, we investigate strategies and techniques to manage
this phenomenon. We asked participants “What strategies do
you use to mitigate procrastination at work?” Participants
identified 14 procrastination mitigation techniques, which we
further categorized into Awareness, Task Focus, Task Planning,
and Team Support groups (Section III). The mitigation tech-
niques are presented in Table V along with their Implications
and specific productivity dimensions (Prod.) the techniqueshelp,/userin the source column indicates participants who
mentioned, along with the total frequency of mention ( ×);
ὖElists literature from other domains supporting some of the
techniques discussed in Section VII-A.
Awareness. ♂shield-altProgress Patterns. Three participants men-
tioned that keeping track of their progress helped discover
the onset of procrastination and modify their behavior. P11
elaborated that by keeping his progress pattern “[he] can
look back and say, at one o’clock when [he] did this [he] was
procrastinating, and maybe [he] can learn from that in the
future.”♂shield-altProactive Measures , suggested by four participants,
suggests being conscious of procrastination before committing
to it. P2 and P10 indicated proactively controlling the effect,
stating, “once I’m aware that I’m procrastinating, I’m always
trying to figure out how to prevent that from happening again
in the future”. Finally,♂shield-altInforming others of the delay , caused
by procrastination, helped mitigate the future consequences, as
mentioned by three participants. The notification allows other
team members to devise new strategies to see if they “can still
do something about it” [P12]. P10 emphasized:
“Y ou have to communicate very early on that the deadline will
be missed and then justify why. As long as you can do those
things, you can keep your job.”
Task Focus. ♂shield-altDaily Task Planning. Following a daily
personalized task list helped 10/15 participants to avoid pro-
crastination by prioritizing tasks [P8,9,15] and avoid deviating
toward prevalent tasks [P5,7-9,11,12]. P7 highlighted that
he has a schedule that prevents him from delaying things.
♂shield-altInterest-Performance trade-off. Five participants prevented
procrastinating on a task they don’t like by balancing it with
other tasks they like in their daily schedule [P5,7,9,11]. P3
mentioned doing uninteresting tasks during the energetic times
of the day helped limit procrastination. P7 illustrated:
“Let’s say 50% of your tasks are very likable, 50% not that
much. Y ou choose one task you like and one you don’t each
day. If you start doing it for a while, you get used to it.”
♂shield-altTimeboxing/Fake Deadlines. Five participants mitigated
procrastination by applying the time boxing [P2,10,11,14] and
creating artificial deadlines closer than the actual deadline to
avoid the perception of having plenty of time. P2 exemplified
that, if “the actual deadline is three weeks from now, I write
down [on his task list] that I can only work on this for the next
two weeks, that helps with the procrastination.” ♂shield-altRemoving
Distractions. Six participants noted they mitigated procrastina-
tion by achieving focus and removing distractions . Participants
physically removed the sources of distraction, reducing the
temptation to engage with it [P2,4,12-15]. P4 stated when he
got distracted by his phone, “[he] would literally just throw [his]
phone in a drawer and say, now I can’t open that drawer until
this task is done.”
Task Planning. ♂shield-altBreaking tasks into smaller ones. Five
participants used Task Decomposition , especially on large
development tasks, to manage tasks better [P1,11] and reduce
stress [P7]. Decomposing one deadline into smaller ones en-
sured that meeting each new deadline didn’t allow enough time

to procrastinate [P13,15]. Additionally, each completing sub-
task motivated them with immediate rewards. As P8 shared
his experience of using this strategy:
“During my day there is a small payoff like, the function works,
the query works, sure the whole feature might not be done yet
but I found some immediate satisfaction.”
♂shield-altAvoid Task Dependency. Reducing dependency between
tasks across the team was reported to be helpful by three
participants. Participants tried “not to define the project in a se-
quential way” [P7], which helped them procrastinate less since
they were working independently [P4,5]. ♂shield-altThorough Project
plan. A well-structured project plan helped two participants
with procrastination. Following a plan reduced vagueness
[P12] and uncertainty [P7], leading to limited procrastination.
Team support. ♂shield-altAdaptive Deadlines. Four participants
pointed out realistic [P8,10] and communication-based [P6,12]
deadlines mitigated procrastination. As P6 emphasized, “a
developer, who is getting deadlines from their managers should
be able to very clearly communicate the workload to their
manager and come up with the right timeline” [P6].♂shield-altUpdate
Meetings. Update meetings in the form of weekly agile
meetings [P6,7,13,14] or one-on-one meetings with the man-ager [P9,11,12] reduced procrastination for nine participants.
Participants mentioned this technique motivated them [P1]
and was an effective way to track their progress [P6,13].
♂shield-altInterruption Management. Unplanned social interruption
was a factor of procrastination, which three participants man-
aged by addressing them directly with coworkers.
“If a coworker is talking to me a lot, I might have a conversation
with them, telling them, ‘Hey, we can talk after work is done.””
♂shield-altSeeking Help. Six participants sought help to tackle
procrastination. Help from experts resolved obstacles in tasks
[P4,5,7,10,11] and improved personal performance [P4,13].
/arrow-circle-righ◎Summary: Developers mitigate procrastination by task
decomposition for better planning, setting fake deadlines
to maintain focus, and communicating early to seek help
on technical and performance issues. Being self-aware of
procrastination habits and tracking one’s activities, like the
amount of code written, can help limit procrastination.
VII. D ISCUSSION
We discuss how developers can apply mitigation techniques,
opportunities for new tools to manage procrastination within
91212teams, and other implications on education and productivity.
We also discuss procrastination across demographic factors
and novelty of our findings.
A. Interventions for developers to deal with procrastination
Awareness : Techniques to enhance awareness of procrasti-
nation rely on individual self-awareness and informing team
members of any resulting delays. In other domains, shown
in Table V, like applied behavior science or neuroscience,
techniques exist to increase individual awareness by educating
people [48], [49] or for neuropsychological preventions [50].
In the management domain, managers are suggested to be
proactive toward their employees’ procrastination [47]. Re-
search has explored tools that automatically track and identify
changes in developer activities [56], with some offering visual
interfaces to explore these activities [57]. Annotating progress
and perceived procrastination in activity visualization tools can
facilitate reflection and highlight high-risk activities.
Task Focus : Various smart to-do lists and daily planners/cal-
endars integrated into IDEs or GitHub can assist developers
in task management. AI-powered calendars can automati-
cally schedule tasks based on user patterns, but developers
must ensure these schedules align with team deliverables.
Frameworks like the Eisenhower Matrix [58] and SMART
goals [59] help further balance personal interests with deliv-
erables. Timeboxing using the Pomodoro technique which is
also prevalent in applied psychology domain [53] is accessible
for developers directly on their IDEs. Studies about managing
and removing distractions [54] (Table V) for developers have
led to specialized tools, like dimming irrelevant windows [60]
or AI-based music recommenders can help maintain focus.
Task Planning : A well-crafted plan helps prevent procras-
tination by addressing bottlenecks from dependency issues,
task orders, and technical debt. Popular software management
platforms, such as JIRA for bug and issue tracking and
GitHub for version management, facilitate project planning
using calendar and Gantt charts. In addition, research from
applied psychology emphasized the effectiveness of tracking
a daily task plan to avoid procrastination on “unpleasant tasks”
in a day [53]. Research on task decomposition [43] has shaped
tools and solutions to reduce dependencies and conflicts. Even
though some of our participants mentioned being dependent
on someone else for a task as procrastination factor, education
psychology domain showed being a part of a team in students
is an effective mitigation technique of procrastination [55].
Team support: Enhancing team support in software de-
velopment involves fostering positive, open communication
both among team members and across organizational levels.
Research on interruption management in software engineer-
ing [61] and organizational behavior domains [54] suggests
that subtle signaling methods, such as using a desklight
or wearing headphones, can minimize disruptions from col-
leagues. Additionally, practices like knowledge sharingand
pair programming can help developers recognize when and
from whom to seek assistance.B. Recommendations for future tool builders
Not all mitigation strategies have sufficient tool support. For
instance, the ♂shield-altProgress Pattern mitigation strategy is more
effective when developers track their progress alongside self-
reported procrastination episodes. Tools that allow developers
to track perceptions of procrastination along with their activity
will help to more effectively identify and mitigate procrastina-
tion triggers. Alternatively, tracking the cognitive activity (e.g.,
EEG, heart rate) of developers along with their development
activities could help to identify if they are distracted, anxious,
stressed, or bored. Certain tools are more effective for specific
procrastination types. For example, when a skill mismatch
causes aversion due to lack of interest, emphasizing the
♂shield-altBenefit of the Task can help. Conversely, when avoidance
stems from feeling overwhelmed, ♂shield-altSeeking Help and♂shield-altTask
Decomposition are more effective. Tools should balance task
interest and performance by incorporating varied tasks and
using AI-driven recommenders to adapt schedules based on
developers’ skills, interests, and performance, enhancing mo-
tivation and productivity.

Table VI compares the negative and positive effects we
found with those found in other domains. Five negative effects
(Table II) and three positive effects (Table III) not shown in
this table are unique to software development as we didn’t find
any sources discussing those effects in the literature (— across
all columns). The nine negative and five positive effects in the
comparative table are marked with ✓to indicate alignment
and/timesto indicate contradiction with listed references.
While negative effects, such as emotional distress and
missed deadlines, are consistent across all studies, some effects
in software development contradict findings in other domains.
Studies in psychology and governance [63], [70] report no
significant correlation between procrastination and individual
or team outcomes, whereas developers reported reduced in-
dividual and team performance from procrastination. While
other domains focus on one or two positive effects, developers
in our study present a more complete list of positive effects.
We also identified procrastination factors unique to software
development, such as subjective importance, task hierarchy,
101213and dependency on others (bolded text in Table IV). De-
velopers reported that unclear task requirements and reliance
on team collaboration lead to delays, cascading disruptions,
and workflow issues. Communication gaps between roles also
exacerbate misunderstandings and project delays, highlighting
the collaborative challenges inherent in software development.
D. Productivity Implications of the Findings along SPACE
As discussed in Section IV, participants mentioned neg-
ative effects on Performance most frequently, followed by
Satisfaction & Well-being. However, albeit with lower fre-
quency, most participants also reported higher positive effects
along Satisfaction & Well-being. This polarity can indicate
that depending on the combination of effects and specific
tasks developers procrastinate on, they might experience both
satisfaction and dissatisfaction from procrastination. Table V
also reports how developers can adopt various mitigation
techniques to reduce the impact of procrastination along the
productivity dimensions. Most techniques in the Awareness
category can help productivity by improving Satisfaction &
Well-being, focusing on preparing developers mentally to
combat or bypass procrastination. Two techniques in Task
Focus category can help improve developer Performance; the
♂shield-altinterest-performance trade-off technique in this category
can also help developers manage their Activity. Techniques in
theTask Planning andTeam Support categories can help devel-
oper productivity by improving their Efficiency in managing
tasks and deadlines and encourage them to Communicate early
and consistently with their colleagues and working groups.
E. Development culture and education
Organizations should create a culture of openly discussing
procrastination, reducing stigma. We found that procrastination
often reflects task or organizational issues, beyond personal
failings. As P7 noted, it can signal problems by: “If you devi-
ate from your schedule, it indicates a problem.” Training and
onboarding could raise awareness, teach mitigation strategies,
and promote early, judgment-free discussions. Incorporating
lessons on managing procrastination into software develop-
ment courses can help future developers address these patterns.
F . Contextual Analysis of Procrastination Factor & Effects
We compared the average number of factors and effects
mentioned by participants along demographic dimensions of
gender, work setting, experience, and roles. Table VII shows
that remote workers mentioned higher personal factors, which
might be an effect of their isolated environment. Developers
reported more task-related factors than managers. Surprisingly,
hybrid workers mentioned positive effects the most, highlight-
ing the potential benefits of blended work models.
We conducted Chi-square χ2tests of independence for each
dimension to examine whether the number of factors and
effects mentioned by participants differ. The χ2test revealed
a significant difference between women and men; women
mentioned more external factors than men, indicating they
might be more affected by factors like distractions and com-
munication issues (detailed table in the supplementary [35]).TABLE VII

VIII. L IMITATIONS
Following empirical standards [71], we addressed credibility
by providing a chain of evidence, final codes, interview
quotations with assigned themes, and the codebook in the sup-
plementary material. To mitigate interpretation biases during
the open coding process, two researchers conducted IRR.
Despite rigorous data collection, fully understanding pro-
crastination among developers remains challenging due to its
complexity, individual variability, and unmeasurable cognitive
mechanisms from self-reported data. Recall bias during the
interview may have influenced participants’ recollections of
past procrastination experiences. To address this, the inter-
viewer explored both positive and negative effects along all
five dimensions of productivity. While our findings reflect
participants’ experiences, sample imbalances may limit their
resonance and generalizability with all individual developers.
To mitigate this, we discussed how our findings connect
with prior research from other domains and populations.
While some of our findings are context-specific to software
development, some findings might be transferable to other
professions after verification from specific in-context research.
The study offers actionable insights into the factors, effects,
and mitigation strategies related to procrastination among
developers which makes it useful for managers and developers.
IX. C ONCLUSION
This paper takes a first look into the effects and factors of
procrastination on developers. Our in-depth interviews reveal
insights about how procrastination creates positive and nega-
tive effects on both the developers and the code they produce.
We uncover that while procrastination brings some benefits to
developer well-being, it negatively impacts their performance
and the quality and quantity of code they produce. We identify
various development tasks, developer, and environment-related
factors that trigger procrastination. Our results enlist mitigation
techniques that participants found useful to limit and manage
procrastination. We discuss how these mitigation techniques
can be used in software teams using existing tools and identify
where developers need support.
Acknowledgments. We thank the participants for their
incredible insights on procrastination in software development
and the anonymous ICSE reviewers for their constructive
feedback.
