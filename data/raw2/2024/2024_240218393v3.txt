Abstract —Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is crucial
in ADS development, with the current primary focus being on
safety. However, the evaluation of non-safety-critical performance,
particularly the ADS’s ability to make optimal decisions and
produce optimal paths for autonomous vehicles (A Vs), is also vital
to ensure the intelligence and reduce risks of A Vs. Currently,
there is little work dedicated to assessing the robustness of
ADSs’ path-planning decisions (PPDs), i.e., whether an ADS
can maintain the optimal PPD after an insignificant change in
the environment. The key challenges include the lack of clear
oracles for assessing PPD optimality and the difficulty in searching
for scenarios that lead to non-optimal PPDs. To fill this gap,
in this paper, we focus on evaluating the robustness of ADSs’
PPDs and propose the first method, Decictor , for generating non-
optimal decision scenarios (NoDSs), where the ADS does not plan
optimal paths for A Vs. Decictor comprises three main components:
Non-invasive Mutation, Consistency Check, and Feedback. To
overcome the oracle challenge, Non-invasive Mutation is devised to
implement conservative modifications, ensuring the preservation of
the original optimal path in the mutated scenarios. Subsequently,
the Consistency Check is applied to determine the presence of non-
optimal PPDs by comparing the driving paths in the original and
mutated scenarios. To deal with the challenge of large environment
space, we design Feedback metrics that integrate spatial and
temporal dimensions of the A V’s movement. These metrics are
crucial for effectively steering the generation of NoDSs. Therefore,
Decictor can generate NoDSs by generating new scenarios and then
identifying NoDSs in the new scenarios. We evaluate Decictor
on Baidu Apollo, an open-source and production-grade ADS.
The experimental results validate the effectiveness of Decictor in
detecting non-optimal PPDs of ADSs. It generates 63.9 NoDSs in
total, while the best-performing baseline only detects 35.4 NoDSs.
I. I NTRODUCTION
Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) have been a rev-
olutionary technology with the potential to transform our
transportation system into an intelligent one. ADSs aim to
enable vehicles to operate without human intervention, relying
on a combination of different sensors (e.g., camera, radar, lidar,
and GPS) and artificial intelligence algorithms to perceive the
environment, make decisions, and navigate safely. Even though
the development of ADSs has seen significant progress over the
past few decades, it is still a great challenge to guarantee that the
ADSs can satisfy all performance requirements under different
situations due to the existing vulnerabilities in ADSs [1].
Therefore, before their real-world deployment, ADSs should
be sufficiently tested in all aspects [2].
Usually, the requirements of ADSs can be classified as safety-
critical and non-safety-critical. Safety-critical requirements are

those essential for ensuring safe operations and performance
of the autonomous vehicle. For example, an ADS should
guarantee that the ego vehicle (i.e., the autonomous vehicle
controlled by the ADS) should arrive at its destination without
causing collisions or violating traffic rules. Non-safety-critical
requirements refer to aspects that do not directly impact safety
but are important for user experiences and optimal vehicle
performance, such as motion efficiency, passenger comfort,
and energy consumption.
Currently, various testing technologies have been proposed
to evaluate the safety-critical requirements of ADSs (referred
to as “safety testing”), such as data-driven methods [3]–[6] and
search-based methods [7]–[17]. They aim to generate safety-
critical scenarios, under which the ego vehicle will cause safety
issues, such as collisions and traffic rule violations. To the best
of our knowledge, there is limited research on evaluating the
robustness of the path-planning decisions (PPDs) in ADSs, i.e.,
their ability to plan optimal paths in dynamic environments .
PPD optimality is an important non-safety-critical property
for guaranteeing the motion efficiency of the ego vehicle in
complex traffic scenarios, but it may not be achieved by ADSs.
Fig. 1 presents two illustrative examples that highlight PPD
robustness issues, where the ADS fails to determine the optimal
paths after minor environmental changes, such as placing two
small obstacles on the lane boundaries that would not affect the
optimal path (i.e., solid lines). Note that, in these changes, the
ego vehicle still maintains a safe distance [18] (i.e., more than
0.5 meters from the obstacle) to pass the scenarios if it follows
the optimal paths. The video [19] shows an example that Tesla
FSD cannot make robust PPDs at a fork in a real-world road.
An ADS with limited intelligence might inaccurately assess
traffic scenarios, resulting in suboptimal choices. Such decisions
could cause prolonged delays or select inefficient routes,
leading to unnecessary hold-ups or even elevating safety
risks. Therefore, evaluating the robustness of PPD of ADSs
is critically vital, as it affects the comfort and efficiency of
autonomous vehicles and could pose additional safety concerns.
Note that, in this paper, PPD robustness evaluation aims to
1arXiv:2402.18393v3  [cs.AI]  28 Jan 2025explore scenarios where safety issues are not present, instead
focusing on assessing the optimal PPD capabilities of ADS
within dynamic driving environments.
Technically, drawing on the foundational principles es-
tablished by existing research in robustness evaluation re-
search [20], [21], the core objective of robustness evaluation
is to assess a model’s capacity to maintain correct prediction
following some perturbations. For instance, in image clas-
sification, an image is slightly modified (e.g., through the
addition of noise) to test whether the model can still accurately
classify the perturbed image. Gradient-based methods [20],
[21] are commonly employed to efficiently calculate these
perturbations. However, evaluating the PPD robustness of ADS
presents unique challenges: ❶Contrary to safety testing, which
relies on explicit, measurable criteria (like collision detection
or timeout occurrences) to identify safety-critical violations,
the assessment of PPD optimality in ADS under new scenarios
lacks clear oracles. While traditional robustness evaluations
might control the extent of perturbations (e.g., the level of noise)
to ensure the perturbed inputs match the truth labels of original
inputs, the complexity inherent in A V scenarios complicates
the control of scenario perturbations. ❷The unpredictable and
infinitely variable nature of driving conditions, influenced by
diverse road users and environmental factors, complicates the
search of “ Non-optimal Decision Scenarios” (NoDSs). The
conventional gradient-based method is difficult to be applied
in these scenarios due to discontinuities in the input space
and the logical constraints that perturbations must obey, such
as adherence to physical laws and ensuring that obstacles
remain within realistic bounds. ❸The evaluation of robustness
typically requires a method to check prediction consistency
between the original input and its perturbed counterpart. In
classification tasks, the consistency check is straightforwardly
verified by comparing their predicted labels. However, in ADS,
decisions are represented by planned paths, which introduces
complexity into the process of determining their consistency.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel testing
method, called Decictor , comprising three main components
Non-invasive Mutation ,Feedback and Consistency Check .
The innovative approach enables the effective and efficient
identification of non-optimal PPDs and their associated NoDSs.
Specifically, to address the first challenge ❶, we design a non-
invasive mutation that conservatively modifies the behaviors
of other participants within the driving environment in a way
that the modifications would not affect the originally optimal
path in the given “ Optimal Decision Scenario” (ODS). For the
second challenge ❷, we propose a fitness function designed to
guide the generation of NoDSs. The function scores are based
on two key metrics: firstly, it seeks to maximize the discrepancy
in the driving paths between the ego vehicle in both the
mutated and original scenarios, directly accentuating the non-
optimal behaviors. Secondly, it assesses the variances between
the scenarios from a broader perspective of ego behavior,
measured by a vector encompassing velocity, acceleration, and
orientation. The second metric is crucial as the behavior of the
ego vehicle may directly affect its driving path. For the thirdchallenge ❸, given the possible slight variations between the
new driving path (in the mutated scenario) and the initially
optimal path (in ODS), the direct path-level comparison is not
reliable. To resolve this, we introduce an abstraction-based
behavior comparison method. This technique evaluates the
driving patterns in both scenarios through abstraction, where
significant differences in routes indicate deviations from optimal
PPDs by the ADS.
We have evaluated Decictor on the Baidu Apollo with
its built-in SimControl [22]. We compared Decictor with
nine baseline methods: two random methods, i.e., Random,
which generates scenarios randomly, and Random- δ, which
applies our non-invasive mutation and random selection to
generate scenarios, along with seven state-of-the-art ADS
testing methods, i.e., A VFuzzer [8], SAMOTA [10], BehA V-
Explor [9], DriveFuzz [13], scenoRITA [14], DoppelTest [15]
and DeepCollision [17]. The evaluation results reveal the
effectiveness and efficiency of Decictor in detecting NoDSs,
demonstrating the path-planning robustness issues within the
ADS. For example, Decictor generates a total of 63.9 NoDSs
while the best-performing baseline only detects 35.4 NoDSs.
Further experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of our
mutation operation and feedback mechanisms meticulously
designed within Decictor .
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
1)We are the first to investigate the problem of non-optimal
PPDs made by ADSs. Our work provides valuable and
original insights into evaluating the non-safety-critical
performance of ADSs.
2)We develop a search-based method that efficiently generates
NoDSs and evaluates the PPD robustness of ADSs.
3)We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effective-
ness and usefulness of Decictor on Baidu Apollo. As a
result, a total of 63.9 NoDSs is discovered on six initial
ODSs on average, demonstrating the potential and value of
Decictor in detecting non-optimal PPDs made by ADSs.
II. B ACKGROUND AND NOTATION
A. Autonomous Driving Systems
ADSs control the motion of autonomous vehicles. Exist-
ing ADSs mainly contain two categories: End-to-End (E2E)
systems [23]–[25], and module-based ADSs [22], [26], [27].
E2E systems use united deep learning models to generate
control decisions from sensor data directly. Recently, the rapid
development of Deep Learning have led to high-performance
E2E systems in close-loop datasets, such as OpenPilot [25].
However, these E2E systems still perform poorly on unseen
data. In contrast, module-based ADSs have better performance
in various scenarios. A typical module-based ADS, such as
Baidu Apollo [22], usually consists of localization, perception,
prediction, planning, and control modules to generate decisions
from rich sensor data. The localization module provides the
location of the ego vehicle by fusing multiple input data from
GPS, IMU, and LiDAR sensors. The perception module takes
camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and Radar signals as
2inputs to detect the surrounding environment (e.g., traffic lights)
and objects (e.g. other vehicles) by mainly using deep neural
networks. The prediction module is responsible for tracking and
predicting the trajectories of all surrounding objects detected
by the perception module. Given the results of perception
and prediction modules, the planning module then generates
a local collision-free trajectory for the ego vehicle. Finally,
the control module converts the planned trajectory to vehicle
control commands (e.g., steering, throttle, and braking) and
sends them to the chassis of the vehicle. In this paper, we
choose to test module-based ADSs on a simulation platform,
where the ADS connects to a simulator via a communication
bridge. Same to previous works [9], [14], [15], the ADS receives
perfect perception data from the simulator, and sends the control
commands to the ego vehicle in the simulator.
B. Scenario
ADS testing necessitates a collection of scenarios as inputs.
Each scenario is characterized by a specific environment (e.g.,
road), the scenery and objects (e.g., static obstacles and Non-
Player Character (NPC) vehicles). Complex scenarios are
generated by combining relevant attributes from the Operational
Design Domains (ODDs) [28]. Due to the vast attribute space,
covering all attributes with all possible values is impractical.
Existing studies [8]–[10], [13]–[17] address this by selecting
specific subsets of attributes. In this paper, we evaluate the
non-safety-critical performance of ADS motion using scenarios
formulated with traffic cones as static obstacles and NPC
vehicles as dynamic objects.
Therefore, a scenario can be described as a tuple s={A,P},
where Ais the motion task of the ADS under test, including
the start position and the destination, Pis a finite set of
participants, including the set of static obstacles and dynamic
NPC vehicles. Note that in our paper, participants in the
scenario do not include the ego vehicle controlled by the
ADS. Scenario observation is a sequence of scenes within
the execution of the scenario, and each scene represents the
states of the ego vehicle and other participants at a timestamp.
Formally, given a scenario s={A,P}, its observation is
denoted as O(s) ={o0, o1, . . . , o k}, where kis the length of
the observation and oiis a scene at timestamp i. In detail,

defined as τj(s) ={pj

represent the driving path of the ego vehicle in the scenario s.
Unless otherwise specified, the driving path in the following
context refers to the path of the ego vehicle in s, i.e., τ(s).
III. O VERVIEW
A. Problem Definition
This paper aims to assess the optimization capability of
the path-planning process in ADSs. Given an ODS sand
its associated optimal path for the ego vehicle τ(s), PPD
optimality testing aims to assess the robustness of ADS’s PPD,i.e., its ability to consistently navigate along τ(s). Following
the robustness definitions of neural networks [29]–[32], we
define the PPD robustness as follows:
Definition 1 (Path-planning Decision Robustness) .Given an
ODS s={A,P}, we formalize the path-planning decision
(PPD) robustness as:
∀s′.||s−s′||δ=True =⇒ϵ(τ(s), τ(s′)) =True (1)
where || · || δis used to constrain scenario mutation, ensuring
that the mutation δmodifies a subset of participants P⊆ P
insto produce s′, without compromising the optimality of the
original driving path, i.e., ||s−s′||δ=True . The function
ϵserves as a consistency checking mechanism, evaluating
whether the two driving paths executed by the ADS in sand
s′are equivalent.
The definition of PPD robustness stipulates that, following
minor perturbations (i.e., s′=δ(s, P)), the ADS should
maintain the capacity to select the original optimal driving
path (i.e., π(s)).The main goal of the PPD robustness testing
is to identify scenarios where the ADS can accomplish its task
without encountering safety issues, yet does not manage to
plan and execute the optimal driving path. Note that the PPD
optimality of the seed ODS scan be manually confirmed while
the PPD optimality of mutated scenarios s′can be automatically
checked by evaluating their consistency.
B. Approach Overview
Fig. 2 provides a high-level depiction of our testing frame-
work Decictor , designed to detect non-optimal PPDs. The basic
idea underlying our method involves generating a scenario s′,
where the ego vehicle opts for a path far from the optimal
one in the ODS sunder the non-invasive mutation δ. It can
be formulated as an optimization problem aiming to maximize
the difference between the driving paths of sands′:
∆s= arg max
∆D(τ(s), τ(s′)),where s′=δ(s,∆) (2)
where ∆symbolizes the non-invasive perturbations on the
scenario s, andDis a function to measure the distance or
difference between the driving paths of the two scenarios.
Decictor adopts a search-based method to solve the optimiza-
tion problem. The process initiates with a seed ODS s∗and
aims to output a set of violation tests, i.e., NoDSs, considering
the optimal path in s∗. We first initialize a population Q
based on s∗.Decictor then optimizes this population iteratively
until the testing budget Bexceeds. In each iteration, Decictor
performs Non-invasive Mutation (δ) to generate the offspring
Q′that has the same size as Q. The mutation strategy ensures
that the original optimal path in s∗remains optimal in the new
scenarios. To determine if the ADS makes the optimal PPDs
in these new scenarios, we introduce Consistency Check (ϵ),
a hierarchical approach for measuring the equivalence with
regard to PPD optimality between the seed ODS and these new
scenarios. Consistency Check initially monitors whether a new
scenario completes the task during simulation execution. If the

modified scenario results in a task failure, such as collisions, it
is not considered as a NoDS of interest. This is because such
failures can already be detected by existing A V testing tools
that utilize timeout or collision detection oracles. Conversely,
if the new scenario passes the task checking, we collect the
observation from the simulator. The Consistency Check then
verifies the equivalence of the driving paths between the seed
ODS and the new scenario using a lane-grid measurement.
Detection of the consistency violation in this step identifies
a NoDS. If no violation occurs, Decictor proceeds to select
the superior population from the candidates of the old and
new populations for the next iteration. This selection process
is guided by the Feedback ( D) that takes into account the
spatial and temporal characteristics, i.e., the driving path and
the behaviors, of the ego vehicle’s motion.
IV. A PPROACH
Algorithm 1 presents the main algorithmic procedure of
Decictor .Decictor receives a seed ODS s∗as the input andoutputs a set of NoDSs. Parameters NandBcan be adjusted
to configure the population size and testing budget, respectively.
The algorithm begins by creating an initial population with the
given seed ODS s∗(Lines 2-3). In each iteration, the algorithm
first generates the offspring by mutating each scenario in the
population Q(Lines 6-7). Each new scenario s′is first executed
in the simulation platform consisting of a simulator and the
ADS under test (Line 8) and verified by the task checking rtc
(Line 9). The new scenario passed the task checking is then
evaluated for PPD consistency (Lines 10-14). If violated, a
NoDS is identified and added to the set Fn(Line 14). If no
violation is detected, the new scenario is added to the offspring
Q′. The scenario selection picks the top Nscenarios from the
union of QandQ′based on their fitness scores (Line 15). The
algorithm ends by returning detected NoDSs Fn(Line 17).
In the following sections, we introduce the key components
ofDecictor : the Non-invasive Mutation (δ), the Consistency
Check (ϵ), and the Feedback (D).
A. Non-invasive Mutation δ
The main challenge of the mutation is to ensure that in the
mutated scenario, the original optimal path of the ego vehicle
in the seed ODS is not affected. Following existing mutation
techniques for ADS safety testing [8]–[10], [33], we only alter
the waypoints of NPC vehicles or other participants, leaving
the ego vehicle unchanged. However, the primary challenge
is that these mutations could significantly impact the ego
vehicle’s original optimal path. To mitigate this challenge, we
introduce a conservative mutation approach, namely the non-
invasive mutation strategy, designed to create new scenarios
with less impact on the original optimal path. While it may
be theoretically difficult, or even impossible, to ensure that
changes do not affect the ego vehicle’s original optimal path,
our method adopts a conservative approach. This involves
calculating “safe zones” for mutation, where adjustments to
participants’ behaviors are unlikely to influence the original
optimal path. This concept is akin to existing adversarial attack
methodologies, where the difference between the new and
original inputs is limited within an LPnorm boundary [32].
Such constraints are intended to preserve the semantic integrity
of the input, but a theoretical guarantee of no impact is
challenging to establish [21], [34].

𝑦#$"𝑦#$"Fig. 3. Illustrative example of feasible area calculation.
The non-invasive mutation mainly includes adding new
participants within the non-invasive feasible areas, removing
existing added participants and changing existing participants.
Non-invasive Feasible Area . To minimize the impact of
the mutations on the original optimal path π(s∗), for any
ODS ˆs={A,P}derived from the seed ODS s∗, we initially
calculate a set of non-invasive feasible areas. These areas are
designated so that the introduction of a new participant Pm
toˆsis unlikely to influence the optimal path π(s∗)and other
participants PinˆsifPmnavigates within these non-invasive
zones. Note that reducing the influence on the motions of
other participants is also important, as their behaviors could
indirectly influence the driving path of the ego vehicle.
The determination of the feasible area at any given mo-
ment ( t) must account for the effects of both time and space.
Specifically, it involves ensuring that the ego vehicle’s original
optimal path π(s∗)and the paths of Premain unaffected
during a certain time frame ( ∆t) surrounding that moment.
Suppose the current observation is O(ˆs) ={ˆo0,ˆo1, . . . , ˆok}
with a sampling time step ∆t, we define the non-invasive
feasible area regarding to the object p∈ {P ∪ P0}during
[t, t+ ∆t]asRp(ˆs, t,∆t), where P0is the ego vehicle.
Fig. 3 illustrates the basic idea about the computation of
Rp(ˆs, t,∆t), taking the ego vehicle as an example. We first
estimate the feasible motion area of the new participant, denoted
asR(yt). Specifically, given the motion constraints (i.e., speed
and steering ranges) and the position ytat timestamp t, we
can calculate a sector range in Fig. 3(a) according to the
kinematic model [35]. Second, we estimate the motion area
of the ego vehicle P0between [t, t+ ∆t]based on the original
optimal path π(s∗), which is denoted as RP0(π(s∗),∆t), e.g.,
the dashed light red area in Fig. 3(b). Note that the motion
area of the ego vehicle is directly calculated from the real
movement recorded in the scenario observations, which can be
regarded as a rectangle between tandt+ ∆ t. Intuitively, the
new participant should not move into RP0(π(s∗),∆t)during
the time frame [t, t+ ∆t]so as not to affect the optimal path
of the ego vehicle.
Therefore, we can calculate the non-invasive feasible area
(e.g., the light yellow area in Fig. 3(b)) as:
RP0(ˆs, t,∆t) =R(yt)\RP0(π(s∗),∆t), (3)
Similarly, we can calculate the non-invasive feasible areas
Rp(ˆs, t,∆t)with respect to any participant p∈ P based on itsAlgorithm 2: Non-invasive Mutation Operators

Note that the time step ∆twill affect the computation of the
non-invasive area. As ∆tincreases, the calculation of the non-
invasive area becomes more conservative as the new participant
does not affect the ego behavior in longer time.
Mutation Operations . Algorithm 2 outlines the specific
mutation operations: Adding (Lines 1-11), Removing (Lines
12-15) and Changing (Line 16-21). The non-invasive mutation
takes as input Ps∗(the participants in the seed ODS s∗),
Pˆs(the participants in the current ODS ˆs) and O(ˆs)(the
observation of ˆs). The observation consists of a sequence
of scenes {ˆs0, . . . , ˆsk}with an equal time step ∆t. In each
iteration, the non-invasive mutation randomly chooses one
operation to change participants in the scenario ˆs, resulting in
a new scenario s′.
Adding. Adding operation aims to introduce complexity to
the scenario by adding a new participant to ˆsthat is less likely
to influence the optimal path. In detail, this operation initializes
an empty waypoint set Pmand an initial collision-free waypoint
y0(Lines 2-3). Waypoints for the added participant are
iteratively generated (Lines 4-9), where each iteration involves

calculating the non-invasive area (Line 5), sampling a non-
invasive waypoint (Line 6-8), and adding it to Pm(Line 9).
The process concludes by merging the resultant set with the
original participants Pˆsto form Ps′(Line 10-11).
Removing. Continuously adding new participants to the
scenario will introduce too many obstacles, resulting in motion
task failures. Thus, we introduce the removing operator. Note
that only the participants in Pˆs\ Ps∗, i.e., the participants
newly added to the seed ODS s∗, can be removed, while the
participants in the seed ODS will remain unchanged in all
mutated scenarios. Because the removal of the participants in
the seed ODS may affect the optimal path of the scenarios.
Specifically, this operation removes a participant in Pˆs\ Ps∗
randomly (Lines 13-14) and returns the mutated set (Line 15).
Changing. The changing operation aims to modify the
scenario ˆsby replacing an existing participant in Pˆs. This
operation involves first removing an existing object from Pˆs
(Line 17) and then adding a new one (Line 20). Specifically,
we remove the observation of the removed participant y{Pˆs
from O(ˆs)(Lines 18-19) to ensure that the calculation of the
non-invasive feasible area does not include this participant.
B. Consistency Check ϵ
Given the seed ODS s∗and a mutated scenario s′, we require
a criterion ϵto determine whether s′remains the optimal path
ins∗. A direct approach might be checking if the driving path
ins′(i.e.,τ(s′)) and the original path of s∗(i.e.,τ(s∗)) are the
same. However, even in real-world scenarios, human drivers do
not strictly adhere to a straight line but exhibit some degree of
zig-zag motion, as shown in Fig. 4(b). This motion can still be
considered optimal even if it slightly deviates from the original
pathτ(s∗). Thus, we propose an abstraction-based method to
quantify the similarity of the two driving paths.
Fig. 4 illustrates the basic idea of our method. We define an
optimal area around the optimal path τ(s∗)in terms of the grid
map. Any driving path falling or mostly falling within this area
is considered optimal. For example, the orange area in Fig. 4(a)
defines the optimal area of the driving path in the seed ODS.
The driving path in Fig. 4(b) does not strictly adhere to the
optimal path but remains within the optimal area, achieving
the highest similarity and thus meeting the optimality criterion.
In contrast, most of the path in Fig. 4(c) (i.e., the blue area)
falls outside the optimal area, resulting in a low similarity and
a non-optimal path.
Specifically, the comparison between the driving paths τ(s∗)
andτ(s′)is implemented by a grid-based approach, as shownin Fig. 4. The map is divided into grids, and each driving
path is mapped to a set of grids. Technically, a driving path of
the ego vehicle in a scenario sis represented as a sequence
of locations τ(s) ={p0
0, . . . , p0
k}, where p0
iis the position at
frame i. To collect the covered grids, a function gis used
to map each position pto the grid where it is located. The
covered grids for the path τ(s)can be denoted as:
Cτ(s)={g(p)|p∈τ(s)} (5)
To check the decision consistency, the similarity between the
covered grids of τ(s∗)andτ(s′)is computed. The consistency
checking is defined using a predefined threshold εas follows:
ϵ(τ(s∗), τ(s′)) =|Cτ(s∗)∩Cτ(s′)|
|Cτ(s∗)∪Cτ(s′)|> ε (6)
If the similarity between the covered grids is greater than the
threshold ε,s′is recognized as an ODS.
C. Feedback D
To guide the search of NoDSs, a feedback is necessary to
select high-quality individuals from the candidate population
(Line 15 of Algorithm 1). The grid similarity ϵ(τ(s∗),τ(s′))(in
Equation 6) provides a direct choice. However, the calculation
of grid similarity is relatively coarse-grained as it only considers
the spatial perspective of the ego vehicle’s motion. While
this coarse-grained calculation is beneficial for consistency
checking, it may not be as specific and effective for guiding
the testing to generate NoDSs (see our evaluation results in
Section V-B2). To mitigate this, another metric is proposed
that incorporates more fine-grained feedback calculated from
scenario observations (detailed in Section II-B), taking into
account the ego vehicle’s driving path and motion behavior.
The former focuses on the spatial characteristics of the ego
vehicle’s motion, while the latter more on the temporal ones.
Driving Path Feedback. The main objective of Decictor is
to maximize the difference between the driving paths such that
the non-optimal decision is identified. Considering the potential
different lengths of τ(s∗)andτ(s′), we use the average point-
wise distance between τ(s∗)andτ(s′)in the spatial space to
measure their difference, which is calculated as:
fp(s∗, s′) =1
ns′ns′X
i=1min{∥pi−p∥|∀p∈τ(s∗)} (7)
where pi∈τ(s′)andns′is the total number of points in τ(s′).
Behavior Feedback. In some cases, optimizing only the
driving path feedback is difficult, thus an additional feedback
mechanism is provided, which is based on the fine-grained
behavior of the ego vehicle. This behavior feedback considers
factors such as the ego’s velocity, acceleration, and heading.
By analyzing the ego’s behavior, it becomes possible to gain
insights into how slight changes in behavior could lead to
variations in the driving path and increase the overall difference
between τ(s∗)andτ(s′). For example, if the heading of the ego
vehicle changes slightly, it may not directly cause a significant
increase in driving path differences. However, such a change
could serve as a valuable indicator, as altering the heading or
6acceleration of the ego vehicle could lead to adjustments in the
driving path, potentially resulting in an increased difference
between paths.
To implement this behavior feedback, the ego’s behavior is
collected from its waypoints in the scenario observation O(s),
denoted as Xs= ((θ0, v0, a0),(θ1, v1, a1), . . . , (θk, vk, ak)),
where θi,viandairepresent the heading, velocity and
acceleration at timestamp i, respectively. To compare the
behavior differences between two scenarios s∗ands′, the
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is used as the measure
of distance between their behavior distributions. The MMD
is a widely used statistical metric for comparing distributions
and can effectively quantify differences between two sets of
data. The behavior feedback function fb(s∗, s′)is defined as:
fb(s∗, s′) =fMMD (Xs∗,Xs′). (8)
Finally, our fitness score is calculated as:
D(τ(s∗), τ(s′)) =fp(s∗, s′) +fb(s∗, s′). (9)
V. EMPIRICAL EVALUATION
In this section, we aim to empirically evaluate the capability
ofDecictor on NoDS generation. In particular, we will answer
the following research questions:
RQ1: Can Decictor effectively find NoDSs for ADSs in
comparison to the baselines?
RQ2: How useful are the Non-invasive Mutation and the
Feedback designed in Decictor ?
RQ3: How does Decictor perform from the perspective of
time efficiency?
To answer these research questions, we conduct experiments
using the following settings:
Environment. We implement Decictor on Baidu Apollo
7.0 [22] and its built-in simulation environment SimControl.
Baidu Apollo 7.0 is an open-source and industrial-level ADS
that supports a wide variety of driving supports.
Driving Scenarios. We evaluate Decictor on a real-world Map
Sunnyvale Loop, provided as part of Baidu Apollo. Following
the existing works [8], [9], we use six representative scenarios
and build the initial ODSs, the inputs of Algorithm 1. These
scenarios have been widely tested in previous literature [8]–
[10], [13]–[15], [17], [28], [36] and have covered all possible
road types in the Apollo map library. The selected ODSs
include left turn ( S1), right turn ( S2), lane following ( S3), U-
turn ( S4), crossing intersection ( S5), and existing driving road
(S6). The optimality of seed ODSs is ensured through manual
verification.
Baselines. Since this is the first work to specifically evaluate
the optimality of PPDs, and there are no baselines that are
directly related to PPD testing. Thus, we design two random
strategies for fair comparison with our Decictor , i.e., Random
and Random- δ. Specifically, 1) Random, which does not have
any feedback and mutation constraints. It randomly generates
scenarios by adding or removing dynamic vehicles or static
obstacles; 2) Random- δ, which does not have feedback but uses
our non-invasive mutation δ. Besides, we selected seven safety-
related baselines for comparison: A VFuzzer [8], SAMOTA [10],BehA VExplor [9], DriveFuzz [13], scenoRITA [14], Dop-
pelTest [15] and DeepCollision [17]. We understand that
comparisons with the seven baselines, primarily designed for
identifying safety-critical violations, may not be absolutely fair.
However, our empirical results demonstrate that they can still
generate scenarios with non-optimal PPDs, which would be
overlooked without a consistency check. Thus, the comparison
with these tools still underscore the need to test the optimality
of PPDs.
Note that not all of baselines were originally evaluated in
the same simulation environment as Decictor (i.e., SimControl
+ Apollo). Specifically, A VFuzzer, BehA VExplor, and DeepCol-
lision were implemented based on the LGSVL simulator [37],
which has been sunsetted [38]. SAMOTA and DriveFuzz are
developed for Pylot [27] and Autoware [26], respectively,
both running with the CARLA simulator [39]. Therefore, we
invested significant effort in migrating them to our simulation
environment for comparison. Since their core algorithms (e.g.,
surrogate models, seed selection, and feedback) are often
general, we kept them the same as the original implementation.
We mainly modified the simulation interface (changing the
simulator APIs) so that they can run on SimControl and Apollo.
Furthermore, we set the ego task consistent with our approach
to facilitate comparison. Details are available on [40].
Metrics. To facilitate comparison with the baseline techniques,
we have incorporated our consistency check into them to
gather the generated NoDSs. In our experiments, we utilize the
metrics #NoDS and #NoDS-Hum to assess the effectiveness of
NoDS generation. #NoDS quantifies the number of potential
NoDSs, identified through our consistency checking with a
predetermined threshold ε.
As discussed in Section IV-A , although our mutation strategy
is conservative, it is still impossible to guarantee with absolute
certainty that mutations will not influence ego behavior.
Additionally, the ADS may plan an alternative route that,
from a human perspective, could also be deemed an optimal
decision. This bears resemblance to the generation of invalid
inputs in existing adversarial attacks [21] or deep learning
testing methodologies [41], despite there are some mutation
constraints. Considering these factors, we introduce #NoDS-
Hum, representing the number of NoDSs validated by human
evaluation. Specifically, the co-authors verify whether the new
paths in NoDSs are truly less optimal than the paths in the
seed ODSs. A NoDS is only counted in #NoDS-Hum if all
authors unanimously recognize it as non-optimal, indicating a
clear-cut case of a non-optimal decision.
Moreover, we also assess the success rate of non-invasive
mutations, denoted as %Mutation. Specifically, the evaluation
involves replaying the ego vehicle in the mutated scenario
alongside the optimal path of the ODS and verifying whether
the motion task can be completed on this path.
Implementation. Following A VFuzzer [8], we set the popu-
lation size NinDecictor to4. In our mutation, we consider
both dynamic vehicles and static obstacles (i.e., traffic cones).
According to our preliminary study [42], we set the time step
∆tin the non-invasive mutation to 2 seconds and the equality

threshold in the Consistency Check to ε= 0.6. The grid size
is set to 2 meters to recognize when the entire vehicle deviates
from the optimal path. Similar to previous works [10], [43], we
repeat each experiment 10 times to mitigate the influence of
the non-determinism inherent in the simulation-based execution
of the ADS. For each run, the budget is set as four hours.
A. RQ1: Effectiveness of Decictor
1) Comparative Results: Table I compares #NoDS, #NoDS-
Hum, and %Mutation across six initial ODSs: S1,S2,S3,S4,
S5andS6, and Fig. 5 illustrates the distribution of #NoDS
across ten iterations of each method in every scenario, where
the median and the average are represented by an orange bar
and a green triangle, respectively. From the results, we can find
thatDecictor outperforms the baselines in #NoDS and #NoDS-
Hum. In detail, on average of #NoDS, Decictor outperforms
the best baseline (i.e., Random- δ):S1(9.4 vs. 3.0), S2(11.9 vs.
5.1), S3(9.0 vs. 4.4), S4(15.7 vs. 7.2), S5(12.1 vs. 10.5) and
S6(5.8 vs. 5.2). Among all the detected NoDSs by Decictor ,
we finally identified 3.9, 8.6, 9.0, 6.7, 9.4 and 1.1 NoDS-Hum
inS1,S2,S3,S4,S5andS6respectively. The detailed human
verification results for NoDS-Hum are given on our website
[40]. Even with very rigorous manual filtering, Decictor still
significantly outperforms the best baseline (Random- δ).
The results indicate the effectiveness of Decictor in iden-
tifying NoDSs and NoDS-Hum. We further observed thatRandom- δoutperforms both the Random (35.4 vs. 16.7 for the
total number of NoDSs) and the best safety-oriented baseline
BehA VExplor (35.4 vs. 17.2 in Sum of #NoDS). This is
attributed to the effectiveness of the non-invasive mutation used
in Random- δandDecictor . It is worth noting that BehA VExplor
performs better than the other safety-guided baselines due to
its diversity feedback mechanism (with diverse explorations),
which makes it more likely to generate NoDSs. However,
scenoRITA and DoppelTest exhibit lower performance. This
occurs because they search for mutations in a wider road area
than others, resulting in many mutations that do not impact
the ego vehicle’s motion. scenoRITA outperforms DoppelTest
as it incorporates a larger number of obstacles in its mutation
processes, increasing the probability of generating NoDSs. We
also observed that all safety-oriented baselines fail to perform
on S3. This is primarily due to their lack of consideration for
the impact of static obstacles during mutation, which is the key
reason for NoDSs in S3. #NoDS-Hum is lower than #NoDS
due to the very strict criteria set for determining optimality.
Regarding %Mutation ( Avg. column), Table I reveals that
Random and safety-oriented baselines produce a maximum
of 95.5% valid mutations (i.e., the original optimal path
is not affected), which is lower than non-invasive mutation
methods (97.1% for Random- δand 97.9% for Decictor on
average). The high rate of valid mutations demonstrates that
our non-invasive mutation effectively ensures the validity of
mutated objects. Note that compared with other safety-oriented
baselines, scenoRITA and DoppelTest generate a higher number
of valid mutations. This is because they explore a broader
mutation space, most of which is disjoint from the motion
space of the ego vehicle, which is less likely to conflict with
the optimal path of the ego vehicle. Compared to Random- δ,
the average 0.8% increase of Decictor in %Mutation indicates
that integrating the feedback mechanism not only maintained
the effectiveness of our mutation process but also increased
the detection of NoDSs.
In summary, the comparison of Decictor with Random and
Random- δdemonstrates its effectiveness in detecting NoDSs.
When contrasted with the seven state-of-the-art baselines,
the results emphasize the importance of robust path-planning
decision testing. Decictor and these safety-oriented baselines
are complementary, given their distinct testing objectives.
2) Root Causes of NoDSs: To better understand the detected
NoDSs, we manually summarize six patterns based on the
potential root causes for these non-optimal decisions. Table II

shows the six unique root causes:
1)The ADS inaccurately predicts a moving NPC vehicle as
stationary, leading to re-plan a non-optimal path.
2)The ADS inaccurately enlarge the impact region of static
obstacles on the ego vehicle’s lane boundaries, resulting in
the change of the optimal path.
3)The ADS inaccurately estimates accessible regions between
parallel obstacles that do not obstruct the optimal path.
4)The ADS overly prioritizes an unrelated NPC’s movements,
reducing feasible space for optimal path decision.
5)The ADS overly focuses on keeping a safe distance from
surrounding static obstacles, resulting in insufficient space
to select the optimal path.
6)The ADS is overly cautious about trailing vehicles, misclas-
sifying part of the optimal area as non-optimal, resulting
in insufficient space for executing the optimal path.
Table II shows the distribution of NoDSs discovered by
Decictor , with the respective proportions for the six root causes
being 6%, 29%, 28%, 15%, 10%, and 12%, demonstrating
Decictor ’s capability to identify a diverse range of root causes
in NoDSs. The Uni. column underscores that Decictor identifies
five unique root causes (No. 1 to 5) compared to the seven
existing safety-critical ADS testing baselines. Notably, our
method detects two unique NoDSs (No. 1 and 4) not identified
by the Random-based baseline, Random- δandRandom , thus
highlighting Decictor ’s enhanced ability to discover varied root
causes in NoDSs.
3) Case Study: Fig. 6 shows two representative NoDS
examples. More NoDS examples and corresponding videos can
be found on our website [40]. The examples illustrate that the
ego vehicle takes non-optimal paths in the detected NoDSs,
even though the optimal ones are still available.
Case 1. Inaccurate Prediction of Vehicle Status. The
Decictor adds a new NPC vehicle in the NoDS, initially slowand located at a distance to the ego vehicle. As shown in the
third column of Fig. 6, by the time the ego vehicle approaches,
the NPC has moved, yet the original optimal path is still
available. However, due to an incorrect prediction treating the
NPC vehicle as stationary, the ADS stops lane changing and
chooses a less efficient path.
Case 2. Inaccurate Prediction of Obstacle Impact. Decic-
torplaces two obstacles near the junction exit, not affecting
the optimal path. However, the ego vehicle (i.e., 2.1-meter
width) deems the target lane (i.e., 3.5-meter width) impassable,
choosing a suboptimal path from an adjacent lane, which raises
risks in real-world traffic scenarios.
Answer to RQ1 :Decictor significantly outperforms existing
methods in identifying NoDSs. The non-invasive mutation
can accurately generate valid scenarios (96.6% - 99.4%).
B. RQ2: Usefulness of Mutation and Feedback
We evaluated the key components of Decictor , including the
non-invasive mutation andfeedback mechanism, by configuring
a series of Decictor variants.
1) Mutation: For mutation, we compared Decictor with
its three variants: (1) w/o Cons applies a random mutation
instead of the non-invasive mutation in Decictor , aiming to
evaluate the effectiveness of the non-invasive mutation; (2) w/o
Mot sets the time step to 0s in the calculation of non-invasive
feasible areas (i.e., only considering the motion constraint at
each timestamp), aiming to measure the influence of the motion
constraint between two successive timestamps. (3) w/o Rem
uses only the adding operation in Decictor under the constraint
of non-invasive mutation, aiming to assess the effectiveness of
the combination of the two mutation operations, i.e., adding
and removing participants. As shown in Table III, we find that
w/o Cons generates the fewest valid mutations (69.2%) and
detects the smallest number of NoDSs (25.8), underlying the
importance of the non-invasive mutation. Comparing w/o Mot
with Decictor , we observed that only considering the motion
constraint at each timestamp is insufficient, and the continuous-
time motion constraint plays a significant role in calculating the
non-invasive feasible area. Our preliminary study revealed that
%Mutation increases while the #NoDS decreases as the time
step increases. The reason is that a long time step will yield

scenarios with reduced interactivity between the ego vehicle
and the added participant, thus exerting a lower impact on the
PPD process of the ADS. Comparing w/o Rem andDecictor ,
we found that mutation with only the adding operation is more
likely to induce more invalid mutations and a lower number
of NoDSs. This is because the adding operation introduces
too many obstacles, potentially leading to the failure of the
motion task. Thus, the removing operation is also important
for generating NoDSs.
2) Feedback: For feedback, we implemented four variants:
(1)F-Random replaces the feedback of Decictor with a random
selection (from Q∪Q′) to evaluate the effectiveness of our
feedback strategy. (2) F-Con replaces the feedback of Decictor
with the grid similarity used in our consistency checking (see
Equation 6) to compare the performance between using a
coarse-grained grid distance and a fine-grained path distance.
(3)F-Path and (4) F-Behavior consider only the driving path
feedback and the behavior feedback , respectively, to evaluate
the usefulness of either feedback type.
Table IV shows the experimental results of #NoDSs. The
comparative results between F-Random andDecictor (35.4 vs.
63.9 in total) illustrate the effectiveness of the feedback used
inDecictor . The results of F-Con (35.0) indicates that the grid
similarity is not an effective feedback metric, as it may overlook
some scenarios with a high probability of inducing NoDSs.
From the ablation results of F-Path andF-Behavior (48.2 and
48.6, respectively), we see that both behavior feedback and
driving path feedback are beneficial for detecting NoDSs. Their
combination achieves the best performance.
Note that, we also evaluated the influence of different ∆t
used in non-invasive mutation. Due to the space limit, the
detailed experimental results can be found on our website [40].
Answer to RQ2 : Both the non-invasive mutation and the
two types of feedback are useful for Decictor to detect non-
optimal decisions.
C. RQ3: Test Efficiency of Decictor
Fig. 7 shows the cumulative number of NoDSs over the
execution time of different methods. We can find that as

steadily increases, whereas other methods quickly reach a
stable state. We further assess the time performance of
different components in Decictor , including the overhead of
mutation, oracle checking, feedback calculation, and simulation.
Specifically, we analyze the average time to handle a scenario.
The results are summarized in Table V, where the columns
Mutation ,Oracle Check ,Feedback , and Simulation represent
the average time taken by a scenario for mutation, validity
checking, fitness computation, and running the scenario in the
simulation platform, respectively. 0.01* represents that the time
cost is small, i.e., less than 0.01. For Random, the oracle and
feedback stages are not involved, being marked as ‘N/A’.
The overall results show that, for all tools, the simulation
process spends the majority of time. For instance, on average,
Decictor takes 77.58 seconds to process a scenario, where
67.20 seconds (86.62%) are used in running the scenario.
Decictor spends slightly more time in Mutation and Oracle
Check than others due to the computation of the non-invasive
feasible area for each waypoint and the grid-based similarity-
checking mechanism. Note that we only consider the mutation
time when generating scenario configurations. However, the
computation time of Decictor remains within an acceptable
range. SAMOTA consumes the most time in the feedback due
to the necessity of training a surrogate model. The feedback
times for scenoRITA and DoppelTest are approximately twice
as long as those reported in [15]. This is due to the simulation
length was set to twice the original settings to ensure the
10ego could complete the task. The differing time duration for
simulation across various tools can be attributed to the different
scenarios each tool generates (e.g., time-out scenarios), which
in turn require varying amounts of simulation time.
Answer to RQ3: Decictor demonstrates efficiency, with
the majority of the time (86.62%) spent in the simulation
phase, while the main algorithmic component consumes
approximately 10.38 seconds (13.38%).
D. Threats to Validity
Decictor suffers from some threats. First, the selection of the
seed ODSs could potentially influence the results. To mitigate
this, we have judiciously selected six motion tasks and created
corresponding scenarios. The decision optimality of each ODS
was manually analyzed and confirmed by all authors, including
a co-author with industrial expertise. Second, the threshold
selection for the Consistency Check ϵinDecictor presents
another threat, as different thresholds can lead to varying
interpretations of non-optimal path decisions. To counter
this, on one hand, we carefully select the threshold εin the
Consistency Check and ∆tin the computation of non-invasive
feasible area (the empirical evaluation of the two parameters
can be found on our website [40]) to reduce the number of
such scenarios; on the other hand, to ensure robustness and
consistency, all co-authors independently review the generated
NoDSs, and only those confirmed by unanimous agreement
among all authors will be considered in NoDS-Hum. Third,
the non-determinism inherent in ADS execution may also pose
a threat to our results, and we mitigate it by repeating each
experiment multiple times.
Lastly, the environments used could pose a potential
threat. On one hand, we adapted existing baselines to the
Apollo+SimControl simulation environment, which could po-
tentially influence the results. However, our modifications
were mainly limited to the interface between the algorithms
and the simulation environment, leaving the core algorithms
unchanged. We thoroughly reviewed the code and released the
implementation of baselines on our website [40].
VI. R ELATED WORK
Safety-Guided ADS Testing. Safety plays the most important
role in the development of ADSs. However, guaranteeing
everlasting safety is challenging and many approaches have
been proposed to generate safety-critical scenarios for eval-
uating the safety of ADSs. They can be divided into data-
driven approaches [3], [4], [6], [44]–[48] and searching-
based approaches [7]–[11], [15], [33], [36], [49]–[53]. Data-
driving methods produce critical scenarios from real-world
data, such as traffic recordings [4], [6], [47], [54] and accident
reports [3], [44]–[46], [55], [56]. Search-based methods use
various technologies to search for safety-critical scenarios from
the scenario space, such as guided fuzzing [8], [9], [57], [58],
evolutionary algorithms [7], [16], [33], [36], [50]–[52], meta-
morphic testing [59], surrogate models [10], [11], reinforcement
learning [17], [43], [60] and reachability analysis [49], [61]. All
these methods aim to generate critical scenarios for evaluatingADSs’ safety-critical requirements, such as collision avoidance
and reaching the destination. In contrast, our work evaluates
the non-safety-critical requirements of ADSs, which is also
crucial for the real-world deployment of ADSs. Compared to
these works, the key difference is that Decictor is the first to
evaluate non-safety-critical requirements for ADSs, particularly
in the aspect of non-optimal path-planning decisions, whereas
the other works mainly focus on safety-critical issues.
Robustness Analysis for ADS. Robustness is a crucial issue
for autonomous driving systems (ADSs). Recent studies have
shown that the perception module in ADSs (i.e., object
detection) exhibit vulnerabilities to various threats including
perturbing sensor signals [62], [63], modifying objects [64]–
[66], etc. There are also some studies [67], [68] work on the
robustness of the prediction module by crafting trajectories
of other vehicles. However, no existing work has tested the
path-planning robustness of autonomous driving systems. In
this paper, we propose the first work to reveal non-optimal
PPDs of the ADS, which can be meaningful to inspiring the
improvement on ADS robustness and reliability.
Path-planning in ADSs. Obtaining optimal PPDs is a chal-
lenging task in ADSs [69]. Existing studies on path planning
primarily focus on avoiding obstacles, overlooking other
attributes that contribute to optimality (e.g., motion time,
path length, and comfort). Traditional algorithms [70]–[73]
often result in discontinuous paths, leading to non-optimal
overall decisions. While, machine learning-based planning
algorithms [74]–[76] could become trapped in local minima,
unable to find optimal solutions. Therefore, given an ADS, it
is critical to evaluate the robustness of its optimal PPDs, but
there is still a significant gap in this area. To mitigate this, we
proposed the first PPD testing technique.
VII. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose the first study to evaluate the
robustness of ADSs’ path-planning decisions. To address this
issue, we develop a testing tool Decictor , which comprises
three main components: Non-invasive Mutation, generating new
scenarios that are unlikely to affect the original optimal paths;
Consistency Check, determining whether the driving paths in
the mutated scenarios are consistent with the original optimal
one; Feedback-guided Selection, responsible for selecting better
scenarios for the subsequent mutation. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Decictor , as
well as the usefulness of each component in Decictor .
