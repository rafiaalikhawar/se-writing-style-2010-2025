ABSTRACT
Log message template identification aims to convert raw logs con-
taining free-formed log messages into structured logs to be pro-
cessedbyautomatedlog-basedanalysis,suchasanomalydetection
and model inference. While many techniques have been proposed
in theliterature, onlytwo recentstudies providea comprehensive
evaluationandcomparisonofthe techniquesusinganestablished
benchmarkcomposedofreal-worldlogs.Nevertheless,weargue
that both studies have the following issues: (1) they used differ-
ent accuracy metrics without comparison between them, (2) some
ground-truth (oracle) templates are incorrect, and (3) the accuracy
evaluation results do not provide any information regarding incor-
rectly identified templates.
In this paper, we address the above issues by providing three
guidelines for assessing the accuracy of log template identification
techniques:(1)useappropriateaccuracymetrics,(2)performoracletemplatecorrection,and(3)performanalysisofincorrecttemplates.
Wethenassesstheapplicationofsuchguidelinesthroughacompre-
hensiveevaluationof14existingtemplateidentificationtechniques
on the established benchmark logs. Results show very different in-
sightsthanexistingstudiesandinparticularamuchlessoptimistic
outlook on existing techniques.

1 INTRODUCTION
Software logs are essential for various software engineering tasks,
such as model inference [ 13,24] and anomaly detection [ 3,17],
sincelogsareoftentheonlydataavailablethatrecordtherun-time
behavior of a software system.
In general, a log is a sequence of log messages generated by log
printing statements in the source code. For example, the execution
of the log printing statement log("retry " + counter) , when
the program variable counter evaluates to 1, will generate the log
message“ retry 1”.Whilesuchlogmessagescontainvaluablerun-
timeinformation,theycannotbedirectlyprocessedbylog-based
analysis techniques that require structured input logs instead of
free-formed log messages.
Log message template identification aims to address the issue by
decomposinglogmessagesintofixedpartscalledmessagetemplates
(templates,inshort),characterizingtheeventtypes,andvariable
parts containing the parameter values of the events, which are
determined at run time. For the above example message, the event
template would be “ retry <*> ”, where symbol “ <*>” indicates the
position of the parameter value ( “ 1”) in the variable part. Log tem-
plateidentificationisstraightforwardwhenonehasaccesstothe

oftheproposedtechniqueshave beenevaluated,intermsofaccu-
racy,inisolation orwithrespecttoa fewalternatives,oftenusing
ad-hoc benchmarks.A notableexception isthe studyby Zhuet al .
[26],whichprovidesthefirstcomprehensiveevaluationofthe13
aforementioned techniques using a benchmark composed of 16 log
datasetscollectedfromreal-worldsystems.Daietal . [1]recently
usedthesamebenchmarktocomparetheirnewtechnique(Logram)
with the five techniques that achieved the highest accuracy scores
as reported by Zhu et al . [26]. Nevertheless, in both studies, we
observed three important issues regarding the accuracy evaluation
of template identification techniques.
First,bothstudiesuseddifferentaccuracymetrics,namelyGroup-
ingAccuracy(GA)1andParsingAccuracy(PA),leadingtodifferent
rankings for several techniques. However, these evaluation results
have not been compared with each other yet, making it hard to
clearly understand how and why the rankings of template iden-
tificationtechniquesvarywhenusingdifferentaccuracymetrics.
Furthermore, some accuracy metrics can return misleading results
sincetheyaresensitivetothenumberofrepeatedlogmessages.This
can be a significant issue for systems whose logs contain repeated
logmessages(e.g.,heartbeatmessages)thatarenotimportantin
terms of the system’s business logic, a common situation.
Second, both studies determined the oracle templates (which
represent the ground truth of template identification results) by
manuallyinspectinglogmessages,whichisanerror-proneprocess.
Though such a process is unavoidable when the source code is not
accessible, the impact of using incorrect oracle templates on the
assessment of the accuracy of template identification techniques is
unclear for the various accuracy metrics.
Third,bothstudiesdidnotprovideanyinformationregarding
the templates incorrectly identified by template identification tech-
niques. Due to such lack of information, we cannot understand the
weaknessesandlimitationsofthevarioustechniquesforlogtem-
plate identification, making it difficult to select the best technique
for a given application context.
Contributions. In this paper, we address the above issues by
(1)providing guidelinesforassessing theaccuracyof logmessage
template identification techniques and (2) assessing the applica-
tionofsuchguidelinesthroughacomprehensiveevaluationof14
existing template identification techniques.
More specifically, to address the issue related to the choice of
accuracy metrics, we first describe new metrics, called Template
Accuracy (TA) metrics, that, unlike GA and PA, are not sensitive to
thenumberoflogmessages.Wethendiscusswhichmetrics(GA,PA,orTA)aremoreappropriatedependingonthenatureofthesoftwareengineeringtaskinwhichlogmessagetemplatesareused.TheideabehindTAmetricsisthattemplateidentificationshouldberegardedasaninformationretrievalprocessinwhichmessagetemplatesare
identified from a collection of log messages. Therefore, based on
standard information retrieval metrics, i.e., precision and recall, wedefinePrecision-TA (PTA) and Recall-TA (RTA) metrics for template
identification. As for determining oracle templates, we proposea set of heuristic rules for correcting oracle templates in ordertominimizethenegativebiasinexperimentalresultsintroduced
1The metric is called Parsing Accuracy in the original paper [ 26]; in this paper, we
follow the naming convention proposed by Dai et al. [1].bymanuallygeneratedoracletemplates.Furthermore,toprovide
additional information about incorrectly identified templates for a
detailedanalysis,weproposeatechniqueforanalyzingincorrect
templates.
From an empirical software engineering point of view, we as-
sess the application of the proposed guidelines by investigating,
using a benchmark composed of 14 existing template identification
techniques, the following research questions:
RQ1:How does the ranking of techniques vary when using differ-
ent accuracy metrics?
RQ2:Whatistheimpactoforacletemplatecorrectionondifferent

RQ3:Canthe analysisof incorrecttemplates provideany insight
to improve template identification techniques?
Significance. Log message template identification is an essential
pre-processing step for automated log analysis research and prac-
tice.Therefore,adoptinganadequateevaluationandcomparison
methodology for log message template identification is of great
importance for both researchers and practitioners. The contribu-
tions of this paper can impact the field of log analysis by providingpracticalguidelinesforaccuratelyselectingthemostadequatetem-
plate identification techniques for a given software engineering
application. Specifically, our empirical evaluation results show that
following the guidelines is indeed critical in assessing and com-
paring the accuracy of log template identification techniques. The

in particular a much less optimistic outlook on existing techniques.

2 MOTIVATION
Given the number of available log template identification tech-
niques, it is important to evaluate and rank them using all relevant
criteria(e.g.,accuracy,executiontime);inthispaper,wefocuson
the evaluation of the accuracy, informally defined as a measure
ofthe abilityofatechnique tocorrectlyidentifylog templates.In
particular,ourstartingpointarethetwonotablestudiesofZhuetal .
[26]and Dai et al . [1], which represent the state of art in empirical
software engineering in terms of assessment of the accuracy of
template identification techniques.
Zhu et al . [26]provided the first comprehensive evaluation of
13 log template identification techniques using 16 real-world log
datasets. They made the replication package publicly available,including the implementation of the log template identificationtechniques, the real-world log datasets, and the oracle templates
forthelogs.Usingtheseartifacts,Daietal .[1]comparedtheirnew

1096Guidelines for Assessing the Accuracy of Log Message Template Identification Techniques ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA
both studies made essential steps towards a comprehensive assess-
ment of the accuracy of log template identification techniques, we
observed three important issues: (1) the choice of accuracy met-
rics, (2) determining oracle templates, and (3) incorrectly identified
templates. The three issues are discussed in detail in the following
subsections.
2.1 The Choice of Accuracy Metrics
The choice of accuracy metrics is naturally of great importance in
evaluatingtheaccuracyoflogtemplateidentificationtechniques.
Initially, Zhu et al . [26]used the Grouping Accuracy (GA) metric
toassesstheaccuracyoflogtemplateidentification.Theideabe-
hind the GA metric is that template identification can be regarded
as a clustering process in which log messages with different log
events are clustered into different groups. Therefore, this metricchecks if log messages that are grouped together by having thesame identified template indeed form the same group as in the
ground truth.Specifically, theGA metricis definedas theratio of
“correctly parsed” log messages (thanks to the identified templates)
over the total number of log messages, where a log message is con-
sidered“correctlyparsed”ifandonlyifitisgroupedwithotherlog
messages in a way consistent with the ground truth. However, Dai
etal. [1]usedanothermetric,called ParsingAccuracy (PA),since
theGAmetricdoesnotconsiderwhethertheidentifiedtemplates
are identical to the oracle ones but only accounts for how the iden-
tified templates support the log message grouping activity. The PA
metric is defined as the ratio of “correctly parsed” log messagesover the total number of log messages (the same as for the GA
metric), where a log message is considered to be “correctly parsed”
ifandonlyif“allitsstatictextanddynamicvariables(i.e.,fixedand
variablesparts)arecorrectlyidentified”[ 1,p.7].Asaresult,theGA
and PA metrics return different results in assessing the accuracy of
log template identification techniques.
To better understand the GA and PA metrics, let us consider the
scenario in which a software engineer (or a researcher) wants to
assesstheaccuracyoftwotemplateidentificationtechniques(calledAandB),usingthesetofexamplelogmessages
𝑀ex={𝑚1,...,𝑚6}
andthecorrespondingsetoforacle(i.e.,groundtruth)templates
𝑂={𝑜1,...,𝑜5}in Table 1; the example is based on a simplified
versionofreallogmessagesandtemplatesextractedfromthelog
datasetsprovidedbyZhuetal . [26].Runningtheimplementation
of each of the two techniques on 𝑀exyields the corresponding set
of identified templates 𝑇𝐴={𝑡𝐴
1,...,𝑇𝐴
4}and𝑇𝐵={𝑡𝐵
1,...,𝑇𝐵
5},
asshownTable1.Noticethatonetemplatematchesoneormore
messages, e.g., template 𝑡𝐴
1matches both 𝑚1and𝑚2.
According to the definition of correctly parsed log messages
adopted for computing the GA metric, messages 𝑚1and𝑚2can be
correctly parsedby technique Abecause ,according to 𝑡𝐴
1, they are
exactly grouped together as they would be by 𝑜1(i.e., the oracle
template of 𝑚1and𝑚2). However, message 𝑚5cannot be correctly
parsedusing 𝑡𝐴
3sincethelattergroups 𝑚5withanothermessage
𝑚4while𝑜4(i.e.,theoracletemplateof 𝑚5)doesnot.Forreadability,
the correctly parsed log messages are marked under column GA
in Table 1. Overall, only four messages (i.e., 𝑚1,𝑚2,𝑚3, and𝑚6)
out of six can be correctly parsed using the templates in the set
𝑇𝐴={𝑡𝐴
1,...,𝑡𝐴
4}, resulting in a GA score for technique Aequalto4
6≈0.67. Similarly, the GA score for technique Bis2
6≈0.33
sinceonlytwomessages(i.e., 𝑚3and𝑚6)outofsixcanbecorrectly
parsed using the templates in the set 𝑇𝐵={𝑡𝐵
1,...,𝑡𝐵
5}. Just by
looking at the GA score, one could think that technique Ais better
than technique B.
However,eveniftemplate 𝑡𝐴
4canbeusedtocorrectlyparsemes-
sage𝑚6in terms of the GA metric, it is quite different from oracle
template 𝑜5.Morespecifically,template 𝑜5containsstring adrin
thefixedpart,informallysuggestingthatthistemplatematcheslog
messages that record different values for the memory location adr.
Onthe otherhand, thefixedpart oftemplate 𝑡𝐴
4isrepresented by
string0xff, meaning that this template will match log messages
thatrecordthe value Oxffatanymemorylocation.Such alimita-
tionoftheGAmetricisaddressedinthePAmetric,whichconsidersboththefixedandvariablepartsofidentifiedtemplates.Inthesame
running example, the PA score for technique Ais2
6≈0.33 since
two messages (i.e., 𝑚1and𝑚2) out of six can be correctly parsed
by the template 𝑡𝐴
1(since𝑡𝐴
1is identical to its oracle template 𝑜1in
bothfixedandvariableparts).Similarly,thePAscorefortechnique
Bis2
6≈0.33 since two messages (i.e., 𝑚3and𝑚6) out of six can
be correctly parsed by the templates 𝑡𝐵
3and𝑡𝐵
5. For readability, the
log messages correctly parsed in terms of PA are marked under
columnPAinTable 1.Bylooking atthePA score,onecould think
that both of the techniques AandBare equally accurate in log
template identification, which is clearly different from the result
obtained when using the GA metric.
While the GA and PA metrics are clearly different, both metrics
share the same issue: they are sensitive to the number of messages
contained in the log (and not to the number of templates). Thiscan be problematic for systems whose logs contain repeated log
messages that are not important in terms of the system’s business
logic. For example, if a log contains many heartbeat messages that
arerepeatedeverysecond,thentheGAandPAscoresofatemplate
identification technique can appear sufficiently high even if thetechnique is only able to correctly identify one template for the
heartbeats.Inourrunningexample,wecanalreadyseethat,though
technique Acorrectly identifies only one template (i.e., 𝑡𝐴
1), the PA
scoreis2

1.Ifwefocusonthenumberof
correctlyidentifiedtemplates,technique Bis“better”thantechnique
Asince technique Bcorrectly identifies two templates ( 𝑡𝐵
3and𝑡𝐵
5).
We want to note that choosing a template identification tech-
niquebasedontheGAmetricisnotanissuepersewhenatemplate
identification technique is only used for grouping log messagesbased on the identified templates. For example, for performanceanomaly detection [
8,17], it is sufficient to monitor occurrence
patterns (e.g., a repetition of the same event in a short period of
time)ofthe(eventscorrespondingto)logmessages,withoutcon-
sideringthemessageparametervalues.However,inotherscenarios
inwhichtheparametervaluesofmessages(e.g., 1in𝑚1)matter—
such asmodel inferencewith guardconditions [24] andadvanced
anomalydetectionusingparametervalues[ 3]—itisimportantto
choose a log template identification technique based on another
accuracy metric that accounts for the correctness of both fixed and
variable parts in identified templates. § 3.1.3 further describes how
to choose appropriate metrics in detail.

To address the limitations of the GA and PA metrics, in sec-
tion 3.1 we propose to use alternative metrics for assessing the
accuracyoftemplateidentificationtechniques.Wethenreplicate
thecomprehensiveevaluationsofZhuetal .[26]andDaietal .[1]in
section 4.2, additionally using different accuracy metrics, including
the proposedalternative ones, to better understand how andwhy
the ranking of log template identification techniques vary when
using different techniques.
2.2 Determining Oracle Templates
Oracle templates are essential to evaluate the accuracy of template
identificationtechniques.Bothoftheexistingstudiesusedthesame
oracle templates generated by Zhu et al . [26]. The oracle templates
weredeterminedbymanuallyinspectinglogmessages.However,
when we compare them with the corresponding log printing state-
ments in the source code, the oracle templates are not always cor-
rect.Forexample,foralogmessage“ status is false ”generated
by a log printing statement log.info("status is " + var) ,a n
engineer with no access to the source code has mistakenly defined
anoracletemplate“ status is false ”insteadof“ status is <*> ”,
by incorrectly assuming that the token “ false” was hard-coded in
the log printing statement.
Nevertheless,manuallydeterminingoracletemplates(inthecon-
text of the study by Zhu et al .[26]) was unavoidable since some of
thebenchmarklogdatasetswerecollectedfromreal-worldsystems
that do not provide access to the source code. Furthermore, from a
morepragmaticperspective,thisstrategyisacceptableconsidering
thefactthatmanuallygeneratedoracletemplatesare,inmostcases,
very similar to the actual templates extracted from the source code.
However,theimpactofusingslightlyincorrectoracletemplatesontheassessmentoftheaccuracyoftemplateidentificationtechniques
may vary depending on the accuracy metrics used. For example,
theGAmetriconlyaccountsforhowlogmessagesaregroupedand
does not consider whether the Technique Under Evaluation (TUE)
correctly identifies templates by accurately decomposing fixed and
variable parts; therefore, one could speculate that the impact of
using slightly incorrect oracletemplates could be limited. Proving
such assumptions is an open problem.
Tocorrectsuchpotentially-incorrectoracletemplateswithoutac-
cessingthesourcecode,insection3.2,weproposeasetofheuristic
rules that can automatically correct many oracle templates. Fur-
thermore,weempiricallyinvestigatetheimpactofusingtheoracle
template correction on different accuracy metrics in section 4.3.2.3 Incorrectly Identified Templates
Regardless of the accuracy metric used, simply ranking the logtemplate identification techniques by their accuracy scores may
notbesufficient.Itisalsoimportanttoanalyzewhythetechniques
incorrectly identify some templates. For example, let us consider a
techniquethathasalowaccuracyscoreonlybecauseitdoesnot
correctly recognize IP addresses as variable parts. In practice, such
an issue can be easily addressed by modifying the TUE to support
user-defined regular expressions for pre-processing structured text
strings like IP addresses. However, without additional information
about incorrectly identified templates, the TUE could be perceived
as being severely inaccurate, even if this is not really the case.
However, both existing studies did not provide any information
regarding the templates incorrectly identified by template identifi-
cationtechniques.Suchmissinginformationhindersthepossibility
to improve existing techniques by addressing the limitations dis-
covered by experimental assessment.
To address this issue, in section 3.3, we propose a technique
for analyzing incorrect templates that can help software engineers
andresearchersunderstandinwhichwaytemplatesareincorrectly
identified. We also discuss the insights one can get by applying
the proposed analysis technique to the empirical evaluation results
presented in section 4.4.
3 GUIDELINES
In this section, to address the issues discussed in section 2, we
present three guidelines for assessing the accuracy of log template
identification techniques:
(1) Do use appropriate accuracy metrics (§ 3.1),(2) Do perform oracle template correction (§ 3.2), and(3) Do perform analysis of incorrect templates (§ 3.3).
3.1 Do Use Appropriate Metrics
As discussed in section 2.1, since existing accuracy metrics rely
on different definitions for “correctly parsed” log messages, it is
essentialtouseametricthatadequatelyassessestheaccuracyof
templateidentificationtechniquesinthecontextofthetargetedusecases.Beforewepresentourguidelinesforchoosinganappropriate
accuracy metric considering a use case, we first introduce new
metrics to address the common limitations of the existing metrics.
3.1.1 Template Accuracy (TA) Metrics. Recall that both GA and PA
aresensitivetothenumberofmessagescontainedinthelog,which
ispossiblymisleadingwhentherearemanyrepetitiveyetuseless
messages,commonlyfoundinreal-worldsystemlogs.Toaddress
1098Guidelines for Assessing the Accuracy of Log Message Template Identification Techniques ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA
this,weproposealternativeaccuracymetricsthattakeintoaccount
how many templates are “correctly” identified by the TUE.
First,wedefinetheconceptof correctlyidentified templates.A
template (determined by a template identification technique) is
correctly identified from log messages if and only if it is identical
(token-by-token)totheoracletemplate(s)ofthelogmessages.In
other words, the correctness of an identified template must be
determinedbycomparisontoits“corresponding”oracletemplate(s).
More precisely, let 𝑀be a set of log messages, 𝑂be the set of
oracletemplatesfor 𝑀,and𝑇𝑣beasetoftemplatesfor 𝑀identified
by a TUE 𝑣. We introduce two auxiliary functions: msg:𝑇𝑣→2𝑀,
which,givenanidentifiedtemplate 𝑡,returnsthesetofmessages
from𝑀whosetemplateis 𝑡;ot:𝑀→𝑂,which,givenamessage
𝑚,returnstheoracletemplateof 𝑚includedin 𝑂.Wedefinethe set
of corresponding oracle templates in 𝑂for a template 𝑡, denoted and
definedas corrOT(𝑡)={ot(𝑚)|𝑚∈msg(𝑡)}.Forinstance,inour
running example 𝑀ex,𝑂ex, and𝑇𝐴shown in Figure 1, corrOT(𝑡𝐴
1)
is{𝑜1}becausemsg(𝑡𝐴
1)={𝑚1,𝑚2}andot(𝑚1)=ot(𝑚2)=𝑜1.
Basedonthedefinitionofcorrespondingoracletemplates,wesay
thata template 𝑡∈𝑇𝑣iscorrectlyidentified (correct,for simplicity)
by TUE𝑣if and only if corrOT(𝑡)={𝑡}; otherwise, we say 𝑡is
incorrectlyidentified (incorrect,forsimplicity)by 𝑣.Fortherunning
example above, 𝑡𝐴
1is correct since corrOT(𝑡𝐴
1)={𝑜1}={𝑡𝐴
1};o n
the other hand, 𝑡𝐴
3is incorrect since corrOT(𝑡𝐴
3)={𝑜3,𝑜4}≠{𝑡𝐴
3}.
Notice that our definition of correctly identified template relies
on the set oforacle templates corresponding to a certain message.
Itisnotenoughthattheidentifiedtemplateisincludedintheset
of oracle templates 𝑂; to be correct, the identified template has
to be identical to the one and only oracle template corresponding
to the messages for which it was identified. For instance, in our
running example, even if there were an additional oracle template
𝑜6∈𝑂/primeex(where𝑂/primeex=𝑂ex∪{𝑜6}) that is identical to 𝑡𝐴
4such
that𝑡𝐴
4∈𝑇𝐴∩𝑂/primeex,𝑡𝐴
4could not be considered correct because
corrOT(𝑡𝐴
4)={𝑜5}≠{𝑡𝐴
4}.
Usingthedefinitionofcorrectlyidentifiedtemplate,weintroduce
twoTAmetrics: Precision-TA (PTA)and Recall-TA (RTA)—collec-
tively denoted by PTA ‡RTA — which are based on the standard
metricsprecision andrecallused in the information retrieval do-
main. PTA is defined as|{𝑡∈𝑇𝑣|corrOT(𝑡)={𝑡}}|
|𝑇𝑣|, theratio of correctly
identifiedtemplatesoverthetotalnumberofidentifiedtemplates,indi-catingthe precisionoftheTUEatthetemplatelevel.RTAisdefined
as|{𝑡∈𝑇𝑣|corrOT(𝑡)={𝑡}}|
|𝑂|, theratio of correctly identified templates
overthetotalnumberoforacletemplates,indicatingthe recallofthe
TUE at the template level.
Thesetwometricsrangebetween0and1.Forourrunningex-
ample,inthecaseoftechnique A,itsPTAscoreis1
4=0.25because
only one template (i.e., 𝑡𝐴
1) out of the four in 𝑇𝐴is correct; the RTA
scoreis1
5=0.2sincethetotalnumberoforacletemplatesin 𝑂ex
is five. In the case of technique B, its PTA score is2
5=0.4 because
two templates (i.e., 𝑡𝐵
3and𝑡𝐵
5) out of the five in 𝑇𝐵are correct; the
RTA score is2
5=0.4.
3.1.2 Relationship among the Metrics. Thereareinterestingrela-
tionships among GA, PA, and PTA ‡RTA. Specifically, when PTA =
R T A=1w eh a v eG A=1be cause log message groups determinedby oracle templates must be the same as the groups determined by
identifiedtemplates, giventhatall identifiedtemplatesare correct
and the total number of identified templates is the same as the
number of oracle templates. For the same reason, when P A=1w e
have GA = 1. On the other hand, having GA=1d o e sn o timply
PTA=1,RTA=1,orPA=1sincecompletelyincorrecttemplates
cangroupmessagesinthesamewayasoracletemplatesdo(like
𝑡𝐴
4inourrunningexample).Meanwhile,sincePTA ‡RTAandPA
consider the correctness of fixed and variable parts of identified
templates(thoughPAcountscorrectlyparsed logmessageswhile
PTA‡RTAcountcorrectlyidentifiedtemplates),havingPTA=RTA
= 1 imply PA = 1, and vice versa.
3.1.3 How to Choose Appropriate Metrics. Given a target use case,
oneshouldchooseanappropriatemetrictoevaluatetheaccuracyof
the TUE. The two important criteria to consider when performing
thischoiceare(1)whetherthevariablepartsoflogmessagesare
usedand(2) whethertheimportanceof amessageisproportionalto its frequency.
When the variable parts of log messages are not used in the
targetusecase,thenoneshouldusetheGAmetric.Forexample,
thelogkeyanomalydetectionmodelofDeepLog[ 3]aimstodetect
behavioral anomalies using the system’s event sequences recorded
in the log. It uses log template identification to convert a sequence
of log messages into a sequence of log keys (i.e., template ids).
Therefore, the GA metric — that only considers message grouping
—isthebesttoassesstheaccuracyoftemplateidentificationinthis
use case.
When the variable parts of log messages matter in the target
use case, one should additionally consider the second criterionabove: if the importance of a log message is proportional to itsfrequency, then PA should be used; otherwise, PTA
‡RTA should
be used. This is because PA is sensitive to the proportion of log
messageswhereasPTA ‡RTAarenot.Forexample,DeepLog[ 3]has
anothermodelfordetectingirregularparametervalues,whichis
not detected by the above log key anomaly detection model. Since
the irregular parameter detection model needs different parameter
values (i.e., variable parts) of log messages accurately extracted by
logtemplateidentification,GAcannotbeusedtoadequatelyassess
the accuracy of template identification in this case. Furthermore,if the importance of system events recorded in the log does notdepend on the frequency of the event messages, then using PA
can yield misleading accuracy evaluation results, as PA counts the
numberoflogmessagesparsedbycorrectlyidentifiedtemplates.
Inthiscase,PTA ‡RTAshouldbeusedtoassesstheaccuracyofthe
TUE.
To summarize, by evaluating the two aforementioned criteria in
the context of the target use cases, one can choose an appropriate
metric among GA, PA, and PTA ‡RTA to assess the accuracy of log
template identification techniques.
3.2 Do Perform Oracle Template Correction

3.2.1 Heuristic-based Oracle Template Correction. The idea of cor-
rectingoracletemplatesisbasedonouranalysisofmanuallydeter-
minedoracletemplatesprovidedbyZhuetal .[26],apubliclyavail-
able, widely-used template identification benchmark. After a de-
tailedanalysisoftheoracletemplates,wenoticedthatsomeofthemcontainfixedpartsthatareunlikelytobehard-codedinlogprintingstatements.Forexample,oneoftheoracletemplatesfortheHadoop
system in LogHub is “ nodeBlacklistingEnabled:true ”; hard-
codingthevalue“ true”inthelogprintingstatementseemswrong.
Indeed, we checked the source code of Hadoop and found that the
actuallogprintingstatementis“ LOG.info("nodeBlacklisting-
Enabled:" + nodeBlacklistingEnabled) ”, meaning that the
correctoracletemplateis“ nodeBlacklistingEnabled:<*> ”.Note
that such an incorrect oracle template is not an issue for the GA
metric, as long as the incorrect oracle template can group log mes-
sagesinthesamewayasthecorrectoracletemplatedoes.However,
the presence of such an incorrect oracle template may introduce a
biasinthecomputationofthePAandTAmetrics,whichdirectly
compare identified and oracle templates. Therefore, we proposea set of heuristic rules, based on the manual investigation of theoracle templates in LogHub, that converts fixed parts into vari-
ablepartsusingregularexpressions.Theregularexpressionsare
provided in our replication package (see § 4.7).
Table2showstherules,theirdescriptions,andsimpleapplica-
tion examples. The DS (Double Space) rule replaces any double
(or more) whitespacewith a single whitespaceto eliminate trivial
whitespace differences between oracles and identified templates.
The DG (DiGit), BL (BooLean), PS (Path String), and US (User-
definedString)rulesreplaceafixedtoken,suchasdigits,Boolean
values,paths,anduser-specificstrings,withtheplaceholdersymbol
“<*>”;therationalebehindtheserulesisthatthetypeoftokenthey
trytorepresentisrarelyhard-codedinlogprintingstatements.Un-
like the others, rule US is made for users who can indicate specific
strings that should be replaced with “ <*>”. For example, a string
“idle” could be hard-coded in a log printing statement in a system,
suchaslog.info("system status is idle") ;however,foran-
other system, “ idle” could be a value for variable “ ret”i nal o g
printing statement like log.info("status=" + ret) . If all log
messages containing “idle” have the form “...=idle”, one could
be drawn to consider token “ idle” as a variable part in the tem-
plate.Inthiscase,“ idle”canbeindicatedasoneoftheuser-defined
stringsfortheapplicationofruleUS.TheMT(MixedToken),CV
(Consecutive Variables), and DV (Dot-separated Variables) rules
replaceatokencontainingvariableparts(suchas“ v<*>”, “<*><*>”,
and“<*>.<*>”)with“<*>”becausethelattercatchesallthestrings
caught by the former, without loss of information. For instance,
“v<*>” is used in templates to indicate version information (e.g.,
“v2”),“<*><*>”usuallyindicatesanumberwithaunaryoperator
(e.g.,“-1”),and“<*>.<*>”usuallyindicatesafloating-pointnum-
ber (e.g., “ 0.5”). In all cases, these tokens can be simply replaced
by “<*>”, which captures all the strings captured by the original
tokens.
Table3showsthenumberofcorrectedoracletemplatesforeach
datasetinthebenchmarkprovidedbyZhuetal . [26],wheneach
of our heuristic rules is applied to the manually determined oracle
templates (columns DS, DG, BL, PS, US, MT, CV, and DV); column
|𝑂|shows the number of manually determined oracle templatesfor each dataset in the benchmark. In summary, for a total of 1363
oracle templates in the benchmark, each rule corrected from a
minimumof13(CV)toamaximumof316(DV)oracletemplates.
We manually checked the soundness of all the corrected oracle
templates.Nevertheless,wecannotguaranteethattheyaretruly
consistentwiththecorrespondinglogprintingstatementsinthe
sourcecode,whichisunknowntous.Section4.6willfurtherdiscuss
this issue.
3.2.2 Using Oracle Template Correction. The proposed oracle tem-
plate correction is meant to be used when oracle templates are
manuallydetermined(e.g.,whenthesourcecodeisinaccessible).
In such a case, the oracle template correction should be used to
makepossiblyerror-proneoracletemplatesmoreconsistentwith
the general form of log printing statements in the source code.
Whenmanuallydeterminingoracletemplates,theheuristicrules
for oracle template correction can be already taken into account.For example, given a log message “
status is false ”, one can
identify an oracle template “ status is <*> ” by considering the
rationale behind the BL rule.
3.3 Do Perform Analysis of Incorrect
Templates
Asdiscussedinsection2.3,simplyrankingdifferentlogtemplate
identification techniques by their accuracy scores may not be suffi-
cient, since such a ranking does not provide any insight about the
reasonforwhichaTUEgotacertainaccuracyscore.Wepropose
to perform an analysis of incorrect templates to further analyze the
incorrectlyidentifiedtemplatestounderstandinwhichwaythey
areincorrect;thisanalysismayprovideinsightstoengineersand
researchers on how to improve the TUE.
3.3.1 Analysis of Incorrect Templates. This analysis is based on
the observation that template identification can also be seen as the
process ofgeneralizing logmessages byconverting fixedparts into
variableparts.Inourrunningexample,showninFigure1,technique
Ageneralizesthetwomessages 𝑚1(“retry 1”)and𝑚2(“retry 2”)

bothmessagesintoavariable.Thus,incorrectlyidentifiedtemplatescanbeseenasincorrectlygeneralizedtemplates.Basedonthisidea,
weclassify incorrecttemplatesintothree types: Over-Generalized
(OG),Under-Generalized (UG), and MiXed(MX). By doing this, we
can understand whether the TUE suffers from over-generalization,
under-generalization, or both.
The core of this three-way classification is the generalization
relationship between templates, which is defined in terms of theformal language defined by the templates. Since a template can
be seen as a regular expression2, we denote by lang(𝑡)the regular
languagedefinedbyatemplate 𝑡.Wesaythatatemplate 𝑡𝑥ismore
generalthanatemplate 𝑡𝑦ifandonlyif lang(𝑡𝑦)⊂lang(𝑡𝑥).Inour

nothold(e.g.,message“ xi s1”isinlang(𝑜2)butnotin lang(𝑡𝐴

Based on the generalization relationship between templates, we
canclassifyanincorrectlyidentifiedtemplateasOG,UG,orMX.

choice of accuracy metrics.
4 EVALUATION
Inthissection,weassesstheapplicationoftheguidelinesproposed
in the previous section, using 14 existing template identificationtechniques. Specifically, we answer the following research ques-
tions, already introduced in Section 1:
RQ1:How does the ranking of techniques vary when using differ-
ent accuracy metrics?
RQ2:Whatistheimpactoforacletemplatecorrectionondifferent
accuracy metrics?
RQ3:Canthe analysisof incorrecttemplates provideany insight
to improve template identification techniques?
4.1 Benchmark and Settings
Toanswertheresearchquestions,weusedthepubliclyavailable
benchmark proposed by Zhu et al . [26]to assess different tem-
plate identification techniques. This benchmark is based on the
LogHub benchmark [ 7], which contains a large collection of log
messagesfrom16real-worldsystemsincludingdistributedsystems,
operatingsystems,mobilesystems,andstandaloneprograms.To
determinethegroundtruthintermsoftemplates,Zhuetal . [26]
randomly sampled 2000 messages for each system and manually
labeledthemwithoracletemplates.Table4providesanoverviewofthe16datasets(eachofthemcontaining2000logmessagesandthe
correspondingmanuallygeneratedtemplates)inthebenchmark;
column|𝑂|shows the number of oracle templates for each dataset.

of the templates in the Zhu et al . [26]’s benchmark, we used the
following tokens as user-defined strings: null,root, and admin.
4.2 RQ1: Ranking of Techniques
Methodology. To answer RQ1, we executed the 14 log template
identification techniques on each dataset in the benchmark and
used their output to compute the accuracy in terms of the GA, PA,
and TA (PTA and RTA) metrics. For each execution (of a technique
on a dataset), we set a timeout of 24 hours. To account for the
randomness of LKE and MoLFI, we repeated the correspondingexperiments 30 times and computed the average results. Noticethat we did not use oracle template correction because it will be
investigated in RQ2.
Results.Alltechniquescompletedtheirexecutiononalldatasets,
except in one case: the execution of IPLoM on the Android dataset
timed out. Figure 1 showsthe GA, PA, and PTA ‡RTA score distri-
butionsoftheindividualtechniquesacrossalldatasetsforwhich
thetechniquescompletedtheirexecution.Overall,itisclearthat
GAscorestendtobehigherthanPAandPTA ‡RTAscoresforall
techniques. This means that, for all techniques, there are manyidentified templates that are incorrect but happen to be able to
grouplogmessagesinawayconsistentwiththegroundtruth.This
impliesthat theGA metricis inadequateto measurethe accuracy
of a template identification technique when identifying correct
templates (both fixed and variable parts) is important.
The left-hand side of Table 5 shows the ranking of the different
techniques in terms of the GA, PA, and PTA ‡RTA scores. The
techniques are sorted, in descending order, by average accuracyscore (computed over the 16 datasets). We can see that Drain is
ranked1stforGAandPTA ‡RTA,butnotforPA.Inotherwords,
Drain outperforms all other techniques, both at correctly grouping
messages and at identifying correct templates. However, SLCToutperforms Drain in terms of PA, meaning that SLCT is betterthan Drain at identifying correct templates when the number oflog messages corresponding to the correctly identified templates is
also considered. Notice that SLCT is ranked 10th for GA but 1st for
PA.Thisisnottheonlycasewheretherankingofthetechniques
differs depending on the metric used; for example, LenMa is better
thanAELintermsofGA,butAELisbetterthanLenMaintermsof
PA and PTA‡RTA. This happens because LenMacorrectly groups
more log messages than AEL, even though AEL correctly identifies
moretemplatesthanLenMa.Suchresultsstronglyimplythatthe
choice of the accuracy metric matters a lot when comparing log
template identification techniques.
To assess how the ranking of the techniques varies when using
the different accuracy metrics, we measured Spearman’s rank cor-
relationbetweentherankingsofeachpairofaccuracymetrics.A
rank correlation coefficient 𝜌ranges between 0 and 1; the more
similarthecomparedrankings,thehigherthevalueof 𝜌.Wefound
that,thoughtheresultingrankcorrelationvariesdependingonthe
accuracymetricscompared,rangingfrom0.455(betweenPAand
GA) to 0.846 (between GA and RTA), the average rank correlation
remainsmoderate(0.666),implyingthattherankingofdifferentlogtemplateidentificationtechniquescansignificantlyvarydepending
on the accuracy metrics used.
To see whether the difference between Drain and the other indi-
vidual techniques is statistically significant in terms of the GA and
PTA‡RTAmetrics,weadditionallyperformedtheWilcoxonsigned-
rank test [ 25], which is a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test
forpairedsamples(i.e.,inourcontext,pairsoftechniques’accuracy
scoresacrosslogdatasets).Givenalevelofsignificance 𝛼=0.05,
Drain is significantly better than the others only in terms of GA;
the𝑝-valuescomparingDrainandAELintermsofPTAandRTA
are 0.1519 and 0.0663, respectively. As a result, we can concludethat Drain is preferable only in terms of correctly grouping log
messagesasitissignificantlybetterthantheothertechniqueswith
respect toGA. However, wecannot saythat Drainis significantly
better than the others in terms of identifying correct templates.
Toconclude,theanswertoRQ1isthattherankingoftemplate
identification techniques can vary a lot depending on the choice of
accuracy metrics, since different metrics consider different aspects
of template identification. When accuracy is measured using thePA and PTA
‡RTA metrics, all template identification techniques
achievealowaccuracyscore(lessthan50%),thusprovidingamuch
worseassessmentthanwhatwasreportedinexistingstudies[ 1,26].
ThisimpliesthatempiricalstudiesusingtheGAmetricweretooop-
timisticduetotheuseofmessage-levelgroupingforcalculatingthe

In section 4.4, we will show the analysis results and discuss the
insights that can be drawn from them.
4.3 RQ2: Impact of Oracle Template Correction
Methodology. To answer RQ2, we assessed how the GA, PA, and
PTA‡RTA scores change when using oracle template correction.
To compute the accuracy scores, we followed the same method-
ology and settings used for RQ1, and corrected the oracle tem-
platesapplying the rules described in § 3.2. Then, we calculated

For all𝑋∈{GA,PA,PTA,RTA}, the difference between Xotcand

Mann–Whitney U test [ 12], with a level of significance 𝛼=0.05.
Thismeansthattheimpactoftheoracletemplatecorrectiononthe
GA, PA, and PTA ‡RTA metrics is statistically insignificant, though
there are some outliers as visible in the figure.
Given that many oracle templates (28.5% on average for all
datasets) were incorrect and thus modified by applying oracle tem-
platecorrections,itissurprisingtoseesuchalimitedimpactofthe
corrections. Through a more thorough analysis, we found that this
was the case because many templates identified by the techniques
are different enough from the corresponding oracle templates tosuchanextentthattheyare“incorrect”regardlessofthecorrections
that can be applied to the oracle templates. This implies that the
impact oforacle template correctionswould bemuch larger ifthe
techniques fared better at correctly identifying templates.
Notice that ΔGA
otcis non-zero for many techniques, even though
the GA metric ignores whether the identified templates are correct
in terms of their fixed and variables parts. This is because the num-
beroforacletemplates(andthereforethenumberoflogmessage
groupsgeneratedbytheoracletemplates)canbechangedbythe
oracle template correction step when two or more incorrect ora-
cle templates become the same oracle template, after applying a
correction.
Though the impact of the oracle template correction on the
metrics is limited in terms of accuracy scores, the ranking of the

Methodology. To answer RQ3, we followed the same methodol-

rectly identified templates into OG (Over-Generalized), UG (Under-
Generalized), and MiXed (MX) types, as described in § 3.3.

many MX templates, such as MoLFI (82.5%), LogSig (77.7%), andIPLoM (69.0%), generated both under- and over-generalized tem-
plates; they require a more thorough analysis to determine where
to intervene for improving the underlying algorithms.
To conclude, the answer to RQ3 is that the analysis of incorrect

4.5 Discussion
In RQ1, the results obtained for the GA metric are exactly the
sameasthosecomputedbythereplicationpackage3oftheoriginal
study [26]. However, the results obtained for the PA metric are
quitedifferentfromthosereportedbyDaietal . [1].Forexample,
on average for all datasets, Drain achieved a PA score of 29% (with-
outoracletemplatecorrection,seeTable5),whichismuchlower
than the PA score of 75% reported by Dai et al . [1]. We could not

tains an accuracy evaluation script only for calculating GA scores,
not PA scores.
One of the most surprising results from our evaluation is the
significantgapbetweenGAandtheothermetricsintermsofac-
curacy scores for the same templateidentification techniques; for
example, on average for all datasets, Drain achieved a GA score of
87%, but its PA and PTA ‡RTA scores were only 29%, 27%, and 29%,
respectively.Inotherwords,bytakingintoaccountthecorrectness
of fixed and variable parts of identified templates, we get a very
differentpictureoftheaccuracyofthetechniquesincomparisonto
theexistingstudy[ 26]relyingontheGAmetric.Theresultsempha-
sizetheimportanceofusingadequatemetricstoassesstemplate
identificationresultsinthecontextoftargetusecases.Forexample,
if the parameter values of log messages are used by a log-based
analysis task, e.g., model inference with guard conditions [ 24] and
advanced anomaly detection using parameter values [ 3], accuracy
should be assessed using PA or TA scores since they adequately
measureatechnique’sabilitytocorrectlyidentifythevariablepartsoflogmessages.However,onemightarguethatPAandTAmetrics
are too strict to fairly indicate the usefulness of template identi-fication techniques as no degree of correctness is accounted for
individual templates, even for the cases where the variable parts of
log messages matter. More studies are therefore required to better
understand the relationship between various accuracy scores oftemplate identification techniques and their actual usefulness in
specific applications.
For some of the techniques (e.g., Drain), the importance of or-
acle template corrections is confirmed by the evaluation results.
However,overall,theimpactofsuchcorrectionsonaccuracyscores
is limited. Based on our analysis, we reckon that the more accu-
rate the technique, the more likely its ranking is to be significantly
affectedbyoracletemplatecorrections.Sincealltechniques,tovari-ousdegrees,farerelativelypoorly,asdiscussedabove,thisresultinlimitedimpactonaccuracy.Inthefuture,astemplateidentification
techniques are expected to improve, oracle template corrections
will increasingly become important.
Wealsoshowthattheanalysisofincorrectlyidentifiedtemplates
canprovideinsightsonhowtoimproveindividualtechniquesby
understanding their limitations in terms of the over- and under-
generalizationoftemplates.Nevertheless,sincedecreasingtheover-
generalizationmayincreaseunder-generalizationandviceversa,
how to practically improve the accuracy of the techniques remains
an open problem for future work.
4.6 Threats to Validity
Using a specific set of log datasets is a potential threat to external
validity. However, the benchmark contains 16 log datasets from
real-worldsystemsandthecorrespondingoracletemplates,andhasbeenusedinpreviousstudiesfocusedonlogtemplateidentificationtechniques[
1,26].Nevertheless,furtherexperimentswithdifferent
benchmarks are required to improve the generalizability of our
results.

above,wecheckedthattheGAscoresobtainedbyourexperiments
are exactly the same as those computed by the replication package
of Zhu et al. [26].
The heuristic rules for oracle template correction can also be
potential threats to internal validity. Ideally, correct oracle tem-plates extracted from the source code are mandatory to validate
theheuristicrules.Atthesametime,suchextractiontaskisvery
challenging, even for open-source programs. This is because differ-
entversionsofthesameprogrammayhavedifferentlogprinting
statementswhilethelogsprovidedinthebenchmark[ 26]donot
havethecorrespondingprogramversioninformation.Therefore,
for each program, one should manually check many previous ver-
sions to find log printing statements that would generate the given
log messages; moreover, older versions may no longer be available.

5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we provide three guidelines for evaluating the accu-
racy of log message template identification techniques. We alsoassess the application of such guidelines through a comprehen-
siveevaluationof14logtemplateidentificationtechniquesusing
a benchmark composed of 16 real-world log datasets, previously
usedintheliterature.Theevaluationresultsshowthattheaccuracy
assessment results for different techniques may significantly vary
depending on whether the guidelines are followed.
As part of future work, we plan to further refine the accuracy
metrics, for example by incorporating the concept of edit distance
to compute the similaritybetween identified templates andtheir
corresponding oracles, leveraging the idea proposed by Nedelkoskiet al
.[18]. We also plan to apply template identification techniques
to specific applications, such as anomaly detection, and measure
the impact of incorrectly identifiedtemplates on the performance
of such applications.
