1 INTRODUCTION
Open-source digital infrastructure is heavily relied upon by billion-
dollarcorporations,governments,startups,hobbyists,andpretty
mucheveryoneelsewhobuildssoftware[ 33].However,despitethe
broadreliance on open source,thereliability andcontinuedmain-
tenance of many of these projects is no sure thing, especially since
muchofthecreationandmaintenancee ￿ortcomesfromvolunteer
maintainers who may stop contributing and disengage from the
project at any point [ 33,39]. When open source maintainers dis-
engage, more often than not, nobody else steps up and the project
becomesabandoned[ 4].Thistensionbetweentherelianceonopen
source and the uncertainty of future maintenance has fueled the
needtostudy,andimprove,open-source sustainability.

e.g., by improving onboarding processes [ 34,49,95],￿nding sus-
tainable funding models [ 92,112], or preventing maintainer dis-
engagement [ 4,13,73]. Yet, maintainers often leave projects for
arguably sensible reasons [ 73], such as changing jobs, losing in-
terest,orstartingafamily.Assuch, therewill alwaysbearisk for
users of open-source infrastructure that some direct or indirect de-

as we will show, there are many ways that developers can pre-

strategiesthat can helpreduce reactioncostswhen abandonment
occurs.Inthispaper,wecollect,curate,andcontextualizetheexperi-
encesandpracticesofdeveloperswhohavedealtwithopen-source

developers do when facing open-source dependency abandonment,
we explore this topic withtworesearchquestions(RQs):
RQ1Howdodeveloperspreparefortheriskofopen-sourcede-
pendency abandonment?
RQ2Howdodevelopersdealwithopen-sourcedependencyaban-
donment, onceitoccurs?
We conducted semi-structured, in-depthinterviews with33 de-
velopers who have experienced open-source dependency abandon-
ment, which we will refer to as just abandonment moving forward
forbrevity.Weidenti ￿edthreestagesduringthedependencylife
cycle where interviewees commonly took action to address the
risksandrealitiesofdependencyabandonment:beforeadoption,
while using a dependency that is still being maintained, and after a
dependency hasbecomeabandoned(see Figure 1). Whileweiden-
ti￿ed a wide range of philosophies surrounding preparing for and
dealing with abandonment, there was a common sentiment that
thereareoften very fewresourcesondealingwithabandonment;
interviewees often had to ￿gure it out by trial-and-error with little
guidance.
Whilenot allintervieweesbelieved itwasworthwhile toinvest
inpreparingforabandonment,somedid,andtheyprepared,e.g.,
bycreatingabstractionlayersintheircodebasetolocalizedepen-
dency use, and by monitoring the dependency and its surrounding
community to stay informed of any issues or potential signs of
abandonment. Once interviewees identi ￿ed abandonment, they
often sought support and guidance from the community, switched
to alternative dependencies, and forked or vendored abandoned
dependencycode.Overall,wesuggestthatthereisapotentialto

2 RELATED WORK
Dependency Management. Open-source dependencies can pro-
vide free reusable functionality to developers. By building on these
resources,developerscanturnideasintoprototypesandprototypes
into deployment code in a fraction of the time and at a fraction
ofthecostpreviouslypossible.However,thereisanotabledown-
sidetodependencies,namely dependencymanagement .Duetoboth
internalandexternalevolutionarypressurestoenhancefeatures,
￿x bugs, and patch vulnerabilities, dependencies and their appli-
cation programming interfaces (APIs) change over time [ 63,81],
sometimesbecomingincompatiblewitholdversionsorotherde-
pendencies a project may have [ 8,54,82]. Such pressures often
make coordinating dependency updates and maintaining compati-
bilitybetweendependencyrequirementsacomplextask,especially
whenlotsofdependenciesareusedorwhen breakingchanges occur,
i.e.,changesthat requireusers torefactortheir code.Additionally,
projects can face security vulnerabilities through their dependency
supply chain, including transitive dependencies where dependen-
cies have dependencies of their own [ 61]. Cross-ecosystem studies
of the presence of vulnerable dependencies have highlighted the
importance of managing and updating dependencies [ 85,111]. Be-
causeofthecomplexities ofdependencymanagement,therehave
been calls for documenting all dependencies in a software bill of
materials (SBOM), including a US executive order signed in May
2021.1In short, dependency management is a complex ongoing
problem that has been studiedindi ￿erentways.
Whendevelopersswitchdependenciesorupdateafterabreak-
ing change, they often face nontrivial migration work in their own
codebase.Researchershaveattemptedtoaddressthemanychal-
lenges surrounding dependency migration by trying to understand
how developers migrate between libraries [ 2,23,98,99], and by
creatingnumeroustoolssupportingmigration[ 3,15,108].Evenso,
attemptstosupportmigrationthusfarhavegenerallysupported
limitedvarietiesofAPIevolution,givingthemalimitedscopeof
applicability[ 16,31,80], andlimitedsuccessinpractice[ 23].
Because keeping up to date with dependency updates can be
challenging, research has studied how developers approach and
manage dependency updates [ 6,26,27]. Despite common concerns
about the continued maintenance of dependencies [ 33], developers
tend to eitherbe slowabout updatingdependencies ornot update
thematall[ 28,29,89],raisingquestionsaboutwhetherabandon-
ment is actually a problem if many projects rely on old versions
anyway. A study of 4,600 GitHub projects found that developers

particular focus has been directed towards studying how breaking
changes are dealt with [ 8]. However, to the best of our knowledge,

pendencies that have been abandoned and that are therefore no

Open-Source Sustainability. Nearly everything we do on screens
from checking email and stock prices to online shopping and read-
ing the news relies on and could not function without open-source
software [ 33]. In 2018, npm, Inc. estimated that, on average, 97%
of the code on modern web applications comes from npm [ 79].
While di￿cult to quantify, the economic value of open source is
alsosigni ￿cant;someestimatethatin2010open-sourcesoftware
produced 342 billion Euros of economic value in Europe alone [ 25].
Nonetheless,despitethewidespreadrelianceonopensource,there-
liabilityandcontinuedmaintenanceofmanyoftheseprojectsisno
sure thing – this is a key motivation for open-source sustainability
research.
Priorresearcharguesthataproject’smaintainersareacrucial

parts ofthe contributor lifecyclehave been studiedthoroughly.
Intermsofattractingnewcontributors,researchershavestud-
ied the barriers faced by new contributors [ 83,94–96,106], the
projectcharacteristicsassociatedwithgreaterattractivenesstonew
contributors [ 10,42,87], and even the role of social media [ 35].
Research supporting the onboarding of contributors has studied
the onboarding process [ 24,32,55,106], the role of sca ￿olding,
mentoring, and social ties [ 34,52,56,97,103,109], and the char-
acteristicsofcontributors who succeeded inbecomingpart ofthe
core team [ 44,104,113]. Research on retaining core contributors
focused on why they disengage [ 13,57,73], the role of maintain-
ing a healthy community to reduce that risk [ 38,72,86], and the
impact of disengagement on the health and survival probability of
aproject[ 37,40,58,67,76,88,105].
Research has also studied the impacts of project and ecosys-
temcharacteristicsandorganizationalstructuresonopen-source
projects including the e ￿ect of codes of conduct [ 93,101], how
badges can be used as a signal to attract new contributors [ 102],
how project and ecosystem characteristics impact maintainer re-
tention and project activity [ 19,51,105], the maintainability and
sustainability of projects [ 18,51,91,110,114], and the impact of
commercialinvolvement onopen-sourcedevelopment[ 14].
Takingastepback,wecanobservethatalmostallsustainabil-
ity research focuses on studying various factors, characteristics,
and phenomena that support the goal of keeping particular projects
or ecosystems alive and actively maintained . However, because of
the self-organized and volunteer-based nature of much of open
source, we likely cannot stop all projects from being abandoned

maintainers sometimes disengage for various reasons that occur

having enough time, or simply losing interest [ 73]. Maintainers
losinginterest orno longerhavingenough timetocontribute are
two common reasons open-source projects fail [ 17]. One study
of popular projects on GitHub found that 16% were abandoned
by maintainers, and in 59% of those abandoned projects, nobody

abandoned[ 4].Therefore,sinceopensourceisdependedonby “our
economy and society, from multi-million dollar companies to govern-
ment websites” [33] to support the rapid and e ￿cient development
of modern software, we argue open-source sustainability research
must expand its focus to include supporting the sustainable useof
opensourcebyhelpingdevelopersbetterprepareforanddealwith
dependency abandonment and its consequences when it occurs.
This general direction, which we pursue in this paper, has received
relatively little attention in the literature, with a few exceptions of

howdeveloperspreparefor(RQ1)anddealwith(RQ2)dependency
abandonment,weusedaniterativeresearchprocessandqualitative
researchmethods.Speci ￿cally,weperformedsemi-structuredinter-

instead iteratively built our understanding and adjusted our inter-
viewguideandcodebookintandemthroughouttheinterviews[ 66].
We willnowdiscuss study design,analysis,andlimitations.
3.1 Identifying andRecruiting Participants

ing with open source dependency abandonment, for our interview

suchmaintainers,weworkedbackward:First,weidenti ￿edaban-
doned projects, then we identi ￿ed projects that depend on each
abandoned project, i.e., the dependents , and￿nally, we identi ￿ed
the maintainersofthosedependents.
De￿ning and Identifying Abandoned Projects. Because cus-
toms and behaviors surrounding dependency management can
vary widely by ecosystem [ 8], we searched for abandoned projects

Using data cross-linked between GHTorrent [ 47] and each ecosys-
tem’srespectivepackagemanagerwebsite(matchingpackagesto
theircorrespondingGitHubrepositories,whenmentionedexplic-
itlyinthepackagemanagermetadata),weheuristicallysearched
forprojectswithsignsofabandonment.Concretely,weidenti ￿ed
all projects with at least ten commits a month for two consecutive
yearsandlessthanthreecommitstotalinthefollowingyear,i.e.,
the year in which the project is presumed abandoned; the three-
commitsthresholdallowsforsomeresidualactivity(e.g.,posting
warnings about abandonment in the README ￿le) and mirrors
prior work [ 73,105]. Once we had a pool of potentially abandoned
projects,werandomlysampledandmanuallyevaluatedwhether
eachprojectseemedindeedabandonedbyinvestigatingtheactivity
patterns on each project’s GitHub repository until we had 10-20
high-con￿dence abandoned projects per ecosystem. For this we
looked at the most recent period we could observe at the time –
the￿rst six months of 2022, regardless of the year we suspected
the project was abandoned based on the automated heuristic – and

7We sent a small number of targeted emails, based on information our participants
postedpubliclyin their pro ￿le. In terms of research ethics, especially the Belmont
report’sprinciplesof respectforpersons andbene￿cence,weconsiderthatthecosts(e.g.,
potentially unwanted emails) and risks (e.g., releasing con ￿dential information) to
potential participants are low, and insights gained in better dependency management
bene￿t all open source contributors. We considered alternative sampling strategies
andconcludedthatbecausewewereinterestedinspeakingtoaspeci ￿cgroupofopen
source maintainers, that it seems unlikely that we could have recruited people in a
di￿erent (less targeted way) without increasing the general cost to the community by
engagingwith largegroupsof maintainers.and (5) whether they considered or evaluated the risk of the de-
pendency becoming abandoned before adoption. Since the goal of
theinterviewswastounderstandhowintervieweespreparedfor
and dealt with the abandonment, during interviews where time
permitted we identi ￿ed additional abandoned dependencies to dis-
cuss,inadditiontotheoriginaldependenciesthatwereidenti ￿ed,
by asking “have there been other instances of any of your project’s
open-source dependencies becoming unmaintained or abandoned by
maintainers?” We typically were able to discuss two abandoned
dependencies per interview, and we kept discussions focused on
thosespeci ￿c casesto getconcrete insights.
3.3 Data CollectionandAnalysis
The interviews took place over Zoom and lasted 25 minutes on
average. In total we conducted 32 interviews (P1-32) where one
interview was with two developers (P2a, P2b). We qualitatively
analyzedtheinterviewtranscriptsusingiterativethematicanaly-
sis[9].TheprocessfollowedLincolnandGuba’strustworthiness
criteria[48],asdiscussedbyNowelletal.[ 77].Duringthisprocess,
we were perpetually switching between the stages of exploring
therichtranscripts,engagingwithandanalyticallymemoingthe
data [71], coding, searching for themes, and re ￿ning the codes and
coding framework, as isrecommended[ 66].
Theanalysisbeganwiththe ￿rstauthorperformingopen-ended
inductivecodingofeachinterviewaswewent.Afterthe ￿rsteleven
interviews,alltheauthorscametogetherandperformedanin-depth
analysisofthecodesandcodingframe.Iterativeadjustmentstothe
codingframeandinterviewguideweremadeasnecessary.Once
a coding frame was settled on, the ￿rst author re-coded all the
transcripts, with any uncertain cases being reviewed by another
author. We stopped running interviews once we reached our satu-
ration criterion, which we de ￿ned as three consecutive interviews
withoutlearninganynewmajorinsights[ 41].Alaterparticipant
discussed a dependency that was marked abandoned but still re-
ceivedsecurityupdates,andweexploredthisfurtherbyidentifying
and interviewing developers who faced this type of dependency
abandonment. We quickly reachedsaturation and did not ￿nd any
newmajorinsights.
3.4 ValidityCheck
To validate and check for ￿t and applicability of our ￿ndings as
de￿ned by Corbin and Strauss [ 22], we performed a validity check
bysharingour ￿ndingsandresultswithinterviewees.Wecon ￿rmed
our interpretations of the rich interview data aligned with the
interviewees’experiencesbygettinginterviewees’thoughtsand
feedback. We sent all interviewees summaries and the complete
drafts of Secs. 4,5,6, and7. We also sent a list of prompts and
questionsaskingintervieweestolookthroughthedocumentsfor
areasofagreementordisagreement,generalcorrectness,andany
additional insightsthey gained after readingthrough the ￿ndings
as well as the experiences andstrategies of otherdevelopers.
Sixintervieweesresponded,allsixcon ￿rmedthattheylargely
agree with our ￿ndings, e.g., “I think your paper is a well-considered
analysisofthe subjectthat ￿tswithmyexperience,fwiw” (P11).One
interviewee pushed back on augments made by other interviewees
suggestingthatabandonmentwasnotalwaysaproblembecause

waysproblematicandalwayshasanimpact,evenifthesoftwareitself
isnotbroken,because abandonment stillforcesaconsumertoactas
if it is abandoned, i.e. to prepare for breakage or vulnerabilities” (P4).
3.5 Limitations
The￿ndings of our qualitative interview study su ￿er from the
same limitations commonly found in work of this kind. Generaliza-
tion beyond the pool of interviewees should be made with caution.
Self-selection bias could in ￿uence the transferability of the results
becausetherecouldbedi ￿erencesinthepersonalitiesandbeliefsin

we de￿ned ‘abandoned’ dependencies since the de ￿nition may not
fully represent the concept of project abandonment [ 68], although
duringthediscussionswithintervieweestherewasagreementwith
our de￿nition.
4 IMPACTSOFABANDONMENT
Unlike breaking changes which by de ￿nition break things, it is not
obvious that dependency abandonment in and of itself is problem-
atic.Ifadependencyworkedlastyearandhasnotbeenchanged,
there is no inherent reason why its abandonment would cause
problems.However,Lehmanarguesthatsoftwareeither “undergoes
continualchangesorbecomesprogressivelylessuseful” [64].Westart
byexploring ifandhowabandonmentimpacted interviewees.We
provide a summary of the types of impacts experienced in Figure 1.
ConcreteProblems. Wede￿neconcreteproblemsastechnicalprob-

was a core dependency, so we needed it to work [with Python 3], and
it didn’t.Soweended uphavingto moveto another library” (P17).
Some interviewees described experiencing performance de-
creases(P13, 32) as a result of dependency abandonment. One
intervieweedescribedhowtheyhadtodependonmultipleversions
of their core libraries because the unmaintained dependency relied
on older versions but their other dependencies relied on newer
versions as they were released, which increased compile times and
binary size for end users(P32).
Some dependencies were missing needed features (P14, 20,
23) or features that interviewees believed may be necessary in the
future,whichtheynolongerexpectedbecauseoftheabandonment.
AnticipatedProblems. Anticipatedproblemsareproblemsinter-
viewees are concerned may impact the project in the future but
haveyettomaterialize.Someintervieweeshad concernsabout
future updates (P16, 22, 29) and worried there could be problems
downthelineduetothelackofmaintenance,suchasincompatibil-
ityissueswhenupdatingotherdependencies.Forexample, “Iwas
notfacinganyprobleminparticular,butIwasconcernedbecausethe
librarydidn’tget anyupdates” (P16).Some had security concerns (P4, 22, 28, 29) about potential
future vulnerabilities or other security-related issues. However, no
intervieweesreportedexperiencinganactualsecurityvulnerability
associated with an abandoned dependency. For example, “we’ve
never had a security incident related to an abandoned dependency,
butthat’salwaysaconcern—thattherecould beasecurityvulnera-
bility”(P4).
GeneralImpacts. Inmanycases,intervieweesdescribedgeneral

7, 9, 10, 20, 21, 23, 25), which was often related to replacing the
dependencyorcreatingaworkaroundtodealwithabandonment.
For example, “right now, we’re working through the fact that the [de-
pendency]isnolongerbeingactivelyworkedon.Whichmeansthatwe
need to switch to something else. We’re looking at [alternative depen-
dency], but there’s really no way to replace that dependency without
rewriting huge portions of the project, and so that’s just something
we have to put e ￿ort into and work through” (P7).Sometimes aban-
donment createdaroadblock (P10,16,21,27,29,30)ornotable

andrequiredaworkaround orsolution to be employedquickly.
Some interviewees reported the abandonment had no mean-
ingfulimpact (P6,7,9,11,16,25,29)andarguedthatjustbecause
adependencywasabandoneddoesnotnecessarilymeanthereis
aproblem(incontrasttotheintervieweesthatmentioned antici-
pated problems , who were at least concerned about possible future
problems). They explained that if the software is complete, does
not interact with other software, and does not become insecure
itself, then the abandonment is not necessarily problematic. For
example, “it was recognized within the organization that [...] one of
the dependencies that the business runs on is totally unsupported for
years [...], and because it wasn’t a cause of many problems it wasn’t
necessarily anissue” (P11).
Overall,intervieweesrarelymentionedconcreteproblemswhen
discussing how dependency abandonment impacted them. Most of
theimpactsdescribedwereconcernsaboutanticipatedproblemsor

appears some interviewees had expectations of their dependencies

leads to questions about dependent projects’ exact expectations
and how they interact with and relate to the concrete technical

commitfrequency (P8,21),lackofupdates (P4,6-8,12,29,30,
32), andlack of progress resolving issues or pull requests
(PRs)(P2a,16,17,21,29).Theseformsofinformationoftenhave
high visibility since they are easily observed during a quick inspec-
tionofthe project.
Manyparticipantsidenti ￿edabandonmentbyobservinga no-

6, 7, 13, 22, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32)which oftenprovided highly visible in-
formation. Often these warnings occurred because the dependency
maintainers had explicitly marked the project as abandoned/depre-
cated or because the unmaintained dependency was causing some
sort ofincompatibility error,such as thosedescribedinSec. 4.Flags for abandoned/deprecated packages are a recent feature of

6.1 Considerations BeforeAdoption
When deciding whether to adopt a dependency, interviewees of-
ten reported evaluating the current maintenance status and the
expected risk of future abandonment by examining project and
maintainer characteristics. Essentially all mentioned factors mir-

Project popularity (P2a, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23-25,

(1)alotofbugsorproblemswiththeproject;and(2)whetherthe
maintainerswere stillactivelyparticipating.
Thenumber of maintainers (P2b, 7, 13, 16, 19, 28, 30, 31)
often impacted expectations for future maintenance; projects with
fewermaintainerswereoftenseenaslessdesirablesincemaintainer
disengagement may have a more considerable impact on project
maintenance.
Some also considered the content and tone of the response
or reaction of dependency maintainers (P2a, 2b, 4, 9-12, 21)
when deciding whether to trust the project. Maintainers who were
helpful, friendly, and welcoming often gave interviewees more
con￿dencethattheywouldbecooperativeandhelpfulifsomething
were to occur. Some used the reputation, status, or previous
experience of the potential dependency maintainers (P4, 8,
10, 11, 17, 19) as an important metric when deciding whether to
trustapotentialdependency.Havingexperiencedmaintainerswith
positive, long-standing reputations was reported to be a good sign.
Choosing Between Dependencies. Several interviewees discussed
factors they use when deciding between multiple potential depen-
dencies.Ingeneral,theyreportedpreferringprojectsthatseemed
more reliable and maintainable over projects with better perfor-
mance or more cutting-edge features. This often appeared to come
frombeingburnedbyanabandoneddependencypreviously,and
wantingto avoid experiencing anothersimilar situation.
Key Insights: A project’s popularity, activity, and main-
tainerreputationwereoftenusedwhenconsideringtherisk

6.2 Preparations OnceAdopted
Betweenwhenaprojectdecidestoadoptamaintaineddependency
andwhen thatdependency is identi ￿edas abandoned, someinter-
vieweespreparedfortheriskofabandonmentoccurring.Interview-
ees engaged in many di ￿erent kinds of preparation. Some forms of
preparationfocusonmakingiteasiertoidentifyabandonmentand
othersfocusonmakingiteasiertodealwithabandonmentwhen
it occurs. Additionally, some forms of preparation are one-time
actions whereas othersare reoccurringactions.
Amethodofpreparationthatwashighlyregardedandseemedto
be relatively successful was minimizing/localizing dependency
use(P2a,6,7,16,27,32)intheproject’scodebase.Thisoftenmeant
explicitly designing the implementation at the time of dependency
adoption in a way that made dependency replacement easier by
minimizing the points of contact using an abstraction layer . For
example, “as much as possible, we try to bu ￿er dependencies with
abstractionssothatspeci ￿cimplementationdetailsofathird-partylibrary aren’t scattered through the whole application in di ￿cult
ways”(P7).
Someintervieweespreparedbydirectly monitoringthedepen-
dency(P2a,4,10,13,27)tokeepaneyeonhowthingsaregoing,
oftenbylookingatprojectcharacteristicssimilartothosedescribed
in Sec.5. For example, “we are always conscious of the dependencies
and looking closely at them” (P2a).By remaining aware of the state
of the dependency and its community, interviewees place them-
selves in a better position to identify early signals of abandonment
whichgivesthemanopportunitytoactbeforeabandonmentand
any resulting concrete problems occur, if they so choose. Some
also prepared by being active and informed members of the
community (P2b, 16, 17, 31) and building relationships with
dependencymaintainers (P1),oftensotheycouldnoticeissues
earlier or have people to reach out to if abandonment occurs. This
often involves at least semi-frequent interactions with dependency
maintainers or other community members to stay informed of the
goings-oninthe project and aware of any potentialissues orwarn-
ing signs of something like abandonment being on the horizon.
For example, “Isuppose Iengaged prettyactivelyinthe open source
community, particularly around Python, so I would hope I would
havea feelingforwhatwasgoingon.Ithink it’spartlyaboutbeing
aware”(P17).
Someintervieweesreport onlyusinghigh-con ￿dencedepen-
dencies(P6,7,11,18,19,21,25,27)inthe ￿rstplace,whichthey
believedweresu ￿cientlyunlikelytobeabandoned.Similarly,some
minimize the number of dependencies (P2a, 9, 11, 24, 27) they
usebyactivelygoingthroughandremovingunnecessarydepen-
dencies to reduce their surface area of exposure. For example, “I
think [we] removed acouple dependencies that we didn’t need, there
weresmallusecases,and[we]justauthoredcodetoreplacethedepen-
dencies”(P2a).One interviewee reported that their development
teamhasaspeci ￿crolecalledthe SustainabilityEngineer (a.k.a.,the
’sus’ role) whose responsibilities each sprint include, among other
things,managingdependenciesbylookingthroughtheircodebase
and￿nding parts that can be cleaned up by removing unnecessary
dependencies. This allows theirteam toslowly andincrementally
manageandremoveunnecessarydependencies,makingitlessof
a large and daunting task. Some prepared by creating plans for
dealingwithparticularlyimportantdependenciesiftheybecome
abandoned, e.g., forking or planning to fork dependency (P2a,
5, 9, 11, 20) sothey have abackupif something happens.
Whether to Prepare or Not. For various reasons, interviewees
often did no preparation (P3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22-
25, 29). In some cases, preparation was something they had yet
toconsider.Othersreportedthatitwouldbeniceiftheyhadthe
time,butthatultimatelypreparingsoundslikeanoverwhelming
ordi￿culttaskgivenhowmanydependenciestheyhave.Others
subscribe to the philosophy that ‘it is not a problem until it is a
problem,’ meaningtheydonotconcernthemselveswithpotential
future issues. These interviewees did not believe it was necessarily
worthwhiletopreparefortheriskofabandonmentbecausetheydid
notbelieveabandonmentisinandofitselfalwaysproblematicor
impactful,asdiscussedinSec. 4.Forexample, “unmaintaineddoesn’t
necessarilymeanthatthereisanyproblemwiththelibrary” (P32).
They instead wait until there is a concrete problem, at which point
1287ESEC/FSE ’23, December3–9, 2023,San Francisco, CA, USA Courtney Miller,Christian Kästner,andBogdan Vasilescu
they deal with it. Another interviewee said the decision of how
and whether to prepare for dependency abandonment points to
along-standingperpetualbalanceinsoftwareengineering.They
explained, for example, that abstraction layers increase project
robustness but can also increase code complexity making it harder
tomaintain,whichcanalsoactasaroadblockwhenintroducing
andonboarding newcontributors (P4).
Key Insights: Interviewees who prepared for the risk of
dependency abandonment often did so by localizing the
use of dependencies in their code base by building abstrac-
tionlayersorbyremainingawareofthegoings-oninthe
dependency itself andthe broadercommunity.
6.3 Solutions to Abandonment
Oncedependencyabandonmentwasidenti ￿ed,nearlyallinterview-
ees deployed some sort of solution to deal with abandonment. The
most common solution was switching to a better maintained
alternative (P1-4, 6, 7, 10, 12-14, 16, 17, 20, 23, 27, 29, 31, 32). Inter-
vieweesfoundthesealternativesinvariousways.Sometimes,an
issue or PR on the abandoned project included a discussion recom-
mending an alternative. For example, “actually, I can see now on
the ‘is the project dead’ issue there’s someone saying use [alternative
project],whichwasthealternativethatweendedupgoingto” (P17).In
othercases,intervieweesusedsearchenginessuchas DuckDuckGo ,
forumwebsitessuchas RedditorStackOver ￿ow,packagemanagers
such asPyPi, or even specialized open-source library recommenda-
tionwebsitessuchas libhunt.com to￿ndpointerstoalternatives.
Anotherintervieweedescribedhowanautomatedwarningabout
an abandoned dependency included a list of alternatives, which
wasusedto selectareplacement(P32).
Often the goal was not just to ￿nd another project that had the
samefunctionality,butthatalsohasasimilarAPItomakemigration
easierandminimizedisruptiontotheircodebase.Forexample,one
interviewee found an alternative with essentially the same API so
the migration entailed “basically just changing the namespace on
whatweimportthat functionality from” (P32).
Another common solution was to fork or vendor code (P1-2b,
4,5,7,10,12-14,16,20,23,30,32)fromtheabandoneddependency;
vendoring means incorporating 3rd party software directly into
a code base [ 100]. For example, “sometimes we vendor some code,
which means we’ll just directly copy the code and re-license it into
thepackageitself” (P1).Adrawbackofthissolutionisthatitcan
increase the amount of code a developer is responsible for main-
tainingovertime.Asone interviewee putit “Ithinkthat’slikethe
lastthingthatanyonewantstodo,justdevelopityourself,because
thenyou wouldhaveto become theone that maintainsit” (P31).
Most of the time, when interviewees forked a project, it was
used as a personal fork, acting as their own stable version with
which they could control and maintain compatibility. Only one
intervieweeexplicitlydiscussedmakingahardforkthattheyad-
vertisedas an alternative for othersto use (P30).
Seeking support from others (P4, 5, 7, 10, 12-14, 17, 21, 23,
25, 30, 32) by reaching out to the maintainers or others in the
community provided insights into the situation and what potentialsolutions or next steps could be. In several cases fellow community
members had already posted bug ￿xes or pointers to alternative
dependencies intheabandoneddependency or createdblog posts
explaininghowtomigratetoanalternative.Forexample, “The￿rst
[strategy]we ￿guredoutis,youknow,gothroughtheissuelistand
seewhat kindofissues peopleare having,andif it’ssimilarissues, I
try to talk to them to ￿gure out what the exact ￿xes are and stu ￿like
that”(P10).
Others[tried to] contribute to the dependency (P2a, 3, 5,
13,23,30)byreachingout tothe maintainer about helpingorpro-
viding maintenance support. In some cases, the old maintainers
would respond after several months, and in other cases this was
notasuccessfulsolutionbecausetheydidnotreceivearesponse.
For example, “I and others were reaching out to the original main-
tainer trying to see if we could take it over, and he was basically
non-responsive. He had originally posted on Twitter; if you look at
that discussion, he was looking for a maintainer. But he just dropped
o￿themap” (P30).
Another solution used by some was trying to help￿nd new
maintainers (P4, 5, 7, 12, 25) by supporting community e ￿orts to
recruit new maintainers to take over. This was often accomplished
through discussionsonthe abandonedproject’s issue tracker.For
example, “I’dsaymystrategyhasbeentoreachouttofolksintheissue
tracker and encourage them to rename the project and get something
up and running, and o ￿er myself for testing if somebody works on
it. So at this point, I’m just monitoring the situation and trying to
encourage others to stepup and workonit” (P25).

7.1 The CostofDependency Abandonment
From interviewees, we heard about the costs associated with aban-
donment throughout our study: We showed the sometimes disrup-
tiveimpactsofabandonment(Sec. 4)andshowedthevarious,often
costly actions developers used to deal with abandonment (Sec. 6.3).
Whena dependencybecomesabandoned,itshiftsata highlevel
from being a free and easy to use software artifact to a potential
liability and source of unexpected disruptions, costs, and concerns.
Onewaytothinkaboutthetotal anticipatedcostofabandonment
is as a product of the probability of abandonment occurring and
impacting the dependent project ( impact probability ) and the e ￿ort
required to react to the abandonment once it happens ( reaction

ProactiveWarningsforUnmaintainedDependencies(Identi-
fying Abandonment). Often identifying whether a dependency is
abandonedrequiresmanuale ￿ort(e.g.,observingcommitfrequency
orlookingfornoticesofabandonment/archival,seeSec. 5).Tore-
ducetheinvestmentrequired,automatedtoolscanprovideproac-
tive warnings for unmaintained dependencies. For example, one
interviewee expressedhowthey wishedthey had a tool that would
notifythemwhenoneoftheirdependencieshasbeenunmaintained
for a given period of time. They described how a Dependabot-like
tool could indicate “if there are no updates to this package in, say,
six months, eight months, a year” (P23)., which“would give an idea
of what kind of things I’m depending on that are starting to go out of
style”(P23).Only one interviewee (P20) reported using a tool that
does just that– the beta Risk Intelligence service by FOSSAnoti￿es
users when a dependency has not been updated in the past two
years [84]. Future work could explore how to design such toolswithout overwhelming developers with con ￿guration work and
alertscausing noti ￿cation fatigue.
Increasing Transparency about Expected Project Maintenance
(Preparing for Risk of Abandonment). While many prepared
byonlyrelyingonhigh-con ￿dencedependencies(Sec. 6.2),deter-
miningwhetheradependencyishigh-con ￿dencewasoftendone
withnon-trivial manualevaluationsofproject characteristicslike
responses to issues and PRs. Transparency mechanisms frequently
studiedinsoftwareengineeringandcollaborativework[ 102],such
as badges in READMEs, can make it easier to assess the status of a
project.Oneinterviewee(P22)explainedhowtheircompanyhas
started putting badges in their public projects’ READMEs showing
their intended support status (e.g.,
 ).
Suchtransparencymechanismscanbeusedtodeclaremaintenance
intention(e.g.,betaphase,hobbyproject,activelymaintained,com-
mercial support available) but can also be used to automatically
summarizeinformation,e.g.,thelastactivityofthemaintaineror
thetypicalrecentissueresponselatency.Beyond shield.io’stem-
plate for a maintained badge (
 , not widely
used),wearenotawareofanymoreadvancedtransparencymecha-
nismsregardingmaintenancestatusorabandonmentrisk,although
e￿orts seem underway at least as part of the CHAOSS project [ 46].
Supporting the Construction of Abstraction Layers (Prepar-
ing for Risk of Abandonment). The building and deploying of
abstraction layers (Sec. 6.2) was widely credited with signi ￿cantly
reducing the reaction e ￿ort, but building abstraction layers was
often a time-intensive process that did not scale well to a large
numberofdependencies.Asanalternativetothevastamountof
researchonAPImigration(seeSec. 2),refactoringtoolscouldbe
enhanced to provide direct support for creating abstraction layers.
Additionally, developers could write reusable abstraction layers for
certain libraries thatcan be shared with other developers to make
subsequentmigrationbetweenlibrarieseasier(similartohowJDBC
abstracts from individualdatabaseprotocols).
AdvertisingAlternatives(AddressingAbandonment). Switch-
ing to an alternative dependency (Sec. 6.3) is a common solution
whenfacedwithabandonment,but ￿ndingasuitableonecanbe
challenging, as it is not always clear where to look. Also ￿nding
actively maintained forks can be di ￿cult in projects with many
forks.Makingsuitablealternativeseasierto ￿ndcanreduce reac-
tione￿orts.Intervieweesmentionedseveralspeci ￿cstrategiesfor
advertising alternatives: (1) posting pointers to alternativeson the
abandoned dependency’s repository page (e.g., notes in an issue
thread about abandonment); (2) promoting alternatives on relevant
online forums (one interviewee (P30) reports creating posts on
relevant Subreddits like r/python when they have a new release
celebratingitandgivinganoverviewoftheprojectanditsfeatures);
and (3) creating blog posts discussing alternatives. Platforms could
highlight postsfor alternatives, curatelinksto external resources,
and highlight active forks. They could also gather a lot of informa-
tion automatically, for example, by scraping what other projects
have migratedto inthe past.
SupportingDependencyMigration(AddressingAbandonment).
Some interviewees expressed how each time they face dependency
abandonment,itfeelslikethereisnoexistinggameplanorguid-
ance to refer to, and that they have to ￿gure out how to move
1289ESEC/FSE ’23, December3–9, 2023,San Francisco, CA, USA Courtney Miller,Christian Kästner,andBogdan Vasilescu
forward on their own. For example, “we really do need rubrics or
tools or something because every time a project becomesabandoned,
or we think it might be abandoned, we feel like we’re winging it. We
feellikewe’redealingwithitforthe ￿rsttimeandwedon’thavea
runbookforthat,andIdoubtanybodyreallydoes” (P4).Beyondjust
suggestingpossiblealternatives,platforms,tools,andcommunity
initiatives can provide support for how todeal with an abandoned
dependency, such as creating a migration guide , showing examples

(semi-)automatically.Suchinformationcanbecuratedwithcom-
munity inputs or generated from activities in other repositories,
which could help reduce developers’ reaction e ￿ortsby minimizing

agiven dependency’s abandonment.
7.3 The Volunteer’s DilemmaandReducing
Community E ￿ort
Theprevioustwosectionsdiscussthevariousactionsusedbyde-
velopers to reduce the anticipated cost of abandonment , each at
some investment cost. However, the person who makes the invest-
mentandthepersonwhobene ￿tsfromsaidinvestmentdoesnot
necessarily have to be the same.The actionsofone developer can
bene￿t manyothers. For example, toolbuilders and platforms like
GitHubcaninvestinmakingiteasierto ￿ndandmigratetoalterna-
tives, which can bene ￿tallthe developers who use such platforms.
Similarly,manyintervieweesbene ￿tedfromtheactionsofotherin-
dividual developers when ￿guring out how to address dependency

Wecalltheseinvestmentsdesignedtobene ￿totherscommunity-

solutionsrequires additionale ￿ortontopofthe reactione ￿ortre-
quired for a developer to address the abandonment in their own
project,forexample,bywritingablogpostafter ￿xingtheirown

However,beyondthesmallhandfulofintervieweeswhoreported
doingso(P2a,2b,13,30),intervieweesdidnottypicallyconsider
creating community-oriented solutions, because they had many
competing demands, no incentive to invest the additional e ￿ort,
or simply had not considered it. This situation is an example of
thevolunteer’sdilemma [30],whichis canonicallyformalizedasa
game with a group of members, where each member can decide
whether to volunteerand incur the associated cost of producinga
publicgoodthatallgroupmembersbene ￿tfromcollectively,and
if nobody volunteers, the entire community loses [ 107].
The volunteer’s dilemma has been studied both theoretically
and empirically in ￿elds likeeconomics,social psychology,orga-
nizationalbehavior,andgametheoryfordecades.Surveyingthis
wealth of knowledge, we collected some practical solutions that
we suspect may encourage the creation of community-oriented
solutions for dependency abandonment:

ReducingtheCostofCreatingCommunity-OrientedSolutions.
Increasingvolunteeringcostsreducestheindividuallikelihoodof
eachgroupmembervolunteeringandtheoveralllikelihoodthatthe
publicgoodwillbeproduced[ 53,59].Thissuggeststhatoneofthe
most straightforward waystosupportthe creation of community-
oriented solutions is by decreasing the additional e ￿ortrequired
to do so. For example, creating a uniform and visible place on
abandoned projects to discuss solutions can make it easier for com-
munity members to post about alternatives or share advice. We
conjecture that tools, especiallyplatform features inGitHub, have
substantial potentialtofacilitateand streamlinethesharingofin-
formationabouthowtodealwithspeci ￿cabandoneddependencies.
Nudging Potential Volunteers. Where relevant characteristics
of group members are visible, nudging [ 11] people who are in a
better position to volunteer and have lower volunteering costs can
be an e￿ective way to encourage creating the public good [ 65].
For example, a bot could nudge developers who already created
an active fork by suggesting they advertise it on the abandoned
dependency project. More research is needed to determine who is
ina ‘favorable’ position andto designnudges that ￿tintoexisting
work￿owsandpractices.
PrimingPotentialVolunteersandRe-framingVolunteering.
Priming potential volunteers to be in a charitable or competitive
mindsetcanimpactthelikelihoodofanindividualvolunteering[ 69].
This suggests that framing the creation of community-oriented so-
lutionsasadeliberateacttobene ￿tthelargeropen-sourcecommu-
nity could encourage such creation and normalize it as a common
action.Alsoestimatingthepossibleimpactofcreatingacommunity-

thegood volunteeringdoesand howsuchactionsalignwiththeir
motivations. Public recognition for community-oriented solutions,
suchasawardsatcommunityeventsorevenjustlistingthemaspart
of a GitHub pro ￿le, could provide further incentives and highlight
positive role models. Gami ￿cation approaches could be deliber-
ately used,such asawarding badgesorpoints,butthey alsocome
with risks [ 50]. More research is needed to understand which re-
wardmechanismsaree ￿ectiveinencouragingcommunity-oriented
solutions.
Facilitating and Encouraging Group Discussion. In general,
incorporating communication into coordination games tends to
improve outcomes and facilitate coordination [ 7,12,20,21,36].
Facilitating and encouraging communication between agents in-
creases transparency and awareness of the choices others are mak-
ing,givingpotentialvolunteersmorecompleteinformation,thus
allowing them to make more educated decisions about whether
to volunteer [ 36]. This suggests that by improving transparency
about what others who face the same abandoned dependency have
done or plan to do, developers are able to make more informed
decisions themselves. For example, providing discussion forums
on abandoned projects could help with highlighting demand (or
lackthereof)forsolutions.Toolingthatcreatestransparencyabout
how others have or have not already dealt with the abandoned
dependency (see Sec. 7.2) can provide insights about the scope
oftheproblemandassuranceabouttheusefulnessofaproposed
community-oriented solution. More research in communication
patterns,informationneeds,andautomatedidenti ￿cationofhow
others dealt with abandonment can help to deliberately design
communicationspacesandtransparency mechanisms.

cus sustainability research on how to sustainably useopen-source

We hope the strategies and insights can be helpful to the many
