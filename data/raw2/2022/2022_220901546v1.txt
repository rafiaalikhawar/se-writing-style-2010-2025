ABSTRACT
When developing autonomous driving systems (ADS), developers
often need to replay previously collected driving recordings to
check the correctness of newly introduced changes to the system.
However, simply replaying the entire recording is not necessary
given the high redundancy of driving scenes in a recording (e.g.,
keeping the same lane for 10 minutes on a highway). In this pa-
per, we propose a novel test reduction and prioritization approach
for multi-module ADS. First, our approach automatically encodes
frames in a driving recording to feature vectors based on a driving
scene schema. Then, the given recording is sliced into segments
based on the similarity of consecutive vectors. Lengthy segments
are truncated to reduce the length of a recording and redundant
segments with the same vector are removed. The remaining seg-
ments are prioritized based on both the coverage and the rarity
of driving scenes. We implemented this approach on an industry-
level, multi-module ADS called Apollo and evaluated it on three
road maps in various regression settings. The results show that our
approach significantly reduced the original recordings by over 34%
while keeping comparable test effectiveness, identifying almost all
injected faults. Furthermore, our test prioritization method achieves
about 22% to 39% and 41% to 53% improvements over three baselines
in terms of both the average percentage of faults detected (APFD)
and TOP-K.

1 INTRODUCTION
Autonomous driving has been through quick development in recent
years and found several new business models such as driverless
taxis [ 8], driverless buses [ 27], and last-mile robotic delivery [ 43].
Nowadays, modern autonomous driving systems (ADSs) such as
Apollo [ 6] make use of machine learning models and logic-based
controllers in tandem to process rich sensor data (e.g., images, GPS,
point clouds) and plan driving trajectories. To ensure the robustness
and reliability of ADSs, autonomous driving companies often con-
duct extensive on-road testing as well as simulation-based testing
to cover various driving scenarios. For example, Google Waymo
has a fleet of 25000 virtual vehicles traveling eight million miles
per day in simulation [ 41]. Waymo has also conducted on-road test
for more than 20 million miles in 2021 [ 55]. Despite the significant
investment on testing, software bugs still slip through and cause
vehicle recalls [ 45] and traffic accidents [ 11,44,56]. Therefore, new
ADS testing methods are in urgent need to ensure the safety of
autonomous vehicles [28, 38].
During ADS development and testing, a common practice is to
reuse driving recordings collected from on-road testing or simula-
tion to test new updates to ADSs, such as replacing a traffic light
detection model with a new model. This is similar to regression
testing in traditional software systems [ 58,59]. However, it is costly
to simply replay the entire recordings to test a change, since some
recordings include many redundant driving scenes that are not
necessary to repetitively test. In particular, a recent study finds
that ADS practitioners wish to have tool support to accelerate the
testing process and reduce the cost of testing [38].
Test reduction and prioritization techniques have been widely in-
vestigated in traditional software engineering [ 13–15,21,22,30,50].
However, these techniques are not directly applicable to ADSs. First,arXiv:2209.01546v1  [cs.SE]  4 Sep 2022ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore Yao Deng, Xi Zheng, Mengshi Zhang, Guannan Lou, and Tianyi Zhang
test cases in ADSs are driving recordings with time-series sensor
data, rather than discrete program inputs as in traditional software.
Therefore, it requires extra care to reduce driving recordings. Sec-
ond, test coverage metrics [14, 50] used in existing techniques are
not applicable to multi-module ADSs, since ADSs contain both
logic-based code and machine learning models. While many testing
techniques have been proposed for ADSs [ 1,2,9,12,20,20,23–
25,36,37,37,52,54,60,62], most of them focus on test generation
rather than test reduction or prioritization. Furthermore, many of
them can only handle a single driving model, rather than a multi-
module system. To the best of our knowledge, only two recent
techniques have been proposed to address test reduction or priori-
tization for ADSs [ 10,39]. However, they can only handle limited
driving scenarios, e.g., road shapes only. Furthermore, both of them
require access to test configuration files (e.g., the road map) to ex-
tract road features, rather than directly from driving recordings.
This limits their utility and generalizability in practice.
To fill the research gap, we propose a novel framework called
STRaP (Scenario-based TestReduction andPrioritization) that auto-
matically extracts and analyzes rich driving scenarios from driving
recordings. In particular, we formally define a driving scene schema
with rich features, e.g., pedestrians, traffic lights, stop signs, and
interactions. We further leverage the publish-subscribe commu-
nication mechanism to dynamically extract semantic information
related to corresponding features from the communication chan-
nels between different modules in an ADS. This publish-subscribe
communication mechanism is adopted by most multi-module au-
tonomous driving systems [ 6,34] and robot operating system in
general [ 46]. Given a driving recording, STRaP first plays it to ex-
tract the corresponding semantic information in each frame of the
recording from the communication channels of the ADS under test.
The extracted semantic information is encoded to vectors for the
ease of comparison and clustering. Then, STRaP slices the driving
recording into continuous segments with the same frame vector.
Lengthy segments are truncated to reduce the length and redun-
dant segments with the same vector are removed. Furthermore, to
expose potential errors (e.g., collisions) early, STRaP sorts the re-
maining segments based on the coverage of different driving scene
features and the rarity of these features. This heuristic is inspired
by coverage-based test prioritization approaches in traditional soft-
ware engineering [ 59], as well as observations that corner cases or
rare driving scenarios are more likely to detect faults [52, 54].
We implemented STRaP for an industry-level multi-module ADS
called Apollo [ 6] and evaluated it in terms of test reduction capability
(RQ1) ,test effectiveness of reduced recordings (RQ2) , and bug detection
speed after prioritization (RQ3) . We created a benchmark of driving
recordings on three different types of road maps in a simulator
called SVL [ 47]. We further developed a mutation testing tool to
systematically inject errors to different modules of Apollo and
evaluated the effectiveness of reduced and prioritized ADS tests.
The experiment results show that (1) STRaP reduces over 34% of
given driving recordings and thus significantly reduces the testing
time in ADS regressing testing; (2) The reduced driving recordings
have comparable test effectiveness—they detected 99% of injected
faults that were detected by the original driving recordings; (3)
The diversity-based test prioritization method in STRaP achieves
39%, 33%, and 22% improvement compared with a coverage-basedmethod related to code change, chronological prioritization, and
random prioritization.
There are three main contributions of this work:
•We propose a general scenario-based test reduction and pri-
oritization framework for multi-module autonomous driving
systems that adopt the publish-subscribe communication
mechanism.
•We make a regression testing benchmark publicly available.
The benchmark includes driving recordings on three differ-
ent kinds of road maps, as well as a mutation testing tool
that systematically injects errors in different ADS modules
in Apollo and evaluates test effectiveness.1. With this bench-
mark, future researchers can systematically evaluate their
ADS testing methods in various regression settings.
•We conduct experiments on an industry-level multi-module
ADS and demonstrate the test reduction capability and test
effectiveness of our proposed framework.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces
the background of current ADS testing practice and multi-module
ADSs. Section 3 formulates testing reduction and prioritization
problems. Section 4 describes proposed testing reduction and prior-
itization methods. Section 5 introduces experiment settings. Sec-
tion 6 demonstrates experiment results. Section 7 introduces related
works. Section 8 describes threats to validity of the work. Section 9
concludes the paper.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 ADS Testing Practices in the Industry
Two primary methods of testing ADSs in the industry are on-road
testing and simulation-based testing [ 38]. The goal is to cover var-
ious driving scenarios, especially corner cases, and check consis-
tency and generalizability of ADSs in these scenarios. Such testing
processes will produce massive amounts of log data, including sen-
sor data (e.g., video recordings, point clouds) and outputs of ADS
modules (e.g., obstacle detection results, speed control commands).
These log data will be further processed for regression testing in
a simulation environment. When an ADS is updated, it will be
tested by replaying previously logged sensor data and comparing
the system outputs of the new ADS with previous outputs (e.g.,
collision or deviation) [ 53]. However, replaying an entire recording
takes a long time and computation power. Alternative, some ADS
developers will manually label and clip recordings to obtain specific
driving scenarios (e.g., overtaking, merging) for testing. Yet since
this requires a lot of manual effort, it cannot be done in a large
scale.
2.2 Multi-Module ADSs
Modern ADSs such as Baidu Apollo [ 6] and Autoware [ 34] are com-
posed of multiple modules to process rich sensor data and make
trajectory plans. A typical multi-module ADS includes perception,
localization, prediction, planning, and control modules, as shown
in Figure 1. Similar to robot operating systems (ROS) [ 46], these
modules in an ADS communicate and coordinate with each other

Figure 1: The Architecture and Data Flow of a Multi-Module ADS
through the publish-subscribe communication mechanism . Each mod-
ule maintains its channel(s) to publish module outputs. Specifically,
when a module generates its output at a timestamp, it packages
the output as a message and publishes the message into its chan-
nel. Each module also subscribes to one or more channels of other
modules to obtain needed data.
Figure 1 gives an overview of an multi-module ADS based on
the architecture of Apollo. As the autonomous vehicle is driving,
sensors such as cameras and LiDARs continuously capture environ-
ment information, package collected data to messages, and send
messages into the corresponding channels. In the perception mod-
ule, a traffic light detection model subscribes to the message from
the image channel and detects traffic lights in the images. The model
predictions are then published to the traffic light detection channel.
Similarly, the obstacle detection model subscribes to both the image
channel and point cloud channel to detect and classify obstacles on
the road, such as vehicles and traffic cones. The detection results are
published to the obstacle detection channel. The prediction module
subscribes data from localization, traffic light detection and obstacle
detection channels to predict the trajectories of detected obstacles.
The prediction result is published to the prediction channel, which
is subscribed by the planning module. Finally, the planning mod-
ule generates the trajectory of the ego-vehicle, while the control
module subscribes data from the planning channel and outputs the
control commands such as steering angles and brakes.
2.3 Regression Testing on Driving Recordings
A driving recording includes all sensor data and module outputs
that are packaged as messages in different channels during the
running of an ADS, as shown in Figure 2. Mathematically, given a
start time point 𝑡𝑎and an end time point 𝑡𝑏, adriving recording
is denoted as 𝑅𝑎→𝑏. Suppose it contains 𝑛channels{𝐶𝑖
𝑎→𝑏|1≤𝑖≤
𝑛]}. Each channel 𝐶𝑖
𝑎→𝑏contains all messages 𝑚𝑖
𝑗created in the
time period[𝑡𝑎,𝑡𝑏], denoted as 𝐶𝑖
𝑎→𝑏={𝑚𝑖
𝑗|𝑎≤𝑗≤𝑏}where𝑡𝑗is
the timestamp when a message is created. Given a timestamp 𝑡𝑎, a
frame𝑓𝑎is a slice of a recording that contains all channel messages
created at timestamp 𝑡𝑎, denoted as 𝑓𝑎={𝑚𝑖𝑎|1≤𝑖≤𝑛}. Therefore,
a driving recording can be seen as a list of frames, denoted as
𝑅𝑎→𝑏={𝑓𝑖|𝑎≤𝑖≤𝑏}. Arecording segment 𝑠𝑎′→𝑏′is a clip of
the driving recording containing frames created in [𝑡𝑎′,𝑡𝑏′], where
𝑎≤𝑎′≤𝑏′≤𝑏. However, since different modules are invoked in
different time orders and frequency, the number of messages and
the creation time of messages in different channels are not quiteTable 1: Terminology Definitions

Messages in a channel can be used to perform regression testing
on the module that subscribes to the channel. For example, sup-
pose a driving recording 𝑅𝑎→𝑏with𝑚frames, the image channel
𝑐𝑖𝑚𝑔
𝑎→𝑏in𝑅𝑎→𝑏with𝑚messages of collected images, and the traffic
light detection channel 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡
𝑎→𝑏with𝑚messages of traffic light de-
tection results. When the traffic light detection system is updated,
by replaying the driving recording, the new version of traffic light
detection system can take images from the recording frames and
output detection results. Then, by comparing the new detection
results with the original detection results in the traffic light de-
tection channel 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡
𝑎→𝑏, we can check whether inconsistent model
predictions or discrepancies are introduced. For example, if a traffic
light detected as in red by the old traffic light detection system but
it is detected as in green by the new one, it implies a potential fault.
Other ADS modules can be tested in the same way.

Test reduction: Given a driving recording 𝑅𝑎→𝑏, a test reduc-
tion method 𝛼should output a list of recording segments 𝑆=
{𝑠1,𝑠2,...,𝑠𝑛}, denoted as 𝑆=𝛼(𝑅𝑎→𝑏), where𝑛is the number
of recording segments. The total time cost of replaying record-
ing segments in 𝑆should be less than the time cost of replaying
𝑅𝑎→𝑏. Meanwhile, 𝑆should be able to detect the same number of
faults as𝑅𝑎→𝑏. More specifically, test reduction shall comply with
two constraints:Í𝑛
𝑖=1(𝑇(𝑠𝑖))≤𝑇(𝑅𝑎→𝑏)andÍ𝑛
𝑖=1(𝜏(𝑠𝑖,𝑆𝑈𝑇))=
𝜏(𝑅𝐴→𝑏,𝑆𝑈𝑇), where𝑛is the number of recording segments, 𝑇
is a function to output replaying time cost of a given segment or
recording,𝑆𝑈𝑇 is the testing module, and 𝜏represents the number
of detected faults in the testing module using the input segment or
recording.
Test prioritization: Given𝑛recording segments 𝑆={𝑠1,𝑠2,...𝑠𝑛}
that detect𝑚faults in the new version of an ADS module, test
prioritization aims to sort the recording segments and obtain a list
𝑃=[𝑝1,𝑝2,...,𝑝𝑛], where𝑝𝑖is the execution order of the recording
segment𝑠𝑖. For example, if 𝑝1=5, the recording segment 𝑠1will be
the fifth to replay. The sorted recording segments should detect all
𝑚faults as early as possible.
4 APPROACH
Figure 2 shows the overview of our approach, STRaP . First, given a
driving recording, STRaP performs message alignment across differ-
ent channels and converts messages in each time frame into vectors
based on a driving scene schema (Section 4.1). Second, STRaP slices
the given recording into segments based on the similarity of con-
secutive vectors. Long segments of the same continuous vectors
will be truncated and redundant segments will be removed (Sec-
tion 4.2). Third, the remaining segments are prioritized based on the
coverage of driving scene features and the rarity of these features
(Section 4.3).
4.1 Recording Alignment and Vectorization
4.1.1 Recording message alignment. As different modules in ADS
run asynchronously and in different frequencies, the timestamp and
the number of messages in different channels are not aligned. For
example, in Apollo, the localization module logs a message every

Step 2: Reference channel

: Reset timestamp
: Copy the message
and reset timestampFigure 3: An example of message alignment
0.1 second, while the prediction module logs a message every 0.15
second. Since the messages in different channels are not aligned,
raw driving recordings cannot be used as-is for comparison and
clustering. Therefore, we need to align them first.
We propose a novel message alignment algorithm to address this
issue. Specifically, we choose the channel containing most messages
as the reference channel to align messages of other channels (i.e.
target channels). Given the reference channel 𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑓, at each time
we retrieve two consecutive messages 𝑚𝑖
𝑟𝑒𝑓and𝑚𝑖+1
𝑟𝑒𝑓from it and
obtain their creation timestamps 𝑡𝑖and𝑡𝑖+1. Then, for the target
channel, if the message is generated between (𝑡𝑖,𝑡𝑖+1), we reset the
timestamp of the message to 𝑡𝑖, as shown in Step 1of Figure 3 .
Then, we iterate over the reference channel and the target channel
to check whether at 𝑡𝑖there is a corresponding message in the
target channel. If no message is found, we copy the prior message
at𝑡𝑖−1in the target channel and reset its timestamp to 𝑡𝑖as shown
in Step 2of Figure 3. In this way, we align all channels to ensure
that the aligned driving recording can be sliced to a list of frames.
4.1.2 Schema-based Recording Vectorization. Given an aligned driv-
ing recording, STRaP converts each frame into a vector v, where
each dimension represents specific semantic information in a driv-
ing scene. We formally define a schema for a variety of semantic
information in a driving scene, as shown in Figure 4. A drivingScenario-Based Test Reduction and Prioritization for Multi-Module Autonomous Driving Systems ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore

Figure 4: Part of the Driving Scene Schema
scene is represented as a list of static or dynamic objects. A dy-
namic object is defined of an actor (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
and an action of the actor (e.g., stop, cruise, etc.). A static object
can be traffic light, stop sign, crosswalk, interaction, traffic cone,
etc. An object can have subcategories and also properties. Our driv-
ing scene schema is designed as a general schema for all driving
systems. Yet one can customize it based on the concrete channel
messages logged by an ADS. For example, in Apollo, each detected
object is also logged with its coordinates and heading direction (if
movable). Such information can also be encoded as new dimensions
in the vector. The encoding function in our current implementation
only considers the existence of different types of objects and their
properties in a driving scene. Given channel messages in a time
frame, it parses the channel messages into a list of objects based on
the schema and flattens the list of extracted objects and their prop-
erties into a vector of integers using label encoding. Specifically, 0 is
a reserved code for none (i.e., undetected objects or properties). This
encoding function also enforces a specific ordering of objects based
on their types for the ease of vector comparison in the next step. For
example, consider a driving scene that contains vertically-aligned,
round traffic lights with the red light on. The corresponding feature
dimensions in the final vector is < 22,34,39,41> where 22 is the
unique code for traffic light, 34 is the code for red, 39 is the code
for the round shape, and 41 is the code for vertical alignment. If no
traffic light is detected, the four dimensions are all set to 0.
After vectorization, a driving recording is represented as a list of
vectors, where each vector corresponds to each time frame in the
recording. In regression testing, if one or more updated ADS mod-
ules are given as input, STRaP will further simplify the vectors by
only retaining features obtained from the channels that the updated
modules subscribe or publish to. For example, suppose only the traf-
fic light detection model is updated. Since the traffic light detection
model takes raw images as input and publishes prediction results to
the traffic light detection channel, features obtained from the traffic
light channel (e.g., traffic light color, shape, and orientation) will be
retained in the final vectors. To avoid over-simplifying the vectors,
we specify several features that should always be preserved in the
final vectors, including stop sign, intersection, and crosswalk.

4.2 Test Reduction
4.2.1 Segmentation. STRaP slices the given recording into seg-
ments based on the similarity of consecutive vectors. If vectors in a
consecutive time range are the same, then they will be sliced into
one single segment. For example, in a 1-hour driving recording, if
the ego-vehicle drives on a highway with no new objects detected
for 10 minutes, the vectors for each time frame in this 10 minutes
will be the same and therefore this 10 minutes will be sliced into a
single segment.
In practice, we noticed that due to noises in raw sensor data
and the uncertainty of DL models, channel messages often contain
glitches —exceptional predictions that only exist for a very short
period of time (e.g., 0.1 second). Such glitches often do not lead
to abnormal ADS behavior since they only exist very shortly and
ADS make decisions based on a sequence of time frames, not just
one. However, it has a significant impact on our segmentation
algorithm. Specifically, it will lead to many tiny segments since
a glitch will produce an exceptional vector that is different from
its preceding and following vectors. To handle this issue, STRaP
smooths glitches in the list of vectors using a sliding window, as
shown in Lines 4−16of Algorithm 1. Figure 5 illustrates this process
with a sliding window of 3 vectors ( 𝑛=3). When smoothing is
finished, we split frames into segments. Each segment contains a
list of frames represented by the same vector, which is denoted as
the segment vector.
4.2.2 Segment Reduction. STRaP adopts two strategies to reduce
the length and the number of segments. First, for each driving
segment, as each frame in the segment is semantically equivalent
(i.e., represented by the same vector), STRaP only keeps the first 𝑛
frames in the segment. STRaP keeps n frames rather than one frame,
because certain ADS modules, such as the planning module, rely on
a sequence of frames to make a decision, not just one frame. In our
current implementation for Apollo, we experimented with different
number of frames and finally set n to 45 (roughly 3 seconds). Second,
as each segment reflects a unique driving scenario, we only keep
one unique segment and remove those segments with identical
segment vectors. By combining these test reduction strategies, we
obtain a list of reduced segments as test cases to evaluate ADS
modules.
4.3 Test Prioritization
Coverage-based prioritization methods have been widely investi-
gated in traditional software systems. These methods sort test cases
based on the total or additional coverage of program statements
or branches [ 4,59]. Inspired by these methods, we propose the
notion of semantic coverage of different driving scenes by countingESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore Yao Deng, Xi Zheng, Mengshi Zhang, Guannan Lou, and Tianyi Zhang

the number of non-zero feature dimensions in a vector. Note that
0 is a preserved code that indicates the corresponding object or
property does not exist. Intuitively, a driving scene with a traffic
light and a pedestrian in a crosswalk has a higher coverage than a
driving scene with only a pedestrian. However, only considering
the coverage of driving scenes may not be sufficient. Since ADSs are
equipped with DL models for perception and prediction, common
driving scenes are less likely to expose faults compared with rare
driving scenes or corner cases, since common driving scenes are
prevalent in training data. This phenomenon has been observed
by several existing works in ADS testing [ 52,54]. Therefore, we
should also take into account the rarity of driving scenes when
prioritizing recording segments.
We define a new prioritization method that accounts for both the
coverage and rarity of different driving scenes. First, given a driving
recording represented by a list of frame vectors 𝑅={𝑣1,𝑣2,...,𝑣𝑛},
we calculate the rarity score of each dimension in the vector by the
formula at Line 9of Algorithm 2, where 𝑛is the number of frames,
nonzero(𝑉[𝑖][𝑗])=1when𝑉[𝑖][𝑗]≠0. The formula presents that
the semantic information occurring less times in a driving recording
has a higher rarity score. The process is shown in Lines 8−10ofScenario-Based Test Reduction and Prioritization for Multi-Module Autonomous Driving Systems ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore
Algorithm 2. Then, we normalize weights to [0,1](Lines 12−14of
Algorithm 2). Then, for each recording segment represented by its
segment vector, it sums the rarity score of non-zero feature elements
in the corresponding segment vector (Lines 16−18of Algorithm 2).
Finally, we sort the list of recording segments in descending order
based on the rareness of recording segments. The sorted indices of
the recording segments list is obtained as the execution orders of
recording segments.
5 EXPERIMENTS
5.1 Research Questions
To evaluate the effectiveness of STRaP , we conducted experiments
to answer the following research questions:
•RQ1: To what extent can the proposed test reduction method
reduce a given driving recording?
•RQ2: Compared with an original recording, how effective is
the reduced recording in detecting faults?
•RQ3: Compared with alternative prioritization methods, how
effective is the proposed test prioritization method in detect-
ing faults?
We implemented and evaluated STRaP on an industry-level ADS,
Apollo 5.0 [ 6]. We chose Apollo 5.0 since it is a mature version with
stable modules. We constructed our experiment as follows. First, we
collected driving recordings from a simulator SVL [ 47]. Then, we
injected mutants into the source code of Apollo to simulate the mod-
ule changes with faults. Third, we tested the traffic light detection
module, the obstacle detection module, the planning module and
the prediction module to build baselines. Finally, we applied STRaP
to split driving recordings, generated reduced and prioritized test
segments, and evaluated STRaP ’s effectiveness.
5.2 Benchmark Creation
We created simulation environments using SVL [ 47]. SVL is a high
fidelity simulator to render driving environments, which provides
bridges to connect with ADSs such as Apollo and Autoware. The
rendered driving environment is fed to an ADS via the bridge. Then,
the ADS outputs control commands and sends them back to SVL
to render the next driving scene based on the control commands.
We collected driving recordings from three maps including Cube-
town, Gomentum, and Shalun in SVL to create three testing suites.
Specifically, Cubetown is a simple map containing a circular road.
Gomentum (as shown in Figure 6) and Shalun are reconstructed
maps based on real-world autonomous vehicle testing (e.g., on-road
testing) environments. These three maps cover the various driving
environments in urban and rural areas. The weather condition and
non-player characters (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) behaviors are
randomly generated by the simulator in default settings. For each
test suite, the destination waypoints are randomly generated by
the simulator. To collect sufficient data, we manually inspected the
waypoints and chose those waypoints with the most complex trajec-
tories. When Apollo 5.0 was connected with SVL, we ran a recorder
in Apollo to record all channel messages generated during the sim-
ulation. In the end, collected test suites contain driving recordings
of different lengths (Cubetown: 84.14 seconds, Gomentum: 96.22
seconds, and Shalun 73.28 seconds). For each driving recording,

A new traffic light detection model classifies a red light as a
green light, which is inconsistent with the previous run
we applied proposed reduction method to obtain reduced driving
segments. Each driving segment is separately replayed to test the
ADS. To ensure that Apollo is in a correct state before replaying
each segment, STRaP replayed the one second before the segment
in the original recording to initialize modules and restore system
states.
We modified the source code of four modules to simulate the
module change with faults. For those modules under test, we im-
plemented a mutation testing [ 31] tool to randomly inject mutants
into the source code. The mutants include commonly used muta-
tion operators such as replacing arithmetic operators, changing
constant values, changing variable values, and changing condition
operators, where the generated mutants can simulate real faults234.
An example5is shown in Figure 8. For each module, 9c++ files were
randomly selected for mutation and totally, 36regression testing
benchmarks are created for each test suite.
5.3 Evaluation Metrics
For RQ1, we used the reduction ratio of testing time to reflect
the effectiveness of the test reduction method, which is defined as
the length of the reduced driving recording over the length of the
original driving recording.

Figure 8: An example of real and artificial fault.
For RQ2, we used the fault coverage to reflect the quality of the
test reduction method, which is defined as the ratio of the number
of the detected faults in reduced driving recording over the num-
ber of the detected faults in the original driving recording. In our
work, we defined a fault as the inconsistency of a module output
before and after code changes (e.g., injecting a mutant). Since each
output is a driving segment, we applied the frame vectorization
approach to such output and retrieved the frame vector list rep-
resenting the output. For the outputs before and after change, we
compared each frame pair. Intuitively, if we find any mismatched
frame pairs, we claim an inconsistent case is detected. To reduce the
systematic noises introduced by Apollo 5.0, we recognized the in-
consistency only when more than 10% of frames were mismatched.
This treatment was proposed since our benchmark study showed
that the inconsistency rate could be up to 10% when we replicated
experiments on the benchmarks.
We calculated the number of faults from the reduced and the
original driving segments. For those detected faults, we manually
checked the visualized driving segments (before and after a ADS
module change) and removed semantically identical faults (e.g., red
traffic light is recognized as green, as shown in Figure 7) to improve
experiment quality.
For RQ3, we used metrics Top-K andAverage Percentage of
Faults Detected (APFD) [51] to evaluate the effectiveness of test
prioritization. Given 𝑛driving segments containing 𝑚bugs, Top-K
measures the amount of segments required for finding the first fault.
APFD measures the capability of fault detection per percentage of
test cases execution. The calculation of APFD is shown in Formula 1,
𝐴𝑃𝐹𝐷 =1−Í𝑚
𝑖=1𝑇𝐹𝑖
𝑚𝑛+1
2𝑛(1)
where𝑛is the number of test recording segments, 𝑚is the number
of faults,𝑇𝐹𝑖is the index of the first segment that detects fault 𝑖.
For example, if 𝑇𝐹2=3, it means the second fault is detected at the
first time when replaying the third prioritized recording segment.
A higher APFD value means the test suite can find all faults faster.

on different ADS modules
5.4 Experiment Settings
For test reduction experiments, we clipped each segment by keeping
its first 45frames as explained in Section 4.2. To evaluate the test
prioritization method, we created three baselines. The first baseline
sorts the segments in chronological order (i.e., CH). The second
baseline randomly sorts the segments (i.e., RD). Specifically, we
randomly sorted the reduced segments by 100times and evaluated
the average performances using Top-K and APFD. For the third
baseline, we first identified the code change in which function in the
source code. Then, we counted the number of calls on the changed
function for each recording segment based on the Apollo running
log data. Finally, we sorted recording segments in descending order
by the number of calls on the changed function (i.e., CC). In addition,
we marked the proposed semantic coverage method as SCand the
rarity and semantic coverage-based method as RSC in Section 6.
All experiments were conducted on a Ubuntu PC with Intel i7-8700
3.2GHz, 32GB of memory, and a NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPU.
6 RESULTS
6.1 RQ1: Test Reduction Capability
Figure 9 shows the test reduction percentage for three test suits on
four testing modules. The result shows that for the planning module
in Gomentum, the reduction ratio of testing time achieves 77%.
Similarly, the reduction ratio of testing time for the planning module
in Cubetown achieves 73%. A similar pattern can be observed for the
traffic light detection and obstacle detection modules in Gomentum
and Cubetown where the test reduction ratios are in general close
or above 50%.
We noticed the test reduction ratios are relatively lower for mod-
ules in Shalun ( 34% to37%). We speculated the main reason is
that Shalun contains more complex driving scenarios and finer-
granularity frame feature encoding functions can be explored be-
sides just using existence of semantic information. We also noticed
that test reduction ratios for all test suites on the prediction module
are relatively lower than on other modules. We manually inspected
the output from the prediction module in Apollo and noticed that
the trajectory prediction for vehicles in the ADS tends to fluctuate
a lot. For instance, for a vehicle in front of the ego-vehicle, theScenario-Based Test Reduction and Prioritization for Multi-Module Autonomous Driving Systems ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore
prediction module in one frame detects the vehicle is driving in
a straight line ahead, but in the next frame the prediction result
is the vehicle is turning right. Such dynamic prediction changes
across frames will result in different semantic feature encoding for
continuous frames for the prediction module thus impacting the
reduction ratios. Nevertheless, the reduction ratio is still promising
with the minimum reduction ratio of 37%in the prediction module.
6.2 RQ2 & RQ3: Test Effectiveness of Test
Reduction and Prioritization
In Table 2, we present the effectiveness of the reduced recording in
detecting faults on the left-hand side. For the traffic light detection
system, besides Shalun, in other two test suites, the fault coverage is
100% . For Shalun, the fault coverage is 92.3%which is also promising.
For the 6missing faults, we manually inspected the traffic light
module output and noticed for vertical traffic light in Shalun (in
other two suites, the traffic lights are mostly horizontal), the module
output sometimes gave wrong bounding box for traffic lights in
a very short duration but the glitch is within our threshold for
smoothing ( 10%). This might contribute to the 6missing faults as
such short-duration glitch is embedded in those driving frames
discarded. The 10%smoothing threshold is empirically retrieved as
the best value for Apollo through our pilot study. Overall, the fault
coverage achieves on average 98.8%, which proves the reduction
technique is effective across four modules in different test suites.
We also present on the right-hand side of Table 2 the comparison
results of our proposed SCandRSC against the baselines using Top
K and APFD metrics. For each module in a specific test suite, the
presented results are the averaged values on nine benchmarks. We
observed that RSC outperforms other baselines for all test suites for
prediction module both in Top K and APFD. Similarly, for planning
module, RSC also outperforms others both in Top K and APFD
except in the Shalun test suite for Top K ( 1.44VS1.0both in CCand
SC). We speculated that even a specific driving segment contain-
ing the rarest semantic information are ranked as the top in RSC,
this driving segment does not contain faults. However, empirically
the correlation between semantic rareness and faults is very posi-
tive as shown in the table as a general trend. For obstacle module,
RSC has lower value in APFD than the baselines ( 0.47VS0.51in
CH) in Gomentum. Similarly, in traffic light detection system, RSC
outperforms all other baselines in Top K, but for APFD has lower
value both in Gomentum ( 0.76VS0.82inSC) and Shalun ( 0.54
VS0.56inSC). We believe because the semantic information in
both traffic light and obstacle detection modules are largely static.
Thus capturing rarest information in such modules has fluctuating
performance either scoring the best in Top K (capturing the first
error fastest) or APFD (capturing all the errors fastest). In summary,
on average, that our method RSC achieves the best performance
across all modules in different test suite with 1.58for Top K and
0.61for APFD.
7 RELATED WORK
7.1 Test Reduction and Prioritization
Test reduction and prioritization are two approaches to reduce
the cost of regression testing. Test reduction, also called test mini-
mization [ 48], seeks to reduce the size of a test suite by removingredundant test cases. Test prioritization [ 49] aims to maximize some
desired properties such as the rate of fault detection by sorting test
cases. The comprehensive overview of regression testing techniques
can be checked in the survey [59].
The typical test reduction techniques contain heuristic meth-
ods [ 13–15,30] and genetic algorithm-based approaches [ 40,42].
Different heuristics and search algorithms were applied to select a
minimal set of test cases that achieve the same test requirements
(e.g., branch coverage and code coverage) as the original test suite.
For test prioritization, many coverage-based prioritization meth-
ods [ 21,22,50] were proposed to maximize structural coverage
or code coverage early. The idea behind these methods is that the
early maximization of structure coverage will improve the chance
to detect faults early [ 59]. These existing test reduction and prior-
itization methods target on traditional programs. However, they
cannot be directly applied on ADSs with time series inputs. Inspired
by traditional coverage metrics, in this paper we propose rarity and
semantic coverage-based test prioritization method.
There are a few works related to test reduction and prioritiza-
tion on ADSs. In [ 39], Lu et al. conducted experiments to evaluate
the performances of five search algorithms for prioritizing driv-
ing scenarios and defined objective functions (e.g., the probability
of collision) for optimization. However, it does not account for
the coverage of different modules in an ADS, which limits its pri-
oritization capability. In our work, the test reduction process is
automated based on frame vectorization calculated by the data
in driving recordings. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on
four ADS modules. In [ 10], Birchler et al. proposed a prioritization
method to sort driving scenarios of lane-keeping systems. In their
work, testing suites are maps with different shapes, turns, and other
properties. They extracted features of maps and sorted them using
genetic algorithms. In our work, testing suites are different driv-
ing recordings and the testing modules are perception, prediction,
and planning modules. We split driving recordings to recording
segments for further test reduction and prioritization.
7.2 Autonomous Driving Testing
The research of testing on ADSs mainly focused on the generation
of rare or error-prone driving scenarios. In [ 54], Tian et al. proposed
to apply different affine transformations to generate new testing im-
ages to evaluate the steering angle prediction of CNN-based driving
models. In [ 60], Zhang et al. proposed to use Generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to generate high-quality testing images such as
driving scenes on rainy and snowy days. In [ 17], Deng et al. pro-
posed to generate driving scenarios based on traffic rules to test
driving models for speed prediction. In [ 62], Zhou et al. proposed
to use adversarial attack methods [ 18,19] to generate adversarial
billboards in driving scenarios. In [ 23], Gambi et al. generated crash
driving scenarios based on police reports.
Several search-based methods were proposed to find and gener-
ate driving scenarios leading to crash or deviation of ego-vehicles [ 1,
2,9,12,20,24,25,37]. While most work targeted on E2E driving
models or Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), some re-
cent works started investigating on industry-level ADSs. In [ 26],
Garcia et al. systematically analyzed bugs in Apollo and Autoware
based on their Github repository commits. In [ 37], Li et al. proposedESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore Yao Deng, Xi Zheng, Mengshi Zhang, Guannan Lou, and Tianyi Zhang

ing environment using genetic algorithms [ 36]. In [ 20], Ebadi et
al. searched testing scenarios for obstacle detection of Apollo. Our
work focus on test reduction and prioritization based on driving
recordings.
7.3 Driving Scenario Identification
Driving scenario identification is the task of identifying driving
scenarios and converting driving scenarios to vectors. After this,
a few downstream works such as scenario clustering and anom-
aly detection can be implemented. Currently, only a few works
in the software engineering community researched in this direc-
tion. In [ 52], Andrea et al. proposed a method to detect potential
misbehaviors of an ADS. The main idea is to train a reconstructor
to reconstruct the current driving scenario (single image or a se-
quence of images). If the reconstruction error exceeds a threshold,
the driving scenario is most likely an anomalous scenario, and the
autonomous vehicle may misbehave in the scenario. In this work,
we identify driving scenarios based on the module outputs in the
driving recording and convert each frame to a feature vector. We
then use feature vectors for testing reduction and prioritization.
Beyond SE community, some existing work targeted driving sce-
nario vectorization. In [29], Harder et al. proposed scenario2vector
to characterize a driving image from three aspects actors, actions ,
andscene . Then based on the text description of the driving image,
key elements belonging to the above three categories are extracted
and converted to vectors or matrices. In our work, we also describe
key elements of driving scenarios from these three aspects. How-
ever, we use them to define a driving scene schema to describe
corresponding semantic information occurred in a driving scene.
On the other hand, we do not use them together to characterize
a driving scenario. For different testing modules, We extract data
from its publish channel messages to encode semantic information
described in the schema.In [61], Zhao et al. proposed using Convolutional Neural Net-
work (CNN) and Gated recurrent unit (GRU) network [ 16] to learn
feature representations for driving videos. In [ 7], Balasubramanian
et al. proposed to use self-supervised learning [ 32] to learn better
feature representations for driving recordings. In our work, we treat
a driving recording as a combination of multiple driving scenarios.
We create and calculate frame-level features for driving recording
segmentation.
8 THREATS TO VALIDITY
We discuss threats to validity from three aspects external validity,
construct validity, and internal validity proposed in [57].
External Validity: The external validity is generalizability of
the proposed method. In this work, we conduct experiments on
an industry-level ADS Apollo to evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed test reduction and prioritization methods. These methods
are also available for other multi-module ADSs that apply publish-
subscribe communication mechanism among modules and save
module outputs in driving recordings (e.g., Autoware [ 34] that
adopts ROS [3]).
Internal Validity: The internal validity is that in ADS modules
there are many non-deterministic algorithms, which makes module
outputs have slight differences when the module runs on the same
input multiple times [ 35]. This problem may introduce uncertain
faults when we compare the outputs of the old and new versions
of SUTs. To solve the problem, We use a sliding window-based
smoothing algorithm to remove noises. Furthermore, we set the
threshold to evaluate inconsistent outputs as 10% to ensure the
detected inconsistent output is caused by the new version of SUT.
In this work, we inject mutants into Apollo source code to create
regression benchmarks. The effectiveness of mutation testing are
suitable for software testing experimentation [ 5,33]. In this way,
we explore common faults in different ADS modules and ensure
every time we only change one file in an ADS module. We doScenario-Based Test Reduction and Prioritization for Multi-Module Autonomous Driving Systems ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore
not use commits in Apollo Github commit history as regression
benchmarks because most commits are relevant to the update of
multiple modules.
Construct Validity: The construct validity is that we conducted
experiments on Apollo 5.0, not Apollo 6.0 that is used in other pa-
pers [ 37]. The reason is that now for Apollo 6.0, the camera-based
perception module does not work and LiDAR-based perception
is unstable in SVL6. In this work, we evaluated our methods on
three maps. We tested two other maps (i.e., ‘Borregas Avenue’ and
‘San Francisco’) but we found that Apollo is not able to control the
ego-vehicle stably. This issue has been reported by Apollo users78.
Therefore, we excluded these two maps from the experiment. We
will keep tracking these issues and try to include more maps for
experiments in the future work. For mutant rejection, we did not
directly mutate DL models in Apollo because the models are en-
capsulated in binary files. Alternatively, we mutated C++ files that
are related to DL model configuration and model input/output to
simulate bugs in DL models. For example, by mutating the output
of the obstacle detection model, we can simulate incorrect model
predictions.
9 CONCLUSION
This paper proposes STRaP to reduce the cost of regression testing
in industry-scale multi-module ADSs. Since such ADSs are largely
built upon publish-subscribe mechanism, we define a driving scene
schema and for different modules under test, we extract frame
data from its publish channels and encode semantic information
described in the schema as frame feature vectors. Based on such
feature vectorization, we propose a test reduction algorithm to
split original driving recordings to recording segments, each of
which reflects a unique driving scenario. We also propose semantic
coverage based and rarity based test prioritization to order the
reduced recording segments as test inputs for ADS modules. In our
work, testing suites are different driving recordings and the test
modules are perception, prediction, and planning modules in ADSs.
In our evaluation using an industry-level multi-module ADS and
three road maps in diverse regression testing settings, we prove
STRaP is able to significantly reduce the length of original driving
recordings ( 34%to77%), has promising fault coverage of 98.8%, and
achieves 1.58for Top K and 0.61for APFD beating the state-of-the-
art baselines. This work is a pioneering work to utilize frame-level
features for driving recording segmentation. With manually defined
driving scene feature schema, we have achieved promising results
in both test reduction and prioritization. As future directions for SE
community, based on this open-sourced work, automated feature
extraction from driving recording can be explored along with more
intelligent smoothing algorithms.
