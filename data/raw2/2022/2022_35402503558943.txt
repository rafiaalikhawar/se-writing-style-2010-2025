case, thenumberoftestsamples is inadequate toproperly evaluate

1 INTRODUCTION
Machine learning (ML) software has grown in popularity in recent
years due to the availability of massive amounts of training data
andapplicationsize.WhentraininganMLsoftware,ingeneral,the
conventionalapproachistodividethedataintotrainingandtesting

for test, usually 25% or less. A problem arises when insufficient

For example, when an event is performed ‘N’ (N <10) times a day

quality attribute of ML software. Testing the robustness of ML
software under limited data conditions is underexplored in the
literature. The question remains whether these limited data are
sufficient to render a robust ML model using the conventional
training-test split strategy.
Aninstancewhere there areinsufficient dataavailable isinthe
refined steel industry, specifically vacuum pumping in the Elec-
troslag Remelting (ESR) process [ 2,15,24]. The process includes
furnace cleaning [ 18], which requires vacuum pumping or extract-

are only a few hundred occurrences to divide between training
and test data. It becomes difficult to obtain the appropriate test
data to determine whether the ML model for pressure prediction is
overfitting [ 21].
Theoretically,to avoidoverfitting, oneof thefollowingsteps is
taken [4,8,22]: (i) removing features such as random forest, (ii)
increasingtheamountofdataavailablefortraining,(iii)performing
cross-validation, or with (iv) regularisation, which includes cali-

tion technique and the testing approach discussed in this paper are
based on the general principles of vacuum engineering. Vacuum
pumping isusedacrossmultiple domains,includingfusionpower
plants [9] and EUV lithography for global silicon manufacturing
[30]. This paper focused on ESR due to the availability of pumping
datafromtheUddeholmsAB steelcompany.However,inprinciple,
this augmentation and testing techniquecan be applied inmultiple
disciplines where vacuum pumping is part of the manufacturing
process.
Thisstudyoffersafreshperspectiveondataaugmentationfor
vacuum pumping from the software testing point of view. The ap-
proach presented in this paper first decomposes the data using
domain knowledge and then generates random and fresh samples
utilizingtheconceptsofvacuumpumping.Althoughthisbodyof
work focuses on vacuum pumping for the steel industry, which
is comprised of well-modeled concepts, the decomposition and

utilized to generate augmented data. The newly generated aug-
mented data are then used to assess ML models’ robustness on
an industrial scale. Here, careful test scenarios were designed to
determine the end-to-end functionality of the ML systems. Each
scenarioiscombinedwithatestoracletodeterminethepassand

from a combination of theory and domain-knowledge background
in industrial production. Therefore, ML models are subjected to
robustnesstesting,animportantnon-functionaltestingproperty
of ML software [ 31]. Here, robustness testing is used to ensure
thattheyworkasexpectedwithGTdata,remainwithinphysical
constraints, and, in theory, are resilient to future unknown data.
To assess the robustness in the presence of limited data, this paper
makesthe following contributions:
•A data augmentation approach for ESR vacuum pumping is
developedthatusesdomainknowledgetogeneratesynthetic

•A strategy is developed to evaluate the robustness of an ML
model based on real and augmented data to compensate for
insufficientGT test data.
•ThepaperusedrealdatafromsteelproductionandMLmod-

•An MLOpsimplementationofthe proposedapproach.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2
gives an overview of ML training with small samples and vacuum
pumping theory to describe the principles underlying the data
decomposition and pumping speed dictionary mentioned in the
proposed work. The subsequent section 3describes (i) an efficient
data augmentation approach for vacuum pumping and (ii) tests to
evaluate the robustness of a trained ML model. Section 4shows

to detect feature interactions step by step without additional ef-

measuringtheperformanceofallsoftwaresystemconfigurations
and then providing direct answers (e.g., which configuration is the
fastest).In addition,small sample MLrequires arobustvalidation

Theoretically, vacuum pumps in the ESR process reduce the
number of gas molecules ina vacuumsystem by creating a volume
flow determined by the rate at which the pressure in a vacuum
systemofconstantvolumedecreasesovertime[ 13].Whenpumping
occurs,theoverallpressureinsideachamberisdirectlyproportional
to the amount of gas extracted by the pump, and therefore there is
less leakage and flow through the inner surfaces of the chamber.
Theamountofgaspumpedoutandtheamountofgasthatleaksin
are constantly changing over time. Dmitrieva et al. [ 6] describe the
total pressure inside a vacuum system at a time ‘T’ as ‘ 𝑃𝑇’ with an
initialpressureof‘ 𝑃0’,thevolumeofthevacuumpumpchamber
‘𝑉𝑐’theaveragepumpingspeed‘ 𝑆’,theleakageflow‘ 𝑄𝑙’andthe
flowfrom the innersurfaces‘ 𝑄𝑖’,whichis:
𝑃𝑇=𝑄𝑙+𝑄𝑖
𝑆+(𝑃0−𝑄𝑙+𝑄𝑖
𝑆)𝑒−𝑇𝑆
𝑉𝑐 (1)
In the above equation 1,𝑄𝑙depends on the total conductance
that determines the aggregate bandwidth of all leaks. And, 𝑄𝑖is
proportionaltothesurfaceareaofthevacuumchamber,adegassing
coefficient, and a constant that depends on the material and rough-
nessofthevacuumchamber.However,inpractice,avacuumpump

pump out oxygen from the vacuum chamber. After pumping for
twentyminutes,expertsinspectthechambertoensurethatitmeets
qualitystandardsbeforemovingontothenextphase,suchascheck-
ing internal pressure. If the quality requirements are not achieved,
the chamber is inspected and re-pumped for an additional twenty
minutes. The role of ML in this situation is to observe the first
few seconds or a minute of pumping and to forecast the minimum
pressure. In this case, accurate pressure forecasts save valuable
time and increase production efficiency with an early decision and
action. However, with the limited occurrence of the event, a few

3 THE PROPOSEDAPPROACH
This paper presents two concepts for the ESR vacuum pumping
applicationwithlimitedtrainingdata:(i)datadecompositionand
augmentationtogeneratenewvacuumpumpingdata,and(ii)tests
forevaluatingtherobustnessofatrainedmodelusingthegenerated
augmenteddata andnewtest scenarios.
3.1 Augmented SampleGeneration
A three-step strategy is designed togenerate augmented dataand
address the scarcity of training data for vacuum pumping. The
first step is to decompose the GT and interpret the initial pressure
andpump-downtime.Second,adictionaryofpumpingspeedsis
constructedthatisindependentoftheinitialpressure.Thefinalstep
generates sparse representations for the dictionary and produces a
fresh set of augmented samples. The following subsections address
thesesteps.
3.1.1 DecomposingtheGTData. Eachpumpingeventisaseparate
anddistinctoccurrence.Foragivenvacuumchamber(i.e.,acon-
stant volume), equation 2mandates that one must understand ‘ 𝑆𝑇’,
‘𝑇’,andthe‘ 𝑃0’inordertointerpret‘ 𝑃𝑇’.Atminimumpressure,all
three mentioned variables are scalars. However, a vector is formed
for𝑆𝑇when we look at the entire pumping period (t = 0 to T). We
take theapproach to decomposethe ground-truth by interpreting
the𝑃0and𝑇distributionsandextractingthe 𝑆𝑇intoadictionary
or a matrix containing only the unique 𝑆𝑇vectors. As a result,
we use the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers
[25] to approximate the initial pressure and pump-down time as a
Gaussiandistribution.Althoughfuturepumpingoccurrencesare
unknown, this assumption will, in principle, assist a regression/-
pressure prediction model in learning about the different pumping
events in a proactive manner. The mean and standard deviation of
the distributions for 𝑃0and𝑇are computed using the maximum
likelihoodestimationfrom ground-truth data.
3.1.2 ExtractingaDictionaryofPumpingSpeeds. Afterobtaining
the𝑃0and𝑇distributions,thenextstepistoobtainthepumping

speeds𝑆per unit volume at regular intervals. Because the amount
of gas coming in and going out changes over time, we extracted
all𝑆from Equation 2. The collected 𝑆was then reduced to the
independent pumping speeds to a dictionary 𝐷𝑆∈R𝑋×𝑌(𝐷𝑆⊂
𝑆) assuming a simplex and linear mixing. Mathematically, for an
acceptable residual error 𝜖andarepresentation 𝜓,itisgiven as:

3.1.3 GeneratingAugmentedSamples. Oncetheparameters 𝑃0and
𝑇fromsection 3.1.1,andadictionary 𝐷𝑆mentionedinsection 3.1.2
for the vacuum chamber and pump setup are determined, the next
step is to generate as many augmented samples M ( 𝑀≫𝑁) as are
required. For each of the 𝑀samples, a sparse vector 𝜓(𝜓∈R𝑌×1)
isgeneratedatrandom,resultinginauniquepumpspeedthatis
a fractional combination of historical events. The mathematical

ML Model
Once an ML model is trained using augmented data, it must be
testedtoensurethatitisrobust.Weproposethreetestscenarios
to evaluate the robustness of the model. Each of the three test
scenarios addresses aunique concern,whichare as follows:
•Feasibility test scenario: is to see if the trained model
remainswithin the physical limits of vacuum pumping.
•GTtesting: examinesthetrained model’saccuracy and its
performance when appliedto knowndata.
•Volume enclosed testing: under a given residual error
examines how well the trained model should operate under
theconstraints ofvacuumpumping (e.g.,incaseofa driftin
the data orchanges inthe pumping conditions).
Dependingontheapplication’ssensitivity,theresultsfromthe
scenariosarecollectedintoatestoraclethatdeterminesifanapplied
robustnesstest ofthe machine learningmodelispassedorfailed.
3.2.1 FeasibilityTestScenario. Thefeasibilitytestscenarioensures
that a trained model stays within the physical limits of vacuum
pumping. This scenario warrants that no direction from initial
pressure and pump-down time is impractical, i.e., the predicted 𝑃𝑇
isalwayspositivewhen 𝑃0and𝑇arepositive.Mathematically,itis:
∀𝑃0>0and𝑇>0,𝑃𝑇>0 (5)
3.2.2 Testing the GT. After the feasibility test, we have a scenario
that uses the ground-truth and a scenario that uses augmented
data. The second test scenario evaluates the residual error of the
data from the ground-truth test data. The mean absolute error
(MAE, equation 6), also known as the Manhattan distance or the ℓ1
norm of the residual error divided by the number of observations,
and the goodness-of-fit measure: R-squared ( 𝑅2, Equation 7) value.
An additional ℓ∞with the real and augmented data shows the
maximum expectedprediction errorfor the given data.

•Oracle 1 : The first sub-oracle (or oracle 1) is to identify
whether a vacuum pump pressure prediction ML model pre-

•Oracle 2 : The second sub-oracle gets its input from sce-

the predicted values/scores against acceptable thresholds

determining how pure each block of steel should remain.
In principle,ahigherminimumpressure means thatmore

•Oracle 3: The third sub-oracle inputs two volume measure-

•Main Oracle : The main oracle takes input from all three
sub-oracles and determines the robustness of the ML model.
Arobustmodelmuststaywithinthephysicalboundary(i.e.,

the GT data (i.e., passed oracle 3). However, suppose that an
MLmodelundertestpassesoracles1and2only.Inthatcase,
itsuggeststhattheMLmodelfairswellwiththeGTdata,but
any deviation or drift may produce unreliable predictions or
be less robust. For this reason, the main oracle considers an
ML model under test a robust model when it has passed all
threesub-oracles.Finally,amongseveralMLmodelsunder
testthat passed themain oracle;themost robust ML model
is the one with the largest volume, demonstrating resilience
towards changes in the GT while delivering the required
accuracyinthe currentdata.

Ourproposeddataaugmentationmethodandtheclassical/tra-
ditional approaches under test are both trained on like-for-like
conditions with MATLAB’s Bayesian hyperparameter optimizer
in this paper. Using the conventional 80%-20% training-test split
approach (referred to as ‘classic’ in tables and figures) and 100,000
augmentedsamples(referredtoas‘aug’intablesandfigures),all
three approaches were trained using furnace M data. Classic meth-
ods use 80% of GT data for training, while aug approaches train
withtheaugmentedsamples.Aftertraining,themodelsweretested

6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we show that the traditional 80-20 split between
training and testing insoftware testing is inadequate for machine
learning with small samples. Furthermore, this paper improves on
the state-of-the-art software testing practices in robustness testing
and presents a data augmentation technique that comprises newlydevelopedtestscenariosandoraclestodetermineatrainedmodel’s
robustnessintheabsenceofsufficienttrainingandtestdata.The
earlyexperiments suggestthataddingaugmenteddatagenerated
by the proposed approach to ML models’ training improves the
testdatapredictionaccuracyand,moreimportantly,reducesthe
bias and variance difference between different vacuum pumping
production dataforESRapplications. Additionally,we identified
that the six ML models under test do not capture events where
the minimum pressure deviates substantially from the training
distributionmean,whichwillbeinvestigatedinfutureworkand
require the development of a bespoke model for vacuum pumping
application. The augmentation and testing approach is designed to
aidfuture modeldevelopmentandhowtodesignarobusttesting
methodology when workingwithsmall sample ML.
In the future, further model investigation will need to be car-
ried out, including research into deep learning and the integra-
tionanduseofseveraltrainedmodelssimultaneously.Thispaper
