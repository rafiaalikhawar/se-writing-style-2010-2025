ABSTRACT
Bug reports are vital for software maintenance that allow users
to inform developers of the problems encountered while usingsoftware. However, it is difficult for non-technical users to write
cleardescriptionsaboutthebugoccurrence.Therefore,moreand

easy to be created and contains detailed procedures triggering the
bug. But it is still tedious and time-consuming for developers to
reproduce thebug due to thelength and unclearactions within therecording.Toovercometheseissues,wepropose

1 INTRODUCTION
Software maintenance activities are known to be generally expen-
sive and challenging [ 60] and one of the most important mainte-
nance tasks is to handle bug reports [ 17]. A good bug report is

straightforward for developers to reproduce and fix.
Bugs are often encountered by non-technical users who will
document a description of the bug with steps to reproduce it. How-
ever, clear and concise bug reporting takes time, especially for
non-developer or non-tester users who do not have that expertise
and are not willing to spend that much effort [ 18,25]. A poorly
writtenreportwouldbeevenpoorlyinterpreted[ 24,26,36],which
oftendevolvesintothefamiliarrepetitivebackandforthandthe
need to nag that comes with every single bug. That effort may
further prohibit users’ contribution to bug reporting.

Toautomatetheanalysisofbugrecordings,weintroduce GIFdroid ,
a light-weight image-processingapproach to automatically replay
thevideo(GIF)basedbugreportsforAndroidapps.First,weextract
keyframes(i.e.,fully renderedGUIs)ofarecordingby comparing
the similarity of consecutive frames. Second, a sequence of located
keyframes is then mapped to the GUI states in the existing UTG
(UI Transition Graph) of the app by calculating image similarity
based on pixel and structural features. Third, given the mapped
sequence, we propose a novel algorithm to not only address the de-
fective mapped sequence, but also auto-complete the missing trace
betweenapplaunchtotheentryframeofthevideo,resultinginan

2.2 What are in Visual Recordings?
To understand the content within these visual recordings, the first
two authors manually check 1,000 (11.5%) GIFs and their corre-
sponding descriptions in the issue report. Following the Card Sort-
ing [67] method, we classify those GIFs into three categories:
(i)BugReplay(60%).Mostscreenrecordingsareaboutthebugre-
playincludingdetailedproceduresintriggeringthebugs,especially
forthoserequiringcomplicatedactionswithoneexampleseenin
Figure 23. The visual recordings bridge the lexical gap between
users and developers and help developers read and comprehendthe bug report reasoning about the problem from the high-level
description.
(ii) Issue Fixed (17%). Once the issue is fixed, developers tend
to record the screen to display the update changes, along witha checklist for project owners to approve the pull request, Also,
those recordings are used for app introduction or answering users’
feature requests.
(iii) Feature Request (23%). Users may use recordings to ask
formissing functionality(e.g.,providedby otherapps)or missing
content(e.g.,incataloguesandgames),andsharingideasonhowto
improve the app in future releases by adding or changing features.
2.3 What are Characteristics of Bug
Recordings?

further analyze the characteristics of 600 bug recordings classified
in Section 2.2. Due to the difference of devices or users’ resize ofthevideo,theremaybedifferentresolutionsandaspectratiosassummarized in Table 1. About half of bug recordings are of 16:9

arbitrarily, according to our observation.

On average, there are 148.29 frames per video and some of them
areevenwithmorethan500frameswhichrequiredevelopersto
manually check and replay in their own settings. We also find that
only 41 recordings (6.8%) start from the launch of the app, while
mostrecordings startfrom 2-7steps beforethebug occurrence.It
indicates that there is no explicit hint to guide developers to the
entry frame of the recording and that barrier may negatively influ-
ence developers’ efficiency. As the important information to show
users’actions,somerecordingscontaintouchindicators(e.g.,circle
or arrow of the touch position) which is animportant resource to

Summary : By analyzing issue reports from 1,274 existing apps
crawled from F-Droid, 60% of them are with recordings for bug
replay. A large number of frames and varied resolution make

3 APPROACH
Given an input bug recording, we propose an automated approach
to localize a sequence of keyframes in the GIF and subsequentlymap them to the existing UTG (UI Transition Graph) to extractthe execution trace. The overview of our approach is shown in
Figure 4, which is divided into three main phases: (i) the Keyframe
Location phase, which identifies a sequence of keyframes of an
input visual recording, (ii) the GUI Mapping phase that maps each
located keyframe to the GUIs in UTG, yielding an index sequence,
and(iii)the ExecutionTraceGeneration phasethatutilizestheindex
sequence to detect an optimal replayable execution trace.
3.1 Keyframe Location
Note that GUI rendering takes time, hence many frames in the
visual recording are showing the partial rendering process. The
goal of this phase is to locate keyframes i.e., states in which GUI
are fully rendered in a given visual recording.
3.1.1 Consecutive Frame Comparison. Inspiredbysignalprocess-
ing, we leverage the image processing techniques to build a per-ceptual similarity score for consecutive frame comparison basedon Y-Difference (or Y-Diff). YUV is a color space usually used in
video encoding, enabling transmission errors or compression arti-
factsto bemoreefficientlymasked bythehuman perceptionthan
using a RGB-representation [ 28,68]. Y-Diff is the difference in Y

vision) is sensitive to brightness changes. In the human visual sys-
tem, a majority of visual information is conveyed by patterns of

contrastsfromitsbrightnesschanges[ 79].Furthermore,luminance
is a major input for the human perception of motion [ 50]. Since
peopleperceiveasequenceofgraphicschangesasamotion,con-
secutive images are perceptually similar if people do not recognize
any motions from the image frames.
Consider a visual recording/braceleftbig
𝑓0,𝑓1,..,𝑓𝑁−1,𝑓𝑁/bracerightbig, where𝑓𝑁is
the current frame and 𝑓𝑁−1is the previous frame. To calculate the
Y-Diff of the current frame 𝑓𝑁with the previous 𝑓𝑁−1, we first
obtain the luminance mask 𝑌𝑁−1,𝑌𝑁by splitting the YUV color
spaceconvertedbytheRGBcolorspace.Then,weapplythepercep-
tual comparison metric, SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) [ 73], to
produceaper-pixelsimilarityvaluerelatedtothelocaldifferencein
the average value, the variance, and the correlation of luminances.
Indetail,theSSIMsimilarityfortwoluminancemasksisdefined
as:
𝑆𝑆𝐼𝑀(𝑥,𝑦)=(2𝜇𝑥𝜇𝑦+𝐶1)+(2𝜎𝑥𝑦+𝐶2)
(𝜇2𝑥+𝜇2𝑦+𝐶1)(𝜎2𝑥+𝜎2𝑦+𝐶2)(1)
where𝑥,𝑦denote the luminance masks 𝑌𝑁−1,𝑌𝑁, and𝜇𝑥,𝜎𝑥,
𝜎𝑥𝑦arethemean,standarddeviation,andcrosscorrelationbetween
the images, respectively. 𝐶1and𝐶2are used to avoid instability
when the means and variances are close to zero. A SSIM score is
a number between 0 and 1, and a higher value indicates a strong
level of similarity.
3.1.2 Keyframe Identification. Tomakedecisionsonwhetherthe
frame is a keyframe, we look into the similarity scores of consecu-
tiveframesinthevisualrecordingasshowninFigure5.Thefirst
step is to group frames belonging to the same atomic activity ac-
cording to a tailored pattern analysis. This procedure is necessary
because discrete activities performed on the screen will persist

tions,animation transitions, and steady.
(1) instantaneous transitions : As shown in Figure 5 Activity 1
(clicking a button), the similarity score starts to drop drastically
whichrevealsaninstantaneoustransitionfromonescreentoan-
other. In addition, one common case is that the similarity scorebecomes steady for a small period of time

cally droppings as shown in Figure 5 Activity 3. The occurrenceof this short steady duration
𝑡𝑠is because GUI has not finished
loading.WhiletheGUIlayoutofGUIrenderingisfast,resources
loading may take time. For example, rendering images from the
web depends on device bandwidth, image loading efficiency, etc.

Wehaveempiricallyset0.954asthethresholdtodecidewhether
two frames are similar, and 5 frames as the threshold to indicate a

3.2 GUI Mapping
It is easy for developers to get the UTG of their own app [ 31,
77]. Therefore, instead of inferring actions from the recording [ 23,
80], we directly map keyframes extracted from the recording to
states/GUIswithintheUTG.Toachievethis,wecomputetheimagesimilaritybetweenthekeyframeandeachGUIscreenshotbasedon
both pixel and structural features. The GUI screenshot that has the
highest similarity score is regarded as the index of the keyframe.
3.2.1 UTG Construction. A GUI transitions graph (UTG) of an An-
droidappiswidelyusedtoillustratethetransitionsacrossdifferent
GUIs triggered by typical elements such as toasts (pop-ups), text
boxes,textviewobjects,spinners,listitems,progressbars,check-
boxes. In Figure 6 we illustrate how a UTG emerges as a resultof user interactions in an app. Starting with the GUI-1, the user
“scrolls down” to the bottom of the page (GUI-2). When the user
“taps”abutton,theGUItransitstotheGUI-3.Therearemanytools

also be used.
3.2.2 Feature Extraction. Thebasicneedforanyimagesearching
techniquesistodetectandconstructadiscriminativefeaturerepre-
sentation[ 34,35].Aproperconstructionoffeaturescanimprove
the performance of the image searching method [ 47]. According to
our observation, in addition to the pixel features as that in natural
images,GUIscreenshotsarealsoofadditionalstructuralfeatures
i.e., thelayout ofdifferent components inone page.Therefore, we
adoptahybridmethodbasedontwotypesoffeatures,SSIM(Struc-
turalSimilarityIndex)[ 73]andORB(OrientedFASTandRotated
BRIEF)[63],forsearchingthemappingGUIscreenshotsintheUTG
for the keyframe.
WhileSSIMdetectsthefeatureswithinpixelsandstructures(i.e.,
adetaileddescriptionisdemonstratedinSection3.1.1),itstillhas
several fundamental limitations that exist in visual recordings, e.g.,
imagedistortion[ 46,71].Toaddressthis,wefurthersupplement
a local invariant feature extraction method, ORB. Given an image,
4We set up that value by a small-scale pilot study.
Figure 7: Illustration of the execution trace generation. In-dex sequence 2,3 indicate two types of defective sequences,i.e., missing {𝐷}and wrong mapping to {𝐵}, respectively.
ORB first detects the interest points, indicating at which the direc-
tion of the boundary of the object changes abruptly or intersection
point between two or more edge segments. Then, ORB converts
eachinterestpointintoann-bitsbinaryfeaturedescriptor,which
acts as a “fingerprint” that can be used to differentiate one feature
from another. A feature descriptor of an interest point is computed
by an intensity difference test 𝜏:
𝜏(𝑝;𝑥,𝑦)=/braceleftBigg
1 if p(x) <p(y)
0 otherwise(2)
where𝑝(𝑥),𝑝(𝑦)areintensityvaluesatpixel 𝑥,𝑦aroundtheinterest
point. Due to the characteristic of local feature extraction, ORB
features remain invariant of scale, brightness, and also maintain a
certain stability of affine transformation, and noise.
3.2.3 Similarity Computation. Based on the features extracted by
SSIM and ORB, we compute a similarity value 𝑆𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑚and𝑆𝑜𝑟𝑏,
respectively. To compute 𝑆𝑜𝑟𝑏, we adopt the Brute Force algo-
rithm [63], which compares the hamming distance between fea-
ture descriptors. We compute the 𝑆𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑚using Equation 1 based on
similarityonluminance,contrast,andstructure.Wethenfurther
determine the similarity 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑏between the keyframe and states in
UTG by combining two feature similarities score:
𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑏=𝑤×𝑆𝑜𝑟𝑏+(1−𝑤)×𝑆𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑚 (3)
where𝑤isaweightfor 𝑆𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑚and𝑆𝑜𝑟𝑏,takingavaluebetween0
to 1. Smaller 𝑤value weights 𝑆𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑚more heavily, and larger value
weights𝑆𝑜𝑟𝑏moreheavily.Weempiricallychoose0.5asthe 𝑤value
for the best performance.
Based on the combined similarity between the keyframe and
each GUI screenshot, we select the highest score to be the index of
the keyframe. Consequently, a sequence of keyframes is converted
to a sequence of the index in the UTG.
3.3 Execution Trace Generation
After mapping keyframes to the GUIs in the UTG, we need to
go one step further to connect these GUIs/states into a trace toreplay the bug. Howev er, this process is challenging due to two
reasons. First, the extracted keyframe (Section 3.1) and mapped
GUIs(Section3.2)maynotbe100%accurate,resultinginamismatch
of the groundtruth trace. For example in Figure 7, {𝐷}is missed in
theindexsequence2andthesecondkeyframeiswronglymapping

to{𝐵}intheindexsequence3.Second,differentfromtheuploaded
GIF which may start the recording anytime, the recovered trace in
our case must begin from the launch of the app.
Therefore,thetracegenerationalgorithmneedstoconsiderboth
the wrong extraction/mapping in our previous steps, and the miss-
ingtracebetweentheapplaunchandfirstkeyframeinthevisual
bug report. To overcome these issues, our approach first generates
all candidate sequences in UTG between the app launch to the
last keyframe from GIF. By regarding the extracted keyframes as a
sequence,ourapproachthenfurtherextractstheLongestCommon

4 AUTOMATED EVALUATION OF GIFDROID
In this section, we describe the procedure we used to evaluate
GIFdroid in terms of its performance automatically. We manually
construct a dataset as the groundtruth for evaluating each step
within our approach, instead of using the real-world bug record-
ingsduetotworeasons.First,manyreal-worldbugreportshave

been fixed and the app is also patched, but it is hard to find the
correspondingpreviousversionoftheappforreproduction.Second,
the replay of some bug reports (e.g., financial, social apps) requires
much information like authentication/database/hardware to gener-
atetheUTGwhicharebeyondthescopeofthisstudy.Therefore,
we collect 61 visual recordings from 31 open-source Android apps
which were used in previous studies [ 23,26,55]. They are also
top-rated on Google Play covering 14 app categories (e.g., devel-
opment, productivity, etc.). To make these recordings as similar
toreal-worldbugreportsaspossible,weadoptdifferentwaysfor
generatingtherecordingincludingdifferentcreationtools(32from
video conversion, 22 from mobile apps, 7 from emulator screen
recording), varied resolutions (27 1920 ×1080, 23 1280 ×800, 11
900×600), diverse length (30-305 frames), and differed playing
speed(7-30 framespersecond).
For each app, we also collect its UTG by Google Firebase. Since
our approach consists of three main steps, we evaluate each phase
ofGIFdroid , including Keyframe Location (Section 3.1), GUI Map-
ping (Section 3.2), and Execution Trace Generation (Section 3.3).
Therefore, we ask two experienced developers to manually label
keyframesfromrecordings,GUImappingbetweenrecordingand
UTG, and real trace in the UTG as the groundtruth for each phase.
Note that each human annotator finished the labelling individually
and they discussed the difference until an agreement was reached.
4.1 Accuracy of Keyframe Location
Ground Truth: To evaluate the ability of keyframe location to ac-
curatelyidentifythekeyframespresentinthevisualrecordings,we
manually generated a ground truth for the keyframe. We recruited
two paid annotators from online posting who have experiencein bug replay. To help ensure the validity and consistency of the
groundtruth,wefirstaskedthemtospendtwentyminutesreading
throughthevideoannotationguidelines(i.e.,TRECVID[ 58])and
get familiar with the widely-used annotation tool VirtualDub [ 14].
Then, we assigned the set of visual recordings to them to anno-
tate keyframes independently without any discussion. After the
annotation, the annotators met and sanity corrected the subtle dis-
crepancies(i.e., ±3frames).Anydisagreementwouldbehanded
over toone authorfor the finaldecision. In total,we obtained289
keyframesfor61recordings,4.73perrecordingonaverage,tallying
with our observations for real-world recordings in Section 2.3.
Metrics: We employ three evaluation metrics, i.e., precision,
recall, F1-score, toevaluate the performance ofkeyframe location.
The predicted frame which lies in the ground truth interval is
regarded as correctly predicted. Since there should be only onekeyframe per interval, if two or more keyframes are localized ina single interval, only the first keyframe is counted as correct.

For all metrics, a higher value represents better performance.
Baselines: We set up four state-of-the-art methods which are
widely used for keyframe extraction as the baselines to compare
withourmethod. Comixify [59]isan unsupervisedreinforcement
learningmethodtopredictforeachframeaprobabilitytoextract
keyframesinthevideos. ILS-SUMM [64]formulatesthekeyframe
extraction as an optimization problem, using a meta-heuristic opti-
mization framework to extract a sequence of keyframes that has
minimumfeaturedistance. Hecate[66]isatooldevelopedbyYahoo
thatestimatesframequalityontheimageaestheticsandclusters

practical tool implemented as a Python library that is popular in
GitHub.ThecoretechniqueforPySceneDetecttodetectkeyframes
isacontent-awaredetectionbyanalyzingthecolor,intensity,mo-tion between frames.
Results:
Table 2 shows the performance of all approaches. The
performance of our method is much better than that of other base-
lines, i.e., 32%, 106%, 14% boost in recall, precision, and F1-score
compared with the best baseline (ILS-SUMM, PySceneDetect). The
issueswiththesebaselinesarethattheyaredesignedforgeneral
videoswhichcontainmorenaturalsceneslikehuman,plants,an-
imals etc. Howev er, different from those videos, our visual bug
recordings belong to artificial artifacts with different rendering
processes. Therefore, considering the characteristics of visual bugrecordings, our approach can work well in extracting keyframes.
Ourapproachalsomakesmistakesinkeyframeextractiondue
to three reasons. First, within some apps, the resource loading is
so slow that the partial GUI may stay for a relatively long time, be-
yond our threshold setting in Section 3.1. So, that frame is wrongly
predicted as akeyframe. Second, some usersmay click the button

85.4%, 90.0%, 91.3% for Precision@1, Precision@2, Precision@3
respectively. We observe that the methods based on structural fea-
tures perform much better than pixel features due to the reason
that the pixel similarity suffers from the scale-invariant as the res-
olutions for visual recordings varies. Our method that combines
SSIMandORBleadstoasubstantialimprovement(i.e.,9.7%higher)

In detail, ORB addresses the image distortion that causes false GUI
mapping considering only SSIM.
Albeitthegoodperformanceofourmethod,westillmakewrong

the dynamic content takes over a large area of the whole GUI, our
approach based on visual features cannot accurately locate them.

manually check and label all the ground truths by two annotators
independentlywithoutanydiscussion.Toensurethequality,any
disagreement would be handed over to one author for the finaldecision. Totally, we obtained 61 execution traces, including 539
reproduction steps.
Metrics: To measure the similarity of the groundtruth trace

We summarise two reasons why it takes the control group more
time to finish the reproduction than the experiment group. First,
some visual recording is quite complicated which requires partici-

times for following procedures. The GUI transitions within therecording may also be too fast to follow, so developers have to
replay it. Second, it is hard to determine the trigger from one GUI

for end users. In contrast to these approaches, our GIFdroid is
rather light-weight which just requires the input recording and
UTG which can be generated by existing tools.
7.2 Bug Replay from Textual Information
Tolowertheusagebarrierofrecordandreplaythatrequiresframe-
works, many of the studies [ 22,37,41,55,74] facilitate the bug
replay base on the natural language descriptions in bug report
which contains immediately actionable knowledge (e.g., reliable
reproduction steps),stack traces, test cases,etc. For example,ReC-
Droid [84] leveraged the lexical knowledge in the bug reports and
proposed a natural language processing (NLP) method to auto-
maticallyreproducecrashes.However,ithighlydependedonthe
descriptionwritinginthebugreportincludingformatting,word
usage, granularity [ 24,36,43] which limit its deployment in the
real world. Many works that assist developers in writing bug re-
ports[51,53,55,56]stillcannotdirectlybenefitit.Differentfrom
textual bug reports, visual recordings contain more bug details and
can be easily created by non-technical users. Therefore, our work
focuses on the automated bug replay from these visual bug reports.
7.3 Bug Replay from Visual Information
Insoftwareengineering,therearemanyworksonvisualartifacts
including recording, tutorials, bug reports [ 27,29,32,38,61,78,
82] with some of them specifically for usability and accessibility

(93.2%) in the real world do not start from the app launch, but just

the usefulness and generality of our approach.
8 CONCLUSION
The visual bug recording is trending in bug reports due to its easy
creation and rich information. To help developers automatically
reproduce those bugs, we propose GIFdroid , an image-processing
approach to covert the recording to executable trace to trigger thebug in the Android app. Our automated evaluation shows that our
GIFdroid can successfully reproduce 82% (50/61) visual recordings
from31Androidapps.Theuserstudyonreplaying10real-world
visualbugrecordingsconfirmstheusefulnessofour GIFdroid in
boosting developers’ productivity.
In the future, we will keep improving our method for better per-
formance in term of keyframe extraction, GUI mapping, and trace
