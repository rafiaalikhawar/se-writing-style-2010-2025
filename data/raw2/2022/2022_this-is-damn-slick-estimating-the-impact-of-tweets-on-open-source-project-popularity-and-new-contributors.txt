ABSTRACT
Twitter is widely used by software developers. But how e ective 
are tweets at promoting open source projects? How could one use 
Twitter to increase a project’s popularity or attract new contribu-
tors? In this paper we report on a mixed-methods empirical study 
of 44,544 tweets containing links to 2,370 open-source GitHub 
repositories, looking for evidence of causal e ects of these tweets 
on the projects attracting new GitHub stars and contributors, as 
well as characterizing the high-impact tweets, the people likely 
being attracted by them, and how they di er from  contributors 
attracted otherwise. Among others, we find that tweets have a  sta-
tistically significant and practically sizable e ect on  obtaining new 
stars and a small average e ect on attracting new contributors. The 
popularity, content of the tweet, as well as the identity of tweet 
authors all a ect the scale of the attraction e ect. In  addition, our 
qualitative analysis suggests that forming an active Twitter commu-
nity for an open source project plays an important role in attracting 
new committers via tweets. We also report that developers who 
are new to GitHub or have a long history of Twitter usage but 
few tweets posted are most likely to be attracted as contributors to 
the repositories mentioned by tweets. Our work contributes to the 
literature on open source sustainability.

1 INTRODUCTION
In open-source software (OSS) development, attention can be a 
double edged sword. Sometimes, OSS projects receive too much 
attention, and maintainers have to deal with overwhelming volumes 
of requests and demands from users [25]; in these cases, maintainers 
might rather fend o  new attention coming their way. Other times, 
even successful OSS projects are unable to attract more than a 
few contributors, and occasionally OSS projects are maintained by 
no one at all [3, 17]; in these cases, more sustained involvement 
from users and contributors would be welcome. Yet, for many OSS 
projects, gaining attention from the community, e.g., to increase 
adoption and attract more contributors, remains a challenge.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3510003.3510121Several mechanisms through which OSS projects can gain atten-
tion [11,40,68] and attract new contributors [ 9,40,53] have been
studied in the past. The literature is especially rich in recent years,
inthecontextofsocialcodingplatformslikeGitHub,becauseof
thehigh levelof transparencyand manyopportunities forproject
maintainersto signal,explicitlyandimplicitly,abouttheirwork[ 20].
For example, prior studies of OSS projects hosted on GitHub have
foundthathowprojectsorganizetheirrepositoryhomepagesand
READMEfiles[ 53],whetherprojectsget featuredbythehosting
platform [ 40], whether projects have public releases [ 10], and how
maintainers use prominent repository badges to indicate less ob-
servableprojectqualities[ 68],allhaveanimpactonhowtheproject
isperceivedbyitsaudienceandeventheactionsthatsomeaudience
members take, e.g., joining the project.
However, prior work has, by and large, focused only on endoge-
nousor “in-network” attention eliciting mechanisms, i.e., taking
actions or displaying signals afforded by the code hosting platform
itself.Thisleavesanimportantgap—littleisknownaboutattention
eliciting mechanisms that can be considered exogenous from the
perspectiveofOSSprojectshostedonGitHuborsimilarplatforms.
Here we focus on one such mechanism, social media. Social media
platforms, widely used by software developers [ 65], enable OSS
maintainers to share their work with a potentially larger audience,
thatexists beyond their immediate connections on any code host-
ing platform; e.g., social media posts about an OSS project may be
amplified by the authors’social networks, influential social media
users, or the platform itself. Social media platforms also tend to
havelowbarriertoparticipationandhighviewership,whichmakes
them actionable and potentially impactful for OSS maintainers, ad-
mirers,andevangelistslookingtoattractattentiontoprojectsin
need. A better understanding of the effectiveness of using social
media to attract attentionto OSS projects coulddirectly impact the
projects’ success and sustainability.
Yet, little is known about how much social media activity can
contributetoOSSsustainability,ifatall.Theevidencefromother
contexts suggests that actions taken on social media platforms can
have spillover, out-of-network effects; e.g., researchers have found
that tweets can predict movie ratings [ 48] and increase citations to
academicpapers [39].Cansimilareffects be expected for OSS?
To address this gap, in this paper, we compile a large dataset
of 44,544 tweets containing links to open source GitHub reposito-
ries,1spanning6monthsofhistory,andwithcross-linksbetween
user profiles on both platforms. We then apply statistical causalinference techniques to: (a) estimate the causal effect of tweets
onthenumberofnewGitHubrepositorystarsandnewcommit-
ters; (b) characterize the tweets with the highest impact; and (c)
characterizethe OSScontributorsattracted by these tweets.

from volunteers [ 28,60]. And even though OSS as a whole plays
important infrastructure roles in our digital economy [ 24], OSS
maintainers’ability to attract, onboard, and retain contributors has
generally not kept up with this success. For example, prior work
describes how many popular OSS projects are maintained by only
oneortwodevelopers[ 2,4,19,72],howprojectnewcomersface
a swath of barriers that hinder their first contributions [ 63,64],
and how many of these newcomer barriers are accentuated by
gender[42],whichfurtherreducestheavailablecontributorpool.
Researchers have also found that high turnover in OSS projects
can have negative effects, including knowledge loss [ 56], longer
timetofixissues[ 29],anddecreasedsoftwarequality[ 30].More
generally,researchershavestudiedtheinternalandexternalfactors
that contribute to the OSS projects’ risk of becoming ‘dormant,’
‘inactive,’ ‘unmaintained,’ or ‘abandoned’ [3, 17–19, 36, 70].

effects, including a surge in new contributors. Within their control,
maintainers can also actively promote their projects. Borges and

interesting repositories, and OSS project promotion [ 12,26,62].
However, there are no studies quantitatively evaluating the ef-
fectiveness of OSS project promotion on social media, with the
exception of the Hacker News study [ 11] above. Yet, there is evi-

and YouTube [57, 59].

e.g.,whethersomeoneonefollowshasinteractedwiththatcontent.
In addition, one’s level of engagement with social media, attention
span, and ability to absorb a typically overwhelming volume of
content are all very limited. It follows that in order to even stand a
chance at being effective, tweets mentioning open source projects
should at the very least be noticed. This may depend on many fac-
tors,includingtheircontentandvirality,andtheirauthors’Twitter
network span. For instance, popular tweets on Twitter are liked by
many and may have stronger promotional effects, and tweets with
certain hashtags, of different lengths, and with different types of
content may also have different effects. It is important to under-
stand the characteristics of successful tweets, if this OSS project
promotional mechanism is to be used effectively. We ask:
RQ2.Howdoestheimpactoftweetsmentioningopen-source

Finally,weseektobetterunderstand whoisbeingattractedby
these tweets. Knowing what type of audience and contributors can
be attracted via Twitter is important for developers’ decision to

offersanadditionalmodalityfordeveloperstosocializeandform
connections. In turn, these connections may help explain develop-
ers’ engagement with the open source projects they discovered via
Twitter, e.g., they may motivate people to contribute more and for
a longer period. By cross-linking user accounts across the two plat-
forms (GitHub and Twitter), we can investigate the characteristics
of the users who were likely attracted by the tweets mentioning
GitHubrepositories,bothrelativetootherusersonTwitterwho

The followingsection gives anoverview of ourstudy design to
answer these research questions.
4 STUDY OVERVIEW
We designed and carried out a mixed-methods empirical study,
analyzinganoveldatasetthatintegratesdataacrossTwitterand
GitHub. Starting from a set of tweets containing links to GitHub
repositories,wecollectdataabouttwooutcomesofinterest—projectpopularityasindicatedbythegrowthinthenumberofstarsand
projectsuccessinattractingnewcontributorsasindicatedbythe
growth in commit authors. We also collect characteristics of those
tweetsandtheirauthors,includingthetweetauthors’egonetworks.
Finally,weusepublicinformationtocross-linkuseraccountsacross
Twitter and GitHub, and collect additional data about the tweet
authors’ relationship to the repositories mentioned in their tweets.
At a high level (Figure 1), our study consists of two main parts. We
give a brief overview here and discuss details below, in Section 5.
Part 1: Diff-in-Diff Analysis of the Causal Impact of Tweets ( RQ1,
RQ2).Inthefirstpart,we mimicanexperimentalresearchdesign

of the two conditions (‘treatment’ and ‘control’), together with the
pre-testmanipulationoftheindependentvariableunderstudy,is

the association between the independent and dependent variables,
ifpresent.Ourstudyisobservationaland,therefore,morelimited
in its ability to support causal claims, compared to a true experi-
mental design. Consider project popularity, one of our two main
outcomes of interest, as an example. While we expect that Twitter
mentionsmay helpincreasethe number of GitHub starsprojects
receiveonaverage,suchanincreasingstarcounttrendmayhave
alreadystarted beforetheTwittermentions,andfordifferentrea-
sons. Figure 2 illustrates this point—the number of new GitHub
starsreceived perdayseemsto startincreasingbeforethe project
was first mentioned on Twitter on March 9th. One of the tweets
mentioning the repository shortly thereafter (O8 in the Appendix)
offersaclueastowhy,suggestingapossiblein-personeventwhere

sure if it is the event itself that causedthe increase in stars, or if
those tweets also played a role in the star increase. Similarly, as
discussed above, being featured on the GitHub trendingpage or
mentioned on platforms like Reddit, Medium, and Hacker News
mayhave also causedthe observed increase in stars.
Tobeabletomakecausalinferences,thekeyideabehindourde-
sign is to compare not the historical changes in outcome measures

repositories, that acts as a control. The latter is chosen such that
thepre-treatmenttrendsinoutcomesaresimilarbetweenthetreat-
mentandcontrolgroups.Thatis,theconfoundingfactorsbefore
the treatment (e.g., offline in-person event), if present, would have
on average affected both treatedand control repositories similarly
sincethe pre-treatment trends betweenthe two groupsareparallel.
Under this assumption, the difference between the observed out-
come and the “normal” outcome, i.e., the difference that would still
exist if neither group experienced the treatment given the same
trendovertimeinbothgroups,canbeseenasthetrueeffectofthe

We use the former analysis to address RQ1. To address RQ2,
we include relevant tweet characteristics as predictors in the same
diff-in-diffmodel, which allows us to estimate their effects.

5 METHODS
Our analyses below are based on a dataset of 2,370 open source
GitHub repositories and all the tweets mentioning them, 44,544 in
total, over a span of 6 months. We detail all our operationalization
and statisticalmodeling steps next.
5.1 Preprocessing
We start from the convenience sample of 70,427 GitHub users
cross-linkedwiththeirTwitteraccounts,publishedbyFangetal .
[26].TheauthorsusedtwoheuristicstoidentifytheGitHubusers’
likelyTwitterprofiles,reportedlywith85%accuracy:“(1)mining
explicit links to Twitter accounts from [all] GitHub user profile
pages; (2) crawling personal websites linked from GitHub user
profile pages and mining links to Twitter accounts therein” [ 26].
We then use the Twitter API to mine all these users’ tweets, and
identify a total of 331,627 tweets among these that contain links to
GitHub artifacts(e.g., issue thread, repository homepage).
Next,weapplyaseriesoffilterstode-noisethisstartingdataset,

WethenlimitoursampletotweetspostedbetweenNovember
1st2018 and April 30th2019 because: a) the copy of GHTorrent
we had access to ended in May 2019; and b) the Twitter API limits
thenumberoftweetswecanobtainfromanysingleuser,therefore
tweets from highly active users posted further back in the past are
less likely to be retrievable (this might bias the sample towards an
over-representationoftweetsfromlessactiveusers).Thechosen
period, six months, is long enough to yield a large dataset for anal-
ysis: after this and all of the above filters, we were left with 10,837
tweets mentioning 7,816 distinct repositories.
However, these 10,837 tweets are only from (a subset of) the

during our observation period, posted by people that were not
part of our starting cross-linked user dataset, we further query
the Twitter API for all tweets containing links with the format

5.2 Aggregating Tweets into Bursts
Twitter mentions of GitHub repositories may occur closely to-
gether in time, as part of coordinated or coincidental burstsof
social media activity. Taking the example in Figure 2, note how
eight tweets by different authors (O1–O8) and many retweets of
these, all mentioning the same repository, occurred within a short
period. In this case, it is unclear how to reason about which tweet
caused a possible increase in GitHub stars shortly thereafter—it
couldbeanysubsetofthosetweets.Ratherthanreasoningabout
tweets separately, we therefore first aggregate tweets into bursts
and then reason about the effect, if any, of a burst as a whole.
There are two important operationalization decisions here. First
isidentifyingthestartandendofaburst (topleftinFigure3).Tothis
end,wedefinedahyper-parameter 𝑋representingthemaximum
allowable time gap (measured in days) between any consecutive
two tweets or retweets mentioning a given repository, before they
are considered to be part of different bursts.
Second is dealing with neighboring bursts (bottom left in Fig-
ure 3). It may take some time before the effects of a burst, if any,
become visible. During this time, it is possible for another burst
mentioningthesamerepositorytohavestarted,creatingambiguity
about which burst caused those effects. To avoid this, we define
a hyper-parameter 𝑌representing the observable effects period
aftertheendofaburst,andconservativelydiscardallburststhat
are“tooclose”toneighboringbursts,i.e.,ifthereisanotherburstmentioning the same repository, either started less than 𝑌days
aftertheend,orendedlessthan 𝑌daysbeforethestartofthisburst.
This decision has implications also for the control group reposi-
tories (more details about how we identified them below). A key
assumption behind our diff-in-diff causal inference analysis is that
the repositories acting as controls have not been treated, i.e., men-
tionedinTwitterbursts,aroundthesametime.Thisimpliesthat
wenecessarilyalsorequirethatapotentialburstmentioningacon-
trolgrouprepositorymustnothavestartedlessthan 𝑌daysafter
the end of a burst mentioning the corresponding treatment-group
repository (right side of Figure 3).
Our results below are computed with 𝑋=3 and𝑌=3 days.4
We performed sensitivity analyses for 𝑋,𝑌∈{3,7}and found
the conclusions after regression analysis to be consistent. Given
the chosen values, our resulting dataset contains 6,981 bursts in
total(15,975originaltweetsand28,569retweets),mentioning2,370
unique repositories.
5.3 Compilinga Control Group
AsdiscussedinSection4,totestthecausalrelationshipbetween
tweetsmentioningGitHubrepositoriesandthenumberofGitHub
stars and the number of new committers, we adopt a diff-in-diff
design [1]. Specifically, we consider a burst of tweets mentioning a
particularGitHubrepositoryasan intervention andcontrastthe
change in the two outcome variables post intervention between
the treated repositories and an appropriate control group.
To compile our control group, we adopt a stacked diff-in-diff
design [33], i.e., we identify suitable control group repositories
alsofromamongthesetofrepositoriesmentionedintweets .Thisis
possiblebecauseevenifallrepositoriesconsideredarementionedin
atleastoneTwitterburst, theyarenotallmentionedatthesametime ;
thus, for any repository treated at time 𝑡, other repositories treated
atdifferenttimescanserveascontrolsfortime 𝑡.Thisapproachhas
severaladvantages,includinganimplicitwaytocontrolforsome
confounding factors (potential ways in which the repositories ever
mentionedintweetsaredifferentfromthosenevermentioned)and
computational efficiency (some variables that need to be computed
for thecontrol group will have been computed anyway).
Specifically, we use propensity score matching [ 14] to sample as
controls, for every treated repository, up to five other repositories
that were not mentioned in tweets around the same time,5but
which show parallel trends in the outcome variables leading up
to the intervention time, compared to the treated repository. We
chose the 1:5 ratio (as opposed to 1:1) to increase robustness in our
statisticalconclusionswhilekeepingthemodelingsamplerelatively
balanced. See Appendix for more implementation details of the
matchingapproach.
5.4 EstimatingTweet Burst Causal Effects and
Their Moderators (RQ1, RQ2)
As per Section 5.2, our unit of analysis is a tweet burst mentioning
a particular GitHub repository. For every such burst, we record
its time and mentioned GitHub repository, variables capturing

5.5 IdentifyingCharacteristicsof Developers
LikelyAttracted By Tweets (RQ3)
For the second part of our study, answering RQ3, we focus on
developersplacingtheirfirstcontributionstothedifferentGitHub
projects soon after the repositories were mentioned in tweets, and
whowere plausibly attracted by those tweets.
To better understand the underlying mechanisms, we start by
qualitatively studying the relationship between attracted devel-
opers and Twitter authors. For every repository and tweet burst
we extract the authors of commits recorded in the main branch
within30daysoftheendoftheburst,thathadnotcommittedto
the projectbefore; bothdirect pushcommits andindirect merged
pull request commits are captured this way. We then label those
newcommittersas likelyattractedbytweets ifthey(i)arepartof
our Twitter-GitHub cross-linked dataset, (ii) retweeted one of the
tweetsmentioningtheGitHubrepositorywithin3daysafterthe
tweet was posted; and (iii) starred the mentioned repository in the
sameperiod.Retweetingensurestheuserisexposedtothetweet,
whilestarringtherepositoryafterthetweetincreasesthelikelihood
thatthe committerwas attracted by the tweet.
With a set of 81 such committers likely attracted by tweets (and
corresponding tweet authors who plausibly attracted them), one
author coded and analyzed all instances of Twitter interaction and
GitHub activity between the tweet authors and attracted commit-
ters using thematic analysis. This was an iterative process that
involved discussing with another author the different codes and
examples thereof, resolving disagreements and recoding, where
needed. In each case, we coded on three dimensions: i) the fre-
quencyanddirectionalityofpastTwitterinteractions;ii)theappar-
entintentofthecurrenttweetandinteraction;iii)thefrequencyof
past GitHub collaboration and each other’s roles in the respective
repositories. The coded interaction is then used to infer the rela-
tionship between tweet authors and attracted committers, and try
to understand the reason developers are attracted.
Following the qualitative analysis we estimate three regressions.
First, we run alogistic regression model to compare developers
whocontributedtotheGitHubprojectstootherswhodid
not, conditioning on both plausibly having been exposed to the
tweets. Here we use past Twitter interaction between the new
committers and the tweet authors to identify users exposed to
tweets,asuserswithfrequentpastinteractionaremorelikelytobeexposed to tweetsposted by each other.6We define interactionas
explicit@-mentioningthetweetauthorandweuseatleastthree
past Twitter “interactions” as the threshold of “tweet exposure.”
Withtheoutcomevariablebeingwhethertheexposeddeveloper
isattractedascommitter(i.e.,madeafirstcommitwithin30days
afterthe tweetburst),GitHubcollaborationand otherdeveloper-
level co-variates are included as independent variables and the
estimated coefficient reflects the difference between developers
attracted versus not. Because of the low number of committers
attracted and high volume of “exposed users,” we randomly down-
sampletheexposeduserstomakethedataframerelativelybalanced
with respect to the outcome variable.
Finally, we estimate regression and survival models to test how
the new committers likely attracted by tweets differ from other
new contributors during the same period in terms of (i) their total
numberof commits 30days aftertheirfirst contribution(linear
regression);7and (ii) their total length of engagement with the
project(Cox proportional-hazards regression)—we follow prior
work [43,54] to detect disengagement as the start of 12 months of
inactivity. See Table 1 for definitions of variables and the results in
Section 6 for the complete set of independent and control variables
included in each model.

characteristics are only defined for repositories in the treatment
group. Recall, since the addition of the Is from committers variable
requires cross-linking of user accounts across the two platforms,
we run Models III and VI on subsets of our dataset, where that
informationwasavailable (cf. Section 5.1).
Interpretingtheestimatedcoefficients,wemakethefollowing
observations.First,thenumberoforiginaltweetshasstatistically
significantpositiveinteractioneffectswiththetreatment:themore
original tweets, the stronger the effect of the burst on the Number
of new stars . One can expect that doubling the number of original
tweets in theburst, will lead toan average increase of 1.8 stars(i.e.,
11%). The effect of tweet likes is partially confirmed by model IIIand no effect is found for the number of retweets. One possible ex-
planation is that the relatively strong co-linear relationship among
thethreevariablesrelatedtoburstpopularity(i.e.,thenumberof
original tweets, retweets, and likes in a burst) makes the effect
less obvious for some variables. Model V (VI) confirms the overall
moderating effect of tweet burst popularity on the Number of new
committers , but only in terms of Number of original tweets —one
canexpectthatdoublingthenumberoforiginaltweetsinaburst
can lead to an average of approximately 0.013 new committers per
project, or one new committer for every 80 repositories.
Second, we turn to the effect of the Is promotional variable, cap-
turingthetweetintent;recall,followingFangetal .[26]weconsider
tweetspointingtoaGitHubrepositoryhomepage,asopposedto
other targets like issue discussions, as promotional. We observe
thatthetweetintenthasastatisticallysignificantmoderatingef-
fect on the Number of new committers per Model V (VI), but not
muchmoderatingeffectonthe Number of new stars perModelII
(III) (only significant at model III and the variance is high). That is,
while the effect of tweet bursts on attracting new stars does not
varymuchwithtweetintentonaverage,tweetburststhattypically
point to issue threads or pull requests (non-promotional per our
operationalization)areexpectedtoattractmorenewcommitters
compared with bursts pointing to repository homepages.
Finally,theaffiliationoftweetauthorswiththerespectiveprojects
beingmentionedinthetweets,i.e.,whetherthetweetburst Is from
committers , has a statistically significant moderating effect for the
Number of new stars —Model III reveals that tweet bursts from
projectcontributorscanbeexpectedtoattract38%fewernewstars
on average, controlling for the number of tweets in the burst. The
effect of the tweet burst on the Number of new committers does
notvary with the affiliation oftweet authors with the project, per

Model VI. We found a negative effect to attract new stars by using
hashtags,and no effect on new committers.
6.3 Characteristicsof New Contributors (RQ3)
Recall, we used thematic analysis to characterize the types of re-
lationshipsbetweenthenewcommitterstotherepositoriesmen-
tioned intweets andauthors of thosetweets (seeSection 5.5).We
stopped after qualitatively analyzing a sample of 19 such develop-
ers’GitHubandTwitteractivityhistoriessincewedidnotobserve

•Repeated past Twitter interaction & GitHub collabora-
tion(6 instances, 32%): The new contributors and the tweet

interactions (i.e., retweeting and replying to each other’s
tweets),andtheyusuallyhavealsocommittedtothesame

ers(7instances,36%):Thenewcontributorsappeareither

•Weak ties (6 instances, 32%): The new contributors have
littleornopastTwitterinteractionwiththetweetauthors
andnotracesofpastcollaborationonGitHub,buttheytend
to follow the tweet authors on Twitter or are in the same

exposure to each other’s tweets.
Thequalitativeanalysissuggeststheexistenceofpastsocialties

on GitHub repositories can also diffuse through weak ties and
reach developers with little prior interaction.
To further characterize the attracted developers, we estimate
thethreeregressionsinTable3.ModelVIIisalogisticregression

Not all tweets are created equal. Our models suggest that the
popularizing effect of tweets varies with different tweet character-
istics.First,wefindthatthemoretweetsthereareinaburst,the
strongertheeffectofthatburstonincreasingaproject’sstartcount.
This reflects, intuitively, the increased exposure andattention the
repositories get when mentioned by multiple tweets around the
same time. However, we find little evidence that the purpose of the
tweets matters. Unlike prior work [ 26] suggesting that tweets that
point to issue discussions or pull requests when mentioning the
GitHubrepositoriesmayhavelesspromotionaleffect,wefindthat
alltweetshelpattractattentiontotheprojectsimilarly,irrespective
ofintent,andsomeofthisattentiontranslatesintonewGitHub
stars. We do, however, find evidence that the effect varies with
the tweet authors’ affiliation with the GitHub projects—tweets by
existing project contributors or maintainers, i.e., project ‘insiders,’
areseeminglylessimpactfulthantweetsbyothers.Onepossible
explanation is that tweets from project insiders may be considered
less objective (self-promotion) and may not be taken to reflect the
truevalueorqualityoftheproject.Anotherpossibleexplanation
isthattweetspostedbyothersmaybringthisprojecttoadifferent,
wideraudience,comparedtotweetsfromprojectinsiderswhose
Twitterfollowersmayalreadyknowthisprojectwell.Thisresult
suggests that obtaining an ‘endorsement’ from a trustworthy third-
partyonTwittermayfurtherbenefittheproject’spopularity,andit
alsosuggeststheimportancetopromoteoutside one’sown social
circle.Multipletweetsaboutarepositorybythesamesetofusers
may have decreasing value to attract new stars, because most of
theiraudiencehave already considered the project before.
Tweetscanhelptoattractnewcommitters,butonlyunder
certaincondition. TheeffectoftweetsmentioningGitHubrepos-
itories on attracting new contributors is weaker than for stars.
However, it is still statistically significant and causalgiven our
study design. Comparing the stars and committers models, the lat-
ter indicate that more focused attention is needed. In particular,
itseemsimportantthattweetsnotbegenericbutratherpointto
specific repository elements, typically specific issue or pull request
discussions, and that tweet bursts contain more original tweets
than retweets to increase the magnitude of the effect.
CommunityengagementonTwitterisimportant. Ourqual-
itative analysis revealed that of those repositories that do attract
newcommitters,manyofthemsucceededthroughthebondofa
community or strong interpersonal connections. Either the project

be diffused to them swiftly.
Socialconnectionscanbeleveragedforwork-relatedtasks,
especially short-term ones. Our models of how the new project
contributors plausibly attracted by tweets differ from other con-
tributors, on average, confirmed the importance of maintainingties with past collaborators on GitHub and, in addition, the added
valueofTwittersocialties.However,comparingthemodelsofshort-
(commitsinthefirst30days)andlong-termoutcomes(lengthof

Twitter connections, long-term. This suggests that open-source
maintainersmaytapintotheirTwittersocialconnectionsforon-
demand, perhaps for help with specific issues, but that these re-
sources are not necessarily sustainable.
Attention can be a double edged sword. The fact that tweets
havestrongeffecttoattractuserattention,butcomparativelylower
numbers of new committers also raises concerns to developers
tweetingaboutGitHubrepositories.AswementionedinSection1,
while using Twitter as a promotion platform may increase the pop-
ularityofaproject,itmayalsosimultaneouslybringaboutrequests
and demands from new users without a proportional amount of
contributioninput. Future research can further investigate other
project outcomes that may be affected by increased attention, such
asthenumberofissuereports.Developersshouldalsoconsiderthis
factor when they decide to start a promotion campaign for their
project on Twitter.
Theroleof Twitter inopen-source development. Comparing
with developers who are not evidently attracted by tweets, the
plausibly attracted ones are relatively new to GitHub, and they
don’t post much on Twitter. We hypothesize that they are new
developerslookingforopen-sourceprojectstocontributetosothey
maynot haveroutinecollaboratorsor theenergyand motivation
to maintain a strong social media presence. We argue that Twitter
is especially important for such developers, since it provides them
an opportunity to receive updates or information about GitHub
projects at a low cost.

open-source repositories, and it has various initiatives to promote
projects (e.g., trending pages, project spotlights) which can lead
to higher popularity of the promoted projects. Given that Twit-
ter seems to be a valuable exogenous attention eliciting platform,
we suggest that integrating Twitter access into the code hosting
platform could help with broadcasting information about those
projects moreeffectively (notethat GitHubrecently addedan ex-
plicitTwitterfieldinuserprofilepagestoo8).Thiscouldbedone,
e.g.,byaddinga‘tweet’buttononeachprojecthomepageandissue
threadpage.ProvidingreadyaccesstoTwittercouldleadtoeasy,
immediate action for developers to promote their project. This can
alsobehelpfultoothernon-developerusersoftheprojecttodiscuss
issuesorpromoteacertainfeatureoftherepositorytotheirbroader
social circle. In addition to this, keeping in mind the moderators of
the effects of tweets we uncovered, platforms could also provide
tweet templates that can incorporate some of these suggestions as
soon as a user tries to tweet from the project homepage.
Diff-in-diff can be a useful design in software engineering
research. At a higher level, we note that our causal inference

8 THREATS TO VALIDITY
Despite our best efforts to carefully collect and analyze our data,
we acknowledge the existence of several limitations in our study.
First,wehaveseveralmissingdataproblems.Thesetoftweets
wecollectedmentioningarepositorymaynotbecompletebecause
of tweet deletion, which we assume is insufficiently frequent to
affect our results. The commit and other activity data we extract
fromGHTorrentmayalsobeincomplete;similarly,weassumethat
is sufficiently rare.
Second, the cross-linked Twitter and GitHub user data may not
bealwayscorrectandweexpectnoiseintroducedbecauseofpo-
tentiallyinaccurateTwitter-GitHubaccountmatching.Similarly
to Fang et al . [26], we selected a random sample of 100 Twitter-
GitHub linked user pairs in our study (where users were either
tweet authors or committers likely attracted by or exposed to
tweets) for further inspection. Among these, one pair had either
their Twitter orGitHubaccountdeleted orinaccessible, which left
uswith99pairs.Wethenmanuallyevaluatedtheaccuracyofthe
matching by comparing the profile information and activity traces
of both accounts. Among the 99 pairs, 87 appear obviously correct
(87.9%), 2 obviously incorrect (2.0%), and we cannot confidently
validate the accuracy of the remaining pairs (10.1%) given their
public activity traces. This puts the accuracy of the linked pairs on
parwiththeonereported byFangetal. [26]andoverall high–at
least 87.9%in the validation sample, and likely higher.
9 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we empirically demonstrated that mentioning open-
sourceGitHubrepositoriesonTwittercan leadtoanincreasein
project popularity and help to attract new developers. However,
themechanismisnotequallyeffectiveforthetwooutcomes:while
the effect of tweets on gaining new stars seems to apply to most
repositoriesandkindsoftweets,tweetingtoattractnewdevelopers
is considerably less effective on average, reflective of the relatively
higher bar to placing a technical contribution in an open-source
project compared to simply expressing interest in the project by
starringit.Still,weargue,thereishopeforopen-sourcemaintainers,
communitymanagers,and evangelists,since theeffectof tweeting
on both outcomes is moderated by many factors within one’s control .
Weconclude,optimistically,thattweetingaboutopensourcecan
contributeto improving open source sustainability.

B PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING
As part of our DID modeling, we used propensity score match-
ingtoensurethecontrolrepositories,onaverage,havethesame
pre-treatment trend in outcome variables (i.e., daily number of
committers and stars gained) as the treatment group. We use a
logisticregressionmodeltofittheprobabilityofarepositorybeing
mentioned by a tweet at a particular time, given a set of repository
features. Following Maldeniya et al . [40], we use the 𝑙𝑜𝑔of the
relative increase in outcome variables (i.e., stars and new contribu-
tor counts)and the absolutenumber ofstars and newcommitters
gained as predictors. Specifically, we compute
𝐼𝑖𝑡=𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑂𝑖𝑡+1
𝑂𝑖(𝑡−1)+1)
where𝐼𝑖𝑡is the relative increase of a given outcome variable for
repository 𝑖at time𝑡, and𝑂𝑖𝑡corresponds to the value of that
outcomevariable. We add one to both the numerator and the de-
nominatorto handle zero counts for stars or new committers.
Manual evaluation shows the number of new stars gained of
treatedrepositoriesstarttoincreasearoundninehourbeforethe
treatment,withnewcommittersincreasesninedaybefore.There-
fore,weincludetherelativeincreaseonboththenumberofstars
andnewcommittersgained,starting9-hourbeforethetreatment
for starsand9-day before fornew committers, as wellas the total
number of stars and new committers gained within 9-hour (stars),
or 9-day (new committers) before the treatment.Our model is formally described in equation 3, where 𝑃(𝑡𝑖𝑐)
corresponds to the probability repository 𝑖is treated by tweet 𝑐
at time𝑡,𝐼𝐶𝑖(𝑡−𝑗)and𝐼𝑆𝑖(𝑡−𝑗)stands for the relative increase on
"star" and "new committers" gained for repository 𝑖on the𝑗𝑡ℎunit
of time before the treatment, respectively. The unit time of relative
increase is 1-hour for stars and 24-hour day for new committers.
Similarly, 𝑆𝑖(𝑡−𝑗)and𝐶𝑖(𝑡−𝑗)corresponds to the number of stars
and new committers gained for repository 𝑖on the𝑗𝑡ℎunit before
treatment.(i.e., 𝐼𝑆𝑖(𝑡−2)correspondstotherelativestarincreasefor
repository 𝑖from the period of 2-1 hour before the treatment, to
the period of 1-0 hour before the treatment. 𝑆𝑖(𝑡−2)corresponds to
thenumberofstarsgainedforrepository 𝑖fromtheperiodof2-1
hour before the treatment.). 𝜎here is the "sigmoid" function and
transformsthe result within 0 −1 range.
𝑃(𝑡𝑖𝑐)=𝜎(𝑗=9/summationdisplay.1
𝑗=2𝐼𝐶𝑖(𝑡−𝑗)+𝑗=9/summationdisplay.1
𝑗=2𝐼𝑆𝑖(𝑡−𝑗)+𝑗=9/summationdisplay.1
𝑗=1𝑆𝑖(𝑡−𝑗)+𝑗=9/summationdisplay.1
𝑗=1𝐶𝑖(𝑡−𝑗))(3)
We plot the pre-treatment trend of outcome variables in both
treatment and control groups in Figure 5, the outcome variable
at relative time (day or hour) 0 or after is in the post-treatment
period, and at time −1 or before is in the pre-treatment period.
According to the graph, both the treatment and matched control
group display an upward trend in both the number of stars and
new committers gained before the treatment, and the trends are
generally the same until the treatment. The plot indicates that our
matchedcontrolrepositorieshavesimilarpre-treatmenttrendin
the outcome variables as the treated repositories, therefore the
parallel trend assumption holds.

C PROMOTIONAL TWEET IDENTIFICATION
VALIDATION
In section 5.4, we use the target of link mentioned by tweet (i.e.,
repositoryhomepagelinkedforpromotionalpurposes,andissue
