ABSTRACT
In community-based software development, developers frequently
relyonlive-chattingtodiscussemergentbugs/errorstheyencounter
in daily development tasks. However, it remains a challenging task
to accurately record such knowledge due to the noisy nature of
interleaveddialogsinlivechatdata.Inthispaper,wefirstformulate
thetaskofidentifyingandsynthesizingbugreportsfromcommu-
nity live chats, and propose a novel approach, named BugListener,
toaddressthechallenges.Specifically,BugListenerautomatesthree
sub-tasks: 1) Disentangle the dialogs from massive chat logs by
usingaFeed-Forwardneuralnetwork;2)Identifythebug-report
dialogs from separated dialogs by leveraging the Graph neural net-
work to learn the contextual information; 3) Synthesize the bug
reports by utilizing Transfer Learning techniques to classify the
sentences into: observed behaviors (OB), expected behaviors (EB),
andstepstoreproducethebug (SR).BugListenerisevaluatedonsix open source projects. The results show that: for bug report
identification,BugListenerachievestheaverageF1of77.74%,im-provingthebestbaselineby12.96%;andforbugreportsynthesis
task, BugListener could classify the OB, EB, and SR sentences with
theF1of84.62%,71.46%,and73.13%,improvingthebestbaselinesby
9.32%, 12.21%, 10.91%, respectively. A human evaluation study also

1 INTRODUCTION
Collaborative communication via live chats allows developers to
seek information and technicalsupport, share opinions and ideas,
discuss issues, and form community development [ 14,16], in a
moreefficientwaycomparedwithasynchronouscommunication
suchasemailsorforums[ 42,65,66].Consequently,collaborative
livechattinghasbecomeanintegralpartofmostsoftwaredevelop-
mentprocesses,notonlyforopensourcecommunitiesconstituting
globally distributed developers, but also for software companies to
facilitatein-houseteamcommunicationandcoordination,esp.in
accommodating remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic [ 49].
Existingliteraturereportsthatdevelopersarelikelytojoincol-
laborative live chats to discuss problems they encountered during
development [ 5,6,13,52]. Shi et al. [ 62] analyzed 749 live-chat
dialogs from eight OSS communities, and found 32% of the dialogs
are reporting unexpected behaviors, such as something does not
work,reliabilityissues,performanceissues,anderrors.Infact,these
reportingproblemsusuallyimplypotentialbugsthathavenotbeen
found. Fig. 1 illustrates an example slice of collaborative live chats
[1] from the Docker community. In this conversation, developer
DavidreportedaperformancebugthatDockertookalotofdisk
space, and Lena indeed confirmed David’s feedback. Then, Jack
provided a suggestion to help resolve this problem but failed in the
end. Althoughdevelopers haverevealed this bugvia collaborative
livechats,thehighlydynamicandmulti-threadingnatureoflive
chattingmakesthisbug-reportconversationgetquicklyfloodedby
new incoming messages. After several months, Docker developers
calltoremembrancethisbugwiththefrustratedcommentssuch
as “lost all my system backups” and “it’s a shame”, when thereare several formal bug reports (i.e., #30254, #31105, and #32420)

bug repository. We can observe that, if the bug discussed in live
chatscouldbeidentifiedanddocumentedinatimelymanner,the
bugmayhavebeenresolvedearlierbytheDockercommunity.Con-
sequently, the Docker community may have the opportunity to
prevent many failure incidents associated with this bug [54].
Althoughthelivechatscouldbeatremendousdatasourceem-
bedded withbug reportsover time,it is quitechallenging tomine
massivechatmessagesduetothefollowingbarriers. (1)Entangled
andnoisydata.Livechatstypicallycontainentangled,informal
conversationscoveringawiderangeoftopics[ 44].Moreover,there
exist noisy utterances such as duplicate and off-topic messagesin chat messages that do not provide any valuable information.Such entangled and noisy nature of live chat data poses a diffi-
cultyinanalyzingandinterpretingthecommunicativedialogues.
(2) Understanding complex dialog structure . In complex di-
alogs,developersusuallyeitherconfirmorrejectabugreportby
replying to previous utterances. Since the “reply-to” relationship is
not linear to the dialog structure, it is necessary to employ moresophisticated techniques to handle nonlinear dialog structure, in
orderto learnprecise feedback andreduce thelikelihoodof intro-
ducing false-positive.For example,the utterance“When Iuse the
‘automationName’ key, I get an error that it is not a recognized
W3C capability.” is very likely to be classified as a bug proposal.
However, when examining the dialog, we found that the following-
up utterances pointed out the error was not a valid bug. Instead, it
was caused by the user’s action of importing incorrect packages.
(3)Extremelyexpensiveannotation.Thelivechatsaretypically
largeinsize.Itisextremelyexpensivetoannotatebugreportsfrom
chat messages due to the high volume corpus and a low propor-tion of ground-truth data. Only a few labeled chat messages are
categorizedintobugreporttypes.Thus,thelabeledresourcesforsynthesizingbugreportsarealsolimited.Howtomakemaximaluse
ofthelimitedlabeleddatatoclassifytheunlabeledchatmessages
accurately becomes a critical problem.
In this work, we propose a novel approach, named BugListener,
whichcanidentifybug-reportdialogsfrommassivechatlogsand
synthesize complete bug reports from predicted bug-report dialogs.
BugListeneremploysadeepgraph-basednetworktocapturethe
complexdialog structure,and atransfer-learning networkto syn-
thesize bug reports. Specifically, BugListener addresses the chal-
lengeswiththree elaboratedsub-tasks:1)Disentanglethe dialogs
frommassivechatlogsbyusingaFeed-Forwardneuralnetwork.
2) Identify bug-report dialogs from separated dialogs by modeling
theoriginaldialogtothegraph-structureddialogandleveraging
the Graph neural network (GNN) to learn the complex context
representation.3)Synthesizethebugreportsfrompredictedbug-
report dialogs using Transfer Learning techniques. Specifically, we
use the pre-trained BERT model provided by Devlin et al. [ 21]
and fine-tune it twice using the external BEE dataset [ 68] and our
owndataset,respectively.Toevaluatetheproposedapproach,we
collect and annotate 1,501 dialogs from six popular open-source
projects. The experimental results show that our approach signifi-
cantlyoutperformsallotherbaselinesinbothtwotasks.Forbug
report identification task, BugListener achieves an average F1 of
77.74%, improving the best baseline by 12.96%. For bug report syn-
thesistask,BugListenercouldclassifysentencesdepictingobserved
behavior (OB), expected behavior (EB), and steps to reproduce (SR)
with the F1 of 84.62%, 71.46%, and 73.13%, respectively, improving
thebestbaselineby9.32%,12.21%,and10.91%,respectively.Wealsoconductahumanevaluationtoassessthecorrectnessandqualityof
the generated bug reports, showing that BugListener can generate
relevant and accurate bug reports.
The main contributions and their significance are as follows.
•We propose an automated approach, named BugListener, based
on a deep graph-based network to effectively identify the bug-report dialogs, and a transfer-learning network to extensively
synthesizebugreports.WebelievethatBugListenercan facili-
tatecommunity-basedsoftwaredevelopmentbypromot-
ing bug discovery and quality improvement.
•We evaluate the BugListener by comparing with state-of-the-art
baselines, with superior performance.

2 PROBLEM DEFINITION
To facilitate the problem definition and further discussion, we first
provide some basic concepts and notations used in this study:
•A chat log (L) corresponds to a sequence of utterances 𝑢𝑖in
chronological order, denoted by 𝐿={𝑢1,𝑢2,...,𝑢𝑛}.
•Anutterance( 𝑢𝑖)consistsofthetimestamp,developerrole,and
textual message, denoted by 𝑢𝑖=<𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒,𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑒,𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 >.
300•Adeveloperrole( 𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑒)inadialogisdefinedaseithera reporter
oradiscussant.A reporterreferstoadeveloperlaunchingadialog,
whileadiscussant referstoadeveloperparticipatinginthedialog.
Denoted by 𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑒∈{𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑟,𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑢𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑛𝑡 }.
•A dialog ( 𝐷𝑖)is a sequence of 𝑘utterances 𝑢𝑖, retaining the
“reply-to”relationshipamongutterances,denotedby 𝐷𝑖={𝑢R1
1,
𝑢R2
2,...,𝑢R𝑘
𝑘}.
•Arelationalcontextforutterance 𝑢𝑖(R𝑖)isasetofundirected
"reply-to"relationshipidentifiers,eachidentifiercorresponding
to a message replying to or replied by 𝑢𝑖. If two utterances share
the same superscript, then it implies one replies to the other. For
example, 𝐷={𝑢𝑅1,𝑅2
1,𝑢𝑅1
2,𝑢𝑅2
3}represents that both 𝑢2and𝑢3
reply to 𝑢1.
Our work then targets at automatically identifying and synthe-
sizing bug reports from community live chats. We formulate the
task of automatic bug report generation from live chats with three
elaborated sub-tasks:
(1)Dialogdisentanglement:Giventhehistoricalchatlog 𝐿,dis-
entangle it into separate dialogs {𝐷1,𝐷2,...,𝐷𝑛}.
(2)Bug-ReportdialogIdentification(BRI):Givenaseparatedialog
𝐷𝑖,findabinaryfunction 𝑓sothat 𝑓(𝐷𝑖)candeterminewhether
the dialog involves bug-reporting messages.
(3) Bug-Report Synthesis (BRS): Assuming that the content of
bugreportsismadeupofsentencesextractedfromthereporters’ut-
terances,givenallthereporter’sutterances 𝑈𝑟inthepredictedbug-
reportdialog 𝐷𝑖,findafunction 𝑔sothat𝑔(𝑈𝑟)={𝐷𝐸𝑆,𝑂𝐵,𝐸𝐵,𝑆𝑅 },
where𝐷𝐸𝑆,𝑂𝐵,𝐸𝐵, and𝑆𝑅representthecollectionsofsentences
in𝑈𝑟that depict Description, Observed Behavior, Expected Behavior,
andStep to Reproduce.

and(5)bugreportsynthesistoformacompletebugreport.Next,
we present details of each step.
3.1 Data Disentanglement and Augmentation
In this step, We first separate dialogs from the interleaved chat
logsusingaFeed-Forwardnetwork.Then,weaugmenttheoriginal
dialog dataset utilizing a heuristic data augmentation method to
overcome the insufficient labeled resource challenge.
3.1.1 Dialog Disentanglement. Utterances from a single conver-
sation thread are usually interleaved with other ongoing conver-sations, and therefore need to be divided into individual dialogsaccordingly. To find a reliable disentanglement model, we exper-iment with four state-of-the-art dialog disentanglement models,i.e., BILSTM model [
29], BERT model [ 21], E2E model [ 44], and
FF model, using our manual disentanglement dataset as detailed
inSection4.1later.Thecomparisonresultsfromourexperiments
show that the FF model significantly outperforms the others on
disentanglingdeveloperlivechatbyachievingthehighestscoresonNMI,Shen-F,F1,andARImetrics.Theaveragescoresofthese
four metrics are 0.74, 0.81, 0.47, and 0.57 respectively1.
Specifically, the FF model is a Feed-Forward neural network
with 2 layers, 512-dimensional hidden vectors, and softsign non-
linearities. It employs a two-stage strategy to resolve dialog disen-
tanglement. First, the FF model predicts the “reply-to” relationship
between every two utterances in the chat log based on averaged
pre-trained word embedding and many hand-engineered features.
Second, it clusters the utterances that can reach each other via the
“reply-to” predictions as one dialog. Thus, the FF-model can output
not only the utterances in one dialog but also their “reply-to” rela-
tionship,whichisessentialforconstructingtheinternalnetwork
structure of dialogs.
3.1.2 Data Augmentation. Toaddressthelimitedannotationand
data imbalance issue, a heuristic data augmentation mechanism is
employed to enlarge the dataset through dialog mutation. The key
todialogmutationistoaltertheutteranceformsandretaintheir
semantics.Toachievethat,wemutatealongutterancebyreplacing
a few words with their synonyms, or mutate a short utteranceby replacing it with another short utterance. Specifically, givena dialog
𝐷={𝑢1,𝑢2,...,𝑢𝑛}, we generate 𝑁different mutants by
iterating the following steps 𝑁times. For each utterance 𝑢𝑖in a
dialog𝐷, we perform either an utterance-level replacement or a
word-level replacement based on its length, and generate a new
utterance 𝑢𝑖/prime=Γ(𝑢𝑖):
∀𝑢𝑖∈𝐷,Γ(𝑢𝑖)=/braceleftBigg
𝑢𝑘|𝑢𝑖|≤𝜃
SR(𝑢𝑖)|𝑢𝑖|>𝜃(1)
where|𝑢𝑖|denotes the length of 𝑢𝑖, and𝜃is a predefined threshold
(We empiricallyset 𝜃=5inthisstudy). 𝑢𝑘istheutterancethatis
randomly selected from the entire dialog corpus with a length less
than𝜃.SR(𝑢𝑖)denotes the synonym-replacement operation that
hasbeenwidelyusedbyNLPtextaugmentationtask[ 76].Afterall
utterances in dialog 𝐷are processed, we then obtain a new dialog
𝐷𝑎𝑢𝑔={𝑢1/prime,𝑢2/prime,...,𝑢𝑛/prime}.
Toachievedatabalancing,foreachproject,wefirstaugmentthe
NBRdialogstoacertainnumber,thenweaugmentBRdialogsto
matchthesamenumber.TakingtheAngularprojectasanexample,
wefirstaugmenttheNBRdialogsfrom179to358(2times),then
augment the BR dialogs from 86 to 358 for balancing purposes.
3.2 Utterance Embedding
The utterance embedding aims to encode semantic information of
words, as well as to learn the representation of utterances.
Word encoding. We encode each word in utterances into a
semantic vector by utilizing the deep pre-trained BERT model [ 21],
whichhasachievedimpressivesuccessinmanynaturallanguage
processingtasks[ 47,72].ThelastlayeroftheBERTmodeloutputs
a 768-dimensional contextualized word embedding for each word.
Utteranceencoding. Withallthewordvectors,weuseTextCNN

Max-Pooling layer followed by the ReLUactivation [ 50]. Then, we
concatenate these features and input them into a 100-dimensional

bedding/vec𝑢𝑖. After encoding all the utterances of a dialog 𝐷, we can
get utterance-embedded dialog 𝐷/prime={/vec𝑢1,/vec𝑢2,.. ,/vec𝑢𝑛}.
3.3 Graph-based Context Embedding
Thisstepaimstocapturethegraphicalcontextofutterancesinone
dialog. Given the utterance-embedded dialog 𝐷/prime={/vec𝑢1,/vec𝑢2,.. ,/vec𝑢𝑛}
with the set of “reply-to” relationship R, we first construct a dialog
graph𝐺(𝐷/prime). Then, we learn the contextual information of 𝐺(𝐷/prime)
via a two-layer graph neural network, and output 𝐺𝑐(𝐷/prime)where
each vertex in 𝐺𝑐(𝐷/prime)restores the contextual information of the
correspondingvertexin 𝐺(𝐷/prime).Finally,Weconcatenateeachvertex
in𝐺(𝐷/prime)withitscorrespondingvertexin 𝐺𝑐(𝐷/prime),andoutputthe
sequence of combination as the dialog vector 𝐶={/vec𝑐1,/vec𝑐2,...,/vec𝑐𝑛}.

Vertex.Eachutteranceisrepresentedasavertex 𝑣𝑖∈V.W euse
theutteranceembedding /vec𝑢𝑖toinitializethecorrespondingvertex
𝑣𝑖. The𝑣𝑖will be updated during the graph learning process.
Edge.We construct the edge set Ebased on the “reply-to” re-
lationship. The edge 𝑒𝑖𝑗∈Edenotes that there is a “reply-to”
relationship between 𝑢𝑖and𝑢𝑗.
Edge Weight. The edge weight 𝑤𝑖𝑗is the weight of the edge
𝑒𝑖𝑗, with 0 ≤𝑤𝑖𝑗≤1, where 𝑤𝑖𝑗∈Wand𝑖, 𝑗∈[1,2,...,𝑁].
𝑤𝑖𝑗is determined by the similarity of /vec𝑢𝑖and/vec𝑢𝑗. Specifically, we
employ pair-wise dot product to compute the similarity score of
pair vertices. Then, we normalize the similarity score and calculate
the edge weight 𝑤𝑖𝑗:
𝑤𝑖𝑗=/vec𝑢𝑖T·𝑊𝑒/vec𝑢𝑗
/summationtext.1
𝑘∈𝑁(𝑖,∗)/vec𝑢𝑖T·𝑊𝑒/vec𝑢𝑘(2)where𝑊𝑒isatrainablematrixusedtoperformlinearfeaturetrans-

𝑣𝑖points to.
EdgeType. Wedefinethetypeoftheedge 𝑒𝑖𝑗as𝑡𝑖𝑗∈T,accord-
ingtothe developer-roledependency of𝑒𝑖𝑗.Specifically,weconsider
four types of edges in this study, i.e., 𝑟→𝑟,𝑟→𝑑,𝑑→𝑟, and
𝑑→𝑑,where 𝑟denotesthereporter, 𝑑denotesthediscussant,as
we defined in the previous section.
3.3.2 Embed Dialog Graph Context. Givenadialoggraph 𝐺(𝐷/prime),
weemployatwo-layergraphneuralnetwork(GNN)[ 59]toembed
the graph context of dialog structure and developer-role depen-
dency, respectively. We output 𝐺𝑐(𝐷/prime)where each vertex restores
graph context information.
Structure-levelGNN. Inthefirstlayer,abasicGNN[ 31]isused
tolearnthestructure-levelcontextforeachvertexinagivengraph,
including embedding its neighbor vertices via the “reply-to” edges,
as well as the features contained in the neighbor vertices.
A basic GNN layer can be implemented as follows:
𝑣𝑖(𝑙+1)=𝜎/parenleftbigg
𝑊(𝑙)
1𝑣𝑖(𝑙)+𝑊(𝑙)
2/summationdisplay.1
𝑗∈𝑁(∗,𝑖)𝑣𝑗(𝑙)/parenrightbigg
(3)
where 𝑁(∗,𝑖)denotes the set of neighboring vertices that point
to vertex 𝑣𝑖.𝑣𝑖(𝑙)represents the updated vertex at layer 𝑙, and
𝑣𝑖(𝑙+1)represents the updated vertex at layer 𝑙+1.𝜎denotes a
non-linearfunction,suchassigmoidorReLU, 𝑊(𝑙)
1and𝑊(𝑙)
2are
trainable parameter matrices. We introduce the edge weights to
betteraggregatethelocalinformation.Hence,theupdatedvertex
𝑣𝑖(1)of the structure-level GNN layer is calculated as:
𝑣𝑖(1)=𝜎/parenleftbigg
𝑊(1)
1/vec𝑢𝑖+𝑊(1)
2/summationdisplay.1
𝑗∈𝑁(∗,𝑖)𝑤𝑗𝑖/vec𝑢𝑗/parenrightbigg
(4)
where𝑤𝑗𝑖denotes the edge weight from vertex 𝑣𝑗to vertex 𝑣𝑖.
Role-levelRGCN. Inthesecondlayer,wefurthercapturethe
high-levelcontextualinformationbyleveragingRelationalGraph
Convolutional Networks (RGCN) [ 60]. RGCN is a generalization
ofGraphConvolutionalNetworks(GCN)[ 36]whichextendsthe
hierarchical propagation rules and takes the edge types between
302vertices into account. Since RGCN explicitly models the neighbor-
hood structures, it can better handle multi-relational graph data
likeourdialoggraph,whichcontainsfouredgetypes.Thevertex 𝑣𝑖
is updated by applying the RGCN over the output of the first layer.

3.4 Dialog Embedding and Classification
This step aims to obtain the representation of an entire dialog and
classify it as either a positive or a negative bug-report dialog.
DialogEmbedding. Weinputthedialogvector 𝐶={/vec𝑐1,/vec𝑐2,...,/vec𝑐𝑛}

we concatenate the output vectors to get the dialog embedding /vec𝑔:
/vec𝑔=|𝑉|/summationdisplay.1

where⊕is the concatenation operator, |𝑉|is the number of the
graph’s vertices.
Dialog Classification. The label is predicted by feeding the
dialogembedding /vec𝑔intotwoFull-Connected (FC)layersfollowed
by theSoftmaxfunction:
P=softmax(𝐹𝐶2(ReLU(𝐹𝐶1(/vec𝑔𝑒)))) (7)
wherePisthe2-lengthvector[ 𝑃(NBR|𝐷),𝑃(BR|𝐷)],the𝑃(NBR|𝐷)

is the predicted probability of bug-report dialog.

3.5 Bug Report Synthesis
Due to the high volume of live chat data and the low proportion of
ground-truthbug-reportdialogs,itisdifficulttogetenoughtraining
data for bug report synthesis task. To address this challenge, we
utilizeatwicefine-tunedBERTmodel,whichprovestobeeffective
toimproveperformancethroughmoresophisticatedtransferringknowledge from the pre-trained model [ 21]. Specifically, we use
apre-trainedBERTandfine-tuneittwiceusingtheexternalBEE
dataset and our BRS dataset, as shown in the dashed box of ‘3.5’ in
Fig. 2.
(1) Initial Fine-tuning BERT model. The BERT model is
a bidirectional transformer using a combination of Masked Lan-
guageModel andNextSentencePrediction.ItistrainedfromEnglish
Wikipedia (2,500M words) and BooksCropus (800M words) [ 79].
TheentireBERTmodelisastackof12BERTlayerswithmorethan
100 million parameters.
Based on an assumption that the contents of bug reports are
likely from the reporters’ utterances, we perform the initial fine-
tune on the task of classifying bug-report contents into OB, EB, SR,
andOthers.First,weselecttheexternalBEEdatasetproposedby
Songetal.[ 68]thatincludes5,067bugreports,11,776OBsentences,

Others ( 𝑃𝑜). We apply Cross-Entropy Loss when measuring the
difference between truth and prediction:
𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠=−(𝑦𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑃𝑏)+𝑦𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑃𝑒)+𝑦𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑃𝑠)+𝑦𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑃𝑜))(9)
where𝑦𝑏,𝑦𝑒,𝑦𝑠, and𝑦𝑜indicate the ground-truth labels of sen-
tences.
(2) Twice fine-tuning BERT model. Given the above fine-
tuned BERT model, we perform the second round of fine-tuningon our BRS dataset as follows. We first collect all the reporter’sutterances
𝑈𝑟in Dialog 𝐷as our inputs. Since 𝑈𝑟may contain
trivial contents that are less meaningful for reporting bugs, we
prunethe 𝑈𝑟into𝑈/prime𝑟iftheysatisfythefollowingheuristicrules:(1)

4 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
To evaluate the proposed BugListener approach, our evaluation
specifically addresses three research questions:
RQ1: How effective is BugListener in identifying bug-report
dialogs from live chat data?
RQ2: How effective is BugListener in synthesizing bug reports?
RQ3: How does each individual component in BugListener con-
tribute to the overall performance?
4.1 Data Preparation
4.1.1 Studied Communities. Many OSS communities utilize Gitter
[27] or Slack [ 28] as their live communication means. Considering
the popular, open, and free access nature, we select studied com-
munities from Gitter2. Following previouswork [ 51,63] ,weselect
popularandactivecommunitiesasourstudiedsubjects.Specifically,
we select the Top-1 most participated communities from six active
domains,coveringfrontendframework,mobile,datascience,De-
vOps,collaboration, andprogramming language.Then,we collect
the live chat utterances from these communities. Gitter provides
RESTAPI[ 26]togetdataaboutchattingroomsandpostutterances.
Inthisstudy,weusetheRESTAPItoacquirethechatutterances
of the six selected communities, and the retrieved dataset contains
all utterances as of “2020-12-31”.
4.1.2 Preprocessing and Disentanglement. Fordatapreprocessing,
we first convert all the words in utterances into lowercase, and
removethestopwords.Wealsonormalizethecontractionsinutter-
ances with contractions [ 37] library and use Spacy [ 4] for lemmati-
zation.Followingpreviouswork[ 10,71],wereplacetheemojiswith
specific strings to standard ASCII strings. Besides, we detect low
frequencytokenssuchasURL,emailaddress,code,HTMLtag,and
version number with regular expressions, and substitute them into
[URL],[EMAIL],[HTML],[CODE],and[VERSION]respectively.
Then,we usetheFFmodel[ 39]todivide theprocesseddatainto
individual dialogs as introduced in Sec. 3.1.1. The detailed statistic
is shown in the “Entire Population” column of Table 1.
4.1.3 Sampling and Filtering. After dialog disentanglement, the
numberof individualchatdialogs remainsquite large.Limitedby
thehumanresourceoflabeling,werandomlysample100dialogs
from each community. The samplepopulation accounts for about
1.1% of the entire population. Although the ratio is not large, we
considertheselecteddialogsarerepresentativebecausetheyarerandomly selected from six diverse communities. The details of
sampling results are shown in the “Sample Population” column of
Table 1.
SinceBugListenerreliesonnaturallanguageprocessingtoun-
derstand the dialog, dialogs that have too much noise or do not
contain enough information are almost incomprehensible and thus
cannotdecideabugreport.Followingthedatacleaningprocedures
of previous studies [ 51,63], we excluded noisy dialogs by apply-
ingthefollowingexclusioncriteria:1)Dialogsthatarewrittenin
non-Englishlanguages;2)Dialogswherethecodeorstacktracesac-countsformorethan90%oftheentirechatcontent;3)Low-quality

greeting or general information messages.
4.1.4 Ground-truth Labeling. For each sampled dialog obtained in
thepreviousstep,welabelground-truthdatafromthreeaspects:(1)
Correct disentanglement results. For each sampled dialog, we man-
ually correct the prediction of the “reply-to” relationships between
utterances, as well as the disentanglement results. (2) Label dialogs
with BR and NBR (See the “Sample Population” column in Table 1).
For each dialog that has been manually corrected, we manually la-
belitwitha“BR”oran“NBR”tag,accordingtowhetheritdiscusses
a certain bug that should be reported. (3) Label sentences with OB,
EB, and SR (See the “BRS Dataset” column in Table 1). For each
dialoglabeledwithBR,wefirstpruneallreporter’sutterances 𝑈𝑟
toobtain 𝑈/prime𝑟asdescribedinSec.3.5(2).Thenwelabeleachsentence
in𝑈/prime𝑟with observed behavior (OB), expected behavior (EB), and
step to reproduce (SR), according to their contents.
To ensure the labeling validity, we built an inspection team,
whichconsistedoffourPhDstudents.AllofthemarefluentEng-
lishspeakers,andhavedoneeitherintensiveresearchworkwith

sourceprojects.Wedividedthemintotwogroups.Theresultsfrom

thecorrectnessofautomateddialogdisentanglementis79%.The
average Cohen’s Kappa about bug report identification is 0.87, and
the average Cohen’s Kappa about bug report synthesis is 0.84.
4.1.5 Dataset augmentation and balancing. ForBRItask,weaug-
ment the dataset as introduced in Sec. 3.1. For each project, we
first augment the NBR data eight times,and then augment the BR
data until BR and NBR data are balanced. The details are shownin the “BRI Dataset” column in Table 1. For BRS task, we apply
EDA[76]techniquestoaugmentOB,EB,SRsentencesuntiltheir
numbers are balanced.We further incorporatean external dataset

The first two RQs require comparison with state-of-the-art base-
lines.Weemployfourcommonmachine-learning-basedbaselines
applicableto bothRQ1andRQ2, including NaiveBayesian (NB)

containing the “problem discovery”utterances as the bug-report
dialog.Casper [ 30]is a method for extracting and synthesizing

ofbothtwotasks,i.e., Precision,Recall,andF1.(1) Precisionrefersto

5 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
5.1 Performance in Identifying Bug Reports
Table 2 shows the comparison results between the performance
ofBugListenerandthoseofthesevenbaselinesacrossdatafrom
six OSS communities, for BRItasks. The columns correspond to
Precision, Recall, and F1. The highlighted cells indicate the best
performancefromeachcolumn.Then,weconductthenormality
testandT-testbetweeneverytwomethods.Overall,thedatafollows
anormaldistribution,andBugListenersignificantly( 𝑝−𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 <
0.01) outperforms the seven baselines on F1. Specifically, when
comparing with the best Precision-performer among the seven
baselines, i.e., CNC, BugListener can improve its average precision
by6.73%.Similarly,BugListenerimprovesthebestRecall-performer,
i.e., Casper, by 10.90% for average recall, and improves the best F1-
performer, i.e., CNC, by 12.96% for average F1. At the individualproject level, BugListener can achieve the best F1-score in all six
communities.
ForBRI tasks , we believe that the performance advantage of
BugListenerismainlyattributedtotherichrepresentativenessof
its internal construction, from two perspectives: (1) BugListenermodels the textual dialog as the dialog graph thereby can effec-
tively exploit the graph-structured knowledge. While the structure
informationismissinginthebaselinemethodsthattreatadialog
as a linear structure. (2) BugListener leverages a novel two-layer
GNNmodelwithconsideringtheedgetypesbetweenutterancesto
learn a high-level contextual representation. Thus it can capture
the latent semantic relations between utterances more accurately.
Answering RQ1: On average, BugListener has the best pre-
cision, recall, and F1, i.e., 77.82%, 78.03%, and 77.74%, improving
the best F1-baseline CNC by 12.96%. On individual projects, it also
outperformstheotherbaselineswithachievingthebestF1-score

5.2 Performance in Synthesizing Bug Reports

in predicting OB, EB, and SR sentences. It outperforms the six

averageF1(by17.22%)acrossallthecommunities.Thisindicates
that the GNN is an essential component to contribute to BugLis-
tener’s high performances. When compared with BugListener and
BugListener w/o CNN, removing the TextCNN component will
lead to the average F1 declines by 13.85%. It is mainly because the
TextCNN model can capture the intra-utterance semantic features,
which improves the classification performance.

6 HUMAN EVALUATION
To further demonstrate the generalization and usefulness of our
approach, we apply BugListener on recent live chats from five new
communities:Webdriverio,Scala,Materialize,Webpack,andPan-
das (note that these are different from our studied communitiesso that all data of these communities do not appear in our train-
ing/testing data). Then we invite nine human annotators to assess
thecorrectness,quality,andusefulnessofthebugreportsgenerated
by BugListener.
Human Annotators. We recruit nine participants, including
twoPhDstudents,twomasterstudents,threeprofessionaldevel-
opers and two senior researchers, all familiar with the five open
source communities. They all have at least three years of software
developmentexperience,andfourofthemhavemorethantenyears
of development experience.
Procedure.First,wecrawltherecentone-month(July2021to
August 2021) live chats of the five new communities from Gitter,
whichcontain3,443utterances.Second,weapplyBugListenerto
disentangleandconstructthelivechatsintoabout562separated
dialogs. Among them, BugListener identifies 31 potential bug
reportsin total3. For each participant, we assign 9-11 bug reports
3Limited by the space, we list the details about the 31 bug reports on our website [ 2].of the communities that they are familiar with. Each bug reportis evaluated by three participants. For each bug report, each par-
ticipant has the following information available: (1) the associated
opensourcecommunity;(2)theoriginaltextualdialogsfromGitter;
(3) the bug report generated by BugListener.
The survey contains three questions: (1) Correctness: Whether
thedialogisdiscussingabugthatshouldbereportedatthatmo-
ment (Yes or No)? (2) Quality: How would you rate the quality of
Description, Observed Behavior, Expected Behavior, and Step to
Reproduceinthebugreport(usingafive-levelLikertscale[ 18])?
(3)Usefulness:HowwouldyouratetheusefulnessofBugListener
(using a 5-level Likert scale)?
Results. To validate the correctness of bug reports identified
by BugListener, we ask each participant to determine whether it is
a real bug report and aggregate group decision based on the ma-
jority vote from the three participants. To validate the quality and
usefulness of each identified bug report, we ask each participant
torateusingaschemefrom1-10andusetheaveragescoreofthe
three evaluations as the final score. Fig. 5(a) shows the bar and
piechartdepictingthecorrectnessofBugListener.Amongthe31
bug reports identified by BugListener, 24 (77%) of them are correct,
while 7 (23%) of them are incorrect. The correctness is in line with
our experiment results (80% precision of bug report identification).
The bar chart shows the correctness distributed among the five
communities.Thecorrectnessrangesfrom63%to100%.Theper-
ceived correctness indicates that BugListener is likely generalized

of bug report description is highly admitted, 85% of the responses
agreethatthebugreportdescriptionissatisfactory(i.e.,“somewhat
satisfied” or “satisfied”). The high quality of OB, EB, and S2R are
also moderately admitted (62%, 46%, and 58% on aggregated cases,
respectively). In addition, the usefulness bar chart shows that 71%
of participants agree that BugListener is useful. We will further
discuss where does BugListener perform unsatisfactorily in Sec.7.2.
7 DISCUSSION
Encouraged by the significant advantages of BugListener as shown
inSec.6,webelievethatourapproachcouldfacilitatethebugdis-
coveringprocess andsoftwarequalityimprov ement.Inthissection,
weproposepotentialusagescenariosaswellasimprovementop-
portunities for future work.
7.1 Potential Usage Scenario
Software Engineering Bots are widely known asconvenient ways
forworkflowstreamliningandproductivityimprovement[ 3,22,35].
BugListener can be easily incorporated into a collaborative bot on
Gitter, following the basic implementation ideas: first, the OSS
repository owner or core team members who care about the po-tential bugs could subscribe to their interesting chat rooms viaBugListener; then, BugListener will monitor the corresponding
chat rooms and send potential bug reports periodically; and finally,
for the bug reports that are confirmed by subscribers, BugListener
couldautomaticallypullthemtocoderepositoriessuchasGithubor
Gitlab that are well integrated with Gitter. We believe that BugLis-
tener could enhance individual and team productivity as well as
improving software quality.
7.2 Improvement Opportunities
AsreportedinSec.6,7outof31bugreportsareincorrectlylabeled
by BugListener. To identify further improvement opportunities
forfollow-upstudies,wesummarizedthefollowingspecialcases
based on examining the human evaluation results that necessitates
further studies to improve the performance of BugListener.
(1)Dialogswithafewornofeedback. Wefoundthat5outof
the 7 incorrect cases are related to insufficient feedback, i.e., three
monologues, and the other two with less than five utterances in
total.Whendecidingwhetheradialogcontainsabugornot,the
feedbackprovidedbyotherdevelopersisimportant. Forexample,
feedback such as “it is still not working” and “could you please
file an issue” likely indicate the discussing bug should be reported.
Therefore, it is difficult for BugListener to predict dialogs with
insufficient feedback. In the future, follow-up research can enrich
the bug report classification by adding different confidence levels:
HighandNormal.“High”referstothebugreportsthatthereporter
or the discussants have confirmed, and “Normal” refers to the bug
reports that have the potential.
(2)Dialogsreflectingusermisuse/mistake. Weobservedthat
2/7incorrectbugreportsareactuallyassociatedwithinstallation
and version-update due to the users’ mistake or negligence. The
differencebetween“Bugs”and“usermisuse/mistake”issubtle.Both
of them might contain negative complaints, error stack traces, and
similarkeywordssuchas“Igeterrors”,“notaddressedatall”,etc.In the future, follow-up studies are needed to incorporate priori
knowledge (e.g., dialogs discussing installation, updating, or build-
ingissuesarelikelynotreportingbugs.)tobetterdistinguishthe
two categories.
7.3 Threats to Validity
The first threat is generalizability. BugListener is only evaluated
on six open-source projects, which might not be representative of
closed-sourceprojectsorotheropen-sourceprojects.Theresults
may be different if the model is applied to other projects. However,
ourdataset comesfrom sixdifferentfields. Thevarietyof projects
relatively reduce this threat.
The second threat may come from the results of automated dia-
logdisentanglement.Inthisstudy,wemanuallyinspectandcorrectthedisentanglementresultstoensurehigh-qualityinputsforevalu-atingBugListener.Theaveragecorrectnessis79%inourinspection.However,forthefullyautomaticusageofBugListener,thetrade-off
option would be directly adopting the automated disentanglement
results.Thus,inreal-worldapplicationscenarioswithoutmanual
correction, a slight drop in performance might be observed. To
alleviatethethreat,fourstate-of-the-artdisentanglementmodels
are selected and experimented on live chat data. We adopt the best
performing modelamong thefour models,the FFmodel, todisen-
tanglethelivechat.Theresultsofhumanevaluationstudyshow
thatBugListener canachieve 77%precisionwithout manualcorrec-
tion,andtheperformanceonlyslightlydeclinedby3%compared
with BugListener taking the corrected dialogue as input. Therefore,
we believe this can serve as a good foundation for BugListener’s
fully automatic usage.
Thethirdthreatrelatestotheconstructofourapproach.First,
we hypothesize that the contents of bug reports likely consist of
reporters’utterances,whichoccasionallyresultsinmissingcontextinformation.Toalleviatethethreat,wethoroughlyanalyzedwhere
our approach performs unsatisfactorily in Sec. 7.2, and planned
future work for improvement.Second, we enlarge our BRI dataset
by using a heuristic data augmentation, which may alter the se-manticsoftheoriginaldialog.Toalleviatethethreat,weemploy
the utterance mutation fromtwo dimensions (utterance-level and
word-level), which has been commonly used in augmenting the
datasetsforNLPtasks[ 23,76].Itcouldreducesemanticchangesof
the overall dialogs to a minimum.
The fourth threat relates to the suitability of evaluation metrics.
We utilize precision, recall, and F1 to evaluate the performance.We use the dialog labels and utterance labels manually labeled
as ground truth when calculating the performance metrics. Thethreats can be largely relieved as all the instances are reviewed
withaconcludingdiscussionsessiontoresolvethedisagreementin
labelsbasedonmajorityvoting.Thereisalsoathreatrelatedtoour
humanevaluation.Wecannotguaranteethateachscoreassigned
to every bug report is fair. To mitigate this threat, each bug report
isevaluated by3 humanevaluators,and weuse theaveragescore
of the 3 evaluators as the final score.

ingtechniquetosynthesizecompletebugreports.Theevaluation
results show that our approach significantly outperforms all other
baselines in both BRI and BRS tasks. We also conduct a human
evaluation to assess the correctness and quality of the bug reports
generated by BugListener. We apply BugListener on recent livechats from five new communitiesand obtain 31 potentialbug re-
portsintotal.Amongthe31bugreports,77%ofthemarecorrect.
71% of human evaluators agree that BugListener is useful. These
