them implement their desired features. While code recommenders
help improve developers’ productivity, there is currently no sup-
portforcontext-awarecoderecommendationforopportunisticcode
reuse on-the-go. Typical code recommendation systems provide
recommendationsagainstasearchquery,whereasacoderecom-
mender that supports opportunistic reuse can recommend related
code snippets that represent features that the developer may want
toimplementnext.Inthispaper,wepresentanovelContext-aware

tool,whichisan IntellijIDEApluginthatleveragesadeveloper’s
development context to recommend related code snippets. We con-
siderthemethodshavingAPIusagesinadeveloper’sactiveproject
as part of the development context. Our approach uses contextual
datafromadeveloper’sactiveprojecttofindsimilarprojectsand

1 INTRODUCTION
Context-awarerecommendersystems(CARS)aredesignedforvari-
ousreal-lifeapplicationdomains.ThepurposeofCARSistogener-
ate more relevant recommendations by adapting them to a specific
contextual situation of a user [ 4]. A context encapsulates the char-
acteristicsofauser’staskorthe goalsof auser[ 27].
Various areas of software engineering make use of context to
improveadeveloper’sexperience.Forcoderecommendation,the
context of a developer can be leveraged to provide better personal-
izedcoderecommendations.Existingcontext-awarecoderecom-
mendationsystemshavebeenshowntosupportdevelopersincode
completion[ 5,7,8,10,16,18ś24,26,31ś33,35]andcodereuse[ 11ś
13,16,17,28,30,34,36].However,therearecurrentlynoexisting
context-aware systems that can provide code recommendations of
multiple related features for opportunistic reuse. Code recommen-
dationsystemscan facilitate opportunisticreuse [14]byproviding
code that represents features a developer may want to implement
next [1ś3]. Opportunistic reuse enables rapid application devel-
opment without the need to conduct multiple searches and thus
enhancesdeveloper productivityandsaves time [ 2,6,9,14].
For example, if Alice is developing a music application, one
of the features her application must support is playing a given
mediafile.Thus,Alicemightsearchforłplaymediafile"anduse
the returned code snippet in her code. Alice might then need to
implementłpausemediafile",łgetcurrenttrackprogress",łcheckif
mediaplaying",andłhandletouchevent"features.Currently,FeaRS
[32]canrecommendthenextmethodthatthedeveloperislikelyto
implementbasedonasequenceofmethodswrittenbythedeveloper.
The recommendations are based on mining commit histories of
thousandsof projects.Ontheother hand,the Feature-driven API
usage-based CodeExamplesRecommender(FACER)systemcan

In this paper, we present a novel context-aware API-based code
recommendation tool (CA-FACER) for Intellij IDEA that recom-
mendsmethodbodiesthatarerelevantforreuseinanactiveproject
of a developer. The main idea of CA-FACER is to use contextual
datafromadeveloper’sactiveprojectfiletofindsimilarprojects

andrecommendcodefrompopularfeaturesofthoseprojectsusing
collaborativefiltering.Afterminingadatasetofrawsourcecode,
we cluster similar functionalities based on similar API usages into
APIusage-basedMethodCloneClasses.Wethenidentifycontextual
datafromuser’smethodsbymappingthemtothosecloneclasses.
CA-FACER uses a hybrid contextual modeling approach which
includes a combination of pre-filtering, feature popularity-based
recommendation, and finally post-filtering. From our experimental
evaluationon120AndroidJavaprojects from GitHub,we observe
a 46% improvement of precision using our proposed context-aware
approach over FACER. The precision of recommendations is calcu-
latedasthefractionofrecommendedmethodsthatbelongtothe
setofgroundtruthmethods.Ourtechniquerecommendsrelated
code examples with an average precision (P@5) of 94% and 83%
and asuccess rateof90%and 95% forinitial andevolved contexts
respectively.
2 OVERVIEW OFAPPROACH
Consider a user uworking on a project 𝑃𝑢with the aim of im-
plementing a set of features 𝐹={𝑓1,....,𝑓𝑛}for the project. Let
useruinput a query to a code search system 𝑆which returns a set
ofmatchingmethods 𝑀={𝑚1,....,𝑚𝑛}fromacoderepository 𝑅.
The methods that are part ofthe project 𝑃𝑢form the user’s active
developmentcontext 𝐶.
Givenauser’sactivedevelopmentcontext 𝐶andacoderepos-
itory𝑅, the aim of our system is to recommend a set of methods
𝑀𝑟𝑒𝑐={𝑚𝑟𝑒𝑐
1,..,𝑚𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑛}from𝑅which are likely to be an imple-
mentationforthesetoffeatures 𝐹suchthat 𝑚𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑥↦→𝑓𝑥where↦→
denotes that the implementation of some method 𝑚𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑥maps to
somedesiredfeature 𝑓𝑥∈𝐹.
2.1 User Context Identification
To take the context of a user into account, we determine a map-
ping of the user methods 𝑀𝑢to a set of clone classes 𝑀𝐶𝐶𝑢=
{𝜁𝑢
1,....,𝜁𝑢𝑛}mined as features in 𝑅such that 𝑚𝑢𝑥↦→𝜁𝑢𝑥, where
↦→denotesthatausermethod 𝑚𝑢𝑥mapstoaMethodCloneClass
𝜁𝑢𝑥∈𝑀𝐶𝐶𝑢. This is accomplished by searching for a method simi-
lartoeachusermethodfromthecoderepository.Weparseauser’s
active code file and create a search query out of each user method
and invoke FACER’s search engine to retrieve the top matching
method with API usages. A user method is assigned the Method
Clone Class identifier of the corresponding searched method. It
may bepossible thatamethodintheuser’scontextdoesnot map
to any existing method clone class in the repository, and such a
methoddoes not getincludedinthe user’scontext.
2.2 Getting FeatureRecommendations from
Contextually Similar Projects
After identifying the contextual features 𝐶of the user’s project,
wefilterouttheprojectsinthecoderepositorycontainingthose
features as contextually similar projects 𝑃𝑐. We use their feature
profilestomakepredictionsabouttheexistenceofotherrelevant
features inthe user’sproject.
We calculatethesimilarity oftheuser’s projectand eachofthe
projects𝑃𝑐andselectthetop10mostsimilarprojectsasneighbors
of the user’s project. We compute the cosine similarity of user’sproject𝑃𝑢witheachprojectin 𝑃𝑐as showninEquation 1:
𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑃𝑢,𝑝)=|𝐹𝑐∩𝐹𝑝|√︁
|𝐹𝑐| · |𝐹𝑝|(1)
where𝐹𝑝denotes the set of features or Method Clone Classes of
project𝑝in in𝑃𝑐and𝐹𝑐denotes the set of features or Method
Clone Classesofthe usercontext.
Afterfindingcontextuallysimilarprojects,werecommendthe
popular features identified asthe frequentlyoccurringAPI usage-
based Method Clone Classes across the projects. The prediction

where𝑛∈𝑛𝑏𝑟(𝑝)represents a neighbor of 𝑃𝑢, and𝜅(𝑛,𝜁)is a

2.3 Recommending RepresentativeMethods
WegetthetopNfeaturesandobtainrepresentativemethodsagainst
eachMethodCloneClasstorecommendasetoftopNmethods.The
representative method is chosen as the method with the highest
API calldensity.
3 FUNCTIONALITYAND UI
We design and implement CA-FACER as a plugin for the Intel-
lijIDEforJavadevelopers.CA-FACERprovidesrelevantmethod
recommendations intwostages.
•Stage1-Methodsearchagainstquery: Adevelopercansearch
for methods against an input query string. The query string
canbeaJavacomment,freetextorJavacodesnippet.The
developer may choose to reuse and include the searched
methodinthe currently active code file.
•Stage 2-Related method recommendations: A developer can
invoke CA-FACER to parse the context and get methods
related to the methods that are written or reused by the
developer in their currently active code file. The methods
recommendedinStage2implementdifferentfeaturesthat
may be related to a developer’s code file being edited and
thus are potentialreuse candidates.
3.1 InstallationandSetup
To setup and install CA-FACER, a developer needs to download
the CA-FACER plugin and a resources folder available online1. The
usercanfollowtheinstructionsintheREADMEfiletocomplete
the setupandinstallation.

4.1 EvaluationMethodology
We adopt an off-line automated evaluation methodology. To test
the precision of recommendations, we need to simulate a user
development context for input to our system and then we want to
comparetherecommendationsagainstagroundtruth.Wetakea
setof 20feature queries.For eachquery,we getasetofmatching
methods from FACER’s Stage 1 code search. We select a method
𝑚𝑟that bestimplementsthe desired feature and selectthe project
to which itbelongs as atest project for our evaluation setup.This
way,weacquireasetof20testprojectspertainingto20methods
selected against20 featurequeries.Thetwentyqueriesare shown
inTable1.
Fromeachtestproject,wesimulateausercontext( 𝐶)andground
truth(𝐺)bysplittingmethodsimplementingfeaturesofaproject
into two parts. We test four context configurations to simulate
both early and evolved development stages. For context 𝐶1, we
take the selected method ( 𝑚𝑟) and all those methods that belong
to the same file to simulate the user-written methods 𝑚𝑢. Then,
we take the feature class identifiers for the selected method and
the simulated user methods to define 𝐶1. The ground truth ( 𝐺1)
corresponding to this context configuration consists of all methods
implementingfeaturesofatestprojectexceptthesetofmethods
𝑚𝑢. We define context configuration 𝐶2to represent an evolved
development stage where almost half of the features of a project
2https://github.com/shamsa-abid/CA-FACER_Replicationare already implemented. For 𝐶2, we use one half of features as the
contextandthe otherhalfas the ground truth 𝐺2.
Foreachofthe20testprojects,weassumethatwehaveanex-
istingusercontext( C)andamethod 𝑚𝑟wasrecentlyselectedfor
reusebytheuser.Ourcontext-awaresystemthengeneratesaset
ofrelatedmethodrecommendationsagainsttheuser’scontext 𝐶
and the selected method 𝑚𝑟. Since the test project comes from the
repository, we are aware of the feature class labels of the methods
formingtheusercontext.Therefore,wedonotneedtoexplicitly
performthecontextidentificationphaseofCA-FACER.Thefeature
class label 𝜁𝑟of𝑚𝑟and feature class labels of other user context
methods𝜁𝑢

latedmethodrecommendations.Foragivenquery,CA-FACERalso
takes into consideration recommendations generated by FACER
andreturns anintersectionsetofrecommendationsforimproved
precision.
4.2Evaluation Results of Context-aware FACER
For baseline FACER, under context 𝐶1and ground truth 𝐺1the
P@5is0.58,whereasweobservethatP@5ishigherwith0.94for
CA-FACER.CA-FACERisabletoprovidepreciserecommendations

assertsthatthemediansoftheprecisionvaluesforbaselineFACER
andCA-FACERareidentical.Weobtainp-values P<.001,P=.002𝐶1
and𝐶2respectively, which are all less than the significance level
alpha = 0.05. This means that we can reject the null hypothesis,
and accordingly we can conclude that the performance of CA-
FACERissignificantlybetterthanbaselineFACERwithoutcontext-
awareness. Thus, we can say that our proposed CA-FACER does
indeed improve the performance of baseline FACER by a minimum
of 36%and amaximumof46%formakingcontext-sensitive related
methodrecommendations.
5 THREATS TO VALIDITY
Theuseofasimulateddevelopmentcontextisathreattoconstruct
validity. To reduce this threat, we create a development context
from an actual project’s file. Currently, we use only 120 projects
from different categories which we download from GitHub instead
of an organization’s source code. We believe that our approach
can be easily generalized to an actual organization setting where a
localcoderepositoryexists.WehavealsoevaluatedCA-FACERona
largercollectionof1,114Intellijpluginprojectsthatwedownloaded
fromGitHub. Ourinternal experimentsindicatethat ourtechnique
scaleswell.
