in testing RESTful APIs is the need for correct sequences of API

1 INTRODUCTION
Representational state transfer (REST) has become a de-facto stan-
dardforWebserviceinteractionssinceitwasintroducedin2000[ 21].
Web-based APIs which follow this standard are called RESTful
APIsandthewebservicesprovidingtheRESTfulAPIsarecalled
RESTful services. Nowadays, most web service providers, such as
Google[26],Twitter[ 27]andAmazon[ 25],exposeRESTfulAPIsto
grant access to other applications or services. As the RESTful APIs
gain popularity, techniques for automatically testing them become
important. Based on whether the knowledge of the program inter-
nalsisneededornot,thesetestingtechniquescanbecategorizedas

API testing techniques.
OneofthemostchallengingproblemsintestingRESTfulAPIs
is how to infer the correct sequences of calling the API operations
(aka,call sequences ) where each API operation can be one of the
four basictypes — create, read,update, and delete(CRUD). This is
becauseRESTful APIsareoften organizedsparselyto encapsulate
different micro services and fulfilling a single task can involve a
chain of API calls. Take the Petstore service [ 39] as an example,
it is a RESTful service for selling and ordering pets. In Petstore,
before calling the API to order a pet, APIs for creating the pet and
updating its status as “available” must be invoked. Skipping any of

theprerequisite APIswillcause theorderingpet operationtofail,
preventing the coverage of deeper logic in the code. To address the
challengeofgeneratingproperAPIcallsequences,researchershave
proposedseveraltestingtechniques[ 11,20,47]whichcaninferthe
dependenciesbetweenRESTfulAPIstoguidethetestgeneration.
For the purpose of API dependency inference, these techniques
leverage API specifications such as OpenAPI [ 38], RAML [ 41] and
APIBlueprint[ 6].AmongtheseAPIspecifications,OpenAPI(aka,
Swagger) is becoming increasingly popular and gets adopted by
major IT companies (e.g., Google, Microsoft, and IBM).
Two most recent state-of-the-artblackbox RESTful API testing
techniques — Restler [ 11] and Resttestgen [ 47] use the Ope-
nAPI specifications of the target RESTful services to facilitate their
call sequence generation. On the one hand, both of them learn the
producer-consumer dependencies1between the APIs to enforce
the correct ordering of APIs in the generated call sequences. On
the other hand, the difference between Restler and Resttestgen
lies in how they utilize the learnt dependencies: For Restler, it
usesabottom-up approach,whichstartswithtestingsingleAPIs
andthenextendstheAPIcallsequencesbyheuristicallyappending
API calls. Although Restler can limit the search space with dy-
namicfeedbacks(i.e.,ifcertaincombinationofAPIsfailstoexecute,
Restler avoids this pattern in the future), the search space forextending the test sequences is still very large due to the lack of
overall awarenessof how theAPIs are connected. To gainsuch
awareness, Resttestgen proposes a top-down approach to con-
necttheAPIsintoan OperationDependencyGraph (ODG),where
APIs are nodes and their dependencies are edges. With the ODG
built,Resttestgencanthentraverseitandaggregatethevisited
APInodestogeneratecallsequences.Inthissense,Resttestgen
can generate valid call sequences mor e efficiently. Howev er, the
qualityofthetestsgeneratedbyResttestgenmightbehindered
since it heavily depends on the ODG, which may not reflect the
API behavior correctly due to some pitfalls (e.g., poorly written
OpenAPIspecifications).Inshort,boththe bottom-up andtop-down
approaches have strengths and weaknesses, leaving the generation
of proper API call sequences an under-researched field.
In this paper, we propose Morest – a blackbox RESTful API
testing technique with a dynamically updating RESTful-service
Property Graph (RPG). The workflow of Morest contains two ma-
jor procedures:building the RPG withthe OpenAPI specifications
of the target RESTful service and the model-based testing with
dynamic updates of the RPG. The RPG is a novel representation of
RESTful services proposed in this paper which encodes API andobject schema information in the form of a mixed, edge-labeled,
attributed multigraph. Comparedto ODG,RPGcan modelnotonly
the producer-consumer dependencies between APIs with more de-
tails but also the property equivalence relations between schemas,
which allows RPG to both describe more behaviors of the REST-
fulservicesandflexiblyupdateitselfwithexecutionfeedback.By
traversingtheRPG,MorestcanaggregatethevisitedAPIstobuild
meaningful call sequences. During the testing process, Morestconstantly collect the responses of the RESTful service and use

2.1 Background
RESTfulAPI. TheREpresentationalStateTransfer(REST)archi-
tecture is is first proposed by Roy Fielding in 2000 [ 21] .AW e b
API using the REST architecture is called a RESTful API. A Web
service providing RESTful APIs is called a RESTful service. One of
the fundamental constraints of REST architectural style is Uniform
Interface,whichregulatestheCRUDoperationsontheresources.
In modern Web API design practice, RESTful APIs often use HTTP
protocol as the transportation layer. Therefore, the CRUD opera-
tions of RESTful APIs can be mapped to the HTTP methods POST,
GET, PUT and DELETE respectively.
OpenAPI Specification. OpenAPI (previously known as Swag-
ger) defines a standard for describing RESTful APIs [ 38] and an
APIdocumentfollowingthisstandardiscalledanOpenAPIspec-
ification. OpenAPI specifications contain the information of the
objectschemasas well as the API endpoints, including but not lim-
ited to the available CRUD operations, input parameters as well as

schema. Fig. 2 shows the OpenAPI specifications of the schemas.
Operation DependencyGraph In Resttestgen, Viglianisi et al.
propose to use Operation Dependency Graph (ODG) to model data
dependencies among operations which can be inferred from the
OpenAPIspecifications[ 47].ThebenefitofusingODGisthataggre-
gating operations by traversing the ODG can generate meaningful
call sequences. The ODG is a graph 𝐺=(𝑉,𝐸)where𝑉is a set
of nodes and 𝐸is a set of directed edges. For each node 𝑣∈𝑉,𝑣
corresponds to a unique operation in the OpenAPI specification.
The graph is said to contain a directed edge 𝑒where𝑒=(𝑣2,𝑣1)
for𝑣1,𝑣2∈𝑉and𝑣1≠𝑣2, if and only if (iff) there exists a common
fieldin the response of 𝑣1and in the request parameter of 𝑣2.T w o
fields are commonwhen they have the same name if they are of
atomic type (e.g., string or numeric) or when they are related to
the same schema if they are of a non-atomic type. Thus, following
this definition, 𝑣2→𝑣1means𝑣2depends on 𝑣1.
2.2 Running Example
Here we introduce a running example extractedfrom the Petstore
service [39], which can demonstrate the limitations of existing
approaches and aid in the explanation of Morest’s strategies in
Section3.Fig.1and2illustratetheOpenAPIspecificationsofthe
Petstore service. The question is, given these specifications, how
to generate meaningful API call sequences. For this purpose, weneed to infer the dependencies among the APIs. Intuitively, the
definition of API dependencies in ODG (§ 2.1) can be applied here
(bothRestler[ 11]andResttestgen[ 47]followthisdefinition).
For the example in Fig. 1, we can get the following dependencies:
(1)findPetsByStatus →getPetById
(2)findPetsByStatus →getOrderById
(3)addPet→findPetsByStatus(4)addPet→getPetById
(5)getPetById →getOrderById
(6)placeOrder →getOrderById
Note that some of the dependencies are infeasible: One example
isindependency2where findPetsByStatus shouldnotdependon
thestatusoftheOrderobjectreturnedby getOrderById because
the status of a pet and the status of an order are not the same. An-
otherexampleisindependency4where addPetshouldnotdepend
ongetPetById althoughbothofthemusethePetschema.While
thereareinfeasibledependencies,theycannotbesafelyfilteredout
as yet because the current ODG model lacks the ability to describe
therelationbetweenanAPIandaschemaindetailanddynamic
execution feedbacks are needed to infer correct dependencies.
After the dependencies are acquired, we can then use them to
guide the call sequence generation. To start with, we can use a
bottom-up approachbytestingsingleAPIsfirstandthenextendthe
test sequences by appending more APIs one at a time. For example,
we can start with a new sequence: <getOrderById> . After a suc-
cessfulcallof getOrderById ,wecanfeedthe petIdofthereturned
Orderobjectto getPetById accordingtodependency5.Thenthe
sequence becomes <getOrderById, getPetById> . Similarly, we
can append findPetsByStatus to the sequence according to de-
pendency1andsoon.Inthisprocess,wecanidentifytheinfeasible
dependencies and avoid using them in the future. For instance, we
can tell dependency 4 is faulty because if we try to append addPet
to<getOrderById, getPetById> according to dependency 4, the
addPetoperationwill alwaysfailsincetheservicerefusestocreate

with each other. For example, it is hard to conduct Depth-First-
Search (DFS) when extending a sequence because the potential
lengthofthesequenceisunknownandifitisverylong,theriskof
getting stuck in a local optimal is high.
Alternatively, we can use ODG to facilitate the generation of
callsequences,whichisa top-down approach.Thecallsequences
canbegeneratedbytraversingtheODGandchainingthevisited
operations. Compared with the bottom-up approach, with ODG,
we can quickly generate call sequences without trial and error.
However,becausesomeextracteddependencies(suchas2and4)
might be infeasible, the quality of the generated call sequences
can be affected. In other words, the top-down approach lacks the
flexibility of dynamically fixing the call sequences.
In summary, both the bottom-up andtop-down approach have
theirownstrengthsandweaknessesandtheycancomplementeach
other. Therefore, a new model is needed to both provide high level
guidance and perform self-updates. Following this observation,
we propose Morest, which leverages RESTful-service Property
Graph (RPG) to adopt the advantages of both approaches while
circumventing their disadvantages.
3 METHODOLOGY
Fig.3showsthedetailedworkflowof Morest.TotestaRESTful
service,MorestfirsttakesitsOpenAPIspecificationsasinputto
build the RPG — a novel representation of the relations amongRESTful APIs and the schemas (§ 3.1). After building the initialRPG, Morest uses it to generate call sequences and replace the
API calls in the call sequences with actual requests (§ 3.2). Then
thegeneratedtestcasesarefedtothetargetRESTfulserviceand
Morest shall collect the responses. By analyzing the collectedresponses,Morestreportsthedetectedfailuresforbuganalysis.Moreover, Morest also uses the responses to refine the RPG byadding missing edges and removing infeasible edges (§ 3.3). The
refined RPG is then used for generating more test sequences. This
marks the end of one iteration and Morest will keep testing the
target RESTful service and refining the RPG until the time budgetis reached.
3.1 Initial RPG Building
InMorest,weproposetheconceptofRPGtoencodetheCRUD
relations of operations, the relations of the schemas, and the data-
flowamongtheschemasandoperations.ThedesignofRPGisbasedon the concept of property graph [42]. The definition of property
graphis as follows:
Definition1(PropertyGraph). Apropertygraphisadirected,
edge-labeled, attributed multigraph 𝐺=(𝑉,𝐸,𝜆,𝜇)where𝑉is a set
of nodes (or vertices), 𝐸is a set of directed edges, 𝜆:𝐸→Σis an
edge labeling function assigning a label from the alphabet Σto each
edge and 𝜇:(𝑉∪𝐸)×𝐾→𝑆is a function assigning key(from
K)-value(from S) pairs of properties to the edges and nodes.
Giventhedefinitionof propertygraph,RPGisdefinedasfollows:
Definition 2 (RESTful-service Property Graph). A RPG is a
mixed,edge-labeled, attributed multigraph 𝐺=(𝑉,𝐸,𝜆,𝜇)with:
•𝑉=𝑉𝑠𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚𝑎∪𝑉𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛

Note that RPG is not exactly a property graph because it is a

Design & Rationale. Here we explain the details and rationale
for the design of RPG. The usage of 𝑉𝑠𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚𝑎and𝑉𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
arestraightforward,weneedthemtorepresenttheschemasand
operations. Asforedges,theedgesin 𝐸𝑜𝑠and𝐸𝑠𝑜aredirectedto
represent whether an operation produces or consumes an object of
aschema.Forexample,theedge 𝑒𝑜1𝑠1=(𝑜1,𝑠1)meansoperation
𝑜1returns an object of schema 𝑠1as its response. Correspondingly,
theedge𝑒𝑠1𝑜1=(𝑠1,𝑜1)meansoperation 𝑜1requiresanobjector
at least one property of the object of schema 𝑠1in its parameter(s).
Theedgesin 𝐸𝑠𝑠representtheequivalencerelationbetweentwo
properties from two different schemas. In the running example,the property
idin the Pet schema is referring to the same thing

as the property petIdin the Order schema. We denote the edge
connecting these two schemas as 𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑡𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟={𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑡,𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟}. The
edgesin𝐸𝑜𝑜areused toconnect twooperationsif theyare under
the same API endpoint. In the running example, the operation
getOrderById and the operation deleteOrder are connected by
this type of edge. Only the edges in 𝐸𝑠𝑜and𝐸𝑠𝑠are labeled by
functions in 𝜆. The labels for 𝐸𝑠𝑜are vectors of property names
showingwhichexactpropertiesofaschemaareusedasparameters
for an operation. Note that the empty vectors are ignored in Fig. 4.
The labels for 𝐸𝑠𝑠are vectors of tuples, where each tuple is pair of
properties with equivalence relations from two different schemas.
The edges in 𝐸𝑜𝑜requires no labelling since they can only indicate
two operations belong to the same API endpoint. The labelling for
𝐸𝑜𝑠is ignored for two reasons. First, labelling edges is an error-
proneprocess,especiallywhentheOpenAPIspecificationispoorly
written,themoreedgeswelabel,themoreerrorswemayintroduce.
Second, comparing with the edges in 𝐸𝑠𝑜, the edges in 𝐸𝑜𝑠are less
important for successfully requestingAPI operations because the
former ones directly affect the input parameters of the operations.
Naturally, the functions to assign properties to the nodes ( 𝜇)
correspondtotheprocessofparsingtheOpenAPIspecificationand
extracting data from it.

RPG vs ODG. Here we compare the RPG model with the ODG
model.ThefirstdifferenceisthatODGhasonlytheoperationnodes
and their producer-consumer dependencies as edges while RPG
hasmoretypesofnodesandedges.Theseconddifferenceisthat
RPG allows nodes and edges to have properties and labels. Both
of the differences indicate that RPG can describe more details of
theRESTfulservices.TheadditionaldetailscapturedbyRPGcan
help to generate longer call sequences and provide the informationneededfordynamicself-updating.Forexample,fortheRPGshown
in Fig. 4b, the connection between the PetandOrderschemas
indicates that Order.petId refers to the same thing as Pet.id.
Withthisinformation,wecaninferthatthe Order.petId canbe
usedtoquery getPetById andthereforegeneratethecallsequence
(placeOrder ,getPetById ,findPetsByStatus ),whichcannotbe
generated only with the dependencies between operations in an
ODG.
3.2 Test Case Generation

In general, this requires two steps: first, Morest traverses the RPG
andaggregatesvisitedoperationstoformcallsequences(CallSe-
quence Generation ); second, Morest generates concrete inputs for
the APIs in the sequences to build test cases (Operation Parameter
Generation ).
Call Sequence Generation. Algo. 1 shows how Morest gener-

for the same schema, any of the read, update or delete operation

(line 22). After that, if the current schema node is connected to
another schema node which has not been visited in the current
iteration (line 19), we will visit that schema and repeat the same
processuntilwerunoutofschemanodes.Notethateachschema
node is visited only once per iteration to avoid infinite loops.
In the running example, with the RPG in Fig. 4b, assume we are
nowvisitingthe Petnodeandthe Ordernodeisnotvisitedyet.For
thePetnode,its𝑂𝑜𝑢𝑡is{addPet,getPetById ,findPetsByStatus }
and its𝑂𝑖𝑛is {getPetById ,findPetsByStatus }. The Cartesian
product of 𝑂𝑜𝑢𝑡and𝑂𝑖𝑛can generate six new call sequences in-
cluding(getPetById ,findPetsByStatus )etc.(line16).Sincewe
donothaveanyexistingcallsequencessofar,wedonotneedto
performcallsequenceconcatenation(line17).Then,becausethe
Ordernodeisconnectedtothe Petnodeandithasnotbeenvisited,
wewillvisititandgeneratenewcallsequencessimilarly(line19).
One of the newly generated call sequences for the Ordernode is
(placeOrder ,getPetById ) (line 16). Now, since we already have
generated some sequences when we visit the Petnode, we can
trytoconcatenatethemwiththenewlygeneratedcallsequences
for theOrdernode (line 17). In this example, we can generate
the call sequence ( placeOrder ,getPetById ,findPetsByStatus ).
This demonstrates how Morest generates call sequences.Notethat,insomecases,therearestandaloneoperationsthatare
not connected to any schemas. For clarity, we omit handling these
cases in the algorithm. But in our implementation, the standaloneoperations are included as single-element call sequences.
OperationParameterGeneration.
Thegeneratedcallsequences
cannot be used directly for testing since they are just sequences of
operations without concrete parameter values. For a given oper-
ation, if its input parameters are notfrom the responses of other
operations on the same test sequences, they are decided as follows:
iftheoperationhasbeencalledcorrectlybefore,Morestassigns
a high chance of using the parameters of the last successful run,
elseiftheOpenAPIspecificationshavespecifiedthevalidrangesof
valuesfortheoperation,Moresthasahighchanceofselectingval-
ues from the valid ranges, otherwise, Morest will just use random
values. Given an object schema, MOREST recursively traverses the
schema to generate values for the object attributes according to
theirparametertypes.Iftheparameterisofabasictype(e.g.,string
and int), we will concretize the value accordingly. If the parameter
is an object or a list, we will jump in and recursively deduce the
basic parameter type.
An important detail worth discussing is that the parameters for
asequenceofoperationsisnotgeneratedallatonce.Instead,theseparametersaregeneratedonthefly.Becauseiftheinputparameter
foranoperationisbasedontheresponseofapreviousoperation,
we will need to wait for the previous operation to finish execution
to get the needed parameter values.
3.3 Dynamic RPG Updating
Theinitial RPGgenerated withtheOpenAPI specifications may
containerrors.Forexample,theredlinesinFig.4aareinfeasible
edges, and the dashed lines in Fig. 4b are the missing edges for the
initialRPG.Thisisoftenduetoambiguitiesinthespecifications.For
example,althoughahumancanquicklyrecognizethatthe petId
property of Orderrefers to the same thing as the idproperty of
Pet,itishardtouserulesandheuristicstoreconstructthisrelation.
Toaddressthisproblem,MorestdynamicallyfixestheRPGwith
execution feedback.
EdgeAddition InMorest,newedgesareaddedtoaRPGinthree
scenarios: The most straightforward case is where the response
value of an API aligns with a certain schema but it is not docu-
mented in the specification. For example, in Fig. 1, the response of
theaddPetoperation is not documented. However, after addPetis
correctedduringthetesting,itwillrespondwiththenewlycreated
Petobject. Morest will notice that the properties of the object re-
turned by addPetmatches the properties in the Petschema. Then
Morest can add the edge ( addPet,Pet) into𝐸𝑜𝑠.The edges of
𝐸𝑠𝑠are added after the collection of execution feedback. For two
schema nodes 𝑠1and𝑠2if both of them are related to an operation
node𝑜, Morest makes the assumption that 𝑠1and𝑠2share at least
onepropertyincommonbutMorestcannotdecidewhichproperty
is shared in the RPG building stage. During the execution of the
test cases, Morest may encounter some sequences involving both
the objects of 𝑠1and the objects of 𝑠2. With the responses of these
sequences, Morest can compare the concrete values of properties
between the two types of objects. As far as the value of a property
fromanobjectof 𝑠1canmatchthevalueofmultiplepropertiesfrom

nect with getPetById (Fig. 4a). Morest can generate multiple test
cases with the sequence of ( getOrderById ,getPetById ). Suppose
these test cases yield the following two pairs of orders and pets:
({id: 1, petId: 1, status: "succ"}, {id: 1, name: "cat",
status: "sold"} ) and ({id: 2, petId: 4, status: "succ"},
{id: 4, name: "dog", status: "sold"} ). After the generation
of the first pair of order and pet, Morest cannot infer the relation
since the idof the pet equals to both idandpetIdof the order.
Morest can only infer that Pet.idis equal to either Order.id
orOrder.petId .Nevertheless,afterthesecondpairisgenerated,
Morest candraw theconclusion of Pet.idequalsto Order.petId.

4 IMPLEMENTATION & EVALUATION
WehaveimplementedMorestbasedonPython3.9.0with11,659
lines of code and conducted experiments to evaluate the perfor-
mance of Morest. We aim to answer the following research ques-
tions with the evaluation:
RQ1 (Coverage) How is the code coverage and operation explo-
ration capability of Morest?RQ2(BugDetection)
Howisthebugdetectioncapabilityof Mor-
est?RQ3 (AblationStudy)
HowdoRPGguidanceanddynamicRPG
updating affect the performance of Morest separately?4.1 Experiment Setup
Evaluation Datasets. We built the evaluation benchmark with
sixopensourceRESTfulservicesshowninTable1.Inthisbench-
mark, four services were selected from the Evomaster Benchmark
(EMB)[7]3.Inaddition,Petstore(theofficialdemoofOpenAPIspec-
ification)andBitbucket(apopularonlineversioncontrolsystem
with complicated business scenarios) were also included.
From Table 1, we can see that the target RESTful services are
diverseinsizes,featuresandareimplementedwithdifferentpro-
gramming languages. Bitbucket is not strictly open source since it
isacommercialproduct.However,wehaveaccesstoitsreleased
.jar file to collect line coverage and conduct detailed bug analysis.
EvaluationBaselines. Weusethreestate-of-the-artblackboxREST-
fulservicetestingtechniquesasbaselinestostudytheperformance
of Morest.(1)Evomaster-bb
: Evomaster [ 7] is a search-based whitebox
technique. In our evaluation, we disabled its code instrumenta-
tion(onlyworksforJavaprograms)anddatabasemonitoring
modulestoturnitintoblackbox mode (namedas Evomaster-
bb). It uses various heuristics to generate call sequences ac-
cording to the OpenAPI specifications. Thus, Evomaster-bb
represents the heuristic-based approach.
(2)Resttestgen : Resttestgen [ 47] is a blackbox technique
whichgeneratesOperationDependencyGraphs(ODGs)from
OpenAPIspecificationstoguidethecallsequencegeneration.
Resttestgen represents the top-down approach.
(3)Restler : Restler is a blackbox technique which build call
sequences by appending new API operations according to exe-
cution feedback. Restler represents the bottom-up approach.
Evaluation Criteria. We use three criteria to evaluate Morest
and the baselines.
(1)Code Coverage : Code coverage can reflect the exploration
capability of the techniques. In the experiments, we use line
coveragesinceitisthefinestgranularitywecangetwithour
current tools (PHPCoverage [ 5] for PHP, CoverBand [ 1] for
Ruby and JaCoCo [2] for Java).
(2)Successfully Requested Operations : In HTTP, responses
with status code 2xx are successful responses [ 37]. We use
the number of successfully requested operations (SROs) as a
criterion because it can reflect whether a technique can gen-erate valid requests to test deeper code logic of the RESTful
serviceandvalidrequestsarepartiallytheresultsofcorrectcall
sequences.
(3)Bugs:Thegoaloftestingistoexposebugs,sothenumberof
detectedbugsisanecessarycriterion.InthecontextofRESTful
service, a failureis considered to happen when an operation
returns5xxstatuscodeanda bugcanberelatedtomanyfailures.
We manually classified the failures into unique bugs in the
experiments according to response bodies, server logs, etc.
Evaluation Settings. For the open source RESTful services, we
hosted them on a local machine and ran each technique with three
time budgets — 1, 4 and 8 hour(s). The purpose is to evaluate how
the performance of these techniques change over time. To the best

paper.

of our knowledge, the time budget of 8 hours is the longest time
budget used in RESTful service testing research. After each round,
we tear down and restore the environment (e.g., docker containers,
self-hosted virtual machines) to guarantee the consistence of all
RESTful services. In addition, we repeated all experiments for 5times to mitigate randomness and applied Mann-Whitney U test
andˆ𝐴12[3,46] calculation for statistical tests. Thus, we conducted
a total number of 1,440, i.e., 6 projects * 6 settings * 8 (hour time
budget for one round)*5r e p etitions, CPU hours of experiments.
4.2 Coverage (RQ1)
To comprehensively compare different approaches, Evomaster-
bb, Resttestgen, and Restler are directly adopted from the prior
work[7,11,47].Besides,toavoidthesideeffectofserviceundertest,
we wrap six evaluation subjects into docker image [ 19] and restore
the corresponding image after each round. Table 2 presents the
statistical results of five runs. As suggested by the prior work [ 28],
the Mann-Whitney U test (with the confidence threshold 𝛼=0.05)
is adopted here. Overall, we summarize our findings as follows.
Fig. 5 and Table 2 depict that4Morest achieves competitive
performance regarding both code coverage and successfully re-
quested operations, significantly outperforming search-based, and
model-based approaches in 5/6 RESTful services (bold numbersin Table 2). Fig. 6a demonstrates unique successfully requestedoperations by each tool. We can figure out that Morest covers
themostoperationsbygeneratingvalidcallsequencesfollowing
producer-consumerdependencies.Therefore,existingexperimental
result demonstrates the exploration effectiveness of Morest re-
garding given coverage criteria (code coverage increased by 26.16%
- 103.24%, successfully requested operations improved by 152.66% -
232.45%). On the other hand, it presents the robustness of Morest
gained by RPG guidance and RPG updating fashion (experiment
results are statistically significant).
Further,weconductanin-depthanalysisofthegeneratedtestse-
quencesbyallapproachestofigureoutwhyallapproachesachieve
the same number of successfully requested operations. Taking the
LanguageTool as an example, we find that all approaches couldnot cover three operations getWords, addWord and deleteWord.
Two parameters, username andAPIKey), in those operations are
labeled as required parameters (i.e., username andAPIKeymust be
filled in each request when testing those operations). However, we
observe that the implementation of LanguageTool is different from
descriptionsintheOpenAPIspecification.Specifically,intheim-
plementation of LanguageTool, username andAPIKeycould not be
filledsimultaneously;otherwise,theserverbehavesunexpectedly
and throws 5xx responses. As a consequence, we could imply that
the gap betweenRESTful API specifications andactual implemen-
tation of RESTful service could affect the effectiveness of RESTful
API testing.
4.3 Bug Detection (RQ2)
Subsequently, we analyze the bug (defined in Section 4.1) discover-
ing the capability of each approach. Table 3 presents the statistical
results of the averaged bugs detection with running tools for 8

requested operations), for 1 hour and 4 hours, in our website [4].hours each round. Since one bug can be detected several timesduringtesting,weonlyrecordthenumberofuniquebugsforall
approaches. Overall, we summarize our findings as follows.
First,inthosebaselines,Evomaster-bb,Restler,andResttest-
genoutperformeachotherindifferentsubjects.Wemanuallyan-
alyze the test sequences generated by baseline and find that 
Restler could sufficiently explore all call sequences theoretically,
however, we have observed that massive invalid call sequences
make Restler inefficient; Evomaster-bb heuristically generates
redundantcallsequencestomakeitinefficient; Resttestgenis
trapped by infeasible call sequences generated from the operation
dependency graph, which limit its performance.
Besides,asshowninTable3,Morestdetectsthemostbugs(bold

on testing RESTful API services. Specifically, Fig. 6b indicates that
Morestcoulddetectunknown13bugs byexistingapproaches.It
not only shows the comparative performance in bug finding but
also the Morest’s robustness.
Similarly to Section 4.2, we manually perform a comprehen-

detail description in Section 4.2), all approaches get 5xx responses

fined by the string type while implemented by the integer type)in the LanguageTool’s specification. This indicates that RESTful

tween the RESTful API specifications and actual implementations.
Case Study. Two bugs, discovered by Morest, have been con-
firmed and fixed by the developers of BitBucket. We conduct acase study tofind out how Morest trigers thosebugs. Bitbucketis a Git-based source code repository hosting service owned by
Atlassian. Bitbucket Server [

limited by such cases. Thus, we can infer that the RPG guidance
and dynamic RPG updating can both boost the effectiveness of the
RESTful API testing process.
Besides,aswecanseefromFig.7, Morestachievesbetterper-
formance other approaches regarding both code coverage and bug

provecallsequencestoobtainhighercodecoverage,whichincreas-
ing the possibility to detect bugs.4.5 Threats To Validity
The first internal threat comes from the choices of configurable
optionsinthedesign.Currently,weempiricallysetthevaluesfor
theseoptionsandtheactualvaluesoftheoptionsusedintheex-periments can be found on our website [
4]. Although the choice
of configurable options can affect the performance of Morest, the
experimentresultscandemonstratethatatleastwiththecurrent
set of option values, Morest can outperform state-of-the-art tech-
niques. Therefore, we leave the fine-tuning of these options as
future work. Another internal threat is that the current RPG model
can only reflect the APIs documented in the OpenAPI specifica-
tions. For undocumented APIs, a possible solution is to infer their
related schemes in an online manner by analyzing the feedback of
the testing process.Another possiblesolution isto useclient-side
analysistechniques[ 31,32,49]togeneratetraffic betweenclients
and servers and analyze the traffic to infer the correct usage of the
undocumented APIs. We leave the support of undocumented APIs
as future work.
The external threats mainly come from the experiment settings.
The testing techniques evaluated in the experiments are random
by nature. To mitigate the random factors, we repeated each exper-
iment for fivetimes and conducted statisticaltests. Therefore, the
experimentresultsarestatisticallysound.Toaddressthegeneral-
ityconcern,wechoseadiversedatasetconsistingofsixRESTful
services with various sizes and features. Moreover, we chose open
source RESTful services so we can perform in-depth experiment
resultanalysesviascrutinizingthecodecoverageandclassifying
the detected failures into unique bugs. Last but not the least, to
improve the fairness for technique comparison, we gave each tech-
nique a generous timebudget of 8 hours while in[ 11] the longest
time budget is 5-hour and in [47] the time budget is 0.5-hour.
5 RELATED WORK
Instead of discussing all related works, we focus on the RESTfulservice testing techniques, SOAP service testing techniques and
model-based testing techniques.
Blackbox RESTful service testing techniques. Several black-
box techniques were proposed to generate meaningful call se-
quences.Resttestgen[ 47]buildsOperationDependency Graphs

vicesandcraftscallsequencesviagraphtraversal.Thequalityof

which starts with single operation call sequences and gradually
extend the call sequences by appending more operations after trial
and error. Comparing to these techniques, Morest can enjoy both
high-levelguidanceandtheflexibilityofdynamicadjustmentsto
achieve better performance.
Other than call sequence generation, some blackbox techniques
focus on improving the operation input parameter generation [ 22,
24,44]. These techniques utilize predefined inter-parameter con-
straints, input grammar, or mutators to generate diverse input
parametersforthetestcases.Inputparametergenerationisorthog-
onal to call sequence generation, we plan to adopt advanced input
parameter generation in the future.

isawhiteboxRESTfulservicetestingtechniquewhichinstruments
the target RESTful service and monitors its database to collect use-
fulexecutionfeedbackanddatatoguidetheevolutionaryalgorithm
based test case generation. Comparing to the the blackbox tech-
niques, on the one hand, Evomaster is more effective in testing
deeper logic inside the RESTful service since it can collect and use
more information about the target service to guide the test casegeneration. On the other hand, Evomaster can only instrument
Java/Scala/Kotlin based RESTful services and requires access to
the database, limiting its application to closed source projects or
projects implemented with other programming languages.
SOAPTestingTechniques SimpleObjectAccessProtocol(SOAP)
is a standards-based web service access protocol first proposed by
Microsoft. Some previous works focus on testing SOAP [ 18] based
web services [ 15–17]. Specifically, some of them use Web Services
DescriptionLanguage(WSDL)specificationstoguidethetesting
process [ 12,23,30,33,35,43]. Despite the similarities, REST is
proposedtoaddresstheshortcomingsofSOAPandisgainingmore
popularityinrecentyears[ 21].Thefundamentalserviceinteraction
modelsinRESTandSOAParedifferent.Therefore,testingRESTful
services requires different strategies.
Model-basedtestingtechniques. BesidesthetechniquesforREST-
fulAPIandSOAPservicetesting,model-basedtestingtechniques[ 13,
14,36,48,49] are also related to Morest. In general, these tech-
niques use models,say a finite-state machine[ 29], to describe the
system-under-testandgeneratetestsbycoveringdifferentstates
in the model [ 45]. In particular, Palulu [ 8] is a technique devel-
oped based on Randoop [ 40], which uses a call-sequence model
to quickly generate legal but behaviorally-diverse tests for Java
classes. Palulu’s intuition of using a model to guide the generation
of valid API call sequences is similar to Morest’s. However, the
difference is that the model used in Morest is tailored for RESTful
API and it is dynamically updated during testing.
6 CONCLUSION
Inthispaper,weproposeMorest—amodel-basedblackboxREST-
ful API testing technique. Morest learns from the OpenAPI speci-
ficationstobuildaRESTful-servicePropertyGraph(RPG),which
encodes both schema and API operation information. Morest can
useRPGtoprovidehighlevelguidanceforcallsequencegeneration
andcontinuouslyrefinetheRPGwithexecutionfeedback.Weeval-
uatedMoreston6opensourceRESTfulservicesandtheresults
showed that Morest can significantly outperform state-of-the-art
techniques in both coverage and bug detection.
