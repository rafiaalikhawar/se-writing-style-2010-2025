1 INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, Android plays a fundamental role in people’s daily
life with an 85% market share of smartphones [33]. Besides smart-
phones,otherdevicesrunningAndroidOScanbeseeneverywhere,
like smartwatches and smart TVs. Such success is largely credited
with the openness of Android, which allows vendors to build their
own customized ROM images for different devices based on AOSP
(Android Open Source Project) [4].
Ontheotherhand,theopennessofAndroidcomeswithrisks.
The large number of customized ROM images built by different
vendors make the Android ecosystem seriously fragmented [ 45],
whichisabigchallengetoguaranteethesecurityoftheAndroid
ecosystem. To vendors, the technical abilities and the attitudes
towards security result in the differential security of their ROMimages. For example, although Google releases security patchesto the security bulletins [
5] every month, many vendors did not
follow up the patches in time [ 29], even some vendors just change
the updated date without fixing vulnerabilities[ 55]. Also, the pre-
installedappsmayhavesecurityproblems.Itcouldbecausedby
thephonevendorsthemselves,likeThemes( CVE-2019-15442 )in

thesuppliers’apps,likeWfoService( CVE-2019-15378 )inaPana-

In recent years, many efforts have been taken to investigate and
improve the Android ecosystem security. For example, Elsabagh

correspondingunderstandingbehindthecurrentsecuritysituations.Infact,someresearchquestionscannotbesolvedwellwithoutlarge-

Ourwork. Inthiswork,wecarriedoutalarge-scalecomprehensive
security measurement of the security of Android firmware fromboth the system and pre-installed app levels. Also, we try to un-
cover the causes and influences behind the security risks. To guide
ourmeasurement, werefinefour importantresearchquestions on
Android firmware security, including:
Q1Do the Android phone vendors follow up the releasedAOSP security patches in time?
Regular security update
playsanessentialroleinprotectingmobiledevices.Android
partners (vendors) are notified of all vulnerability details at
least a month before the public disclosure, and they haveenough time window to update their firmware. However,
whetherthevendorsindeedfollowupthesecurityupdate
ofAOSPintimeisstillaquestion.Wearealsocuriousabout
the causes of the patch delay.
Q2Whether the patching claims of phone vendors are re-liable?
Though the phone has been updated to the latest
securitypatchlevel,there isstillnoguaranteethatthecor-
respondingvulnerabilitieshavebeenfixedbythevendorscompletely. It needs to answer whether the patch missing
issue is a widely existing security practice mistake. The fur-
ther question is why vendors missed some patches provided
by Google, say deliberately or technical issues.
Q3How many pre-installed apps containing unfixed vul-nerabilities (CVEs)?
In addition to the OS patch missing
issue mentioned by Q2, pre-installed apps also may have
known and unfixed vulnerabilities. That is, the ROM images
contain vulnerable apps with CVEs, which attackers will
quickly exploit.Apart from the detectionstatistics, we also
wanttoexplorethesourcesofthesevulnerablepre-installed
apps and the actual scope of influence.
Q4Whetherthe"non-vulnerable"pre-installedappsarese-cure?
Thesecurityrisksofpre-installedappsarenotlimited
toCVEs.Manycommonconfigurationmistakescanresultinseveresecurityissues,likeexportedcomponentsandcryp-
tographicmisuse.Weplantomeasuretheoverallsecurity
situations of pre-installed apps from multiple levels and ex-
plore whether these configuration mistakes can result in
practical security threats.
Toanswertheproposedquestionsandexplorethereasonsbe-
hindthem,webuiltalarge-scalefirmwaredataset, covering6,261
Android firmware images from 153 phone vendors with 443,475
pre-installed APK files (in all unpacked images). To the best of
our knowledge, itisthelargestAndroid firmwaredatasetever
used for security measurements . Also, apart from the Android
officiallyreleased411CVEs,wecollected191CVEsassociatedwithpre-installedapps.Inparticular,wedesignedanautomatedanalysis
framework, named AndScanner, to execute a series of targeted
measurements and primarily explorations. After massive data anal-
ysis and case studies, finally, we can answer the above researchquestions and provide new knowledge of the Android firmwareecosystem (with deep understandings) to the security practices
insoftwareengineering.Inthiswork,wehopetohelp consumers
learn more about the security knowledge of Android phones, such
asthetimelinessandefficacyofsecurityupdatesandwhetherthere
are security vulnerabilities in pre-installed applications. Therefore,
they can have security-relevant references when purchasing an
Android phone.

2 BACKGROUND AND METHODOLOGY
Inthissection,weprovidethenecessarybackgroundofAndroid
firmware and discuss the methodology of this work.
2.1 Android Firmware
To Android phones, firmware is the system software that provides
low-level control and makes the hardware work. Firmware is usu-
allystoredinparticulartypesofmemory,calledflashROM(Read
OnlyMemory)[ 48].Therefore,wesometimesrefertothefirmware
ofaphoneasROMorROMimage1.Typically,thefirmwareofan
Androidphonecontainsabootloader,Linuxkernel,Androidrun-
timeframework,radiofirmware,andvariouspre-installedapps[ 38].
1In this paper, we use “ROM images”, “ROM files”, and “firmware” interchangeably.

Authorized licensed use limited to: LAHORE UNIV OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCES. Downloaded on August 07,2025 at 08:26:40 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. Phone vendors may publicly provide the ROM images to facilitate
the users to flash their devices (factory reset or regular OS update).
Forexample,GooglereleasestheofficialROMimagesofNexusand
Pixel phones periodically [10, 11].
Formatandstructure. Thefirmwareisusuallyreleasedbyphone
vendors in a compression format, such as .zip. Sometimes, the
ROM files may be encrypted to prevent reverse engineering. After
unpacking a ROM file, in general, we can find several common
partition images, such as boot.img ,vendor.img ,recovery.img ,
andsystem.img [23].Theyservedifferentfunctionsforthedevice.
For example, boot.img contains a kernel image and a ramdisk
image for loading the device before the filesystem mount. Among
them, system.img isthemostimportantone,whichcontainsthe
Android framework. It provides the binary files and configuration
filesforrunningtheAndroidOS,suchassystemappsandlibraries.
Also, system.img belongstofilesystemimages,anditcanbeYaffs2
format or sparse image format [15].
Pre-installed apps. Thepre-installedappsaretheappsinstalled
intheAndroidfirmware.Theymaybethecoresystemcomponents
providedbyAndroidandthephonevendors,suchasPackageIn-
staller2forappinstallingandMiCloud3forXiaomicloudservice.
Third-party apps (e.g., Twitter) can also be pre-installed due to
commercial cooperation or other reasons. In general, pre-installed
system apps are put in the /system/app and/system/privapp
folders. Third-party apps are put in the /data/app folder.
Customization. Androidisanopen-sourceOSdesignedformobile
devices,andvendors tendtoconductthesecondarydevelopment
based on the source code of AOSP (Android Open Source Project),
that is, adding extra features and optimizations to their mobile
products. Dueto such a customizationprocess, the systemconfig-
urationsandpre-installedappsbecomequitediverseindifferent
Android phones (and the corresponding ROM images). Accord-
ing to the previous research [ 26,27,54,61], ROM customization
may bring new security risks due to the carelessness of developers
orevenmalwareinstalledonpurpose.Researchdetailsandmore
related work are reviewed in Section 6.Security update.
During system software developments, security
vulnerabilities cannot be avoided. On the other hand, the vendors
shouldfixthediscoveredvulnerabilitiesandprovidesecurityup-
datesforusersintime.Followingsuchapolicy,Googlepublishes
the details of security vulnerabilities affecting Android devices ev-
erymonth[ 5].Thepartners(phonevendors)willbenotifiedbefore
vulnerability publication. In the ideal case, the vendors should also
provide security updates for their phones by every month.
2.2 Methodology
Nearlyallpreviouswork only focusesonsomespecificaspectsof
the custom firmware, like malware and privacy leakage. There still
lacks a deep understanding of its ecosystem and security status,
especiallythe causesbehind thecurrent status.To bridgethe gap,
thisworkaimstoconductalarge-scaleandcomprehensivesecurity
measurement on Android firmware in the wild.

3Package name: com.miui.cloudserviceTo answer the research questions proposed in Section 1, our
measurementsandanalysesshouldbebasedonalarge-scaledataset
covering diverse ROM images. Also, an automated analysis tool
is needed, that is, the design of AndScanner. It takes the ROMimages as the input and carries out a series of security analyseson different layers. On the OS level, we focus on the analysis of
securitypatches.Totheaspectofpre-installedapps,apartfromtheactualinfluenceofknownvulnerabilities,thediscoveryofunknown
vulnerabilitiesisalsoconsidered,suchasattributemisconfiguration
and cryptographic misuse. In addition, to quantify the security
threats,wealsoshouldinvestigatethefundamentalreasonsbehind
the statistical data.
As our work focuses on comprehensive measurements, it will
considerasmanytypesofvulnerabilitiesaspossible.Weassume
the attacker has a stronger ability that can induce the victim to
click on the URL, install the app, even physically touch the device.
The main researchchallenges in this work include 1)confirma-
tionofCVEsrelatedtopre-installedAPPs,2)efficientlarge-scale
securitypatchdetection,and3)selectionofthedetectionfeaturesofthepre-installedappsecurity.Section3describesthecorresponding
solutions to these challenges.
3 DATA COLLECTION & ANALYZER
SinceweaimtoevaluatethesecuritystatusofAndroidfirmware
ecosystem, a large amount of ROM images are needed. Besides,
CVE information is also crawled for security feature checking and
correlation analysis. We implemented a crawler to collect the ROM
images and the target CVE data. Meanwhile, we implemented sev-
eralanalysistoolstofacilitateourlarge-scalesecuritymeasurement.
This section illustrates the data source and detailed design of And-
Scanner, which contains the Crawler,ROM Parser, Patch Analyzer,
andApp Analyzer. The overall workflow is illustrated in Figure 1.
3.1 Crawler
ROM images. Most major phone vendors, such as Google and
Xiaomi, release their ROM images on their official websites to facil-
itateusersdownloading.Insomecases,theusersneedtorecover
their bricked phones with the factory images. However, some ven-dors, like Samsung and Huawei, do not directly provide the public
downloading URLs for their firmware. The images only can be ob-
tainedthroughsomeofficialsupportchannels.Insuchcases,wetrytoconstructallpossibleURLsbasedonalegaldownloadingURLbychangingsomekeyparameters.Inaddition,wealsoobtainthedatacollectedbyanotheropen-sourcerepository,AndroidDumps[
2],a
public project hosting phone images. This project contains images
from small phone vendors, increasing the scale and diversity of
our dataset. For the soundness of Android Dumps, we verified the
unpacked files of our crawling firmware with those of the identical
firmware in Android Dumps to ensure the integrity of firmwareimages in Android Dumps. In addition, we reproduced the open-
source tool [ 36] of Android dumps and verified the accuracy of the
unpacking results.
CVEdata. Asdescribedpreviously,theCVEdataisrelatedtomul-
tiplesecurityfeatureanalysisandcorrelationanalysis.Theinitial
research challenge in this work is to establish a link between CVEs

and pre-installed apps. Through traversing all CVE data from 2009
to 2020, we collected the basic data at first. That is, CVE IDs, dis-
closed time, and descriptions are collected from the official CVE
website[9].TheCPE(commonplatformenumeration)information,
likevulnerableappnamesandversions,arecollectedfromtheNVD
website [18]. Then, we match the CPE information with the meta-
dataofpre-installedapps(e.g.,appname,andversion),collectedfrom ROM Parser (Subsection 3.2), to filter out the pre-installed
apps related CVEs. However, as the irregular formats of some CVE
submissions, we indeed missed some CVEs. Hence, we conductthe filtering again by manually check each CVE and remove the
duplicate and irrelevant CVEs.
3.2 ROM Parser
As the critical step before security measurement, accurate ROM
image parsing is quite essential. The ROM parser module achieves
such a target. That is, in this step, unpacked image files and the
corresponding firmware metadata are outputted. In our implemen-
tation,twosub-stepsareinvolved,ROMunpackinganddataextrac-
tion. First, the ROM parser unpacks the ROM image and obtains
the individual file-system images for subsequent security analysis.
Next,multiplekindsoffirmwaremetadatawillbeextractedfrom
the unpacked files.
ROMunpacking. AsdescribedinSubsection2.1,firmwareisusu-
ally released in a standard compression format. It is easy to handle
this case. To the encrypted ROM images, we use some dynamic
methods,suchasADB(AndroidDebugBridge)debugging,toobtain
the decryption key from the running system. To the uncompressed
Android ROM files, we still need to unpack the partition images,
especially system.img .Ifthevendorsstoretheimagesusingtheof-
ficialsparseimageformat,itcanberesolvedwiththe"official"tool,simg2img [
31]. The other vendors may use their private formats or
compression formats to store the factory images or OTA images.
We identify theformat ofimage files basedon their fileextension
andformatfeaturesfirst,thenusethecorrespondingpublicparsing
tools [44] [58] [6] [35] [56] to unpack them.
Data extraction. After unpacking the images, we generate the
identification for the ROM image and each internal file. We ex-
tractthe metadatafromeach ROMimagebased ontheirproperty
files(i.e., build.PROP )forsub-processanalysis,includingFinger-
print, Android version, Build time, Security patch level, Model,
and Vendor. Fingerprint is used as the identifier of a ROM im-
age. Android version represents the ROM image’s Android OS
version. Build time is the build time of a ROM image, such as“Thu Jun 29 18:12:59 UTC 2017 ”.Security patch level rep-
resents thetime of a device’slatest security patch update,such as
‘2017-08-05 ”.Modelrepresents the corresponding device model.
Vendorrepresents the ROM image’s vendor. The internal files con-
sistoftwotypesof files: pre-installedapplicationpackages (APKs)
andbinary executables. For the internal files, we use a tuple < File
MD5, vendor, ROM fingerprint> to mark the source of this file.
3.3 Patch Analyzer
Sincepatchesmayoriginatefrommorethanoneupstreamkernel
(e.g., Linux, AOSP, and Qualcomm), the propagation usually takes
multiple steps to reach theOEM vendors [ 59] finally. At the same
time,vendor’spatchclaimsmaybeunreliable[ 49].Hence,weneed
toverifythecompletenessandeffectivenessofthesecuritypatchesonaROMsampleindependently.ItisalsoacriticalsteptoevaluatetheROMfile’ssecuritystatus.ThePatchAnalyzermodulegenerates
reportsaboutwhetheranAndroidfirmwarehasbeenpatchedin
time and whether the vulnerabilities indeed have been fixed on
thefirmware.Insummary,thismoduleisdesignedtoanswer Q1
&Q2andexplorethefundamentalreasonsbehindthemwiththe
PatchDelayAnalysisModule (forQ1)andthe PatchMissingAnalysis
Module(forQ2).
Based on the firmware’s metadata collected in Subsection 3.2,
thePatchDelayAnalysisModule usedthebuildtimeandsecurity
patchleveltocheckwhetheronefirmwarefollowedupthereleased
AOSPsecuritypatchesintime.Thevalueofthebuildtimeminus
the security patch is defined as the patch delay time. For example,
in a ROM image, if the build time is 2019-09-13 (UTC time) and
the security patch date is 2019-08-05, so we can calculate the delay
as 39𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠/(30𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠/𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ )= 1.3 months (rounded down to
1month).BasedonGoogle’srecommendation[ 3],wedecided30
days as the ideal time to patch the Android firmware image. If the
delay period is less than 30 days, we do not count it and believe it
is a reasonable delay for vendors processing the security update.
To address the second research challenge, we should balance
PatchAnalyzer’sefficiencyandaccuracy.Hence,weimplementthePatchMissingAnalysisModule basedonthepatchtestsetandpatch
verification logic of the state-of-the-art open-source app Snoop-
Snitch[49]andmakeitworkforthelargescaleoffirmwaresamples.
Indetail,theworkflowofsignaturegenerationforvulnerabilities
and patches [ 49] is as follows: (1) compiling reference source code
before patching and after patching, (2) parsing disassembly listing
forrelocationentries,(3)sanitizinginstructionstotossoutirrele-
vant destination addresses of the instruction, (4) generating a hash
valueofremainingbinarycode,(5)generatingsignaturecontaining
function length, position/type of relocation entries, and the code’s

and hundreds of different Android revisions, and re-compiles each
source code leveraging different compilers with different optimiza-
tionlevelsonallsupportedCPUtypes.Intotal,thepatchtestset
contains411testcasesrelatedto411CVEsand520patchfilesfrom
Oct 2015 to May. 2020 (Android 5.0 - Android 10).
However, the original version of SnoopSnitch is implemented as
anAndroidappandcanonlyrunonasinglephone,whichisnot
suitable for large-scale analysis. Therefore, we re-implemented the
verificationlogicofSnoopSnitchbasedonPython.Wetakeverifica-
tion on each executable file in the ROM images as an independent
detection task, send it to the thread pool, and then use multiple
processes to test each patch test case for the binary. Compared
with the original app, our analysis time for a ROM image has been
reducedbytentimes.Becausewediscardpatchtestcasesrelatedto
the runtime state, it may result in false positives. In order to verify
thecorrectnessofourworkintimeandcorrectourresults,wetake
samplesformanualverificationbasedonthefollowingtwoprin-
ciples: 1) choose from vulnerabilities that are centrally disclosedand identified as fixed in a specific firmware; 2) randomly select
the vulnerabilities that have been verified as fixed and unfixed.
In thePatch Missing Analysis Module, the test set contains 411
testcases.Onetestcaseisasignaturegeneratedbythecorrespond-
ing CVE-related patch files. The Patch Missing Analysis Module
first selects the patch that affects the firmware according to the
firmware’sOSversion,selectsthecorrespondingpatchtestcases
from the test set, and filters the patch-related binary files from
the unpacked files of the firmware. Then, the patch-related binary
files’signatureswillbegeneratedinthesamewayasthetestcases.
Then these signatures will be compared with the corresponding
test cases to determine whether these patches exist. Finally, if one
patch does not exist, we will combine the security patch level of
the ROM image and the release time of this patch to determine the
patchmissing.Forexample,ifthepatchwasreleasedinJan2019
and the ROM image’s security patch level is Feb 2019, it will be
patch missing. If the ROM image’s security patch level is Dec 2018,
it will not be patch missing.
3.4 App Analyzer
To answer Q3andQ4, App Analyzer, a static analysis tool im-
plemented based on Androguard [ 28] and CryptoGuard [ 34], is
designed to extract the identification features and vulnerability
features of pre-installed apps, including the CVE Matching Module
(forQ3) and the Risk Detection Module (forQ4).
TheCVE Matching Module extracted the identification features
frompre-installedappsfirstly,includingthepackagename,version,
signature and file MD5. Then, the module matched the apps and
CVEs basedonthe identificationfeatures, andconfirmed whether
theknownvulnerabilityinthematchingappbycheckingtherelated
vulnerability code and misconfigured attributes. Next, the module
combinedthetuple< File MD5 ,vendor,ROM fingerprint >(men-
tionedinSubsection3.2)toestablisheachCVE’simpacttuple< CVE
Num,package name ,version,signature ,File MD5 ,vendor,ROM
fingerprint >. Finally, after comparing the CVEs’ disclosure time
andthebuildtimeofROMimages(withvulnerableapps),wecan
get the images with unfixed app CVEs.TheRisk Detection Module focuses on the security risk mea-
surementforthepre-installedapps.Toaddressthethirdresearch
challenge, we need to select suitable features to detect the security
ofthepre-installedapps.Byanalyzingthecollected191CVEvul-
nerabilities(from2013to2020)relatedtothepre-installedapps,wefindthatmorethan90%(176/191)arecausedby attributemisconfig-
uration(168)and cryptographicmisuse (8)issues

ofothervulnerabilitiesistoolow,weselectedthetwowiththehigh-
est proportion, attribute misconfiguration andcryptographic misuse,
as the analysis targets. Meanwhile, all these problems have the
corresponding detection items in OWASP Mobile Security Testing
Guide [50].
3.4.1 Attribute Misconfiguration. The extracted security features,
storedintheAndroidManifest.xmlfile5,arechosenbasedonthe
CVE records related to Android app’s configurations and Google’s
official security enhancements, as mentioned above.
F1: exported components. The exported attribute of a compo-
nent(e.g.,ActivityandService)determineswhetherthecomponent
is public. If a component is public (set to true), it can be exported
and accessed by other apps. Developers can use the permission
attributetorestricttheinvocationfromexternalentities.Supposea

ilyexploitthoseessentialfunctionstocompletemaliciousactions

such as screen/messages recording involved in CVE-2018-14996.
F2: debuggable. The debuggable attribute can be set to trueto
helpdeveloperdebugtheappduringdevelopment.Ifadeveloper
releasesanappwiththe true debuggable attribute,itcanbeex-
ploitedbyattackerstoaccessthedebuggableapp’sdatawiththeprivilegesoftheapp,evenexecutearbitrarycodewiththisapp’s

"YouuploadedadebuggableAPK.Forsecurityreasons,youneedto
disable debugging before it can be published in Google Play [22]."
F3: networkSecurityConfig. The networkSecurityConfig at-
tribute allows an app to customize its network security settings in
a safe, declarativeconfiguration file withoutmodifying its source
code,whichisavailablesinceAndroid7.0.Ifthe networkSecurity -
Configfeature is not set, this app will be at risk from a man-in-
the-middle attack [ 17,30]. Google Play prohibited new apps and
updatesfromincludinginsecurecertificatevalidationlogic[ 12–14],
like the networkSecurityConfig misconfiguration.
F4: allowBackup. The allowBackup feature defines whether an
app’sdatacanbebackedupandrestoredbyauserwhohasenabled
the USB debugging mode. If this feature is set to true, it means
an attacker can take the backup of the app’s data (e.g., account
informationandpasswords)nomatterwhetherthedeviceisrooted,
likeCVE-2017-16835.

4 MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS
In this section, we present and discuss our measurement results.
Particularly,weanswertheresearchquestionsproposedinSection1
with deep cause explorations.
4.1 Experiment Setup
Our measurement programs are mainly implemented in Python
and shell scripts with 12,278lines of code. Three powerful servers
were deployed for our large-scale measurement and data storage.
Dataset. Our dataset is built from August 2020 to November 2020.
AslistedinTable2,intotal,wecollected6,261Androidfirmware
imagesof 153Android vendors,covering allmainstream Android
phonevendorsandsomesmallvendorslikeGionee[ 42]andLea-
goo [47]. These images occupied 8.6 TB storage. To the best of our
knowledge, itisthelargestAndroidfirmwaredataseteverusedfor
security measurement. The image types of our collected dataset are
diverse, like .zip and .ozip. The Android OS versions cover 2.x to
11, and the building time is from 2012 to 2020. All of them couldbe unpacked successfully. Besides, we obtained 443,475 unique pre-
installedAPK filesfromallunpacked ROMimages,and191 CVEs
related to these pre-installed apps.
Accuracy. Inaddition,toverifytheaccuracyofSnoopSnitch,we
randomly selected 50 patch missing analysis results to do the man-
ual verification. Only one result is suspected to be false positive.
4.2 Analysis Results
Following the workflow described in Section 3, we conducted a se-
riesofsecurityanalysestoanswertheresearchquestionsproposed
in Section 1. Here we give our answers with the corresponding
measurement data and explore the reasons behind them.
Q1.DotheAndroidphonevendorsfollowupthereleasedAOSP
security patches in time?Overall result. Up to 1,516 of the total 6,261 images (24.2%)
have at least one month delay
. The overall average delay period
of 6,261 images is around 0.8 months. To the firmware existing the
patchdelayissue,theaveragedelayperiodisaround3.2months.
Themostseveredelayismorethanthreeyears.Thatis,thelatest
image of OPPO A33m (put on sale in 2015) was built in Jan 2019
with Android version number 5.1.1. However, its security patch
date was still labeled as Oct 2015, say 40 months’ delay.
In Table 2, we list the overall patch delay statistics of the top
10 vendors with the number of ROM images in our dataset. Based
on this table, we could summarize that this security patch delay
issue is widespread, even for well-known vendors, like Samsung
andHuawei.Also,somevendors’performanceisentirelyterribleinthisissue,whichindirectlyreflectstheirinsufficientsecurityefforts.Forexample,asoneofthetop3Androidphonevendors[
46],46.8%
of the ROM images of Xiaomi have patch delay issues. Only oneimage (total of 110 images) from Nokia has a one-month patch
delay,anditssecurityeffortisstilladmirable.Inthistable,noimage
from Google has delay issues. It is entirely reasonable because the
Android security updates are maintained and published by Google.
Cause exploration. Tofurtherunderstandingthepatchdelayis-
sue, taking Xiaomi as an example, we compare the delay situations
among different models. As listed in Table 3, we can find no patch
delayinthemodelsreleasedafter2017,buttheearliermodelshave
a relatively bad performance. One possible reason is that as experi-
encingthetroughin2016,Xiaomidevotedmoreresourcestothe
development of mobile devices from 2017. Another possible reason
is the introduction of Project Treble, as the following analysis.
Google also notices the issue of Android fragmentation and
updatedelay.InAndroid8.0,Googlere-architectedtheOSframe-
work (Project Treble) to split the OS framework and vendor im-
plementation tohelp the vendors updatetheir devices [ 25]. Inour
dataset, there are 4,838 imagesbased on Android 8.0 orlater ver-sions. Among them, 782 images exist the delay issue, say 16.2%.
The average delay is 2.8 months. On the other hand, to the images
beforeAndroid8.0,around51.6%havedelayissues,andtheaverage
delay is 4.0 months. It means the Project Treble is successful to
some extent though we cannot quantify its contribution precisely.
Furthermore, Google launched two certification programs to
regulate and promote Android OS, certified partners [21] for phone
vendors and supported devices [24] for individual phone models.

andsignificantpricedifferencesfromthesamevendor.Thehigh-
end model is OPPO R9s (put on sale in Oct 2016), and the low-end
model is OPPO A57 (put on sale in Nov 2016). For a device, we
arrange its associated ROM images in ascending order of compila-
tiontimeandobservethechangesinpatchdelay.Wecanfindno
remarkabledistinctioninthefirsteightimagesofthesetwomodels
from this line chart, around 0 t o 3 months. Ho wever,starting from
the ninth ROM image, the difference becomes quite apparent. The
patch delay of A57 increases to 7 months and finally reaches the
peakof19months.Onthecontrary,thereisnopatchdelayforR9sfurthermore. Although A57 was released one month later than R9s,
R9s was upgraded to Android 7.1.1 in the ninth ROM image, while
A57 was still running Android 6.0.1 until the end. It reflects that
OPPOcaresmoreaboutthemaintenanceofhigh-endmodels.Moreseriously,theupdatelogsofA57’slasttwoROMimagesmentioned
that the system security patches were integrated [ 19]. However,
the fact is that their system security patch levels were not changed.
Assessment: ThesecuritypatchdelayiswidespreadinAndroid
phones, even for leading vendors, like Samsung and Huawei.24.2% of the images have this issue, and the average delay isabout 3.2 months. It means that the updated images of many
vendors focus on the feature update, not the security update.
Q2.Whether the patching claims of phone vendors are reli-
able?
Overall result. There are 383 of the total 6,261 ROM images
(6.1%) from 50 vendors that have at least one patch missing .

The most extreme one has 46 patches missing, which belongs to
OPPOR9skt(announcedin2016).ThisROMimagewasbuiltinMay
2017,anditssecuritypatchlevelwasinApr2017.Allitsmissing
patches were disclosed from Dec 2016 to Apr 2017.
Table 5 lists the overall patch missing statistics of the top 10
vendors with the number of ROM images. According to this table,
we can find that the issue of security patch missing is quite severe,
which can also indirectly reflect the involved vendors’ insufficient
security efforts. For example, as a mainstream vendor, 161 ROM
images(19.5%)ofOPPOhavepatchmissingissues,andtheaverage
missing number is around 1.5. Nokia still has the best performance
in patch missing with no patch missing issue. The other vendor
with no patch missing issue is Realme, a subsidiary of OPPO.
Tobetterunderstandthepatchmissingissue,wetookOPPOA59
(announced in 2016)as an example to compare themissing issues
amongdifferentROMimages.Wefoundthatthenumberofmissing
patchesincreaseswiththeROMimageupgrade.TheoldestROM
image built in 20166only has one missing patch, but the newest
ROM image built in 20187has 23 missing patches. We manually
confirmedtheeffectivenessofcontainedhigh-riskvulnerabilities,
likeCVE-2017-0479 andCVE-2017-0480 . The reason may be that
the developer gave up maintaining the security patches of this
mid-range model, only updated the date of the security patch level.

Google having patch missing issues, which is beyond our expec-
tation, as all patches in the test set are collected from Android
securitybulletins[ 5].Afterfurtherexploration,wenoticedthese
ROM images belong to 4 models, Nexus 6 (2014), Nexus 5X (2015),
Nexus 6P (2015), and Pixel (2016), of which OS versions are all
Android 7.x. Also, all missing issues are attributed to one patch,
CVE-2017-0494 ,aninformationdisclosurevulnerabilityinAOSP
Messaging and rated as moderate. In addition to the passive obliv-
ion of developers, there is another reason that Google usually fixes
moderate vulnerabilities during major version upgrading.
Google introduced Security Test Suite (STS) into Compatibility
TestSuite(CTS)inAug2018totestwhetherthesecuritypatches
work[8].We measuredtheaveragenumber ofmissingpatchesin
the top 10 vendors’ images before and after Aug 2018, which is
listed in the last two columns of Table 5. To all top 10 vendors, the
average number of missing patches after Aug 2018 is much smallerthan the number before Aug 2018, proving the effectiveness of STS.
Table 4 also compares the differences of missing patches among
vendors(partnervs.non-partner)anddevices(supporteddevicesvs.
non-supportedones).Onaverage,theimagesfromnon-partnerven-dors miss 1.42 patches, which is higher than the number of partner
vendors (0.97). Similarly, the average missing number of supported
devices is 4.04, much less than non-supportedones (11.09). There-
fore,fromtheperspectiveofpatchmissing,themobilephonesof
certified partners and supported devices are also more secure.
Besides,wealsomeasuredthelongitudinalchangesonthemissed
patchesonOPPOR9sandOPPOA57,andtheirpatchmissingtrends
are plotted in Figure 2 (b). The missing patch number of R9s in-
creasesmarkedlyinthefourthROMimage,from10to34.Asimilar
situation also appears on A57, from 8 to 34. Our further investiga-
tion shows that the missed patches in the previous ROM images
havebeenfixedinthefourthone.However,thefourthimagemissed
34 new patches that are mainly related to Mediaserver (20 related
patches) and Audioserver (5 related patches). We analyzed the
updatelogsofbothdevices[ 19,20]andfoundthatthefourthROM
image mainly updated Mediaserver andAudioserver related fea-
tures.Therefore,itispossiblethatOPPOtemporarilyignoresthe
relevant security patches due to compatibility issues, not updating
features, and patching security bugs at the same time.

previously missed patches in the subsequent ROM images. But the
difference between the two devices appears in the last two images.
ThemissednumberofA57maintainsat5,whilethenumberofR9s
decreases to 1. The reason is that R9s was upgraded to Android
7.1.1 from 6.0.1, while A57 was not. Due to the upgrade of the
OSversion,theimagesofR9sweredirectlybuiltonthenewbase
AndroidOSwithoutpatchingmissing.Whatismore,thelastmissed
patch of R9s only affected Pixel devices, not all Android devices.
This longitudinal analysis also indicates that a vendor has different
attitudes towards mobile phones’ security at different price levels.
Assessment: The claims of vendor patching may not always be
reliable, even for some mainstream vendors, such as OPPO. 6.1%
ROMimagesfrom50vendorshavesecuritypatchmissingissues.
Thepossiblereasonisthatvendorsdonothavesufficienttesting

on Nov 14, 2019). Specifically, CVE-2019-9295 is a vulnerability re-
lated to the NFC function, leading to local privilege escalation.
CVE-2019-15473 isavulnerabilitycausedbyanexportedservice
(i.e., CallEnhancementService ). As com.google.android.tag is
a Google official pre-installed app integrated into the AOSP source
code, and com.qualcomm.qti.callenhancement is an essential
service pre-installed app provided by Qualcomm. It means that
some vendors do not pay enough attention to security checking

trust in the security of these well-known suppliers.
Scope of influence. Due to commercial cooperation and app sup-
plier reasons, phones are usually pre-loaded many apps. On the

device, the actual scope of influence of such vulnerabilities may be
more than the disclosed scope.
Accordingtotheapp’sscopeofinfluence,weshowedseventypi-
calappsinTable7.WecanfindthattheCVEinformationdisclosed
publiclyisjustthetipoftheiceberg.Apartfromtheofficialvulnera-
ble pre-installed app com.google.android.tag , every vulnerable
pre-installed app is associated with undisclosed vendors. The two
pre-installedappsassociatedwiththemostnumber(15)ofundis-
closed vendors is com.qualcomm.qti.callenhancement (ver. 9)
andcom.qualcomm.qti.callenhancement (ver. 8.1.0). Since they
are provided by Qualcomm, the major chip supplier for Android
devices,alldevicesequippedwithQualcommchipswillbeaffected.
Thissituationalsoappliesto com.mediatek.factorymode (ver.1.0)
with 10 undisclosed vendors, a pre-installed app related to Medi-
aTek, another major chip supplier for Android devices. The vulner-
ablepre-installedapp com.dropboxchmod (ver.1.0),relatedtothe
vendor customized basic service in OPPO and Realme devices, is
associated with the most (328) ROM images. Therefore, the vulner-
ableappsfrombasicinfrastructureservicesandhardwaresuppliers
will affect various devices.
In addition, we noticed that 5 vulnerable pre-installed apps (i.e.,
com.dropboxchmod (ver.1.0,disclosedin2018), com.qualcomm.qti -
.callenhancement (ver.9,disclosedin2019), com.log.logservice

(ver.8.1.0,disclosedin2019),and com.mediatek.factorymode (ver.
1.0, disclosed in 2019) – appeared in the ROM images built in
2020, which means those ROM images still load the vulnerablepre-installed apps at least one year after the vulnerabilities weredisclosed. All these apps are related to the basic system services,
and three of them are provided by chip suppliers.
Assessment: Apps with unfixed CVEs appear in almost half of
vendors’ ROM images, even some famous vendors, like OPPO
and Samsung.The mostextreme vendoris Realme,the average

owndevices.Then,weusedthevulnerabilityscanningtoolbased
on drozer [ 40] to detect the target APP to discover the exploitable
vulnerabilities.Fortheexploitablevulnerabilities,weconstructed
and ran the corresponding PoCs so that we could provide evidence
of exploitable vulnerabilities to vendors. Finally, we confirmed and
submitted 307 exploitable vulnerabilities based on our own devices.
38 pre-installed app vulnerabilities from 15 vendors have been
confirmed with 32 CVE/CNVD numbers.
Case studies. Here we give some interesting cases.
Case 1.The security risks of "ancient times" are still alive.
The app com.autonavi.manu.widget (ver. 2.4), signed by Au-
toNaviSoftwareCo.,setthe debuggable valueas true.Thisapp
isintegratedintotheROMimage9.Theattackerscanexploitthe
9Fingerprint: OnePlus/OnePlus5T/OnePlus5T:9/PKQ1.180716.001
/2002171214:user/release-keys of OnePlus, built on Feb 17, 2020.exposed debuggable functionality to access the app data and even
executearbitrary code.Therearetwopossiblereasons:(1) thede-
velopers forgot to check the debuggable value, (2) the supplier
provided the test version of the app by accident.Case 2.Crypto misuses bring practical data leakage risks.
Theapp com.samsung.android.smartcallprovider (ver.10.0.24)
signed by Samsung, used a hard-coded stringas the key for the
deployed AES encryption. Since AES is a symmetric encryption al-
gorithm, the attacker can utilize this key to decrypt the ciphertext,
making the encryption operations meaningless. The developers
may not have enough knowledge to invoke cryptographic APIscorrectly [
37]. Also, the manufacturer neglected to check on the
hard-coded key existing in the pre-installed apps.
Case 3.Exported components result in user privacy leakage.
Theapp com.vivo.weather.provider (ver.6.0.2.2)isaweather
appdevelopedbyVivo.Ithasanexportedcontentprovider, com.viv-
o.weather.provider.WeatherProvider . The attacker can steal
thevictim’sprivacyfromthecontentURIsthroughtheexported
component without permission, such as the victim’s accurate lo-
cationinformation(pinpointingthestreet)10,thecitiesvisitedin
recent 100 days11, and inferring the victim’s trajectory informa-
tion12. Based on our database, this vulnerability exists in all 24
versions of this app (ver. 1.0 to 6.0.2.2), which affects 109 ROM
imagesofVivo(OSver.4.4.2to11),buildtimefromJun2016toSep
2020. This vulnerability has been confirmed by Vivo and assigned
a CVE number, CVE-2021-26279.
Case 4.Different vendors have different reactions.
The Google app com.android.providers.settings (ver. 10)
has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to steal the victim’s pri-
vacythroughano-permissionthird-partyapp.Wehavereported
this vulnerability to nine related vendors, of which four vendors
confirmed it, four vendors ignored it, and one vendor (Google)
stillreviewsitfornearlythreemonths.Intheconfirmedvendors,
onevendor(Huawei)identifiedthisvulnerbilityashigh-risk,two
vendors (OPPO, Vivo) identified this vulnerability as medium-risk,
and one vendor (Lenovo) identified it as low-risk. Finally, two ven-
dors assigned CVE numbers to this vulnerability, CVE-2021-22486

installedappofGoogle,andonevendor(Xiaomi)reasonedthatthe
leakedinformationwasinsensitive.Thesedifferencesaremainly
duetothedifferentcustomizeddevelopmentoftheAndroidsystem
by various vendors and various vendors’ different vulnerability
review standards.
Assessment: All vendors have potential security risks in the
pre-installed apps in their ROM images. It may lead to multiple
kindsofvulnerabilities.Thevendorsneedtodoacomprehensive
app security test before their devices are released to markets,
especially for their customized apps and third-party apps.
5 THREAT TO VALIDITY
Here we discuss several threats to the effectiveness of this work.
CVE data. Since CVE reports were submitted without standard
formats, some of them may lack important information. For exam-
ple, if the CVE reports do not provide the vulnerable apps’ affected
versions, we cannot match the corresponding pre-installed apps.
Thisissuemaybesolvedbycollectingmorevulnerabilitydatafrom
broader sources, like research papers, technical reports, and blogs.
Packed App. AsAPPAnalyzerisbuiltonstaticanalysistools,it
cannot analyze packed apps well. Nevertheless, we found that only
0.23%(1,020/443,475)ofthepre-installedappsarepacked,which
has minimal impact on our measurement results.
6 RELATED WORK
In this section, we review the related work on the security analysis
of Android firmware. Most of the previous research focused on
a particular aspect of firmware, and few works tried to launched
comprehensive large-scale security measurements.

etal.[41].Zhengetal.[ 60]designedandimplementedDroidRay

app level and system level, and 250 firmware images were covered.
However, their analysis concentrated on pre-installed malware,
andthevulnerabilitiestheyanalyzedaretoooldtoexploitinthe

installedapps,likethestakeholdersinvolvedinthesupplychain,
personally identifiable information leakage, potentially harmful
behaviors. However, their analysis target only concentrated on the
malicious pre-installed apps and the related privacy operations,
without the firmware level security analysisthat includes system-
levelandpre-installedapplevel.Comparedwiththeabovework,
this paper presents a comprehensive security measurement on the
Android firmware ecosystem, giving a panoramic view and the
causesbehindthesecuritythreats,notjusttheparticularaspects.
Meanwhile,weusedamoreextensiveanddiversefirmwaredataset
for analysis.
Duringthefirmwarecustomizationprocess,newsecurityhaz-
ardsmaybeintroduced.Forexample,Zhouetal.[ 61]studiedthe
security risks introduced by the driver customization, especiallythedowngradeoftheLinuxprotectionlevelofacustomizeddevice-
related file. Aafer et al. [ 27] detected the security configuration
changes introduced by Android customization, such as permission
mismatch and duplicate components declaration. On other aspects
ofvendorcustomization,Tianetal.[ 54]andAaferetal.[ 26]focused
on the security of AT commands and hanging attribute references,
respectively.Possematoetal.[ 51]studiedtheAndroidOEMcom-
pliance and security posture during the customization process.
The issue of capability leakage in firmware is also noticed by
security researchers. As an early study, Grace et al. [ 43] designed a
toolnamedWoodpeckertouncoverthepermissionleaksinAndroid
firmware. Nevertheless, their experiment scale was small, and only
eight images were analyzed. Wu et al. [ 57] studied the provenance,
permission usage, and vulnerability distribution of pre-installedapps. Similarly, Cam et al. [
32] proposed a system, uitXROM, to
detect sensitive data leakage in Android firmware by analyzing re-
lationshipsofpre-installedapps.Morerecently,Elsabaghetal.[ 38]
presented FirmScope, an automated analysis system to uncover
differenttypesofvulnerabilitiesinpre-installedapps,andovertwo
thousand firmware images were evaluated.
Besides, to the aspect of security patches, Zhang et al. [ 59] in-
vestigated the Android kernel patch ecosystem, revealing the rela-
tionship among different parties as well as the bottleneck in patch
propagation. The study of Farhang et al. [ 39] also measured the
patch latency from Qualcomm and Linux repositories to AOSP.
