ABSTRACT
Background: Despitesimilareducationandbackground,program-
mers can exhibit vast differences in efficacy. While research has
identified some potential factors, such as programming experience
anddomainknowledge,theeffectofthesefactorsonprogrammers’
efficacy is not wellunderstood.
Aims:We aim at unraveling the relationship between efficacy
(speed and correctness) and measures ofprogramming experience.
We further investigate the correlates of programmer efficacy in
terms ofreadingbehaviorandcognitive load.
Method: Forthispurpose,weconductedacontrolledexperiment
with 37 participants using electroencephalography (EEG) and eye
tracking.Weaskedparticipantstocomprehendupto32Javasource-
code snippets and observed their eye gaze and neural correlates of
cognitiveload.Weanalyzedthecorrelationofparticipants’efficacy
with popularprogrammingexperience measures.
Results: Wefoundthatprogrammerswithhighefficacyreadsource
codemoretargetedandwithlowercognitiveload.Commonlyused
experience levels do not predict programmer efficacy well, but self-
estimation and indicators of learning eagerness are fairly accurate.
Implications: The identified correlates of programmer efficacy
can be used for future research and practice (e.g., hiring). Future
research should also consider efficacy as a group sampling method,
ratherthan usingsimple experience measures.

1 INTRODUCTION
Proficientprogrammersareessentialforprovidingthecriticalin-
frastructure and functioning applications for our modern soci-
ety [28]. Although the learning strategies, education, and path-
waystobecomingaprogrammermaydiffer,thegeneralexpecta-
tionis that,withmore time andexperience,a programmer should
generally become more proficient. For example, many research
studies of programmers use years of experience [ 8,44], education
level [17,38,57], or employment status [ 12,13,45] as foundational
measures for proficiency. While all these choices are sensible, they
allimplicitlyencodetheexpectationthathigherproficiencyshould
correlate with more experience.
However,inpractice,reportedobservationsviolatethisexpec-
tation. Hiring managers and technical founders [ 6] report that
they routinely encounter łengineers with years of experience who
couldn’tcompetentlyprogramž[ 2],whołstrugglewithtinyprob-
lemsž[29],andłSenior Engineers whocan’twrite basic codež[ 1].
The original creator of the infamous FizzBuzz interview ques-
tion [29] only did so after seeing that the łmajority of comp sci
graduates...andself-proclaimedseniorprogrammersžhaddifficulty

found that, in companies, the seniority level showed little corre-
lation to actual programming skill [ 39], and programmers with

2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND VARIABLES
Ourstudyonprogrammerefficacybuildsonthemethodologyof

herentstudyasshowninTable 1.Wespecificallydesignedourstudy

Programmer efficacy is therefore the independent variable for our
experiment. We operationalize programmer efficacy as follows:
programmer efficacy =number of correct code comprehension tasks
completion time in minutes
Note that programmer efficacy captures both the speed and
correctnessofaparticipant’sbehavior.Duetothestrictone-hour

were able to see all snippets before the experiment ended. Our
definitionofprogrammerefficacyeliminateseffectsarisingfrom
a difference in the number of attempted tasks and is in line with
prior work [ 34,69,78].
To guide our experimentdesign regarding dependent variables,
we definedseveral research questions,whichwe introduce next.
2.1 Reading Behavior (RQ 1)
Several studies have shown that experienced programmers show a
differentreadingbehaviorthannovicesbasedoneye-gazemeasures.
The reading behavior describes a programmer’s eye movements
while they are comprehending a source-code snippet. Therefore,
we state the following research question:
RQ1Do differentlevels of programmer efficacy exhibitdif-
ferences in reading behavior (in terms of navigation
strategyandcode element coverage)?
Operationalization. ForRQ1,weadopt7measuresthathavebeen
identifiedintheliterature:Inalongitudinalstudy,AlMadietal.ob-
served differences inthe navigationstrategy at the token level[ 4].
Specifically,they analyzedfixation durationandhow likelyit was
that a participant (re)fixated on a token. Experts showed signifi-
cantlyshorterfixationdurations,alowerchanceofrefixatingon
a token, and a higher chance to skip tokens. Likewise, Aljehane
et al. found differences between novices and experts in terms of
code element coverage [5]. It refers to the number of elements on
which a participant fixates during a task in contrast to the total
number of code elements. They found that novices read, in particu-
lar,more methodsignatures, variabledeclarations,identifiers, and
keywords.Finally,Busjahnetal.havealsoidentifiedadifferencein
code elementcoverage,inthatnovices fixatemorecode elements
thanexperts[ 13].Theyalsoidentifiedadifferenceinthe reading
order. However, our replication study revealed that this effect is
principallydrivenbytheexecutionorderofthesnippets[ 60].As
our snippets are not balanced for thisaspect, we will not consider
readingorderasameasure;thesestudiesuseddifferentmeasures

at answering how programmer efficacy affects reading behavior
acrossalldescribedmeasures to increasecomparability.
2.2 CognitiveLoad(RQ 2)
Similartoreadingbehavior,previousstudiesfoundthatdifferent
levels ofprogramming experiencecanbe distinguishedby theob-
served neural correlates of cognitive load, which leads us to our
nextresearchquestion:
RQ2Do differentlevels of programmer efficacy exhibitdif-
ferences inneuralcorrelates of cognitive load?
Operationalization. Related to RQ 2, Crk et al. used event-related
desynchronization along alpha and theta powerbands measured
by an EEG device to classify participants into two programming
experience levels [ 16]. Similarly, Lee et al. found a similar effect
also using EEG, but using a more comprehensive analysis across

load[52].Notably, this ratio iscommonly usedas a cognitive load
measure in other fields [ 35,40]. We analyze both powerbands and
theratiomeasureinourstudytobetterunderstandthelinkbetween
programmer efficacy andcognitive load.
2.3 Experience Measures(RQ 3)
Finally,wefocusonprogrammerefficacyasadistinguishingfac-
tor betweenour participants.Prior research mostcommonly uses
rather simple experience measures to separate participants (e.g.,
years of programming). In this vein, we pose our last research
question:
RQ3Do different levels of programmer efficacy correlate
withcommon measures ofprogramming experience?
Operationalization. Many commonly used experience measures
canbeinconsistentintheirpredictivepower,whichledustouse
programmer efficacy as the distinguishing factor. In RQ 3, we an-
alyze widely used experience measures3and distill the relevant
measures that correlate best with the observed programmer effi-
cacy.
3 STUDYDESIGN AND CONDUCT
To answer our research questions, we designed and conducted a
study, which we describe in this section. All materials including
snippets, tasks, and the experiment script, are available on the
project’s Website.2

brackets. This serves as a baseline for neural activation and is com-
mon inneurosciencestudies ofprogram comprehension [ 59,73].
We chose a 4:1 design, so a participant completes four program-
comprehension tasks and one search task. Between tasks, we in-
cluded a 30 second rest condition, in which participants were in-
structedto focustheireyes onafixation crossandrelax.
For the comprehension tasks, the participants could choose
among four answer options (cf. Listing 1) as well as the option
łnextž to skipa task.Participants used thelefthand to pressspace
as łsubmitž and łcontinuež buttons, and the right hand to navigate
withthearrowkeysbetweenansweroptions.Afterashorttraining

lookingat theirhands,whichminimizesmotion artifacts.

3.5 Participants
WerecruitedparticipantsatSaarlandUniversityviae-maillistsand
online bulletin boards. Participants received 10 Euro compensation
each. The prerequisite for participation was, at least, one year of
experience with Java or, at least, three years of experience with
arelatedprogramminglanguage,suchas C#.Itwasimportantto
recruit a diverse set of programmers with a wide range of expe-
riencelevelstoexplorethedifferencesandcommonalitiesacross
different efficacy levels. In Table 3, we provide an overview of our
participants’demographics.Basedontheconventionallyusedex-
perience measures, our participant sample exhibits a wide range of
programmingexperience,from programmersintheirfirstyearof

We invited 39 participants to start the experiment. 38 out of

modalities are available and the data are included in the analy-
sis. We later excluded one complete participant data set due to

tion4.1), leaving us with 37 participants included in the data set.
We based our programming experience questions on a validated
questionnaire [ 72], but extended it to cover more topics for further
investigation(e.g.,programming-contentconsumptionandproduc-
tionanddailywork;thequestionnaireisavailableinthereplication
package).
4 DATA ANALYSIS
In this section, we describe our data-analysis procedure for eye-
trackingdata,EEG data,andexperience measures.
4.1 Outlier Removal
Westartedwithremovingoutliersinresponsetimeforcomprehend-
ing a source-code snippet. Specifically, we discarded the slowest
5%(i.e.,aresponsetimeofover2min32s)aswellasthefastest5%
(under11s),butonlyifaparticipantchosetheoptionłNextž,since
some tasks can be rapidly answered by proficient programmers
(e.g.,theSignChecker snippet).Thisway,datapointswereonlyre-
movedwhenparticipantsdidnotthoroughlyattempttounderstand

Withtheserules,weremoved9datapoints7inthelower5%and
55 in the upper 5%, leaving 1072 data points for further analysis.
This ledto the removal of more than halfof the datapoints for one
(slow)participant,sowe excludedtheparticipant’sentiredataset
from the study.
4.2 Eye-TrackingData
Wedefinedareas-of-interests(AOIs)foreachsource-codesnippet
torelateeye-gazebehaviorwithparticularregionsandelementsof
code. For this purpose, we first obtained the abstract syntax tree of
eachsource-code snippetto identify eachtoken and code element.
Then,wemanuallyidentifiedhigher-ordersyntacticalstructures

We preprocessed the eye-tracking data to separate fixations and
saccadesfromtherawstreamof (x,y)coordinates.Forthispur-
pose, weused I2CM, whichis anoise-robustalgorithm[ 33]. Then,
wecomputedthetoken-levelandelement-coveragemeasuresde-
scribedinSection 2.1.
4.3 EEGData
Our cognitive load measures are based on a spectral analysis of
EEG data.To improve therobustness ofour analysis, we calculate
cognitiveloadusingtwodifferentapproaches:theta/alphapower
ratioandrelative power analysis.
DataCleaning. First,weremovednoisefromtheEEGdata,espe-
ciallymovementartifacts,usingestablishedpreprocessingmethods:

sponse (FIR) filters. Power line noise was removed by a notch filter
with a lower cutoff frequency of 49Hzand an upper cutoff fre-
quencyof 51Hz.Second,toobtainamorerobustperformancein

the subsequent analysis, we also removed baseline drifts and high-
frequentnoisewitha bandpassfilterranging from4 to 200Hz[63].
Due to the nature of the experiment, where participants have
to look at different points of the screen, eye movements and other
muscleactivitycannotbefullyavoided.Therefore,weperformed
blind sourceseparation as asecond step toremove corresponding
artifacts. The used EEGLABtoolbox [ 19]8provides an automated
implementation of the independent component analysis (ICA). For
eachcomponent,ityieldsaclassificationwithaconfidencelevel,
which we can use to automatically reject noisy components. Rejec-
tion thresholds for eye and muscle artifacts were set to the default
values of 0.9, while components without a clear assignment to a
group were rejectedat 0.95.
Theta/Alpha Power Ratio. As a first technique, we computed the
cognitive load based on the work of Holm et al. [ 35] and Kartali et
al.[40]astheratiooftherelativepowerofthethetaandalphaband
oftheEEG.Wecalculatedthepowerspectraldensityonasliding
window obtaining the mean power within each frequency band of
interest.Theslidingwindowhadasizeof 3sandwasshiftedby 0.1s
over each task. The cognitive load measure is obtained by dividing
themeanpowerwithinawindow.Byusingtheslidingwindow,we
can observe thetimecourse ofthecognitive load duringthetasks.
Relative Power Analysis. As a second technique, we also computed
a per-band and per-channel relative power analysis along alpha,
beta, gamma, and theta band based on the technique established
by Lee et al. [ 45], which is sensitive to the spatial location of brain
activation byconsidering the channelofthe electrode.9
4.4 EfficacyandExperience
For RQ 3, we correlated the observed efficacy with all collected
numerical and categorical experience measures. To this end, we
used Spearman’s 𝜌correlation due to the mix of continuous and
ordinal nature ofour data.
5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, we present the results of our EEG and eye-tracking

5.1 Reading Behavior (RQ 1)
Our eye-tracking data show a change in reading behavior with
increasing efficacy levels. Based on the token-level measures from
AlMadietal.,we foundthat increasedefficacy leads to:
•shorter(first) fixations( 𝜌=−0.14),
•shortergazeduration( 𝜌=−0.19),
•a much lower chance that a token is revisited ( 𝜌=−0.37),
and
•a slightly higher probability that a token is skipped ( 𝜌=
0.08).
We visualizetheserelationships inFigure 3.
Regarding code element coverage,based on Aljehane et al. and
Busjahn et al., we find a similar result, such that higher efficacy
leadstoalowercodeelementcoverage( 𝜌=−0.35).Notably,this
differenceincreasesthroughoutthetask,asweillustrateinFigure 4.
To underline the difference between programmer with low and
high efficacy, we show an example scanpath in Figure 5(Page8).
Clearly,theprogrammerwithhighefficacyrequiresfewerfixations
andrefixationsto comprehendthe source-code snippet.
Overall, this leads to the following answer to our research ques-

leads to higher cognitive load and longer response times [ 50]. Due
to the lower cognitive-load levels, programmers with high efficacy

spikesofcognitive load (Figure 6).
Synthesis of RQs 1ś2.Our study was inspired by several prior ex-
perimentsinvestigatingprogramcomprehensionwithvariousoper-
ationalizations and different definitions of experience. We aimed at
finding a common ground across their measures, specifically when
focusing on programmer efficacy. Overall, our study confirmed
the accuracy of some of these measures, but to different degrees.
Programmers with higher efficacy can be particularly identified
duetotheirefficientreadingstrategyandlowerspikesincognitive
load. This is not only important for future research, but also has
practical implications. For example, a lot of hiring processes use
technical interviews in front of awhiteboard,whichartificially in-
troduce stress and high cognitive load [ 10]. An alternative solution

In Table5, we show the strength of correlations between pro-

experience. Notably, some commonly used experience measures
(e.g.,yearsof(professional)programming[ 8])showlittlepredictive
powertoourparticipants’efficacy.But,severalotherdimensions
of experience show, at least, medium-strength correlations. Specif-
ically,self-estimation in comparisonto peers ( 𝜌=0.59)and a 10-
yearprofessionalprogrammer( 𝜌=0.38)showthatourparticipants
seem to be keenly aware of their proficiency level. The number
ofknownprogramminglanguagesalsoshowsamedium-strength
correlation ( 𝜌=0.42). For the subset of professional program-
mers (𝑛=26), several questions that capture learning eagerness
(e.g., learning, mentoring, code review) show medium correlations.
However,strikingly,thetimeprofessionalsspendonpureprogram-
ming does not correlate to their performance in our experiment
(𝜌=0.06).Overall, these results allow us to answer this research question:
RQ3Programmer efficacy does not correlate with com-
monlyusedexperiencemeasures,suchasyearsofpro-
gramming.Self-estimationandindicatorsoflearning
eagerness show, at least, medium correlations with
observedprogrammer efficacy.
Discussion. Our experiment highlights two fundamental prob-
lems for studying programmers. One issue is that programming
issuchadiversefieldwithdifferenttechnologiesthatrequiredif-
ferent skill sets, so it is incredibly difficult to accurately measure
aprogrammer’sexperience.Therefore,manyresearchersrelyon
simple measures, such as years of programming. However, this can
become problematic if the difference between the selected measure
and theactualproficiency level becomes a significant confound-
ing factor [ 74]. Our experiment, in line with prior research [ 20],
underlineshowlimitedcommonexperiencemeasuresareinpre-
dictingprogrammers’efficacy.Thus,futureresearchmustcarefully
consider collecting more comprehensive experience data, in partic-
ular,when using it to separatethe participants intogroups. While
thismaynotbecompletelynewinsights,ourexperimentfurther
corroborates this critical point. The use of too simplistic measures
canpotentiallyweakenempiricalstudiesofprogrammersandtheir
conclusions.

7 RELATED WORK
Our study is at the intersection between the fields of program
comprehension, eye tracking, neuroimaging, and programming
expertise,whichwe eachdiscuss below.
Program Comprehension. There is a multitude of program-com-
prehensionstudies[ 3,13,25,45,71,75],onwhichwebuildbyre-
using source-code snippets as a foundation for our experiment. In
theearlyyears,behavioral orreflectivestudieswerepopular[ 70].
Ourstudysharesasimilardesignwiththemintermsofsnippets
and tasks, but our observed measures are more in line with the
recent movement toward more objective measurement methods,
such as eye trackingorEEG [ 70], whichwe discuss next.
Eye Tracking. Eye tracking enables researchers to objectively
observeattentionduringcomplextasksandhasincreasedinpop-
ularity,includingprogramcomprehension[ 67].Again,thereisa
multitude of studiesthat use various eye-gaze measures [ 4,5,7,8,
11,13,18,55,57,60,68].Wehaveusedrecentlyestablishedeye-gaze
measures for differentiation of programmer expertise [ 4,5,13], but
we applied these measures to a larger pool of diverse programmers
thanbeforeandincludedinsightsfromneuralcorrelatesviaEEG
data. With efficacy, we also arguably used a better way to separate
participants (cf.Section 5.3).
NeuralCorrelatesofProgramComprehension. Inadditiontoeye
tracking,somestudieshaveemployedmethodstoobserveneural
correlatesofprogramcomprehension.SomehaveusedfMRI[ 14,27]
or fNIRS [ 26,53], others have used EEG [ 43,45,48,51,52,80]. Our

and beta power) [ 45] and Medeiros et al. (i.e., ratio of theta and
alpha)[52],butitdiffersintermsofthegoalandtheparticipantpool.
Lee et al. focused on classification between two distinct groups,
whileMedeirosetal.focusedonsoftwaremetrics[ 52].Bycontrast,
we focused on the programmer and investigated their efficacy on a
continuous distribution,withoutthe needto create twogroups.
ProgrammingExperienceandExpertise. Therehavebeenmultiple
waves of program-comprehension research regarding expertise. Intheearlyyears,severalstudieshavedevisedtheoriesofexpertise,in
particularrelatedtoplans[ 31],mentalmodels[ 62,79],strategy[ 42]
and knowledge [ 30]. More recently, researchers have focused on
visualattention[ 8]andimplementationstyle[ 56].Ourstudydif-
fers in that we operationalize on a more narrow scope of expertise
based on programmer efficacy, rather than measures of knowledge,
mentalrepresentations,orotherintangiblefactors.Weargueour

tionalproblemsaswellasaclearerdefinitionoveranobfuscated

8 PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSION
Measuring Programming Experience. For future studies, one ma-
jor obstacle is to select the correct measure of programming ex-
perience.Cognitivepsychologyhasinvestigatedtherelationship
between experience and expertise in many fields beyond program-
ming[66].Oneconsistentfindingisthatthelengthofexperience
canbepartofexpertise,aspeoplecontinuetoacquireskill[ 21],but
isnoteverything[ 65].Inprogramming,studiesfromthe1990siden-
tifiedasimilareffect,inthattherearetwoelementsatplay:thetime
and learning [ 76]. In our questionnaire, we aimed to capture many
aspectsofprogrammingexperience,includingmeasuresoflearn-
ing,butalsoregardingcontentcreationandwork-timedistribution.
One themethat consistently showedastrongconnection withob-
served efficacy is the eagerness of learning and inquisitiveness.
The number of known programming languages, how much time
isspentonmentoring,andoncodereviewareallhighlyrelevant
factors. Psychology describes this conscious effort to keep learn-
ing asdeliberate practice . It also highlights that not necessarily the
length of practice, but the intensity and goal-orientation is critical
toachieveexpertiseinatopic[ 23].Theeffectofdeliberatepractice
has been observed in programming education and practice, as well.
For example, students show higher ability when participating in
programming competitions [ 81]. In an industry survey, software
engineerssharedthenotionthatagreatsoftwareengineerisshown
by their open-mindedness and eagerness to learn. They considered
theabilitytolearnasmoreimportantthantechnicalskill[ 46].This
was later confirmed in an experimental setting, in which company
seniority level showed little correlation to actual programming
skill [39]. Overall, the results of our experiment underlined that
the learning component is a highly relevant measure to capture
efficacy, which leads us to suggest it as important measure(s)for
future experiments.
Implications for Research. Beyond learning measures, our results
indicatethatfutureresearchcouldmaximizeitspotentialwhencol-
lectingself-estimationmeasures.Thisresultisinlinewithasimilar
findingbySiegmundetal.,whichalsohighlightedself-estimated
comparison as a differentiating factor among students [ 72]. In the
same vein, Kleinschmager and Hanenberg found self-estimated
comparison, at least, as effective as pretests or university grades in

ImplicationsforIndustry. Fromapracticalperspective,ourem-
pirical results provide scientific evidence that technical interviews
maybenecessaryforestablishingefficacy,sincecommonmeasures
selected for decisions (e.g., years of experience), have limited to no
predictivepower.Ourquestionnaireprovidesafewpromisingdi-
rections for operationalizing a more effective method for assessing
efficacyinindustry,suchaspeerreviewandmentoringexperience,
peercomparison,andlearningbehaviors. However,inhigh-stake
decisions, such as promotion or hiring, the degree to which self-
estimationcan be reliable remainsan open question.
Conclusion. Experience, expertise, and efficacy are three dimen-
sionsofcharacteristicsofprogrammersthatarenotwellunderstood.
Inparticular,therelationshipbetweenthemisunclear.Inthispaper,
wehavepresentedcorrelatesofefficacyintermsofreadingorder
andcognitive load acrossawide range ofprogrammers.
Commonly used experience measures do not correlate well to
observed efficacy. Instead, we underline to use self-estimation and
learning eagerness as more accurate measures for programming
experience.
Despite encouraging results, future work shall explore program-
mer efficacy in more detail. For example, the link between reading
behaviorandcognitiveloadcouldbeexploredtounderstandcausal-
ities. Is the more efficient reading strategy of programmers with
high efficacy the cause for lower cognitive load, orvice versa?
