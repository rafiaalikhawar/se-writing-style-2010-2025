the methods, are the intuitive characteristic for understanding the
functionalityofthecode.Toensurethereadabilityandmaintain-
abilityoftheprograms,methodnamesshouldbenamedproperly.
Specifically,thenamesshouldbemeaningfulandconsistentwith
other names used in related contexts in their codebase. In recent
years, many automated approaches are proposed to suggest consis-
tent names for methods, among which neural machine translation

1 INTRODUCTION
During programming, developers must name variables, functions,
parameters, etc. The appropriateness of a name changes over time
during the software evolution. For example, a good function name
can degrade into a poor one when the semantics of the function
change or the function is used in a new context. Poor names make
programs harder to understand and maintain [ 9,10,17,22,25,39],
leadingtomisusesanddefects[ 1,2,8,13].Findingconsistentnames
forprogramconstructshasalwaysbeenacynosureinthesoftware
industry.
Methods are the most minor named units for indicating the pro-
gram behavior in most programming languages [ 18], thus they are
particularly important [ 12,30,32]. Meaningful and conventional
methodnamesarevitalfordeveloperstounderstandthebehaviorof
programsorAPIs.Oncethenameofamethodisdecided,itislabori-oustochange,especiallywhenusedforanAPI[

historyinprojects,developersusuallychangethemethodnames
withoutanychangetothecorrespondingbodycodeinmanycases,
which suggests that programmers strive to choose meaningful and
appropriate method names, i.e., more consistent with other names
in the same project or the codebase. Especially when collaborating,
they need to obey a project’s coding conventions.
Inrecentyears,researchershaveproposedautomatedapproaches
forsuggestingconsistentnamesforthosemethods.Basedonthe
intuition that two methods implemented with similar code in their
body code are likely to be named similarly, Liu et al . [28]proposed
an IR-based approach to detect and rename inconsistent method
names.Theyidentifytheinconsistentmethodnamesbycomparingthenamesretrievedfromthemethodbodyvectorspacewiththose
retrieved from the method name vector space. For the inconsistent
names, their model recommends the potentiallyconsistent names
by referring to the names of similarly implemented methods. How-
ever,inmanycases,eventhemethodswithsimilarbodycodecanbe
named differently because they might belong to different projects

and have different semantics. Besides, by retrieving names from
similar methods, the model cannot suggest neologisms. Allamanis
etal. [5]proposedaconvolutionalattentionalnetworktoextract
local time-invariant and long-range topical attention features in
the method body to suggest names for methods. To leverage the
syntacticstructureofprogramminglanguages,Code2vec[ 7]and
Code2seq [ 6] represent the method body as a set of compositional
abstract syntax tree (AST) paths and use the path representation to
predictthemethod’sname.Nguyenetal . [34]proposedMNire,a
simplebuteffectiveapproachtorecommendamethodnameand
detectmethodnameinconsistencies.Theytreatedthemethodname

the program entities’ names in the method body and the enclosing
class name. Li et al . [24]developed DeepName, a context-based
approachformethodnameconsistencycheckingandsuggestion.
Theyextractthefeaturesfromfourcontexts:theinternalcontext,
thecallerandcalleecontexts,siblingcontext,andenclosingcontext.
The above state-of-the-art models mainly focus on exploiting
code-specific features from the method body or the surrounding
methodsinthesameprogramfile,whichcanbeconsideredaslo-
calcontextsofamethod.However,theinformationofthewhole
project (global context) is ignored in these models. For example,
thedocumentation ofthemethod candescribe themethod’sfunc-
tionality and the role it plays in the project. Besides, there also
existnestedscopesforproject,whereasourcecodefilecanhave
references to other files of the same projects. Thus, the contextsfrom other program files which are imported by the file wherethe target method in are also helpful in understanding the meth-
ods. Intuitively, these contexts are of great importance for method
namerecommendation,especiallyforthemethodswhichhavelittle
contentinthe body,butwithsufficient globalcontexts.Amethod
does not exist in isolation, a large number of associations can be
found among the project-specific contexts and the documentation:
(1)Thefunctionalityandnamingconventionofamethodcanbe
better understood when more contextual features are provided. (2)
There might be many possible names that can match the semantic
ofthemethod.Byreferringtotheglobalcontextualinformation,the solution space of the method names can be narrowed. Thus,
when recommending a method name, it is necessary to refer to
the global contexts. It can help in following situations: when the
method is first created, existing global context can be accessed for
suggesting a proper name for it; during the code refinement, theglobal context can be used to suggest an alternative name if the
current name is inconsistent.
Toverifyourintuition,wefirstconductedastatisticalanalysis
to learn the relation between the method names and their contexts
of different levels. Based on the statistical analysis results, we pro-
poseGTNM, a novel GlobalTransformer-based NeuralModel for

2 MOTIVATING EXAMPLE AND STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS
According to Nguyen et al . [34], the principle of naturalness of
software [ 16] also holds for the tokens composing the names of
program entities. Specifically, tokens are repetitive and occur inregularity, where the repetitiveness can be captured by statisti-cal models trained on a large code corpus. Therefore, the tokenscomposing the names of program entities can reflect the seman-
ticandfunctionalityofthecodesnippets.Basedonthisevidence,
mostpreviousworkmainlyconsiderstheassociationsamongthe
tokens of the method names and the tokens in the method body
(local context). However, only considering the local context is not
sufficient.Weassumethattheproject-specificcontextcanbetter
reflecttherolethatthetargetmethodplaysinthewholeproject.
Forexample,themethodsinthesamefilewiththetargetmethod
(we call them in-file contextual methods) and the methods in other
program files of the same project that are imported by the file
where the target method locates (we call them cross-file contextual
methods). Besides, the documentation of the method also plays an
important role in recommending the method names. We present
several java method examples to illustrate the associations among
methodnamesandtheproject-specificanddocumentationcontexts
in Section 2.2, appearing as the token overlapping. Based on those
observations,weconductastatisticalanalysistoexploretherela-
tionshipbetweenthemethodnamesandthecontextsofdifferent
levels in Section 2.3, i.e., local context, project-specific context, and
documentation context.
2.1 Definitions
Firstly,wegiveabriefdefinitionoftokens,localcontext,project-
specific context, and documentation context.
DefinitionofTokens. Forprograms,weparsetheprogramtoAST
and extract entities (method names, identifiers, parameters, return-
types) from AST. Then we split the entities following camelcaseand underscore naming conventions, and lowercase the entities
togettokens.Fordocumentation,weextractthefirstsentencein
Javadocbydeletingthepunctuations.Thenwesplitthesentence
with space to get words and lowercase the words to get tokens.
DefinitionofLocalContext. Local-contextcontainstheprogram
entitiesinthemethodsignature andbody, includingparameters,
return type, and identifiers.
Definition of Project-specific Context. Project-specific context
is supposed to reflect the target method’s role in the whole project

and the naming styles. We argue that the methods in the same file
withthetargetmethod(wecallthemin-filecontextualmethods)
andthemethodsinotherprogramfilesofthesameprojectthatare
importedbythefilewherethetargetmethod(wecallthemcross-
file contextual methods) in can provide the above information. We
considerthenameofthecontextualmethodsastheproject-specific
context.
DefinitionofDocumentationContext. Thefirstsentenceofthe
code documentation is informative, and many code summarization
approaches use itas a code summary[ 19,23,43]. Following them,
weusethetokensinthefirstsentenceasthedocumentationcontext.
2.2 Motivating Example
1. Theproject-specificcontextmight containthe entitiesthat can
providesemanticinformationforthetargetmethodnamerecom-
mendation.InCode1,thenamesofthethirdmethod(getMaxValue)
donotdescribethefunctionalityofthemethodswell.Whenchang-
ing it into a more precise name that contains the project-related
entitynames(getMaximumResourceCapability),onlyreferringto
the method body is not enough. If the (in-file) project-level con-textual information, i.e., other methods in the same file, can beaccessed, we can easily realize that the method is related to the
resource capability and make correct revisions.
public Resource getClusterResource() {
return clusterResource;
}
public Resource getMinimumResourceCapability() {
return minimumAllocation;
}
// consistent name: getMaximumResourceCapability
public Resource getMaxValue() {
return maximumAllocation;
}
Code1:Project-specificcontextcontainstheentitiesthatcan
provide semantic information
2. The project-specific contextual information can imply the
logicandthefunctionalityoftheproject,whichwillreflecttherole
the target method plays in the project. In Code2, these methods
are related to the window events, including the keypress events or
trackpadtouch events.By accessingthe(in-file) project-levelcon-
text,thefunctionalityofthewholeprojectandtheroleofthetarget
methodcanbebetterunderstood,thusofferingmoreknowledge
for recommending meaningful method name.
public boolean touchDown (InputEvent e vent ,floatx,floaty,int
pointer , intbutton) {
...
}
public void touchUp (InputEvent e vent ,floatx,floaty,int
pointer , intbutton) {
...
}
public boolean keyDown ( InputEvent e vent ,intkeycode) {
return isModal;
}
public boolean keyUp (InputEvent event , intkeycode) {
return isModal;
}
Code 2: project-specific contexts imply the logic and the
functionality of the project.
3. There might be many semantically consistent names that can
reflectthefunctionofaspecificmethod.Wecannarrowthesolution
space and suggest a consistent and conventional method name byreferringtotheproject-specificcontextualinformation.Bothofthe
twomethodsinCode3indicatethatsomeerrorsareencountered.
However,differentverbsareusedinthenames(“Encountered”and
“Occured”), and they are synonyms. Although these two names are
bothsemanticallycorrect,theyarenotconsistent.Whenrefactoring
thesecondmethodname“serverErrorOccured”intoanamethatis consistent with the contextual methods, we can use the verb
“Encountered” to replace “Occured” by referring to the previous
method name “clientErrorEncountered”. This suggests that with
thehelpoftheproject-levelcontext,wecanchoosethecandidate
names from a smaller and specific solution space.
public void clientErrorEncountered() {
clientErrors.incr();
}
// consistent name: ser verErrorEncountered
public void serverErrorOccured() {
serverErrors.incr();
}
Code 3: Semantically consistent names
4. Cross-file project-specific context can provide extra infor-
mation when the in-file context is less informative. In code4, the
AccountActivity class inherits from BaseActivity class, thus the
methods of the parent class BaseActivity might be overridden in
AccountActivity class, for example, getLayoutRes(), onCreateActiv-
ity(),etc.Theprogram filewheretheBaseActivityclassdefinedis
importedatthebeginningofthefile.Thus,wecanextractthemeth-
odsdefinedintheBaseActivityclassbyconsideringthecross-file
project-specific contexts. Thus, when predicting the method name
forthemethodsinAccountActivityclass,themethodsdefinedinits
parent class can be accessed, which are helpful for the cases where
thein-filecontextislessinformativeforinferringthemethodname.

2.3 Statistical Analysis
Basedontheaboveobservations,weconductastatisticalanalysisto
exploretherelationshipsbetweenthemethodnamesandtheircon-
textsby computingthe percentageoftheir tokensharing.For the
analysis, we used the java programs in the Java-small dataset used
in Alon et al . [6]. The dataset contains 11 high quality open-source
java projects, which is a benchmark dataset for method name sug-
getstion task. It contains about 700K Java method examples. Thus,
weusethisdatasettoconductthestatisticalanalysistoexplorethe
relationshipsbetweenthemethodnamesandtheircontexts.The
statistical results in this analysis can be expected in a good project
where most of the names are consistent.
For local context, we found that the tokens of 67.47% of the
methodnamescanbefoundintheidentifiers,and35.64%canbe
foundinthereturntypeandparameters.ForProject-specificcon-
text,wefoundthatthetokensof85.98%ofthemethodnamescanbefoundinthenamesofitsin-filecontextualmethods,andthetokens
of 53.83% of the method names can be found in the names of its

thatdevelopersalwaysrefertotheproject-specificcontextwhen
namingthemethods.Thus,project-specificcontextalsocontains
essential information for method name recommendation, which
should be carefully considered.
3 PROPOSED MODEL
3.1 Overview
In this work, we propose GTNM, a global Transformer-based Neu-
ral Model for method name recommendation aiming at generating
meaningful and consistent method names. The overall architecture
of our approach is shown in Figure 1. To fully utilize the contex-
tual information of a method, we firstly extract context from three
different levels giventhe target method andthe project, including
the local context, project-specific context, and documentation con-
text. We employ a transformer-based seq2seq framework [ 41]t o
generate the method name. Specifically, we build corresponding
encoderstoencodethecontextsintovectorrepresentations.The
decoder generates the target method name by sequentially predict-
ingtheprobabilityofthesubtokens 𝑦𝑡+1inthemethodnamebased
onthecontextualrepresentationsproducedbytheencoders,and
thepreviouspredictedsubtokens 𝑦1,𝑦2,...,𝑦 𝑡.Weusetheattention
mechanismtoallowthemodeltoattendtodifferentcontextsduring
the decoding process.
3.2 Context Extraction
We extract the contexts of three different levels for generating
meaningful and consistent names for the method, including lo-
calcontext, project-specificcontext, anddocumentation.Figure 2
showsanexampleofthecontextsfortheJavamethod“getElement”.
Local Context Extraction According to the results of our statisti-
calanalysisandtorepresentthemethodbodysuccinctly,weextract
the following code entities as the local contexts for the method: (1)
identifiers;(2)parameters;(3)returntype.Wetokenizedeachofthe
names from the local contexts following camelcase and underscore
namingconventions,thennormalizedthetokenstolowercase.Fi-
nally, all the subtokens are concatenated in the order that they
occurred in the source code to form the sequential representation
of the local feature.

Project-specificContextExtraction Wedefinetheproject-specific
context of one method as its in-file methods (other methods in the
samefilewiththetargetmethod)andcross-filecontextualmethods
(methods in the files imported by the file containing the target
method).Forsimplicityandefficiency,weextractthenameofthe
contextual methods as the project-specific context. Thenwe per-
form a similar process to these names as to local context. The
concatenation of the lower-cased subtokens serves as the represen-
tation of the project-specific feature.
Documentation Context Extraction For each method with a
comment, to get its documentation context, we extract the first
sentence that appeared in its Javadoc description since it typically
describes the functionalities of the method1. Then we delete the
punctuations and split the sentence with space to get words and
lowercasethewords.Allthewordsareconcatenatedtoformthe
documentation context.

Training. To train the network, we adopt cross-entropy loss be-
tween the predicted distribution 𝒒and the “true” distribution 𝒑,
which is computed as:
𝐻(𝒑||𝒒)=−/summationdisplay.1
𝑦∈𝑌𝑝(𝑦)log𝑞(𝑦)=−log𝑞(𝑦𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒)(5)
where𝑦𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒is the target name. Since p will assign value of 1
to the actual label in the training example and 0 otherwise, the
cross-entropylossforaexampleisequivalenttothenegativelog-
likelihood of the true label. As 𝑞(𝑦𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒)tends to 1, the loss ap-
proaches zero. The smaller 𝑞(𝑦𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒)goes, the greater the loss be-
comes. Thus, minimizing this loss is equivalent to maximizing the
log-likelihood that the model assigns to the true labels.

they provide and followthe same way tobuild the dataset.After
data processing, the detailed data information is shown in Table 1.
4.2 Metrics
To evaluate the quality of the generated method name, we adopted
the metrics used by previous works [ 6,7,34], which measured
Precision, Recall,and F-scoreoversub-tokens.Specifically,forthe
pair of the target method name 𝑡and the predicted name 𝑝, the
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝑡,𝑝),𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙(𝑡,𝑝), and𝐹1(𝑡,𝑝)score are computed as:
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝑡,𝑝)=|subtoken (t)|∩|subtoken (p)|
|subtoken (p)|
𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙(𝑡,𝑝)=|subtoken (t)|∩|subtoken (p)|

Match Accuracy (EM Acc), in which the order of the subtokens are
also taken into consideration.
4.3 Implementation Details
We use Transformer with 6 layers, hidden size 512, and 8 attention
heads for both encoders and decoders. The inner hidden size of thefeed-forward layer is 2048. We use javalang
2to parse the java code
to extract the contexts. The details of different contexts and target
names (subtoken) lengths are shown in Table 2.
In our experiments, we set the in-file project-specific context
length to 30, the cross-file project-specific context length to 30, the
local context length to 55 (variable length (50) + parameter andreturn type length (5)), the documentation context length to 10.
Andthemaximumtargetnamelengthissetto53.Weusethesame
vocabulary for the input source code and the target method name
and build another vocabulary for the documentation context. The
vocabularysizeforthesourcecodeissetto20,000,andthevocabu-
lary size for documentation is set to 10,000. The out-of-vocabulary
tokens are replaced by /angbracketleftUNK/angbracketright. To demonstrate the effectiveness
ofthecross-fileproject-specificcontext,weconductexperiments
under the cross-project setting where the programs used in thetraining and test process are from different projects. Since morecontexts can be accessed, we assume that we can use fewer pro-grams to train the model. To verify the assumption, we train the

5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND RESULTS
To evaluate our proposed approach, in this section, we conduct
experiments to investigate the following research questions:
5.1 RQ1: Comparison against state-of-the-art
models
We compare GTNM with the following state-of-the-art method
name suggestion models:
1) code2vec [ 7]: an attention-based neural model, which performs
attentionmechanismoverASTpathsandaggregatesallofthepath
vector representations into a single vector. They considered the
methodnamepredictionasaclassificationproblemandpredicteda method’s name from the vector representation of its body.
2) code2seq [ 6]: an extended approach of code2vec, which employs
seq2seq framework to represent AST paths of the method body
node-by-nodeusingLSTMsandthenattendtothemwhilegenerat-
ing the target subtokens of the method name.
3) MNire [ 34]: an RNN-based seq2seq model approach to suggest a
method name based on the program entities’ names in the method
body and the enclosing class name.
4)DeepName[ 24]:anRNN-basedapproachformethodnameconsis-
tency checking and suggestion, using both internal and interaction
contexts for method name consistency checking and suggestion,
which achieves the state-of-the-art results on java method name
suggestion task.
Thefirstthreebaselinesdonotusethecross-fileproject-specific
context for the method name suggestion. To make the comparison
fair, we do not use the cross-file project context in this experiment.
We use the same dataset as MNire and DeepName to train our
model. For code2vec and code2seq, we download their publicly
availablesourcecodeandtraintheirmodelonthesamedatasets.
The results are shown in Table 3. Among these baselines, code2vec
andcode2seqonlyusethecontextinthemethodbodytopredict

where the exact-match didn’t occur but F1 was good. In the first

Amongthesecases,only2.32%ofmethodshavethesamesubtoken

AlthoughMNireandDeepNamealsoconsiderthecontextsbe-
yond the method body, the contexts extracted by their approaches
are different from ours. They only consider the contexts directlyinteracting with the target method, such as the sibling methods,
callersmethods,andcalleesmethods.However,themethodswhich

videessentialinformationforunderstandingthefunctionalityofthe

erful backbone model to model the contexts, which is based on the
self-attentionmechanism.Besides,wealsogivetheproject-specific
contextsmoreattentionweightsbyapplyinginvokedweightma-
trix. When generating the names of the target method, different
decoder layers are utilized to focus on the contexts of different lev-
els. Thus, our model can achieve better performance than baseline
models.
Amongthesemetrics,theexactmatchaccuracyismuchmore
strict than the other three metrics, which calculates the percentage
of the predicted method names that are exactly the same as thegroundtruth.Theotherthreemetricsarebasedonthesubtokenoverlapping between the predicted names and the target names,
where the order of the subtokens is ignored. The results show that
ourmodelobtainslargerimprovementsonexactmatchaccuracy
and recall, which further demonstrates that the subtokens in thepredicted names generated by our model can cover much more
targetsubtokensthantheotherbaselines.Thereforeourmodelcan
fully and precisely describe the functionality of the method body.

5.2 RQ2: The contributions of contexts in the
same file
Inthepreviousexperiment,weconsidercontextsofthesamefile
(i.e., local context, in-file project-specific context, and documen-
tation context) for generating the method name. To answer this
research question, we conduct experiments using different context
combinations. As shown in Table 5, the first row shows the results
of only taking the source code token sequence in the method body
as input. The second row presents the result of using the local con-
text(i.e.,theentities’namesofthemethodsignatureandvariables)
as input to suggest the method name. The third row shows theresultsofusingboththein-fileproject-specificcontextandlocal
context.Thelastrowgivestheresultsofusingallthreecontexts:
local, in-file project-specific, and documentation context.
AsseenfromTable5,comparingtheresultsofusinglocalcon-
text(sequencelengthis55)withtheresultsofusingsourcecode
tokensequence(sequencelengthis200),theperformanceiscompa-
rable,andusingthelocalcontextcanachievehigherexactmatch
accuracy. However, the length of the local context is much shorter
than the source code token sequence, which demonstrates that the
local context extracted by our model contains enough information
aboutthefunctionalityofthemethodbody,andtheshortercontext
canimprovethecomputationalefficiencyofthemodel.Whenwe
further incorporating the project-specific context information, the
performance is improved by a large margin. Specifically, the F1
score and exact match accuracy significantly increase from 66.89%
and 50.95% to 73.46% and 59.51%. The substantial improvementshows that the project-specific context, which can offer knowl-edge about the project information, is essential and efficient for
improving the performance of method name recommendation.
Whenthedocumentationinformationisadded,theperformance
is further improved. However, in our whole dataset, only about20% of the methods have the document information. Thus, formost of the methods, the documentation context information is
missing.Todirectlyillustratethecontributionofthedocumentation
contextinformation,weextractthosedocumentedmethodsfrom
thewholedatasetandpresenttheresultsontheextracteddataset.
As shown in Table 6, the first row shows the results of our full
model on the extracted dataset, and the second row shows theresults of removing the documentation context from the input.
When removing the documentation context, the performance is
decreased by 5.1 in precision, 5.9 in recall, 5.5 in F1, and 6.5 inexact match accuracy, respectively. The results demonstrate that
the documentation context can provide useful information for the
method name suggestion.
5.3 RQ3: The contribution of cross-file context
Whenconsideringthecross-fileproject-specificcontext,weneed
to preserve the project structure of the programs in the dataset.
Sincemorecontextualinformationcanbeaccessed,weassumethatTable 7: Performance of using cross-file project-specific con-

the model can be trained in a low-resource setting, that is, fewerprograms are needed for training the model. Thus, we only use

6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Qualitative Analysis
We perform qualitative analysis on the human-written method
names and method names which are automatically generated by
GTNM.Inmostcases,thenamesgeneratedbyGTNMareexactly
the same as the human-written names. To figure out in what cases
our model generates different names with human, we randomly
sample 200 cases where the names generated by our model are
different from the ground truth from the test to analyze the results.

this, GTNM tends to generate a longer name that contains more in-
formationaboutthemethod’sfunctionality.Inthisexample,GTNM
suggests a more detailed name “add path if not exists”, which indi-
catesthattheobjectandtheusagescenarioofthetargetmethod.
Our modelcan learn thisdetailed informationfrom the documen-
tation, parameters, and the method body. In the whole test set, 25%
of the wrong cases belong to this situation.
Synonyms. As shown in method 2, the human-written name and
the name generated by our model have the same meaning, andthe verbs used in these two names are synonyms (“join in” and“append”). Since “join in” is not as often used as “append” in the
methodnames,andthecontexts(includingtheproject-specificcon-text,localcontext,andthedocumentationcontext)alsodonotoffer
the relevant information about it. Thus, GTNM cannot correctly
suggestthesubtokens“joinin”.However,thenamegeneratedby
ourmodelcanalsopreciselydescribethefunctionalityofthetarget
method, which is also semantic consistent and acceptable.
Acronym. In method 3, the human-written name contains an
acronymforthespecificentities,i.e.,“du”for“definitionuse”,which
our model cannot correctly infer. Based on the given contexts,

GTNM suggests a name that has a similar style with the project-
specific context, but fails to suggest the acronym for specific entity
names.
Different Word Orders. As shown in method 4, the subtokens in
thehuman-writtennameandGTNMsuggestednamearealmost
thesame(exceptfor“removals”and“remove”),butthesubtoken
orders are different. In this example, the different orders do not
affectthesemanticofthemethodname,andbothofthetwonames
expressthesamemeaning.However,inothercases,thesemanticof
thenameswithdifferentsubtokenordersmightbedifferent.0.7%
of the wrong cases belong to this situation.
6.2 Length analysis
We further analyze the generated name length distribution and the
performance of GTNM for different name lengths. As shown in
Figure3,thelengthsofthemethodnames(thenumberofsubtokensinthemethodname)mainlyrangefrom2to3.Ourmodelgeneratesfewernamesoflength1,andgeneratedmorenameswithlengths4and 5. Among all the methods, only 13.78% of the names generated
by our model are shorter than the ground truth. We apply the
Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test (WRST) [ 44] to test whether the increase
in the method name length is statistically significant, and all the
p-valuesarelessthan1e-5,whichindicatesasignificantincrease.
We also use Cliff’s Delta [ 29] to measure the effect size, and the
valuesarenon-negligible. Thus,ourmodeltendstosuggest more
detailed names for the method. Besides, we also give the exactmatch accuracy of different lengths. As the length increase, the
method naming task becomes harder. Even though our model can
still achieve more than 50% accuracy for the names of length 5.
6.3 Explainability Analysis
Lack of explainability is an important concern in many complex
AI/MLmodelsinSE[ 35,40].Itiscrucialtoensurethatthemodel
islearnedcorrectlyandthelogicbehindthemodelisreasonable,
which is also important for method name recommendation task.
In this section, we analyze the explainability of GTNM. We em-
ploy model’sconfidence aboutits predictionto decidewhether toacceptthemodel’srecommendation.PredictionConfidenceScore
(PCS)[47]whichdepictstheprobabilitydifferencebetweenthetwoclasses with the highest probabilities is a measure for evaluatingmodel’s confidence. In our model, the Pearson Correlation Scorebetween PCS and F1-score of the generated names is 0.612 and
p-value <0.05, demonstrating that the correctness of the generated
name isclosely related tothe model’s confidenceabout its predic-
tion.Thus,userscandecidewhethertoacceptthegeneratednamesdependingonthecase’serrortoleranceandthemodel’sconfidence.
6.4 Threats to Validity
Threatstoexternalvalidity relatetothequalityofthedataset
we used and the generalizability of our results. We evaluate our
approach on the Java dataset, which is a benchmark dataset formethod name suggestion, and has been used in previous work
[6,7,34]. All of the programs in the dataset are collected from top-
ranked and popular GitHub repositories. Thus, most-of-the-names
are expected consistent. However, there still exist a few cases that
thenameisinconsistentasshowninsection6.1.Besides,further
studiesarealsoneededtovalidateandgeneralizeourfindingsto
other programming languages. Furthermore, our case study is on a
smallscale.Moreuserevaluationisneededtoconfirmandimprove
the usefulness of our model.
Threatstointernalvalidity includetheinfluenceofthemodel
architectural choices and the hyper-parameters used in our model.
Thehyper-parametersandarchitecturalchoiceswereobtainedbya
mixofsmall-rangerandomgridsearchandmanualselection.Thus,
there is little threat to the hyper-parameter choosing, and there
might be room forfurther improvement.However,current settings
have achieved a considerable performance increase.
Threats to construct validity relate to the suitability of our eval-
uation measure. We adopted the measure used by the previousmethod name recommendation work [
5–7,34], which measured
precision, recall, and F1 score over subtokens, and exact match
accuracy.Thisisbasedontheideathatthequalityofthegeneratedmethodnameismostlydependantonthesub-wordsthatwereused
to compose it.

7.1 Code Representation
Code representation is a hot research topic in both software en-
gineeringandmachinelearningfields.Differentneuralnetwork-
basedapproacheshavebeenproposedforrepresentingprograms
asvectors,whichcanbedividedintothefollowingcategories:(1)
source code token (subtoken) sequence - Using the source codetoken sequence as input. (2) AST node sequence - Using the flat-tened AST node sequence as input. (3) AST paths - Using a paththrough the AST as input. (4) Graph - Extending ASTs throughadding edges to build the graph as input. (5) Program entities -

RNN-based encode-decoder framework to generate the subtokens
of the method name.
7.2 Neural Machine Translation
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) [ 45] is an end-to-end learning
approach for automated translation. In recent years work of NMT
is largely based on encoder-decoder architecture [ 11], where the
encoder maps an input sequence of words 𝑥=(𝑥1,...,𝑥 𝑛)to a se-
quenceofcontinuousrepresentations 𝑧=(𝑧1,...,𝑧 𝑛).Given𝑧,the
decoderthengeneratesasequenceofoutputwords 𝑦=(𝑦1,...,𝑦 𝑚)
one token at a time, hence modeling the conditional probability:
𝑝(𝑦1,...,𝑦 𝑚|𝑥1,...,𝑥 𝑛). The encoder-decoder architecture has been
applied across many SE seq2seq tasks, including code summariza-
tion[5,19],methodnamerecommendation[ 7,34],codegeneration
[37,43],programtranslation [ 14], etc.Different neuralnetworks
can be used in the encoder and decoder. Code2seq [ 6] employs a
bi-directional LSTM to encode the AST paths then averages the
representations of all the paths as the final representation of theprogram encoder, and employs another LSTM as the decoder togenerate the output (method name or code summarization). Hu
etal.[19]useRNNforbothencoderanddecoderforcodecomment
generation task. Allamanis et al . [5]employ CNN to encode the
code snippet and use GRU as decoder to generate the tokens of the
methodname.Fernandesetal .[15]employGNNastheencoderand
LSTMasthedecoderforarangeofsummarizationtasks.Ahmad
etal.[3]usetransformernetworkforboththeencoderanddecoder

7.3 Method Name Recommendation
Recommendingmeaningfulandconsistentmethodnamesisimpor-tantforensuringreadabilityandmaintainabilityofprograms.Many
approaches have been introduced to suggest succinct names for
methods[ 5,7,34],wheredifferentmodelarchitecturesandmethod
contextsareconsidered.Inthissection,wesummarizerelatedwork
on method name recommendation from the following two aspects.
7.3.1 Models. Suzuki et al . [38]proposed an N-gram based ap-
proach to evaluate the comprehensibility of method names andsuggest comprehensible method names. Liu et al
. [28]follow an
information retrieval (IR) method with the motivation that two
methods with similar bodies should have similar names. They use
paragraphVectorandConvolutionalNeuralNetworkstoproduce
the vector representations of method names and bodies, respec-
tively.Theycomparedthesimilarityofthenamesretrievedfrom
themethodbodyvectorspaceandthemethodnamevectorspace
to identify the inconsistent method names. For the inconsistentnames, they use the names of methods whose bodies are similar
to the body of the input method to suggest the new method name.
However, methods with the same bodies can still have different
namessincetheyareindifferentprojectsandareunderdifferent
contexts. Besides, the IR-based approach cannot generate a new
name that it has not seen before. Another kind of researches based
on NMT models, where encoder-decoder framework is used to en-
code themethodbodies andgenerate themethod names[ 5,7,34].
Allamanis et al . [5]built a convolutional attentional network to
extract local features of the subtoken sequence from the methodbody, and then use these features to suggest names for methods.
Alon et al . [7]design attention-based neural network to encode
theASTpathsintovectors,andbasedonthepathrepresentation
to makepredictions on themethod’s name. Zügneret al. [48]pro-
posed Code Transformer, a Transformer-based language-agnostic
code representation model. They combined distances computed on
structure and context in the self-attention operation, which can
learnjointlyfromthestructureandcontextofprogramsrelyingon
language-agnosticfeatures. Theyappliedtheirrepresentationsto
thetaskofmethodnamesuggestion.Nguyenetal .[34]proposedan
RNN-based seq2seq approach to recommend method names and to
detectmethodnameinconsistencies.Theytaketheprogramentities
in the method body and enclosing class name as the input. Li et al .
[24]also developed an RNN-based seq2seq approach DeepName
for method name consistency checking and suggestion, which ex-
tended the contexts by considering the internal context, the caller
and callee contexts, sibling context, and enclosing context.
7.3.2 Method Contexts. Different method contexts are taken into
accountformethodnamerecommendation.Mostoftheresearch
only focused on exploiting the features from the method body,
wherethetokensequencesor ASTsofthemethodbodyaretaken
as the inputs. Allamanis et al . [5]considered the token sequence
from the method body and built a convolutional attentional net-
work to extract the features from the context. Alon et al . [7], Alon
etal.[6],Zügneretal .[48],andPengetal .[36]consideredtheAST
paths extracted from the method body as the context, and made
predictionsonthemethod’snamebasedonthepathrepresentation.Inadditiontothedatafromthemethodbody,manyresearchbegan
to include the information from a wide range of contexts. Nguyen
et al. [34]took the program entities in the method body and en-
closing class name as the input. Wang et al . [42]also considered
othermethodsintheprojectthathavecallrelationswiththetarget
method. Li et al . [24]further extended the contexts by considering
the internal context, the caller and callee contexts, sibling context,
and enclosing context. Inspired by these approaches, we further
considered the nested scopes of the project and the documentation
ofthemethodbyextractingtheproject-specificanddocumentation
context, which can help for suggesting accurate method names.
8 CONCLUSION
Inthispaper,weproposeGTNM,aglobalmethodnamesuggestion
approach, which considers contexts of different levels, including
localcontext,project-specificcontext,andthedocumentationofthetargetmethod.Weemployatransformer-basedseq2seqframework
to generate the method names, which uses the attention mecha-
nism to allow the model attending to different level contexts when
generatingthenames.TheexperimentalresultsonJavamethods
show that our model has a substantial improvement over baseline
models.
