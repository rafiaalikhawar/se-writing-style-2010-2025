for CI service providers could also improve the experience for ser-

the heavy and typical service consumer groups spend significantly
different proportions of time on seven of the nine build actions
(e.g.,dependencyretrieval).Ontheotherhand,thecompilationand

1 INTRODUCTION
Continuous Integration (CI) [ 9] is a software development practice
inwhichdevelopmentevents(e.g.,thecreationofandupdatesto
pull requests, pushes to central code repositories) trigger build,
test,andreportingroutinesautomatically.ThemaingoalofCIis
to provide fast feedback to developers, allowing them to verify
whethertheirchangescleanlyintegratewithotherchanges.Indeed,
the benefits of CI, such as increases in developer productivity and
improved software quality, have been observed by the software
development community [ 42]. Both open source [ 4] and propri-
etary[10,37]softwareorganizationshavededicatedresourcesto
maintaining and operating CI pipelines for this purpose.
Dedicatedcloud-basedCIproviders,suchasCircleCIandTravis
CI offer CI services for software organizations. These services pro-
vide consumers with the benefits of CI without the hassle of provi-
sioning, operating, and maintaining CI infrastructure.
The broad adoption of CI services has facilitated research on CI.
Researchershaveinterpretedtheoutcome[ 13]andduration[ 15]
of the builds run by these CI providers from the perspective of
the CI consumers, discussing the challenges and benefits of adopt-
ingCI[47].However,theCIproviders’perspectivehasremained
largely unexplored. Focusing on build data from the perspective of
CI service providers could uncover opportunities to holistically im-
provetheCIsolutionsthatswathsofsoftwareteamsrelyupon.Forexample,focusingoptimizationeffortonslowCIstagescoulddrivedown service costs for the CI service providers and simultaneously
provide fast feedback to their consumers.
Tothatend,weconductanexploratorycasestudyof CircleCI—

RQ1:HowdoestheusageofaCIservicechangeovertime?
Motivation: Studying the growth of CircleCI in terms of
active consumers and productivity heuristics may help to
identify specific areas that need attention to improve re-
source allocation and the overall user experience.Results:
During the last eight years, the CircleCI service
has grown, in terms of both monthly consumers and totalnumber of builds that are invoked every month. However,this growth has stagnated since mid-2020. At least 14% ofprojects that were inactive on CircleCI during 2020 have
startedusing another CIservice. Throughputand builddu-
ration have been increasing (up to 25 minutes per build and
900buildspermonth)fortheplatform’sheaviestconsumers,
while median values have remained stable. Inequality in
termsofbuildexecutionratesandresourceconsumptionhas
steadily increased to Gini coefficients of 95% and 98%.Recommendations:
Additional resource usage incurred by
growth could be tackled by applying build acceleration and
skipping approaches from the literature. The high successrate shows that there is a large pool of builds that couldlikely be safely skipped. Automated repair techniques can
be used to further reduce MTTR.
RQ2:How is time spent during signal-generating builds?
Motivation: Signal-generatingbuildsterminatewitheither
a pass or fail outcome. By understanding the time consump-
tion of different steps in the CI pipeline, service providers
canidentifyresourcebottlenecksandestimateoperational
costs. Identifying stages that slow down the CI pipeline can
allow researchers and developers to target the most impact-
ful stages.Results:
ComparedtootherstagesintheCIprocess,alarger
proportion(median35%)oftheCIruntimeisspentonthe
compilation and testing stages.Recommendations:
Focusingresearcheffortsonaccelerat-
ingtestingandcompilationstepsintheCIpipelinewillyield
the largest reductions to CI workload costs for CI providers
and feedback delays for CI consumers. The heaviest con-sumers will benefit most from the allocation of additional
networkbandwidthduringdependencyinstallationorthe
deployment of local mirrors of dependency archives.
RQ3:Why are some builds unable to provide a signal?
Motivation: Whenabuilddoesnotprovideasignal,devel-
opers are not provided with feedback about the changes
thattheyhavesubmitted.Sincereceivingearlyfeedbackisa
keyfeatureofCI,thesenon-signal-generatingbuildsarea
concern. Studying why builds fail early without providing a
signal can help service providers and researchers to developapproaches to mitigate such instances, yielding more robust
and available CI services.Results:

Theconsumers of CI services may subscribe with multiple
projects, each with its own CI workflow . A workflow is com-
prised of one or more jobs. The result of executing a workflow
is referred to as a build. CI services typically support specifying
workflows in a configuration file (e.g., .circleci/config.yml for
CircleCI, .travis.yml for Travis CI). Although this configura-
tion fileis primarily usedto specifythe sequence ofcommands to
be executed, other options can be customized like:
Parallelism: The number of parallel instances of a job to run.
Environment: Environment variables to be set for each build.
Resource Class: The compute resources allocated to each job.
Workflows can be configured to invoke builds based on develop-
mentevents(e.g.,whenapullrequestiscreatedorupdatedorwhen
a push to a central repository is performed), on a schedule (e.g.,
nightly), or manually (e.g., programmatically via an API requestor on-demand to retry a build without changing the code). Oncea build request is received, depending on the subscription of theconsumer and the workflow configuration of the project, a buildenvironment (e.g., a set of physical machines, virtual machines,
and/or containers) is allocated to execute the build.
2.1 CI Build Outcomes
CI builds are executed with the expectation that they will produce
asignalindicatingwhetherchangestothecodebasearereadyto
be integrated. However, in practice, build outcomes are not always
conclusive. Therefore, we categorize build outcomes as either:
Signal-generating. Buildsthatexecuteuntilapassingorfailing
outcomeisproduced.Ifabuildpasses,CIconsumersknow
that the associated changes to the codebase have at least
passed the baseline checks. If a build fails, CI consumers
can diagnose the problems with their changes while design
decisions are still fresh in their minds.
Non-signal-generating. Buildsthatareterminatedbeforecom-
pletion.Abuildcouldprematurelyterminateduetoauser
aborting the build, configuration errors, or infrastructure
provisioning issues. These builds do not provide consumers
with a meaningful signal about their changes.
In an ideal CI pipeline, all builds are signal generating. If non-
signal-generatingbuildsoccuroften,serviceconsumerswilllose
faith in a provider’s ability to deliver a meaningful CI signal.
2.2 CI Indicators
CIproviders haveproposedindicators totrackperformance inCI
pipelines. CircleCI1has recently proposed four such indicators:
Build Duration. The time taken for a build to execute. A long
duration may force developers to switch contexts—a costly
actionfor knowledgeworkerslikesoftware engineers[ 30].
Ashortdurationmayindicateinadequatetestingisincluded
in the CI workflow.
Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR). The average length of the
time interval between the end times of failing and subse-quent passing builds. A long MTTR suggests that failures

are difficult to diagnose or resolve, or a lack of build sta-
tus monitoring. A short MTTR suggests that consumers are
quicklyresolvingbuildfailureswithouttoomuchdisruption.
Success Rate. The proportion of signal-generating builds with

textsensitive.Thesuccessrateinthemainbranchwherea
large team collaborates should be kept high to avoid imped-
ing development progress. On the other hand, the success
rateinadeveloper-specificfeaturebranchmaybeirrelevant.
Throughput. Thenumberofbuildsthatareperformedduringa
given period of time. Throughput may vary across projects
based on the development model and the team size. This
metric gives an indication of expected total server load and
network bandwidth usage for the CI service provider.
These four indicators provide insight into the maturity of CI
adoptionamongCircleCIconsumers.Individualsoftwareorgani-
zations also may find these indicators useful to understand how
their CI usage compares with others. Recently, CircleCI startedproviding these metrics to their users on a per-workflow basis
within their web interface. In this study, we use these indicators to
characterize the growth of CI usage over time.
3 STUDY DESIGN
In this section, we provide our rationale for studying CircleCI
(Section3.1),anddescribeourdataextraction(Section3.2)anddata
analysis approaches (Section 3.3).
3.1 Subject CI Provider

(see DE2 of Figure 1). A corpus of 8,259 projects survive this filter.

determine why these fields are incomplete. We also remove builds

Observation 1 : The number of builds per month across all studied
projects grew over the years, reached a peak of 872,842 builds during
the month of April 2020, and then declined. Competitive pricing and
new features offered by other service providers such as GitLab
CI and GitHub Actions—GitHub’s own automation service—may
havecontributedtoauserexodusfromCircleCI.Forinstance,com-
pared to the 250 free minutes of build time per month in CircleCI,

al.found that projects with longer build durations are less likely to
abandon CI, suggesting that projects with more complex builds are
better able to adapt the CI service to fit their needs.
To explore whether other CI service providers are attracting
users away from CircleCI, we investigate the CI usage of projects
thathavestoppedusingCircleCI.Forthispurpose,wefocuson
projectsthathavenotexecutedanyCIbuildson CircleCIduring
2020, the last year of our analysis. We find that 39% (3,074 of 7,795)
projects match this criteria. Then, we query the GitHub API to
determine if these projects have reported the result of a build from
anyotherCIserviceduringtheyear2020oriftheyhaveconfigured
GitHub Actions to execute any CI workflows.
Observation 2 : At least 14% (425 of 3,074) projects that were inac-
tive onCircleCI duringthe year 2020have startedusing anotherCI
service.WefoundthatprojectsthatbecameinactiveonCircleCI
migratedtootherCIproviderssuchasTravisCI(50%),GitHubAc-
tions(35%),AppVeyor(16%),Scrutinizer(2%),andSemaphoreCI
(2%). The inactive projects on CircleCI had configured at least 20
different CI services to report results back to GitHub. Some of
these projects were configured to use more than one CI service,
therefore the sum of percentages exceeds 100%.

this,themedianMTTRstayedintherangeof12–87mins.Similarly,
the CircleCI study7reported that 50% of the workflows recovered

13], these projects
could be takinga long time torecover from build failuresbecause
the software teams are not taking the CI signal seriously. Onlya small proportion of software teams may be focusing on fixingbroken builds. For the benefit of software teams who are truly

success rates were 80% for the default branch and 58% for the non-

of CI builds, the newly introduced changes are not causing any
buildfailures.Ifthesechangesthatarenotcausinganybuildfail-
urescanbeidentifiedinadvance,theexecutionofsuchCIbuilds
can be completely skipped, saving time and compute resources.
Abdalkareem et al.[1] have proposed a machine learning approach
to identify such commits that can be skipped. Jin and Servant [ 23]
haveproposedtoreducethehighcostofCIbyrunningfewerbuilds,
while running as many failing builds as early as possible. Similarly,
Ananthanarayanan etal.[3]haveproposedtouseaprobabilistic
model,poweredbylogisticregressiontoselectbuildsthataremostlikely to succeed, and speculatively execute them in parallel. These
approaches to skip builds can be used by CI providers to prioritize
builds that can uncover faults early without wasting computing
resources on the growing proportion of passing builds.
Figure4(d)showsthatthemedianthroughputremainedunder
30throughoutthestudiedperiod(roughlyonebuildperday).How-
ever, for 5% of the studied projects, the throughput grew rapidlyand reached a peak of 900 builds per month. Confirming our ob-servations, the CircleCI study
7reported that 50% of workflows
were invoked fewer than one time per day (0.7), while in the top
5%, workflows were invoked over 35 times per day.
Observation 4 : Inequality of build execution and resource consump-
tion has steadily increased over time. To further investigate the

compute the Gini coefficient [ 16], a popular measure of inequality.

in approaches that optimize the workloads of their heaviest con-
sumers.
Although the demand for CI has rapidly grown over the
years, CI providers have managed to provide a consistentservice for the regular consumers. However, to cater to theheaviest consumers who account for a growing proportion
of the build activity and resources, CI providers may benefit
fromresearchbreakthroughsintheareasofbuildaccelera-
tion, and automated build and program repair.
(RQ2) How is time spent during
signal-generating builds?
RQ2: Approach. To answer RQ2, we focus our analysis on signal-
generatingbuilds.TheCircleCIAPIresponseprovidesstartand
endtimesforeachstepinagivenbuild.Furthermore,eachstephas
anactiontypewhichis machine,infrastructure,checkout,dependen-
cies, compile, test, database, deployment, orteardown. We use the
action type and runtime of each build step to compute the percent-
ageofruntimespentexecutingeachactiontypeinabuild.Then,
weapplytheScott-KnottEffectSizeDifference(ESD)test[ 39]to
clustertheactiontypesofbuildstepsintostatisticallydistinctranksbasedontheproportionofthebuildtimespentoneachactiontype.
Moreover, we investigate whether the time spent during the
signal-generating builds of heavy consumers is different from typi-
calconsumers. Afteridentification ofheavy consumers,we apply
the Mann–Whitney U test [ 27] and Cliff’s Delta [ 7] statistical in-
struments.Weusethosetestsbecausetheyallowforcomparison
of the runtime distributions of build steps in heavy and typical
consumer categories without an assumption of normality.
In this RQ, note that we are investigating how time is spent
performingdifferentactionsduringbuildsandnottheamountof
timespentoneachaction.Therefore,wefocusonrelativevalues
instead of absolute values with regard to durations.RQ2:Results.

projects that generate many builds/many action types. Because we
chose to focus on the overall impact of each action type on the CI
service providers, we believe that the influence of aggregate builddata is relevant for the service providers.
However, as we observe in RQ1, the heaviest consumers exhibit
different behaviour than others. Figure 7 shows the distribution of
monthlybuildtimeconsumptionacrossallstudiedprojects.Guidedbythis,weselect1%oftotalmonthlybuildtimeconsumptionasthethresholdforidentifyingprojectsthatheavilyuseCI.Basedonthis
threshold, we identify 27 of 7,795 projects as heavy CI consumers.
We conservatively selected this threshold based on the distribu-
tionofconsumptiondatawhichfollowsalognormaldistribution
(Anderson-Darlingnormalitytest[ 38]forlog-transformedvalues,
𝛼=0.05). Inthe log-transformed distribution,our 1% thresholdis
5.7 standard deviations away from the mean and therefore projects
above the threshold are certainly outliers (typically 2–3 SDs away
from the mean).

source consumption of heavy CI consumers compared to typical
consumers ( 𝑝<2.2×10−16) for all action types except deployment
andcompile. The deployment andcompileaction types had insuffi-
cient evidence (i.e., one and zero observations respectively) among
the builds of heavy consumers to reach any conclusions. Basedon Cliff’s delta, effect sizes are large for infrastructure, checkout,
database, andteardown action types.The effect size ismedium for
thedependencies action type, while for the machineandtestaction
types the effect sizes are small.
As heavy consumers account for an increasing portion of re-
source consumption, catering to their needs will have a substantial
effectonCIprovidersaswell.Forexample,heavyconsumersare
spending more time downloading dependencies during the CI pro-
cesscomparedtotypicalconsumers.Therefore,ifacceleratingthose

the bandwidth demand, as proposed in prior work [ 12], because it
will eliminate the need to download dependencies for some builds.

approaches to optimize dependency installation.
(RQ3) Why are some builds unable to provide a
signal?
RQ3: Approach. First, we use an open coding approach on a ran-
domized sample to study the reasons why builds failed to generate
a signal. Next, we evaluate the identified set of reasons (i.e., codes)
by developing scripts to label example builds automatically. We
alsomanuallycodea sampleofthescript-classifiedbuildstoeval-
uate correctness. Finally, we group codes according to common
themes.Below,wedescribeoursampling,discovery,validation,and
grouping procedures in more detail.
Sampling . The bottom six rows of Table 1 show the outcomes of
1.69 million non-signal-generating builds. Since coding all of these
builds is impractical, we select a random sample for coding.
Ourgoalistodiscoverascompleteofasetofreasonsforwhy
signals could not be generated for builds as possible. Therefore,
we strive to achieve saturation with our codes. Similar to prior
work[22],wecoderandomlyselectednon-signal-generatingbuilds
until no new codes are discovered for 50 consecutive builds.
We aim to achieve saturation separately for each outcome type
(provided by CircleCI) of non-signal-generating builds. We reach
saturationaftercoding53,53,50,50and116buildsfor canceled ,
infrastructure_fail ,timedout ,no_tests , and NULLoutcome

Observation 7 : At least 371,647 builds failed to generate a signal
duetoavailabilityissuesoftheCIserviceandthesupportingservices.
A CI service that is available and reliable is essential to provid-
ing prompt feedback to consumers. However, we observe multiple
instances where the CI service or the supporting services were
unavailable.Weobservethat10,993buildswhichwereunableto

ing to CircleCI forum discussions,8builds can terminate with the
infrastructure_fail outcome due to faults in CircleCI inter-
nalinfrastructureorotherservicesthatarecontactedduringthe
builds (e.g., GitHub, AWS). Although builds that terminate due to
infrastructure failures are restarted automatically, it wastes time
and resources.

Of the builds with a NULLoutcome, 359,857 builds were not exe-

To put these rates of failure in context, let us presume that CI
providerslikeCircleCIarestrivingtoachieveindustry-standard

fallsalittlebitshortofthisstandard(98.41%=100%-1.59%),but
it is a goal that is not too far out of reach. Since we do not have
access to the internals of CircleCI service, we cannot pinpoint the
specific architectural shortcomings that lead to availability issues.
However,sincepriorresearchhasidentifiedthatinvestingeffort
indisasterrecovery,fastfailuredetection,andeliminatingsingle
points of failure [ 29] help to improve availability in cloud services,
we recommend CI services in general to direct their attention to
such best practices.
Observation 8 : The vast majority of cancelled builds (92%) were
cancelled by user request. We observe that 50% of the non-signal-

Observation 9 :17,917buildstimedoutbeforecompletion. Ifthereis
nooutputfromanyofthecommandsduringbuildexecutionfortenminutes,CircleCIterminatesthebuild.Weobservethatbuildstime
out at all stages of the CI process (e.g., setting up the environment,
installing dependencies, testing). Currently, consumers can extend
the timeout in the CI configuration if they expect a build stepto continue longer than ten minutes without output. However,programmatically determining if a program will terminate is aform of undecidableproblemknownas the halting problem [
40].
Therefore,usingonlythesourcecodechangestobebuilt,CIservice
cannot determine if a build will eventually terminate if given more
timeorwillhangforever.Althoughterminationanalysisresearch
has proposed automatic tools to determine whether some builds
will eventually terminate, implementing such solutions in a CI
servicetosupportamultitudeofprogramminglanguagesandbuild
tools is infeasible. Instead, CI services can use recent past buildoutcomes to speculate that a build will time out, similar to how
9https://status.circleci.com/incidents/kxw3dyhykqkbSmartBuildSkip[ 23]operatesbasedonthehypothesisthatfailing
builds in CI happen consecutively after another build failure.
Observation 10 : At least 31,238 builds failed to generate a signal
due to misconfigurations. There are three codes that are associated
with misconfigurations that lead to signals not being generated. At
least31,238buildswith NULLoutcomesdidnotcompletebecause
the CI process was not properly configured (e.g., 30,065 builds
with missing or outdated CircleCI configuration files, 26 builds
specifyinganunsupportedXcodeversion,23buildswhereGitHub
was missing a CircleCI SSH key). Adoption of tools such as CI-
Odor[43]andHansel&Gretel[ 14]proposedinpriorresearchto
identifyandfixconfigurationerrorsmayreducefutureoccurrences
of the builds terminating due to misconfiguration.
Furthermore,someconfigurationissuesareresolvedovertime
by the service provider. For example, in platform version 1.0 of
CircleCI, if a command was not defined for the testing phase ofthe CI process, the build terminated with the special outcome of
No tests . To prevent this behaviour from interfering with their
workflow, CircleCI consumers had to include an explicit no-op
command in the testing phase of their CI configuration. We found
that36,184buildsterminatedwithabuildoutcomeof No tests .In
version 2.0 of the CircleCI platform, this requirement was relaxed
such that a test section was not required for build job execution.
Availability issues, configuration errors, user cancellation,
andexceedingtimelimitsarekeyreasonsthatleadtonon-
signal-generatingbuilds.Approachestoincreasetheavail-

5 THREATS TO VALIDITY
This section describes the threats to the validity of our study.
5.1 Construct Validity
We use the mapping of commands and action types provided by
CircleCIAPItodeterminetheCIstageforeachcommandandthencomputethetimedistributionforeachsignal-generatingbuild.The
accuracy of this mapping depends on CircleCI’s labelling. To miti-
gate this threat, we manually inspected a sample of 50 commands
and their assigned action types for consistency.
SomeCIconsumersmayhaveconfiguredCIbuildsthatfinish
quicklyandreturnasuccessfulbuildoutcomeinsecondswithout
executing any useful tests. In such situations, metrics such as build
duration and success rate will not provide value as indicators of
theeffectivenessofCI.Therefore,wedonotpromotethesemetrics
asgoalsforsoftwareteams.Instead,weusethemasindicatorsof
service usage from the CI providers’ perspective.
5.2 Internal Validity

(e.g., social coding platform integration, container-based orchestra-
tion, job-based parallelism support for projects that target multiple

otherserviceproviders.Nevertheless,replicationstudiesinother
contexts might prove fruitful.
6 RELATED WORK
In this section, we situate our work in the context of the literature
ontheanalysisofCIdata,thechallengesassociatedwithCI,and
the service provider perspective in other DevOps contexts.
6.1 Analysis of CI Datasets
The analysis of large collections of historical CI data is not uncom-
mon in the literature. For example, the Travis CI service has been
the target of several research efforts. Beller et al.’s TravisTorrent [6]
provides a curated set of data about 2.6 million builds from the
Travis CI service. Their initial analysis indicates that testing is
thesingledominantreasonforbuildstofail[ 5].Durieuxetal.[ 8]
have curated an even larger set of 35 million Travis CI jobs. Using
independentcollectionsof TravisCIdata,Hiltonetal.[ 21]studied
how developers use CI and Rausch et al. [ 33] performed a targeted
analysisofbuildfailuresinthecontextofJavaopensourcesystems.
Similarly, Zhang et al. [ 50] have studied 6.9 million CI builds to
identify the ten most common compiler error types. Complement-
ingtheworkonbuildcategorizationsbasedonfailures,inourwork,
we categorize the build outcome based on whether a signal was
provided to the consumer at the end of the build.
Priorworkhasdemonstratedthatthesecorpora,madeoflarge
collections of operational data, are not free of noise. Gallaba etal. [
13] found that, on average, there is at least one build with
an inaccurate outcome in every eleven builds that they analyze.Zolfagharinia et al. [
52] described the build inflation problem in
an analysis of 30 million builds from the Perl ecosystem. Felidréet al. [
11] identified four characteristics of projects that use CI
technology without adopting CI principles. Since our focus is to
provide the CI provider’s perspective of the overall usage of the CI
service, we do not remove noisy builds from our analysis.
A line of work on anti-patterns has emerged from the studies
of CI data. Gallaba et al. [ 14] formulate four anti-patterns thatimpact CI specifications, and propose Hansel & Gretel to detect
and repairthem. Vassallo et al.[ 43] identifiedfour additional anti-
patternsthathinderthebenefitsassociatedwithCI,andpropose
CI-Odor to detect them. Zampetti et al. [ 49] studied Q&A forums
to identify 79 CI smells. Since slow build durations hinder thepace of development, Ghaleb et al. [
15] characterize builds with
longdurations.WhilethesepriorworksadopttheCIconsumers’
perspective, we focus on the CI providers’ perspective to facilitate
all users amidst the presence of anti-patterns.
Collectionsofbuilddatahavealsobeenusedtostudythelinksbe-
tweentheadoptionofCIandotherprojectcharacteristics.Vasilescu
et al. [41,42] observe an increase in developer-reported bugs after
theintroductionofCI,suggestingthatCIhelpsdevelopersdiscover
more defects. Zhao et al. [ 51] report that the introduction of CI
technology is associated with a higher rate of successful pull re-quests; however, pull requests tend to take longer to arrive at an
outcome. Instead offocusing on individual projectcharacteristics,
we focus on the overall state of the CI service over time.
6.2 Challenges in CI
Researchers have also studied the challenges faced when software
teams are adopting CI. By conducting a qualitative study, Hiltonet al. [
20] found that when using CI, developers face trade-offs
betweenspeedand certainty,better accessand security,and more
configurationoptionsandeaseofuse.Pintoetal.[ 32]surveyed158
CI users about the benefits and problems of CI systems and found
thatdevelopersareunsureaboutwhatconstitutesasuccessfulbuild,due to reasons such as flaky tests or misconfigured CI jobs. Widderetal.[

thatslowfeedbackduetolong-runningbuildsandconfiguration
issuescausingnon-signal-generatingbuildsarecommoninpractice,
strengthening the conclusions from prior work.
6.3 DevOps Service Providers’ Perspective

scale DevOps services. Schermann and Leitner [ 36] propose using

7 CONCLUSIONS & LESSONS LEARNED
Through an empirical study of 23.3 million builds from the popular
CircleCI service, we set out to better understand the challenges
thatCIserviceprovidersfaceandtheopportunitiesthatarepresent.
We make ten observations (see Section 4) from which we conclude
thatpriorresearchinnovationsarewell-suitedtoaddresscurrent
limitations in CI services:
The rapidly growing build throughput and build durations
ofheavyconsumers(Observation3)suggestthatbuildaccel-
erationapproachesareneededtostemthisrisingtide. Large
softwareorganizationslikeMicrosoftandGooglehaveproduced
internalsolutionstoacceleratebuilds[ 10];however,theiradoption
inothersettingspresentschallenges.ApproacheslikeKotinos[ 12]
strive to make accelerated builds accessible to other organizations.
ThehighrateofsuccessfulbuildssuggeststhatCIprovidershavea
growingpoolofcandidatebuildswithwhichtoapplytechniques
proposed in the literature to skip builds. For example, candidate
approaches [ 1] aim to save resources and time by skipping the exe-
cutionofbuildsthatareunlikelytofail.Priorwork[ 2]estimates
that 18% of successful builds could be skipped, equating to 3.38
millionbuilds inoursetting —leading toconsiderablesavings for
aproviderlikeCircleCI.Furthermore,CIproviderscanconsider
offering suggestions to developers to fix build errors by using auto-matedrepairtechniqueslikeBuildMedic[
26],HireBuild[ 19],and
DeepDelta[ 28],therebyreducingtheMTTR.Vassalloetal.[ 45]
have shown that suggesting public solutions to build breakages,
which can be found online, reduces the time to fix breakages by an
average of 37%.
Hypothesis: Tools and techniques for accelerating builds
will help manage the rapid growth in build throughput and
build durations.
Focusing optimization effort on compilation and testingstages will likely provide the most benefit.
Most of the build
timeisspentinthecompilationandtestingstagesforalargepropor-
tionof serviceconsumers(Observation 5).Therefore,approaches
to optimize compilation and testing steps effectively reducing their
run time or skipping such steps altogether, are well suited to drive
downservicecostsand improve thr oughput.Forexample,research
in the Facebook context has shown that using one such strategy,predictive test selection [
25], can reduce the total infrastructure
costoftestingcodechangesbyafactoroftwo.Yettherearechal-
lenges that make adopting such approaches difficult in the (global)
contextofaCIprovider.Forexample,theplethoraofbuildtools,lan-guagetoolchains,andtestingframeworksmakestool-andlanguage-
specific approaches [ 1,17,19,48] unlikely to yield optimal results.
Any provider-side solution will need to operate in the heteroge-
neous deployment environment in which CI services operate.Hypothesis: Language-agnosticsolutionsinCIservicesto
optimize compilation and testing stages will be most benefi-
cial to reduce build durations.
Providing more transparency regarding orphaned buildsmayimprovetheuserexperience.
Orphanedbuildsconstitutea
largeproportionofthebuildsthatareaffectedbyavailabilityissues
(Observation 7). These builds do not provide any details about the
internalfailuresthatcausedthedisruptionoftheserviceandarenotlinkedfromGitHub.Tousers,orphanedbuildsareentirelyopaque
servicefailures,whichmayimpacttheirperceptionoftheservice
provider.Therefore,providingdetailedreportingandtraceability
for orphaned builds will improve the user experience, helping to
retain and attract consumers for the CI service.
Hypothesis: Providingvisibilityaboutorphanedbuildswill
improve customer retention and growth.
Serviceproviderscanuserecentpastbuildoutcomestoiden-tify builds that are likely to timeout.
We find 17,917 builds
timedoutwithoutgeneratingasignal(Observation9).Timedout
buildstakethefullallocatedtimereservedtoperformabuildanddonotprovideachangestatussignal.Therefore,althoughthesebuilds
accountforasmallpercentageofallbuilds,fromtheperspective
ofbothCIprovidersandconsumers,timedoutbuildsareawaste
of themaximum amountof resources andtime. However,due toits similarity to the halting problem, identifying builds that will
time out is not trivial. Instead, similar to SmartBuildSkip [ 23], CI
serviceproviders canuse heuristics(e.g., manytime-out buildsin
CIarefollowedbymoreconsecutivetime-outbuilds.)toskipbuilds
that are likely to time-out, saving resources.
Hypothesis: Heuristicssuchasfrequent time-outbuildsin
therecentpastcanbeusedtoidentifyandskipbuildsthat
are likely to time out.
Userresearchisneededtobetterunderstandwhybuildsarebeing cancelled by users.
Since one of the most common rea-
sons for abruptly terminating CI builds is cancellation by the user
(Observation8),futureresearchisneededtocharacterizethisbe-
haviour. For example, while cancellation may indicate that a build
wasunintentionallytriggered(e.g.,publishingaPRbeforeitwas
ready), there may be other cases that more careful user experience
engineering could help to mitigate.
Hypothesis: Userresearchwillhelptounderstandreasons
for user-cancelled builds.
In order to aid in future replication of our results, we make our
data and scripts publicly available online.10
