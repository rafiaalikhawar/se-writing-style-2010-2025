ABSTRACT
The development of open source software (OSS) is a broad field
which requires diverse skill sets. For example, maintainers help
lead the project and promote itslongevity, technical writersassist
withdocumentation,bugreportersidentifydefectsinsoftware,and
developersprogramthesoftware.However,itisunknownwhich
skills are used in OSS development as well as OSS contributors’
general attitudes towards skills in OSS. In this paper, we address
this gap by administering a survey to a diverse set of 455 OSS
contributors. Guided by these responses as well as prior literature
onsoftwaredevelopmentexpertiseandsocialfactorsofOSS,we
develop amodel ofskills in OSSthat considers the many contexts
OSScontributorsworkin.Thismodelhas45skillsinthefollowing
9 categories: technical skills, working styles, problem solving, con-
tribution types, project-specific skills, interpersonal skills, external
relations, management, and characteristics. Through a mix of qual-
itative and quantitative analyses, we find that OSS contributors are
actively motivated to improve skills and perceive many benefits
in sharing their skills with others. We then use this analysis to
derive asetofdesignimplications andbestpractices forthose who
incorporate skills intoOSStools andplatforms,such as GitHub.

At the crux of these roles are skills. Skills are critical to software
development, including the development of OSS. While OSS devel-
opment and software development are similar, OSS contributors
also work in contexts that are unique to OSS (e.g., consistently
collaboratinginadistributedform).Previousworkhasinvestigated
theexperience,expertise,andskillsofOSScontributorsinavariety
of contexts, such as maintainers [ 16], integrators [ 27], and men-
tors[5,59].Whileworksuchastheseprovidesomeideaofskills
thatarenecessaryforOSS,itdoesnotfullyconsiderthebroadsetof
circumstances that OSS contributors work in, such as contributors
whoprovideessentialnon-codecontributions[ 13].Priorworkalso
does not provide a set of skills relevant to OSS and furthermore,
howcontributors wouldlike toshare andimprove on them.
BybetterunderstandingskillsrelatedtoOSS,wecaninformthe

practices to leverage them as much as possible. In this paper, we
investigatetheskillswhicharerelevanttoOSSandcontributors’
relationship with skills.We define three research questions:
RQ1What are relevant skills forOSS?
RQ2HowdoOSScontributors growandimprove skills?
RQ3HowdoOSScontributors share anddisplay skills?

From the survey data, we further investigate contributors’ perspec-
tivesonskillsinOSS,namelyhowtheywouldliketoimproveskills
andhowthey wouldlike toshare theirskills.
In our study, we find that contributors themselves defined skills

following prior work [ 66].We define skills as anything that

tors. The broader definition of skill is exemplified by this response:
łSkills are anything that helps improve the project. This can in-
cludecoding,writingdocs,researchingbugs,triagingincomingbug
reportsand requests, and doing releases. Largerprojectsmay also
require skills that we see in commercial dev environments, such as
project management, product management, and planning release
schedules. And there is also a need for people skills like dealing
with conflict between project members, enforcing codes of conduct,
and otherskillsalong those lines. ž(P188)

2 BACKGROUND
Software engineering researchers have studied the skills and
expertisethatsoftwareengineersrelyon.Previousworkhasfound
thateffectivesoftskills(e.g.,communication,criticalthinking)[ 1,
18,49] and hard skills (e.g., fault localization, software design) [ 68]
arecrucialtosoftwareengineering.Baltesetal.developedatheory
of software engineering expertise with a focus on programming
expertisebeingformed[ 6].Lietal.uncovered56attributesofgreat
softwareengineers,focusingontheirsoftskills,suchaspersonal
anddecisionmakingcharacteristics[ 38].Inalaterstudy,Lietal.
foundthatdistinguishingtraitsofgreatsoftwareengineersincluded
payingattentiontocodingdetails,handlingcomplexity,andcon-
tinuouslyimprovingaswellasbeingopen-mindedandhonest[ 37].
However,thesemodelscannotbefullyappliedtoOSSdevelopment.
OSSdevelopmentreliesonrolesasidefromsoftwareengineering,
such ascommunitymanagers, technicalwriters[ 63],andpeople
withexternaldomainexpertise[ 32].Thus,ithasuniquecontexts
(e.g.,wranglingcontributors[ 16,27],identifyingfunding[ 16,63],
consistently collaborating in a distributed, remote form [ 26,27])
whichprior researchinthis area does not completely address.
Practitioners have previously discussed the various skills re-
quired in OSS communities. This includes social skills, such as
communication,collaboration,andadvocacy,aswellastechnical
skills,suchastoolsandtechnologies,programming,writingdoc-
umentation,andbugtriaging[ 4,11,20].LearningaboutOSSand
related skills have also occurred in academic settings. For instance,
universities have developed graduate degree programs and courses
onfree open-source software for studentsto becomeexpertsinthe
field [46,52]. Students have also been invited to participate in OSS
projectsaspartofclassassignmentstoteachcollaborativesoftware
engineering skills [ 35,58] and knowledge in OSS work practices
anddevelopmentprocesses [ 42].
Additionally, researchers have investigated contributor motiva-
tion. Contributors participate in OSS projects for self-marketing
and to fulfill personal software needs [ 2] as well as having fun
and giving back to others. [ 8]. Huang et. al found that contributors
involvedin OSSprojects forsocialgoodwere motivatedto join to
impact society and learn new skills [ 32]. Other research has also
studiedcareertrajectoriesofcontributors.Trinkenreichetal.found
that contributors often start their OSS career by łlurking" in the
community,suchasworkingwiththecodeorjoiningevents.Then,asinvolvementincreased,theywouldtakeoncodingornon-coding
roles.Contributors’careerswerenon-linear;theycouldswitchroles
throughout theircareers. [ 63]
Meanwhile, previous work in OSS has uncovered aspectsof be-
ingasuccessfulOSScontributoracrossavarietyofspecificcontexts.
However, this body of work does not provide a holistic model of
OSScontributorskillsorattributesacrosstheOSS ecosystem.For
example,previousworkhasindependentlystudiedmanyrolesin
OSS, such as attributes of maintainers [ 16], barriers of newcom-
ers[60,62]andmentors[ 5],thepracticesofintegrators[ 27],and
experiences of quasi-contributors (i.e., contributors who did not
have their contributions accepted) [ 61]. Other work has examined
howcontributions[ 65]andothercontributors[ 43,44]areevaluated
byOSS contributors onGitHub.

tion, advancement by level and experience, self-development, and
achieving personal satisfaction. Our work complements this by

3.2 Survey
To understand contributors’ perspectives on skills in OSS, we
distributedaQualtrics survey to OSS contributors onGitHub.

andinvestigatetheroleofskillsinOSS.Surveytopicsincluded:how
userscurrentlydisplayskillsrelevanttoOSS,identifyingrelevant

methods of displaying skills on GitHub. A subset of the survey
questions is displayed in Figure 1; the full survey instrument is
available inour supplementalmaterials[ 39].
Followingpreviouswork[ 32],weusedtheFDA’sdescriptionsof

andInclusivity[ 55]tocollectdemographicinformation.Weallowed
participantstoselectmultipleresponsesforthedemographicsre-
lated to ethnicity, gender, and role. While developing the survey,
an external researcher reviewed the survey and provided feedback
onthe wording ofthe questions.
SamplingStrategy. First,weidentifiedGitHubprojectstosample
potentialcontributorsfromtwolistsofOSSprojectspreviouslyused
by Huang et al. to study OSS communities [ 32]. The list Projects-
OSS4SGcontained 437 GitHub projects identified as OSS for social
good (OSS4SG), while the other list Projects-OSS contained 642
GitHubprojectsthat were not includedinthe firstlist.Next,we definedpopulationsbasedontheir contributiontypes
toeachproject:1)authoringcommits,2)openingissuesandpull
requests, and 3) commenting on others’ issues and pull requests.
Wechosetosampleusingdifferentcontributiontypestocapture
the diversity of roles that contributors take in OSS projects. We
sampledanddistributedthe survey intwophases.
InPhase 1, we focused on commits as a contribution type. We
identifiedthe top30contributorsbycommitcountforeachproject in
Project-OSS4SG andProject-OSS , which yielded population sizes of
5,905 and 6,256 contributors respectively. 1,856 users from OSS4SG
and2,692usersfromOSShadcontactinformationpubliclyavailable.
After removing duplicates, this resulted in 3,072 users who we
invitedto take the survey.
InPhase 2, we focused on issues and pull requests as contri-
bution types. We identified all contributors who submitted an is-
sueoropenedapullrequestin Project-OSS4SG (25,011users)and
Project-OSS (72,501 users). We also identified all GitHub users who
commentedonanothercontributor’sissueorpullrequestin Project-
OSS4SG(5,583users)and Project-OSS (5,065users).Fromthesefour
lists,weselecteduserswhoincludedcontactinformationintheir
public GitHub profile. We removed duplicate users across the four
sets and users who had already been distributed a survey from
Phase1. Thisresultedin28,847userswhoparticipatedinGitHub
issuesand pull requests. Due tothelargesize, we further reduced
thissettothe userswhohadopenedissues,pullrequests,orcomments

whowe invitedto take the survey.
Participants. Thesurveywassenttoatotalof9,095OSScontrib-
utors and received 455 responses, resulting in a response rate of
5%, which is comparable to other surveys in software engineering,
which range from 6% to 36% [ 57]. The slightly lower response rate
is due to the length of the survey, which was advertised as 20 min-
utes. Most participants completed the survey within 20 minutes,
withamediancompletiontimeof16minutes.Aftercompletingthe
survey, participants could join a sweepstakes to win one of four
$100 electronicgiftcards.

to discuss the resulting set of codes and their relationships and
to clarify the scope of each code. From this discussion, a shared

Next,theauthorsindependentlyperformedasecondroundof

authors convened againto discuss thescopeof the codes andadd
new codes by unanimous vote. In the second round, the authors
agreed on 78.2% of the codes; a moderate agreementwhich is also
comparabletootherempiricalsoftwareengineeringstudies[ 33,45].
Next, the rest of the items were divided into sections and each
author coded one of the sections independently. Afterwards, the
authors convened for one last discussion on the codes’ scopes and
addednewcodesbasedon unanimous vote,whichresultedinthe

To provide insight on improvingskills (RQ2) and displaying

assignedasingleauthor.Theassignedauthorthenreviewedatleast
100 responses and identified common themes across the responses
thatansweredtheprompt,eachofwhichcorrespondedtoacode.
Finally, each response was labeled with one or more codes. The
authors then met to discuss the codes and the emerging themes.
For the closed-ended questions, we used standard statistical analy-
sistechniques.Wereportpercentagesofhowfrequentlyanitem

4 SKILLSINOSS(RQ1)
Inthissection,wepresentthefindingsfortheresearchquestion:
łWhat are relevantskillsforOSS?žThroughreviewingrelevantliteratureandqualitativecoding,we
synthesized an OSS skills model with 45 skills across the following
9 categories: technical skills, working styles, problem solving, con-
tribution types, project-specific skills, interpersonal skills, external
relations,management, andcharacteristics(seeFigure 2).Overall,
we find that characteristics of the contributor underlie all other
skills and allows an individual to excel in other skills. The remain-
ingskillcategoriesaredirectlyrelatedtoeithertheOSScontributor,
project, or community, where management-related skills cross-cut
acrossallthree ofthesefunctions.
In analyzing survey responses, we find that participants de-
scribed skills in OSS broadly, and included formal skills as well
aspersonalattributes.Thus,ourmodelincludes anyinstanceofa
skillorattributelistedbyparticipantsthatcouldbeimprovedupon
by an individual . Below, we discuss this model and its categories in
further detail.Our full modelissummarizedinTable 1.
4.1 Model ofSkills in OSS
Technical Skills. TheTechnical Skills category encapsulates
technicalknowledgeandabilitiesneededtoperformaspecifictask.
Many of these skills were technology-related. Basic /caret_rightprogramming
skills,suchasdebugging,testing,andcodecomprehension,were
the mostcommonly mentionedskillinour model.Participantsar-
gued that programming skills were central to OSS development:
łBeing able to write working computer code and tests, kind of the
backbone of OSS. ž (P4) In this category, participants also frequently
mentionedskillsinmoreadvancedaspectsof /caret_rightsoftwareengineering ,
including best practices on software design, requirements engi-

trade offs of one solution over another. However, a critical com-
ponent to solving a problem is moving past thinking about the
problemanditssolutionsbyhaving /caret_rightinitiative toexecutesolving
the problem. One contributor summarized the problem solving
process succinctly: ł [Skills that] enable you to quickly assess the
situation, figureout whatneeds to bedoneand justdoit. ž(P83)
ContributionTypes. TheContributionTypes categoryencap-
sulates types of contributions to OSS projects. Most of these codes
were not explicitly mentioned in the literature sources but were
elicitedthroughparticipants. /caret_rightBugreporting ,whichencapsulates
identifyingdefectsinOSSproductsandprovidingclearandconcise
instructionstoreproduceit,aswellas /caret_rightbugtriaging ,whichdescribes
parsing through bug reports and prioritize them for the project,
were listedasOSS skills.The mostcommoncontributionbrought
up by participants was /caret_rightdocumentation , which is essential to teach
others howto useOSS orcontribute to aproject. Another typeof
contribution was /caret_rightvisual design , which describes competency in
designing,prototyping,ordevelopinguserinterfacesorgraphicart.
Participantsalsomentionedcontributingfeedbackthrough /caret_rightcode

nally,contributorsidentified /caret_righttranslation ofmaterialstodifferent
languages as a skill, such as ł contributing to Brazilian Portuguese
translationofrepositories. ž(P270)Thediversityofcontributionswas
vital to OSS, as one participant summarized: ł Most programmers

thosegaps.Programmerssuckas [sic]findingtheirownbugs,sousers
arecriticalto finding and fixingbugs. ž(P10)
Project-Specific Skills. TheProject-Specific Skills category is
skills related to the particular OSS project. Understanding and fol-
lowingproject /caret_rightprocesses,suchasł submittedpullrequesthascom-
prehensivedescription,withrequisiteautomatedtests ž(P43).Tomake
useful contributions, participants said that contributors should un-
derstand and believe in the project’s /caret_rightpurposeand its trajectory:
ł[One OSS skill is to] create a pull requests [sic]that fixes a bug or
adds a feature that is in line with the package mission statement and
doesn’t break any other functionality. ž (P91) This skill also includes
whether a contributor understands and is aligned with the broader
impactofOSSin theworld:ł [One OSSskill is to] havethecapacity
to understand the support you are giving to an emerging community,

oftheworld. ž(P31)Finally,knowingthe /caret_rightorganization ofaproject
helps contributors work more effectively by knowing where re-
sources are located in the repository as well as who to ask for help
basedonthe team members’ expertise.
Interpersonal Skills. TheInterpersonal Skills category refers
to skills used to interact with others. /caret_rightCommunication enabled
łasynchronous and distributed collaboration ž (P349), and was oneofthemosthighlycitedskillsfromliteratureandbyparticipants.
/caret_rightCollaboration wasalsoacommonthemefromparticipants.This
skill enabled groups of people with ł different culture, timezone and
skillsž (P284) to work with one another. Thus, skills in /caret_rightconflict
resolution helpedfacilitate teamwork inOSS teams.
Being/caret_rightkindwascentraltointerpersonalskills.Oneparticipant
explainedhowitfacilitatedcollaboration:ł Empathyisalsoatwo-
way street; understanding the communication patterns of othersand
realizing when someone isn’t too far gone to be guided back to a
path of productive communication is important... It takes skill to
workwith these people,de-escalate,and help guide themaway from
toxic behavior and back towards being effective contributors. ž (P441)
Additionally,participantsnotedacultureof /caret_rightgivinghelp and/caret_rightasking
for helpas vital to OSS. One participant explained how helping
others grows communities: ł A bit of mentorship can come a long
way in growing the community, if there’s more on an OSS project
thantheproduct/contents like aknowledge baseto tap into. ž(P96)
External Relations. TheExternalRelations category describes
skillsrelatedtowardsworkingwithandbuildingrelationshipsindi-
viduals outside the OSS team. The most frequently cited skill from
literatureandrespondentsunderthiscategorywasbuildingrela-
tionshipswith /caret_rightstakeholders .Oneparticipantexplainedhowthese
relationshipshelped tounderstand user needs and painpoints: ł If
you are socially skilled, you can contribute to OSS by conducting
surveyswiththeOSSuserstohighlightpainpointsandhelpfulfea-
tures.ž(P18)Otheraspectsofexternalrelationsincludedidentifying
and obtaining proper /caret_rightlicenses,/caret_rightmarketing the project to broader
audiences, and finding /caret_rightfunding. The latter two skills were cited as
importantinpromoting the OSS project’s sustainability[ 16].
Management. TheManagement categoryreferstoskillsrelated
to managing OSSprojects, teams,communities, ortasks. /caret_rightPlanning,
/caret_rightdelegating , and/caret_righttimemanagement helped contributors execute
tasksefficientlyandsupportedothermanagement-relatedskills.For
instance,managinga /caret_rightprojectwasapopularskillwhichinvolved
forming a long-term, łmacrož view of the project and efficiently
lead the team and tasks to remain on schedule. Meanwhile, par-
ticipants mentioned skills in managing the /caret_rightcommunity , which
included being involved in community governance or providing
internal support to foster an engaged, welcoming community. One
participantexplainedhowthisskillwasvitaltosuccessfulOSScom-

commonly said they learned new skills based on their interests;
what would benefit their professional career; the needs of the OSS
community,teammates,ortheworld; resourcesavailabletothem,
such as time and energy; and what they or others identified as
potentialareas ofimprovement.
Participants also explained how the impact of the skill was a
factor:łIprimarilydoopensourcebecauseitmakesmefeelgoodand
I lovesolving problems. I don’t think about my OSS workin terms of
skills. I think in terms of how can I make the world a better place. ž
(P10) Some participants said they would do a cost-benefit analysis
of learning the skill based on the resources required to learn the

interest in learning for self-improvement, their current role, per-
sonalcircumstances,trendsinthefield,theirworkingenvironment
(e.g., having an inclusive community), and their previous experi-
ence. Some participants reported not having a rationale to learn
skills. Additionally, some said learning skills expanded their social
network: ł Growing social contacts. I already have 16000 followers on
LinkedInand wouldlike to grow it more. ž(P35)

Contributor thoughts on improving skills. When asked questions
around participants’ future plans to improve skills, the majority
ofparticipantsknewhow toimprove them(72%) andwere taking
steps to improve (72%) the OSS-relatedskillsthey want to grow.
We asked participants if they joined projects based on the skills
thattheycouldlearn(seeTable 4).Learningnewskillsisimportant:

○Summary: Contributors improve skills by reading blogs,
followingOSSfiguresonsocialmediaandconferences,learning
from peers, and contributing to OSS projects. Growing skills
is influenced by contributor interests, needs of the OSS team,

7 DISCUSSION
Our findings indicate that skills should be a first-class citizen
in software engineering and OSS development. Skills could help
improvemanyexistingtoolsandexperiences(e.g.,pullrequests)or
createnewexperiences(e.g.,mentorship).However,thisrequires
careful thought on how to incorporate skills in platforms and tools.
Skillscouldalsoenrichempiricalstudies,forexample,forproject
successandteamcomposition.Below,wesynthesizeourfindings
withprior literature anddiscuss implicationsof this work.
7.1 Detecting Skills
Our skills model (see Section 4.1) indicates that both soft and
hard skills are crucial to OSS, which is corroborated from previous
work [66]. Prior work has automatically detected expertise and
skillsfromonlinesources,suchasGitHub[ 7,28,30,48,50,51,53,
56,69], but largely focuses onsoftware engineering-relatedskills.

Anopenproblemremains:howdoweautomaticallyminesoft
and hard skills from online data? Answering this question is a
prime research direction for mining software repositories. Prior
work has investigated this issue [ 40], but more research is needed.
Fromourqualitativeanalysis,someparticipantsvieweddetected
skillsasasourceoftruthtoassigncredibilitytotheiractions.Since
GitHubusersuseprofilestojudgeindividualsandtheircontribu-
tions [21,44], this could impact GitHub activity, such as whose
contributionsareaccepted.Thus,methodstodetectskillsshould
be accurate, objective, and grounded in developer activity traces.
Researchinthisareashouldcarefullyconsiderholisticmeasures
of skill detection to be inclusive of newcomers. For example, being
/caret_rightdiligentmay be shown through continuous contributions made
overalongduration,ahighvolumeofcontributions,orresponsive-
nessto assignedissues.
7.2 Skills Development
Our study indicates that contributors are motivated to learn be-
causeamajorityofparticipantsaretryingtoimprovetheirskillsin
the next 12 months. In software engineering, many individuals use
massive open online courses (MOOCs) to learn new skills. MOOCs
attractlearnerswhodonotaspiretoearnformaldegrees,butrather
gainknowledge that willhelpthemintheirroles [ 15].OSSplatformsmayhelpsupportthislearningsincestudypartic-
ipantsindicatedthattheylearnedskillstoimprovethemforOSS
andprofessionalsettings.Thisprovidesanopportunitytoextend
learning to include soft skills, as opposed to only technical knowl-
edge.Thiscouldbeincreasinglyimportantwiththeintroductionof
neuralmodelsthatgeneratecodewithhighquality,suchasGitHub
Copilot [23]. Future work could detect skills being learned and rec-
ommendsupplementalresourcestohelpcontributorstolearnthose
skills. Because participants reported continuous practice being cru-
cial to learning skills, future tools could also create individualized
curriculumwhichsetłbite-sized"goalseverydaytoencouragecon-
tributorstolearnnewskills.Additionally,revealingglobaltrends

ProjectMatching. Ourfindingsimplythatskillsareimportantfor
matchingcontributortoprojects.OSScontributorsaremotivatedto
learnskillsneededbyprojectsandarelikelytocontributetoanew
OSSprojectbasedonwhethertheprojectneedstheirskillset.Prior
work supports this as wellÐcontributors whose motivation was
associated with career advancement was correlated with higher
levels of satisfaction in participating in a project [ 67]. Additionally,
common barriers for OSS newcomers are a lack of hard skills, such
as software engineering background and domain expertise, as well
assoftskills,suchascommunication,patience,andproactivity[ 60].
Skills could be useful data to match contributors with specific skill
sets toprojects that requirethem, potentiallyreducing barriers to
newcomers’firstcontributionsandincreasing satisfaction.
7.3 GitHub Profiles
Incorporating skills into GitHub profiles could provide an ad-
ditional signal to assess OSS contributors and enable profiles to
includemoredynamicsourcesofinformation.Previousworkhas
shownthatOSScontributorsanalyzeGitHubprofilestoassesscon-
tributors and their potential contributions [ 21,44]. In our study,
someparticipantsreportedlargelybeingmotivatedtoshareskills
tomarketthemselvesandtheirexpertise,whileotherswantedaddi-
tionalinformationtoevaluatepotentialcontributorsorfindexperts
with specific skills. One could consider revealing some informa-
tion on skills that contributors are currently learning or improving
on for transparency, to be inclusive of newcomers, and showing
a contributor’s trajectory. Allowing contributors to display skill
dimensions that they want to grow (e.g., in a spider graph on their
GitHub profile) is a possible strategy to indicate what motivates
contributors (e.g.,adesire to improve their workingstyles).
Another potential application of skills in GitHub profiles could
be GitHub’s achievement badges [ 22], which currently only rec-
ognizes contributions to specific repositories or participation in
GitHub programs. There is an opportunity for OSS platforms such
asGitHubtoextendachievementbadgestoincludeOSSskills,using
the aforementioned miningtechniques (see Section 7.1)to surface
them. Similarly, GitHub could develop a certification of skills that
could be madedirectlyavailable inauser’sprofile.
However,ourfindingsalsoindicatethatincorporatingskillsinto
GitHub profiles requires careful design considerations. Techniques
togamifyskills,suchasincludingskilllevel,couldcreateunhealthy
competition and add additional barriers to entry for newcomers.

[41], but do not tailor their experiences for OSS contexts. Such
tools could be useful for maintainers or mentors to help their team
growtheirskills.Ourworklaysthefoundationforsuchatoolby
providingavocabulary to discuss OSS skills.
Mentorship. ManychallengesexistwithinOSSmentorship.New-
comers struggle with finding mentors [ 60] and defining profes-
sional goals [ 5]. Mentors may face language barriers, lack inter-
personalskills,orstruggletodeliverconstructivefeedbackbased
on the mentee’s background [ 5,59]. Using skills to match mentors
andmenteescouldincreasealignmentofmentors’skillsetswith
mentees. Surfacing mentees’ skills could also help mentors craft
appropriate feedback, while enabling mentees to identify areas
of improvement and set personal goals. Following the design of
GitHubDiscussions InsightsDashboard[ 24], whichfeatures new-
comers’ and daily contributors’ discussion activity, as well as a
movementtorecognizeallOSScontributions[ 13],suchtoolscould
highlight mentees’ valuable non-code contributions.
8 THREATS TO VALIDITY
Below,we discuss the threatsto validity ofour study.Internal validity. Survey participants may misinterpret wording
ornotrespondinawaythequestionintends.Toreducethisthreat,
wehadanexternalresearcherreviewthesurveytoclarifywording.
Additionally, the structure of the survey may have caused unin-
tentionalpriminginstudyparticipants,especiallyforwhatskills
inOSSmaylooklike.Toaddressthis,weputthequestionthatwas
used to validate the skills in OSS model in the beginning of the
survey before any examples of skillswere introduced.
External validity. How generalizable single-case empirical stud-
ies, such as thisstudy,tootherpopulationsisunknown. However,
these studies contribute to scientific advancement [ 19]. Our survey
includesparticipantsfrommanyOSSroles,genders,ethnicities,and
geographic regions, which may improve the generalizability of our
findings. Additionally, our sampling approach was designed to cap-
ture a wide range of contributions, as it included stratified samples
across different OSS project types (OSS, OSS4SG) and contribution
types (commits, pull requests, issues,andcomments).
Surveys by nature also often suffer from selection bias, and ours
is no different. In this study, non-response bias may have occurred
becauseoursurveywaswritteninEnglish,whichmaycauseless
representationinregionswhereEnglishisnottheprimarylanguage.
Self-selectionbiasmayalsohaveoccurred.Becausethesurveywas
marketed as a łSurvey on Skills in OSSž, participants that felt more
confident about their skills and contributions in OSS may be more
likely to participate in our study. To reduce the effects of the selec-
tionbias,wemadethesurveyasshortaspossible,weretransparent
about the survey’s length, provided incentives to participate in our
study,andkept survey responses anonymous.
Construct validity. Evaluating our model using only LinkedIn
skills may not be completely representative of skills that practi-
tionersfindimportantinpractice.Toaddressthis,wewillrunan
additionalevaluation ofour OSS skillsmodelwithOSS experts.
9 CONCLUSION
Skills remain fundamental to the success of OSS development.
The diversity of roles and contributions in OSS requires equally
diverseskillsetswhichspanbothsoftandhardskills.Inthispaper,
weinvestigatedtheskillsthatsupportthedevelopmentofOSS.We
contributed a model for skills in OSS with 45 skills in 9 categories,
survey results on how contributors grow their skills and how they
would like their skills to be presented, and design implications and
best practices on incorporating skills into OSS tools and platforms.
Our results indicate many future directions for skills in OSS.
