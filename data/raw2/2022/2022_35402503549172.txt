aprototype,aproofofconcept,orameasurementapparatus.To-
gether with the data collected in the research process, they are
collectively referred to as research artifacts and are subject to arti-
fact evaluation (AE) at scientific conferences. Since its initiation in
the software-engineeringcommunityatESEC/FSE 2011,boththe
goalsandtheprocessofAEhaveevolvedandtodayexpectations
towards AE are strongly linked with reproducible research results

the overheadthey impose is justified.

1 INTRODUCTION
As reported in a 2016 Nature article, the scientific research commu-
nityfacesa łreproducibilitycrisis.ž 70% ofthe 1576scientistssur-
veyed by Nature (from various fields, including chemistry, physics,
earth andenvironmental science,biology, andmedicine) reported
thattheyhadtriedandfailedtoreproduceanotherscientist’sexper-
iments [3]. Numerous conferences for computer science (including
thesoftware-engineeringfield)organizeartifactevaluationswith
the goal to ensure reproducibility. Organizers assign badges based
on peer review to recognize authors’ efforts to make their tools
and datasets available and reusable, and integrate these artifacts
into publication processes. In the software community the artifact-
evaluation process started at ESEC/FSE in 2011 [ 15]1, and has now
spread to become commonplace at most conferences in the area of
software engineering and programming languages as well as other
communities,includingHCI,Communications,andSecurity.
As different communities have different requirements regarding
research artifacts, artifact-evaluation organizers use different eval-
uation methodologies to assess submissions and differentincentive
mechanisms to encourage authors (and reviewers) to participate.
Researchcommunititiesinvestaconsiderableamountofeffortinto
thedevelopmentandimplementationoftheartifact-evaluationpro-
cesses. However, recent studies have shown that there are diverse
views on the part of both reviewers and authors [ 11,13,20]. In

future researchers.
Whatisclear,however,isthatparticipationinartifactevaluation

all major conferences and is increasingly adopted at journals in
software-engineering and programming-language research. Adop-

PLDI 2020 ≈90%of eligible articles were accompanied by artifacts.
However,this isnot alwaysthe casefor allvenues.

2 BACKGROUNDAND RELATED WORK
Priorworkandcommunityeffortsthatourstudyisbasedonfallinto
threecategories:effortstowardscommunitystandards(including
terminology), systematic studies of artifact sharing and evaluation,
and data collections to archive research artifacts. We discuss each
category inthe following subsections.
2.1 Background andDefinitions
Claims in scientific literature must be supported by evidence or
a reasoning why readers should regard the claims as valid [ 7].
Suchevidenceorreasoningincomputer-scienceresearchisoften
providedusingaprototypicalimplementation,acollectedorderived
dataset, or an (automated) proof. Authors may choose to make
these objects available (e.g., in the Archive of Formal Proofs2)
for other researchers to inspect or reuse. The lack of availability
2https://www.isa-afp.orgof this supporting evidence has often been criticized to hinder
reproducibility ofresearch [ 17,19].
Asupplementing research artifact is ła digital object that was
either created by the authors to be used as part of the study or
generated by the experiment itself. For example, artifacts can be
softwaresystems,scriptsusedtorunexperiments,inputdatasets,
raw data collected in the experiment, or scripts used to analyze
resultsž(ACMTaskForceonData,Software,andReproducibility
inPublication4).Weusetheshortterm artifacttorefertosucha
supplementing digital object.
Artifact evaluation is the process of evaluating certain quality
attributesofanartifact[ 11,14,15].Typically,theevaluationworkis
done by an artifact-evaluation committee, which assesses whether
artifactsare reusable,functional ,well-documented ,consistent ,and
complete.

Figure 2:ACM badgesThe five badges can be divided
into three categories: (a) an artifact
isavailable, independent from arti-
fact evaluation, (b) artifacts satisfy
the criteria of being functional or
reusable, as assessed by artifact eval-
uation, and (c) results of the article
werereproduced with the artifact, or
replicated withoutthe artifact.
Artifact-evaluationcommitteesare
concerned with two or three of the
above badges ( functional ,reusable,
sometimesalso reproducible6),while
theavailable badge does not require
evaluation(onlythatartifactsarelong-termavailable,immutable,
identifiable),andthe replicated badgerequiresanindependentstudy.
There are different communities working on establishing standard
processes andnotionsfor badgingof artifacts [ 18].

2.2 RelatedStudies
The expectations of the community regarding artifacts and their
evaluation process were studied by Hermann, Winter, and Sieg-
mund using a survey involving members from past artifact-
evaluation committees [ 11]. The study raises several questions,
someofwhichwestrivetoanswerinthiswork.Weparticularlypick
uponthequalityaspectofartifactsandtheeffectofartifactevalua-
tiononartifactquality.Heumüller,Nielebock,Krüger,andOrtmeier
gave evidence that one of the most important expectationsÐthe
availabilityoftheartifactsdescribedinscientificarticlesÐisfulfilled
onlytoanunsatisfactorydegree[ 13].Incontrasttoourstudy,they
found a small positive correlation between linking to artifacts and
citationstothearticle.However,theyonlyinspectedresearch-track
articlesfromtheInternationalConferenceonSoftwareEngineering
(ICSE)inyearswithoutanestablishedartifactevaluationprocess.
Two other studies identified reasons for the insufficient availability
of artifacts, and present a number of challenges that the authors
encounter[ 20,22].Astudyonrepeatabilityincomputer-systemsre-
searchreportedthateveniftheartifactsareavailable,studyresults
areoftennotreproducible[ 7].Thefieldsofcomputersystems[ 7,8],
computergraphics[ 6],communications[ 2,24],andmachinelearn-
ing [9,16] have alsobeen the subjectof studies on artifact quality
andavailability.
2.3 Data Collections
Toensurethatartifactsareidentifiableandfindable,therelations
between articles and artifactsmust be reliablytracked and made
available [ 1]. Zenodo7provides a convenient interface to view,
query, and change the relations of a digital object stored at Zen-
odo’s digital library to other digital objects and provides means
to declare the semantics of the link (such as ‘is supplemented by
this upload’, ‘is replaced by this upload’, and ‘cites this upload’).
ACM’s digital library has individual landing pages for artifacts and
makes the links between articles and artifacts explicit.8Article-
artifactrelationshipsthatwerefoundinarepeatabilitystudy[ 7]
were made publicly available.9Baldassarre, Ernst, Hermann, Men-
zies,andYedidacollectreuserelationshipsbetweenpublicationand
artifacts beyondrepeatabilityandreproduction [ 4].
3 RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND STUDY
SUBJECTS
Inthefollowingweintroducetheresearchquestionsdrivingour
analysesandthe study subjectsthat our answers are basedon.
3.1 Research Questions
Ourstudyaddressesfiveresearchquestionsrelatedtothemeritsof
AEforauthors,themeritsofAEforartifactusers,andhowthese
merits for authors and users are linked with AE and publication
processes andpractices.
RQ 1:Are articles with artifacts that have passed AE more visible?
RQ 2:Are successfully evaluatedartifacts more available?

for successfully evaluatedartifacts?
RQ 4:Are successfully evaluatedartifacts more often reused?
RQ 5:Aresuccessfullyevaluatedartifactsmorethoroughlydocu-
mented?
Before we discuss the relevance of these questions for the
software-engineering community, our methodology for answer-
ing these questions, and the results in more detail, we introduce
the dataset throughwhichthe questionsare investigated.
3.2 Subjects andDescriptiveStatistics
The questions in our study are related to the effects of artifact
evaluations. Therefore, we choose conferences from the SE and
PLdomains thathave implemented corresponding processes.Her-
mann, Winter, and Siegmund [ 11] provide a comprehensive list
of such conferences that we use for our subject selection. As the
format and degree of information that conferences provide regard-
ing the conducted AE differs significantly, we restrict our study
to conferences withproceedings in the ACMDigital Library (DL).
The main reason for this decision is that the ACM’s guidelines
for artifact review and badging4provide a common, albeit very
general, AE framework and that all AE processes adopting this
frameworkshouldbecomparableonthatbasis.Moreover,theACM
DL provides uniform formats for (1) proceedings, (2) publication
metadata,and(3)researchartifactslinkedwithpublications,which
facilitates the creation ofaconsistent dataset.
Figure 3 shows the conferences with AE for which we have
collectedarticledatafromACM’sDLbyconferenceandyear.We
refertothecombinationofconferenceandyearas venue.Wehadto
excludeFSE2012andMODELS2019fromourdataset:ForFSE2012,
onlyałbestartifactawardžwasawardedbytheprogramcommittee.
The number of candidates for this award and the selection process
remain confidential. Hence, we were not able to identify which
articles had evaluated artifacts thatwere considered fortheaward
and which had not. Therefore, we cannot make any meaningful
comparison between artifacts that did and did not undergo an
evaluation. For MODELS 2019, only the workshop articles from
thecompanionproceedingsareavailableintheACMDL.However,
there is no information regarding any AE process or evaluated
artifacts for these workshops available. We added ASE 2018 to
our dataset, although it did not have a formal artifact evaluation
process, because łAvailablež badges were issued for some of the
articles and we can, therefore, assess effects that we attribute to
badges (rather thanAEprocesses)as targetedby RQ1. Onthetop
of each bar in Figure 3, a number indicates the total number of
articles in our dataset. This number may be smaller than the actual
number of articles in the proceedings, as we exclude keynotes,
workshopabstracts, etc.More precisely,we include every article
from the proceedings that has an author, is tagged as łResearch

4 RQ1: ARE ARTICLES WITH ARTIFACTS
THATHAVE PASSEDAE MOREVISIBLE?
PreparingartifactsforAEentailssignificantamountsofworkfor
authors. However, evaluation measures for hiring, promotion, and
tenureoftenarecenteredonthevisibilityofarticlesÐderivatives
ofpublicationandcitationcountsÐnotonthevisibilityofartifacts.
Whilewedonotendorsetheuseofthesemeasuresforevaluatingca-
reer advancement, it is nonetheless the case that many institutions
around the world rely on them, and some researchers are forced
to optimize towards them. One hypothesis is that AE positively
impacts the visibility of publications [ 13]. If this hypothesis holds,
it may provide authors with a strong incentive to participate in AE.
Ifitdoesnot,aninvestigationofalternativerewardmechanisms
maybe worthwhile.
4.1 Method
We measure visibility in terms of citation counts of articles, which
we obtain from the Crossref Metadata Search10(cf.also[10]).
To link these visibility measures with AE, we group articles into
four article categories: (AE)with artifact and AE badge (łFunc-
tionalž,11łReusablež,12or the łold venue-specific badgesž ( Fig-
ure1)),(Av.)withartifactandonlythełArtifactAvailabležbadge,
(NoB)with artifact butwithout any badge,and (NoA)without ar-
tifact. Note that we treat articles that only have an łArtifacts Avail-
ablež badge separately from articles that also have other badges,
becausełArtifactsAvailableždoesnotimplyanactualevaluation
ofthe artifact,4as discussedfor ASE 2018 above.
WeidentifycategoriesAEandAv.bytheirbadgesintheACM
DL. To identify the old monochrome badges, which are not shown
in DL article entries, we extract the upper left and right corners
from article PDFs and analyze the distribution of pixel colors in
thoseareasto detect the presenceof a badge. Toruleoutfalseposi-

We identify categories NoB and NoA by conducting a tool-
assistedmanualreviewandclassificationof 25728URLsfrom 3150
article PDFs (the remaining PDFs in our dataset did not contain
any URLs). In this process, we automatically extract URLs from
thePDFtextandmanuallytageachextractedURLasłaccessible

make the tool available together with our dataset in the artifact
accompanying this article [ 23].
ToassesswhetherAEaffectsvisibility,wedeterminewhether
there is stochastic dominance of either category over any other
categorybyconductingatwo-sampleKolmogorov-Smirnov(KS)

for confounding factors,we further categorizearticlesby (a) page
lengths,and (b)whetherthey are published aspublicorclosed ac-
cess.Inadditiontotheseconfoundingfactors,wealsoattemptedto
analyze confounding with article topic as per the 2012 ACM Com-
puting Classification System (CCS). However, we found the spread
of CCS topics to be too large to support a meaningful analysis, e.g.,
theESEC/FSE2020proceedingsfeature75differentCCScategories
that only apply to one single article, 22 that apply to 2, 13 to 3, 4 to
4, and so on. Consequently, a stratification of the dataset according
to CCS categories would lead to numerous strata with single or
fewarticlesand,thus,impedeameaningfulcomparison.We,hence,
decidedtoexcludetheimpactanalysisforCCScategoriesfromour
study of confounding factors, but kept the data in our artifact [ 23].

5 RQ2: ARE SUCCESSFULLYEVALUATED
ARTIFACTSMOREAVAILABLE?
The reproducibility of research results and the reusability of re-
search artifacts are perceived as the main objectives of artifact
evaluations by AEC members [ 11]. If an artifact is not available,
itcanneitherbereused,norcanpublishedresultsbereproduced.
Therefore,availability isavitalquality criterionfor artifacts.
5.1 Method
To study whether artifacts that passed AE are more often available
than artifacts that did not, we classify artifacts as (a) passed AE
(article group AE in Section 4.1 ) or(b) unknown (article groups Av.,
NoB inSection 4.1 ). We refer to these groups as AE and NonAE in
the following.

(1)Artifact-ReferenceAvailability: Toidentifywhetheraresearch-
artifact reference is available for articles in our study, we search
differentinformation sourcesfor thesereferences:
The ACM Digital Library (DL)14provides authors of pub-
lishedarticleswiththeopportunitytoalsopublishanyaccompany-
ing research artifacts. Artifacts in the DL have their own dedicated
landing page with links from and to the research articles that they
accompany.
Conference Publishing Consulting13is a consulting agency
for publishers of scientific articles. Conference Publishing Consult-
ingisentrusted withthepublication processesfor alargenumber
of SE and PL conferences and openly publishes metadata for these
conferencesonitswebsite.ArtifactlinksfromConferencePublish-
ing Consulting are extracted as the łinfo linksž that authors can
supply when submittingtheircamera ready article versions.
FindResearch9isa platformthatpresentssemi-automatically
collected metadata of computer-science research articles. Authors
of research articles are queried for confirmation of presumably au-
tomaticallyextracteddata.15Theportaldoesnotcontainmetadata
forconferencesafter2018,butservesasareferenceforoldervenues
inour study.
CMU Dataset [21] is the result of a recent study of research
artifacts[ 20],inwhichtheauthorshavemanuallyanalyzedartifact
references in research articles and published this dataset. As the
venuescoveredbythatdatasetoverlapwiththevenuesinourstudy,
we make use ofthe dataset for intersecting venues.
Article PDF files are used for the venues in our study that are
not coveredby the CMU Dataset and we conduct a similar analysis
as for the CMU Dataset. As the manual analysis of PDF URLs does
not scale well for the total of 3650articles in our study, we have
developed the tool URLBrowser to support this process. The tool
automaticallyextractsURLsfromPDFfilesandopenstheselinks
in a web browser to facilitate URL classification (whether the URL
points to an artifact of the article and, if so, whether that link
works). We make URLBrowser publicly available as part of our
artifact [23].
(2) Digital-Object Availability: To approximate the availability
of digital objects referenced by the URLs identified in the first
step of our availability analysis, we send HTTP HEAD requests
usingcURL16andanalyzethereturnedHTTPstatuscodes.This
measurementonlyyieldsanapproximation,because(a)websites

These results indicate that the overall number of articles with
references to research artifacts is similar across the two partitions

tral criterion for awarding the łAvailablež badge is that the artifact

effects of host platforms on artifact availability and which hosting
platforms have been most prevalent over time. We identify host
platforms by extracting the domain of a given artifact reference

that category is somewhat smoother (albeit on a different scale),
we do expect the observedchange inpublicationculture dueto the

use the other three measures as indicators of interest and visibility

Availability of research artifacts is a necessary, but not a sufficient
prerequisitefortheirutilitytoreuseinscientificresearchandresult
reproduction. To serve the research community, artifacts must also
be reusable for reproducing research results or for repurposing in
different contexts. We, therefore, analyze how often artifacts are
being reused.

We also see more references (last column) to NonAE artifacts,
irrespective of whether author lists intersect or not. The difference
between references to NonAE versus AE articles is larger for non-
intersecting author lists (138 vs. 61) than for intersecting author
lists(96vs.80).Thismeansthat while slightlyfewerNonAEthan

In summary, we cannot draw clear conclusions from the data.

itisdifficulttoreuseandthearticle’sresultsarelikelydifficultto

8.1 Method
As the analysis of documentation requires the download of linked
artifacts, which requires a manual investigation of the linkedweb
sites,werestrictouranalysistoarandomlydrawnsampleof100
artifacts for each category (AE and NonAE). As each article may
contain multiple artifact links from different sources, we priori-
tize links from the ACM DL over links found in PDF files over
links from other sources, i.e., Conference Publishing Consulting
orFindResearch.Therationaleforthisprioritizationisthatlinks

ers. The links published by Conference Publishing Consulting and
FindResearcharealsoauthorsubmittedlinks,butareusuallynot
directly visible to readers, unless they explicitly search for infor-
mation on these platforms. To address the imbalance of archive
file types(e.g.,zip ortar) vs.repository linksinthe ACMDLcom-
pared to other sources, we generally give preference to archive file
types over other links from the same source. In the case of links
toZenodo,weuseZenodo’sRESTAPItoresolvetheartifactlink
todownloadlinksoffileslinkedwiththeZenodorecord.ForGit
repositorylinks,weattempttocheckouttheversionsthatgotac-
cepted/rejected during AE, where we determine the date as the AE
notificationdateifthatinformationisavailable.Ifthatinformation
was not available, we either used the camera-ready due date (if
indicatedasrelevantforartifactsaswellonthevenue’swebsite)or
the dateofthe venue’sprogram announcement.
To approximate the adequacy of artifact documentation, we
search for document file types in the artifact and quantify the
amount of documentation by word counts. As we are not aware
of any existing standards for research artifact documentation or
widelyacceptedpractices,wethenproceededtosearchfor12(case
insensitive)file namepatterns across the identified documentfiles

8.2 Results
Table 7shows the result of our documentation analysis of 100 sam-
pled AE and 100 sampled NonAE artifacts. In our randomly drawn

sample of 100 artifacts each, 13 artifacts in the AE group and 12
artifactsinthe NonAE groupdid not includeanyfile matchingany
of our search terms. For the artifacts with missing documentation,
there is no pattern in terms of conference or year. Out of the re-
mainingartifacts,84fromtheAEsampleand86fromtheNonAE
samplecontainedaREADMEfilewithamuchhigheraverageword
countforfilesintheAEsample.Atthesametime,separatedocu-
mentation and examples directories are more common and their
contentismorecomprehensive(intermsofaveragewordcount)
for the NonAE sample than the AE sample. A deeper analysis of
the collected data reveals that the large amount of documentation
andexamplesintheanalyzedNonAEsampleisonlycontributed
by a comparatively small fraction of 15 artifacts, out of which only
5 exceed the single observed AE łˆdoc/ž word count and only 2 the
mean AE łˆexamples?/ž word count. We see this as an indicator
thattheartifactsintheNonAEsamplearehighlydiversewithonly
fewartifacts providingextensive documentation.
Overall, the results show that AE artifacts tend to have more
comprehensiveoverviewdocumentationinREADMEfiles,whereas
we observe some NonAE artifacts to have a shorter overview docu-
mentationandamorecomprehensivedocumentationinseparate
directories,albeitinalimitednumberofcases.Whiletheformer
is more suitable for a focused reproduction of research results, the
latterismoresuitableforrepurposingandreuse,whichmayhint
atunderlyingdifferencesintheperceivedpurposeofresearchar-
tifacts [11]. The documentation of positively evaluated artifacts
focuses on reproduction, whereas the documentation of (some)
otherartifacts focuses onreuse andrepurposing.
Basedontheobservationthatatop-levelREADMEfileismiss-

Fromourresults,wealsoseethatthemajorityofthesampled

some of the analyzed artifacts were obtained from the ACM DL

Out of the 26 artifacts with licenses specified in publication

Finding5: Documentationpracticesstronglydifferacross
AE and NonAE artifacts and within the NonAE group.
Many AE and NonAE artifacts are lacking licenses and
copyright information.

Construct validity: Participation in artifact evaluation, as a vari-

Internalvalidity: ExceptforRQ2,thefindingsofourstudyare

how AE is conducted and how AEC chairs implement/guide an AE

because itisrarelydocumented.
To control for confounding, we stratify our dataset according to
hypothesized confounding factors, test for differences across them,

(citations). As a consequence, the reported results are conservative.
To control for selection bias, we include a wide range of SE and
PL conferencesthatadopted artifact evaluationover severalyears
usingdifferentprocesses,fromwhichwerandomlysampleartifacts
for our documentation analysis. The selection of subjects in our
study is restricted to conferences organized or supported by the
ACM,forwhich publicationandartifactdata isavailablethrough
the ACM DL. We have taken great care to analyze potential effects
of this choice, e.g., by cross-comparing the obtained metadata with
othersources,e.g.,fromConferencePublishingConsulting.During
our consistency checks, we identified and reported a number of
data inconsistenciesto ACM,whichgot acknowledgedandfixed.
OurapproachofidentifyingartifactURLsfromPDFsisimperfect
and represents a threat to internal validity. We mitigate the threat
by (a) providing the set of identified artifact URLs as part of our
dataset, allowing them to be scrutinized, and (b) including our tool
for identifying artifact URLs as part ofour reproduction package.
External validity: Our analysis and, thus, our conclusions are
limitedtotheSEandPLvenues,forwhichproceedingsareavailable
intheACMDL.However,thissampleaccountsfor64outof89data
points (i.e., almost 71.9%) according to the most comprehensive
study ofAE adoption inthe SE andPLcommunities to date[ 11].
10 DISCUSSION
In the first decade after its initiation, artifact evaluations have
significantlygainedpopularityintheSEandPLcommunities.In
ourarticle,welookattheartifactsevaluatedduringthisperiodand
makeacomparativeassessmentwithresearchartifactsthathave
not been submitted or did not successfully pass artifact evaluation.
Inthissection,wediscussourfindingsandmakerecommendations
to further improve artifact evaluations for the coming decade.
AERewardMechanisms: Themainrewardmechanismforarti-
fact submitters are badges, which are prominently displayed in the
title area of articles and in digital libraries like the ACM DL. How-
ever,inourstudywefindthatthisadvertisementofresearchresults
obtainedwithevaluatedartifactsdoesnotsignificantlyaffectthe
visibilityofresearcharticlesintermsofcitations.Asmuchofthe
traditional academic performance evaluation is centered around
citation-derived measures, the creation and maintenance of arti-
factsiscurrentlynotwellintegratedinthissystem,alsobecause
thereisnostandardizedwaytoreferencethemandtheyare,hence,
likely to escape the common citation tracking mechanisms. As the
creation of these artifacts entails significant overheads, we encour-
age the SE and PL communities to propose and discuss alternative
reward mechanisms for authors who create and publish high qual-
ity research artifacts, which benefit the research community as
a whole. Besides more rigorous attribution policies for artifacts,
whichcouldbeincludedinpeer-reviewguidelines,alternativere-
ward mechanisms could also be based on non-citation measures,
e.g.,thenumberofpositivelyevaluatedartifactsortheR+index[ 4].
Withadecadeofartifactpublications,theadditionoftest-of-timeawards for artifacts may also reward creators of particularly useful
artifactsandconstituteavaluableadditiontoconferenceprograms.
łAvailabležAssessment: InSection5 wediscusstheimpactthe
łAvailablež-badge-imposedrequirementshaveontheavailabilityof
researchartifacts.However,from Figure3,weseethatthereisanup
and down in AE participation and that NoB articles still dominate
for SE conferences (see ESEC/FSE, ISSTA, ICSE), even after 2017,
when thełAvailabležbadges were introduced.For PLconferences
thesituationisabitbetter,butthereisgenerallyverylittlereasonto
not get łAvailablež badges for any NoB article. We suspect that the
reasonforthispartiallyisthattheprocessforobtainingłAvailablež
badgesisoftenlinkedwiththeartifact-evaluationprocess.Authors,
who do not want to get an actual evaluation of their artifacts may
not be aware of the łAvailablež badge option. At the same time, we
have seen some łAvailablež articles in our dataset, for which we
could not easily find links. This could be prevented by introducing
anadditionalcheckforthecamera-readyversionofarticleswhether
theycontainanartifactreferenceiftheyareassignedthełAvailablež
badge.18In summary, we recommend to link the łAvailablež badge
assignment with calls for papers and the paper-review process,
rather than the artifact evaluation. We also recommend to focus
furtherresearchonthefactorsthatpreventauthorsfrompackaging,
submitting,andpublishingtheirresearchartifacts,asweexpectthe
related insights to significantly benefit our communities’ processes
andthe availability ofresearch artifacts.
Community Standards: Our analysis of the documentation for a
sampleofartifactshasrevealeddeficienciesregardingthepresence
of common documentation andlicense files. This means that such
informationiseitherindeedmissingorthatitishiddeninplaces
not covered by our analysis. To make sure that this information
is present for every artifact and that it can be easily found, we
recommend the communities to develop common standards for
the documentation of artifacts. ESEC/FSE, for instance, is currently
mandating certain information to be present in certain files in the
artifactsubmission, andwe endorse toadopt andextend thisstan-
dardizationeffort.Specifically,standardscouldalsocoveraspectsof
artifactpackaging,submission,publication,andreferencing,which
would facilitate artifact reviews as well as automated checks to
scale with the hopefully further increasing numbers of artifact
publicationsinthe coming years.
