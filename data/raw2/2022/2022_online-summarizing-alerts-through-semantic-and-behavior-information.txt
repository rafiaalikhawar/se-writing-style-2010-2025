ABSTRACT
Alerts,which recorddetails aboutsystem failures,arecrucial data
formonitoringaonlineservicesystem.Duetothecomplexcorrela-
tion between system components, a system failure usually triggers
alargenumberofalerts,makingthetraditionalmanualhandling
ofalertsinsufficient.Thus,automaticallysummarizingalertsisa
problem demandingprompt solution.This papertackles thischal-
lenge through a novel approach based on supervised learning. The
proposedapproach,OAS(OnlineAlertSummarizing),first learns
two types of information from alerts, semantic information and
behavior information, respectively. Then, OAS adopts a specificdeep learning model to aggregate semantic and behavior repre-sentations of alerts and thus determines the correlation betweenalerts. OAS is able to summarize the newly reported alert online.
Extensive experiments, which are conducted on real alert datasets
fromtwolargecommercialbanks,demonstratetheefficiencyand
the effectiveness of OAS.

thatcausefailures,suchasnetworkfailures,hardwareproblems,
softwarebugs,temperature,humidity,andevenhumanerrors.In
addition to affecting customer satisfaction, failures can even cause
hugeeconomiclosses,especiallyforonlinesystemsinvolvingfinan-
cial services, such as banking systems, online supermarkets, and
stocktradingsystems.In2019,theestimatedcostoftheone-hour
downtime for Amazon on Prime Day, which is the biggest sale
event of the year for Amazon, is up to 100 million dollars [3].
To detect the failure timely, maintenance engineers monitor
various data of online service system in real time, such as KPIs [ 26,
34,35],logs[5,7,9,14,18,30],andtraces[ 15,20,21,36].Whenthe
monitoring datais abnormal, corresponding alertswill be reported,
which describes the phenomenon of the underlying failure, and
thenmaintenanceengineerswillbenotifiedimmediatelytohandle
the alerts and fix the failure. Thus, alerts are essential data for
engineers to maintain the service system.
In a real scenario, a failure usually triggers a large number of
alerts,duetotheinteractionbetweensystemcomponents,resulting
inalargenumberofalertsinaday,orevenanalertstormduetothe
overwhelmingnumberofalertsinashortperiodoftime[ 31].Al-
though maintenance engineers commonly define correlation rules
to summarize alerts of the same failure, thereby reducing the in-tensity of their maintenance work. However, manually defining
correlationrulesisalaborintensiveandtime-consumingprocess,
and it is hard to cover all correlations between alerts. In conse-
quence,designingapproachtoautomaticallysummarizealertsinto
incidents is an urgent requirement.
There are a few works focusing on automatically summariz-
ing alerts [ 13,31]. Such works claim that since correlated alerts
describe the same failure, their contents may be similar, and thepropagation of a failure within the system follows the topology
ofsystemcomponents,thusthetopologicalrelationshipbetween
systemcomponentsmayrevealthecorrelationbetweenalertsof
thefailure.Therefore,existingworkssummarizealertsaccording
totwofactors,theJaccardsimilaritybetweenalertcontents[ 13,31]
and the topological relationship between system components [ 31].
However, these approaches have following drawbacks. First,
alertstriggeredbyonefailuremayhavetotallydifferentcontents.

3 MOTIVATION
In this section, we use an illustrative example to motivate ourapproach. Table 1 shows an alert snippet of a large commercialbank, A, in which the alerts,
𝑒1,𝑒2,···,𝑒5, are all caused by the
samefailure,“NTPstarterror”.Byremovingvariableparameters
and stop words from contents, these alerts can be classified into
three types, 𝐸1,𝐸2, and𝐸3. Alerts ofthe same type havethe same
parsed content. In Table 1, 𝑒1and𝑒3belong to 𝐸1,𝑒2and𝑒4belong
to𝐸2, and𝑒5belongs to 𝐸3.
Our study aims to automatically summarize such alerts into a
group,namedas incident,therebyreducingthenumberofalertsan-
alyzedbymaintenanceengineers.Tominethecorrelationbetween
alerts, in this paper, we leverage two types of alert information,
semantic information and behavior information.
3.1 Semantic Information
As shown in Table 1, contents of the alert of 𝐸2and𝐸3have some
commonkeywords,suchas“NTP”and“start”,whichrevealsthe
commonsemanticinformationbetweenalerts.However,mining
suchcommonsemanticinformationisnottrivial,becauseitisoften
that correlated alerts have only a few common words and most
wordsintheircontentsaredifferent.Therefore,popularapproaches,
like Jaccard [ 31] and Word2Vec [ 19], may fail to capture such faint
common semantic information.
Toattacksuchproblem,inthispaper,weproposeadeeplearn-
ing based model, named ASR (Alert Semantics Representation), to
extract the semantic information of alerts. ASR not only mines
thecontextualinformationofeachalertword,butalsoconsidersthecontributionofeachwordtotheoverallalertsemantics.Asa
result,thecontextualinformationofalertwordsisintegratedbased
ontheirsemanticcontribution.Inthepreviousexample,ASRwill
pay more attention to the words, “NTP" and “start", than the other
words in the alert of 𝐸2and𝐸3.
3.2 Behavior Information
Comparedtocorrelatingalertsof 𝐸2and𝐸3,correlatingthoseof 𝐸1
is more challenging since there are no common words between 𝐸1
and𝐸2(or𝐸3). Thus, we leverage the behavior information lurking
inco-occurrencesofalerts.Therationaleisthatcorrelatedalerts
should occur together in higher probability. For example, Figure 1
shows the occurrence series for alerts of 𝐸1and𝐸2in one day,
whichareformedbycountingalertoccurrencesofeachtypeper
oneminuteinaday.Itcanbeseenthat1)alertsof 𝐸1and𝐸2always
occurinthe sametimeperiods, [𝑡1,𝑡2],[𝑡3,𝑡4],and[𝑡5,𝑡6],which
correspond to three distinct failures; 2) the fluctuations of these
two series are similar.

The straightforward approach is to measure the similarity of
twooccurrenceseriesusingEuclideanDistance(ED)orDynamic
TimeWarping(DTW).However,althoughthetwooccurrencese-
riesinFigure1aresimilarin [𝑡1,𝑡2]and[𝑡3,𝑡4],theyhavedifferent
shapesin [𝑡5,𝑡6].Thisisbecausetheoccurrenceofalertsisaffected
by many factors, like alert detection mechanism, failure severity,
failure duration, and so on. Another alternative is to mine frequent
patterns(orsequences)[ 10,12,28].Buttheycanonlyfindincidents
with frequentalert types. Theinfrequent ones, althoughmore im-
portant, will be missed.
In this paper, we propose a data driven model, ABR (Alert Be-
haviorRepresentation),torepresentthebehaviorinformationofan
alert.InspiredbySkip-Gram[ 19],ABRcapturethecommonality
between the occurrence series of correlated alerts. Moreover, ABR
utilizes the supervised learning to leverage theexpert knowledge.
Theadvantageisthateventheoccurrenceseriesofcorrelatedalerts
is not intuitively similar, ABR is still able to capture their common
behavior information.

4 BACKGROUND AND APPROACH
OVERVIEW
Inthissection,wepresentthenecessarybackgroundknowledge
and give the approach overview.
4.1 Alert Preprocessing
Given an alert sequence, we first preprocess alerts in four steps.In the first step, we remove variables in the alert content. Thereare numerous works on parsing alerts [
1,8,29]. As Drain [ 8]i s
a popular online parser, we adopt it as the parser of OAS. In the
second step, we further remove stop words from the alert content,
sincestopwords,suchas"the","a",and"and",donotcarrymuch
specific semantic information. In the third step, according to alert
contents,wegroupalertsintodifferenttypes,andthusalertsofthe
same type have the same alert content. In the last step, for an alert,
weformits occurrenceseriesbycounting thenumberofalerts of
the same type per 𝛼minutes in the past 𝛽minutes ( 𝛼<𝛽). As aresult,thealertcontentcontainsthesemanticinformationofthe
alert, and the occurrence series contains the behavior information
of the alert.
For convenience, we define the parsed alert sequence as 𝑆=
[𝑒1,𝑒2,···,𝑒𝑛].Foranalert, 𝑒𝑖(1≤𝑖≤𝑛),thetimestampisdenoted
as𝑡𝑖. We have a set of alert types, {𝐸1,𝐸2,···,𝐸𝑚}, and each alert
belong to one alert type. 𝑊𝑖(|𝑊𝑖|=𝑙𝑖) records the words in the
contentof 𝑒𝑖.Theoccurrenceseriesof 𝑒𝑖isreferredtoas 𝐹𝑖∈R⌈𝛽
𝛼⌉.
4.2 Overview
The objectiveof OAS isto utilize thesemantic and behaviorinfor-
mationofalertstosummarizealertsonline.Asaresult,alertsare
groupedintodifferentincidentsbyOAS,andeachincidentcontains
alerts of the same system failure. In addition to reduce the number
of alerts, compared to a single alert that only focuses on a local
phenomenon of a failure, an incident can reflect the whole impact
of the failure, thereby helping maintenance engineers efficiently
locate and fix the failure.
Figure 2 shows an overview of OAS. OAS contains four main
components,alertsemantics representation(ASR),alert behavior
representation(ABR),alertcorrelation(ACT),andonlinesummariz-
ing. OAS has two stages, training stage and summarizing stage. In
the training stage, OAS trains the alert representation models, ASRandABR,andthealertcorrelationmodel,ACT,offlineaccordingto
the history alert sequence. In the summarizing stage, based on the
trainedmodels,OASsummarizesthenewlyreportedalertonline
by a time window.
4.2.1 Training Stage. AsshownintheleftpartofFigure2,alerts
in training dataset are first parsed to get alert contents and alertoccurrences series. For each
𝑒𝑖in the training dataset, we obtain
otheralertsinwindow [𝑡𝑖−𝑤,𝑡𝑖]thatbelongtothesamefailure
with𝑒𝑖. Suppose there exist 𝑐𝑖alerts correlated to 𝑒𝑖during[𝑡𝑖−
𝑤,𝑡𝑖], which are denoted as 𝑅𝑖=[𝑒𝑟𝑖
1,𝑒𝑟𝑖
2,···,𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑖],( 1≤𝑟𝑖
𝑗≤𝑛,
1≤𝑗≤𝑐𝑖). Alerts correlated to 𝑒𝑖can be collected from history
failure reports. It should be noted that 𝑅𝑖may not be a complete
set that contains all the alerts correlated to 𝑒𝑖. In fact, even an
experienced domainexpert can notguarantee that ineach of his
failurereports,allalertsbelongingtothereportedfailurearefound.Ourapproachestrytolearngeneralrelationshipsbetweenavailable
correlated alerts, and apply them to the newly reported alert in
online alert stream.
Then, we train the semantics representation model, ASR, and
the behavior representation model, ABR. Since ASR and ABR have
nodependency,theycanbetrainedseparately.Finally,wetrainthe

4.2.2 Summarizing Stage. AsshownintherightpartofFigure2,
for the newly reported alert in the summarizing stage, 𝑒𝑖, after it is
parsed, we can directly extract its semantic and behavior informa-
tionbytherepresentationmodels,ASRandABR,whicharetrained
in the training stage. Then, we measure the correlation between
thenewlygeneratedalert, 𝑒𝑖,andpreviouslyreportedalertsduring
aspecifiedtimewindow, [𝑡𝑖−𝑤,𝑡𝑖].Accordingtoalertcorrelations
found by ACT, we propose a summarizing strategy to online group
thenewlyreportedalert, 𝑒𝑖,anditscorrelatedalertintoanincident.
5 ALERT REPRESENTATION
We propose two approaches, ASR (Alert Semantics Representation)
and ABR (Alert Behavior Representation), to represent the seman-
tic and behavior information of alerts respectively. As shown inFigure 2, extracting the semantic representation and the behav-ior representation are independent, thus there is no dependency
between ASR and ABR.
5.1 Semantics Representation
Alertsbelongingtothesamesystemfailurearelikelytohavesimilar
semanticinformation.Althoughtherearesomeexistingapproaches
that can be used to represent the semantic information of alerts,
such as Jaccard [ 13,31], word embedding [ 7,18], and topic distilla-
tion [33], theycan not extractthe complete semanticsof the alert.
The Jaccard-based approach naively correlates alerts with same
words,ignoringthecommonsemanticsbetweendifferentwords.
The word-embedding-based approach simply sums up embedding
results of words in an alert, neglecting varying contributions of
words to the overall semantics. The topic-distillation-based ap-
proach only distills the general topic of the alert, which are too
crude to capture distinctive semantic details.
To represent the alert semantic information, we propose ASR
(AlertSemanticsRepresentation),whichextractsthecompletealert
semantics based on the respective semantic contribution of each
word in the alert content. For words in the alert content, ASR first
minesthecontextualinformationofeachword,andthencalculatesthecontributionofeachwordtotheoverallalertsemantics.Finally,
ASRaggregatesthecontextualinformationofalertwordsaccording
to their contributions to the overall alert semantics. Therefore, the
key issue is how to mine the contextual information of the alertwordandhowtocalculatethecontributionofthealertwordtothe
overall alert semantics.
As shown in Figure 3, for each word in the alert content, ASR
adopts a word embedding model, named CBOW (Continuous Bag-
of-Words) [ 19], to mine the contextual information of the word,
andutilizesIDF(InverseDocumentFrequency)[ 14,17]tocalculate
thesemanticcontributionoftheword.Morespecifically,inCBOW,
aneuralnetworkistrainedtominethecontextualinformationof
a word by extracting the common semantics between the word
and its adjacent words.IDF is a widely used factorto measure the
semantic importance of a word to the document, which is calcu-
lated by dividing the total number of documents by the number of
documentsthatcontainthetargetword.InASR,thedocumentis
referred to the concatenate contents of correlated alerts in history
alerts.

In the training stage, we separately train CBOW and IDF by

straightforwardly extract the semantic representation for an alert.

For each word in the alert, 𝑒𝑖(1≤𝑖≤𝑛), we get the contextual in-

5.2 Behavior Representation
Inadditiontosemantics,alertsbelongingtothesamesystemfailure
usually also have common behavior information. Mining frequent
patternsisawidelyusedapproachtocapturebehaviorcorrelations
betweenalerts[ 10,12,28].Becausefrequentpatternsindicateco-
occurrence correlations between alerts. In practice, however, some
alert types have quite lowfrequencies to whichfrequent pattern
mining approach is not applicable.
To represent the alert behavior information, we propose ABR
(Alert Behavior Representation), which for the first time learns the
commonalitybetweenalertoccurrenceseries.ABRisinspiredby
thewordembeddingmodel, Skip-Gram[ 19].Skip-Gram captures
the common semantics between a target word and its adjacent
words via a shallow neural network, which converts the encod-
ing of the target word to the encoding of its adjacent words in a
linearfashion.Similarly,asshowninFigure4,ABRtrainsashal-
low neural network to converts the occurrence series of a targetalert to the occurrence series of its correlated alerts. As a result,the trained neural network can capture the underlying common
behavior information between alerts.

tion of the alert.
To train ABR in the training stage, for each history alert, 𝑒𝑖
(1≤𝑖≤𝑛), by Equation (2), we aggregate the occurrence series of
alerts correlated to 𝑒𝑖, and denote the result as ˆ𝐹𝑖. Thus, since 𝐹𝑖
contains the behavior information of 𝑒𝑖andˆ𝐹𝑖contains the behav-
iorinformationofitscorrelatedalerts,thecommonalitybetween
𝐹𝑖andˆ𝐹𝑖represents the same behavior information between 𝑒𝑖
anditscorrelatedalerts.Specifically,asshowninFigure4,wetry

6 ALERT CORRELATION
With ASR and ABR, we can represent the semantic information
and the behavior information of the alert, respectively. We thusproposeamodel,ACT(AlertCorrelaTion),tomeasurethecorre-lation between alerts by aggregating the semantic and behavior
representations of the alert. Before formally introducing ACT, let’s
consideramotivatingquestion,fortwoalerts 𝑒1and𝑒2,whenboth
theirsemanticandbehaviorrepresentationsaresingle-dimensional,howtodetermineiftheyarecorrelated.Generally,forthesemanticrepresentationsof
𝑒1and𝑒2,thedifferencebetweenthemshouldbe
lessthanathreshold,andthesameistrueforthebehaviorrepresen-tations.Formally,wedefineasimpleauxiliaryfunction,
𝑓𝑑𝑖𝑠(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧),
inEquation(4),whichfirstcalculatesthesquaredifferencebetween
𝑥and𝑦, and measure the difference between the square difference
and𝑧. Therefore, if 𝑒1and𝑒2are correlated, both 𝑓𝑑𝑖𝑠(𝑠1,𝑠2,𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑑1)
and𝑓𝑑𝑖𝑠(𝑏1,𝑏2,𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑑2)arepositive,where 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑑1and𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑑2arethe
thresholds for the semantic difference and the behavior difference,
respectively. Identically, to ensure 𝑒1and𝑒2are correlated, we can
get𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑢(𝑓𝑑𝑖𝑠(𝑠1,𝑠2,𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑑1))×𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑢(𝑓𝑑𝑖𝑠(𝑏1,𝑏2,𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑑2))>0.
𝑓𝑑𝑖𝑠(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧)=𝑧−(𝑥−𝑦)2(4)
ACT, shown in Figure 5, is a generalization of the above moti-
vating example in a multi-dimensional situation. For two alerts,
𝑒𝑖and𝑒𝑗(1≤𝑖,𝑗≤𝑛), inspired by the above example, ACT first
calculatesthe squaredifference between eachdimensionof each
type of alert representations. For the semantic representation, the
result is denoted as 𝑠𝑖,𝑗, and for the behavior representation, the
result is denoted as 𝑏𝑖,𝑗. In above example, 𝑓𝑑𝑖𝑠(𝑠1,𝑠2,𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑑1)and
𝑓𝑑𝑖𝑠(𝑏1,𝑏2,𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑑2)actuallycanberegardedastwolineartransfor-
mation of square differences between each type of alert representa-tions,where
𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑑1and𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑑2arebiases.Thus,ACTcorrespondingly
performs linear transformation on 𝑠𝑖,𝑗and𝑏𝑖,𝑗, respectively. In ad-
dition, since 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑢(𝑓𝑑𝑖𝑠(𝑠1,𝑠2,𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑑1))×𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑢(𝑓𝑑𝑖𝑠(𝑏1,𝑏2,𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑑2))>0
when𝑒1and𝑒2are correlated, ACT similarly activates the trans-
formation results by 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑢function, and then aggregates the two
typesofalertrepresentationsbyelement-wiseproduct.Afterfur-
thertransformationanddimensionreduction,ACTfinallypresents
the correlation degree between 𝑒𝑖and𝑒𝑗,ˆ𝑃𝑖,𝑗=[ˆ𝑝𝑖,𝑗

is a two-dimensional vector, in which ˆ𝑝𝑖,𝑗
1is the probability that
the two alerts are correlated, and ˆ𝑝𝑖,𝑗
2is the probability that the
twoalertsareuncorrelated.Thesumof ˆ𝑝𝑖,𝑗
1andˆ𝑝𝑖,𝑗
2is1,whichis
ensured by the 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 function.
To train ACT in the training stage, for a history alert, 𝑒𝑖(1≤
𝑖≤𝑛), previous alerts during [𝑡𝑖−𝑤,𝑡𝑖]can be divided into two

7 ONLINE SUMMARIZING
Inthetrainingstage,allmodelsforalertrepresentationandalert
correlation are well trained offline. Therefore, in online summa-
rizing stage, for the newly reported alert, 𝑒𝑖, and the previously
reported alert, 𝑒𝑗, in the time window, [𝑡𝑖−𝑤,𝑡𝑖], we can easily
represent their semantic information and behavior information by
ASR and ABR, respectively. Then, according to ACT, we can obtain
the correlation degree between the two alerts straightforwardly,
which is defined as ˆ𝑃𝑖,𝑗=[ˆ𝑝𝑖,𝑗
1,ˆ𝑝𝑖,𝑗
2]. Specifically, ˆ𝑝𝑖,𝑗
1indicates
the probability that the alerts are correlated, and ˆ𝑝𝑖,𝑗
2indicates the
probability that the alerts are uncorrelated. If ˆ𝑝𝑖,𝑗
1>ˆ𝑝𝑖,𝑗
2,𝑒𝑖and
𝑒𝑗may belong to the same system failure. Therefore, we use the
Equation(6)tofindthealertmostcorrelatedto 𝑒𝑖during[𝑡𝑖−𝑤,𝑡𝑖].

8 EVALUATION
To evaluate the effectiveness of our approaches, we exploit real-
world datasets from two large commercial banks to address the
following research questions:
•RQ1: How does OAS perform in summarizing alerts?
•RQ2:Howdoesthesamplegranularity 𝛼inABRaffectthe
summarizing performance?
•RQ3: How does the sample length 𝛽in ABR affect the sum-
marizing performance?
•RQ4:How doesthe timewindow 𝑤inonline summarizing
affect the summarizing performance?
8.1 Datasets
We conduct experiments on real-world alerts from two large com-
mercial banks, A and B. As shown in Table 2, alerts of Bank Aand Bank B have different characteristics. The definition of thealert in Bank A is not strictly standardized, thus there are thou-
sandsofalerttypesinitsdataset.InBankB,thedefinitionofthe
alert is quite rigorous, thus Bank B has a much smaller numberof alert types than Bank A. Due to the information privacy, wecan only share the alert dataset of Bank B, which is available athttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5336985, in which all sensitive in-
formation is anonymized.

8.2 Baselines
As shown in Table 3, we compare our approaches with seven ap-
proaches, SeqKrimp, GoKrimp, CSC, SWIFT, Jaccard, Word2Vec,
and LDA. SeqKrimp, GoKrimp, CSC, and SWIFT are all frequent
patternminingapproaches.Theygenericallysummarizeanevent

approach.Asfrequentpatterns revealco-occurrencerelations be-
tween alerts, we consider CSC, SeqKrimp, GoKrimp, SWIFT as a
type of approaches that summarize alerts by behavior information.

SinceJaccard[ 13,31],Word2Vec[ 19],andLDA[ 2,33]arewidely
used to measure the semantic relevance of alerts, we thus com-
pareourapproacheswithsuchthreeapproaches.Inaddition,we
also individually evaluate the ability of ASR and ABR, respectively.

𝑒𝑖,insteadofACT,wefinditsmostrelevantalertduring [𝑡𝑖−𝑤,𝑡𝑖]
bythecosinesimilaritybetweensemanticrepresentations.Then,if
the maximum cosine similarity is larger than a fixed threshold, we
then add 𝑒𝑖into the incident of the most relevant alert. Otherwise,
we form a new incident for 𝑒𝑖. The same is true for ABR.
8.3 Setup
We implement ASR, ABR, ACT, OAS, Jaccard, LDA, and Word2Vec
with Python 3.6 and PyTorch 1.5.1 [ 22]. For LDA and Word2Vec,
we use a popular open-source NLP toolkit, Gensim [ 23]. As for
SeqKrimp,GoKrimp,CSC,andSWIFT,weuseaJava-basedopen-
source toolkit [ 28]. All experiments are conducted on a 4.20GHz
×8 Intel i7-7700K PC with 16 GB memory running ubuntu. The
source code of our approaches is available at https://doi.org/10.

Although our approaches require the longest training time, they
all take less than 10 minutes to finish training, which is actually
acceptable since the training stage is conducted offline.

8.4 Metrics
Forasystemfailure,ifanapproachonlygroupsapartofitstrig-gered alerts into an incident, we do not consider the incident to
be wrong, since the incident still groups correlated alerts correctly.
Only when an incident contains an uncorrelated alert, we consider
the incident tobe wrong. After correctness verification,incidents
canbedividedintothreegroups,correctincidents,wrongincidents,
and isolated incidents. An isolated incident contains only one alert
andhasnocontributiontoalertsummarizing,thusthereisnoneed
to judge its correctness.
Weusetheincidentaccuracy( 𝐴𝐶𝑅),thevalidcompressionratio
(𝑉𝐶𝑅),andthetimecost( 𝑇𝐶)insummarizingstagetoevaluatethe
performance of experimental approaches. The incident accuracy is
definedas 𝐴𝐶𝑅=𝑁𝑐
𝑁𝑐+𝑁𝑤×100%,where 𝑁𝑐isthenumberofcorrect
incidentsand 𝑁𝑤isthenumberofwrongincidents.Theincident
accuracy represents the proportion of correct incidents in non-
isolated incidents. The valid compression ratio is defined as 𝑉𝐶𝑅 =
(1−𝑁𝑐+𝑛𝑤+𝑛𝑖
𝑛)×100%, where 𝑛𝑤and𝑛𝑖respectively indicate the
number of alerts in wrong incidents and in isolated incidents. The
valid compression ratio represents the true summarizing ability of
the approach, and it ignores the contribution of wrong incidents
andisolatedincidents.Thehigherthesummarizingabilityofthe
approach,thehigherthevalidcompressionrate.Moreover,foreach
approach, we record its time cost ( 𝑇𝐶) in summarizing stage to
evaluate its efficiency.

8.5 Evaluation Results
To answer the proposed research questions, we evaluate our ap-
proachesfromfouraspects,thesummarizingperformanceofour
approaches compared with the state of arts, the influence of the
sample granularity 𝛼in ABR, the influence of the sample length 𝛽
in ABR, and the influence of the time window 𝑤in online summa-
rizing.
8.5.1 RQ1: summarizing performance. Inthefirstexperiment,we
compare the performance of approaches for each dataset. Figure 7
showstheresult.FromFigure7(a)andFigure7(b),wecanfindthat,
in terms of the semantic information, ASR has higher 𝐴𝐶𝑅and
𝑉𝐶𝑅than Jaccard, Word2Vec, and LDA, in terms of the behavior
information, ABR has higher 𝐴𝐶𝑅and𝑉𝐶𝑅than CSC, GoKrimp,
SeqKrimp,andSWIFT.Furthermore,OAShasthebestperformance
among experimental approaches.
This is because ASR integrates the contextual information of
wordsinanalertaccordingtotheirsemanticcontributions.How-
ever,Jaccardonlyconsidersthenumberofthesamewordsbetween
alerts, ignoring the common semantics between different words,
Word2Vec equally treats thewords in an alert, neglectingvarying
contributionsofwordstotheoverallsemantics,andLDAdistillsthe
generaltopicofanalert,failingtocapturethedistinctivesemanticsforalertsofthesametopic.Moreover,ABRminesthecommonality
betweenalertoccurrenceseries,whileSeqKrimp,GoKrimp,CSC,
andSWIFTtryto findnaivefrequentpatternsof alerts. Neverthe-
less, it is rare that the exact same failure recurs in a short period of
time, thus correlated alerts may not have frequent co-occurrences.
Since OAS further has a better performance than ASR and ABR,
the experiment demonstrates that both ASR and ABR have their
owncontributionstoalertsummarizing,andOAScaneffectively
aggregatethesemanticinformationandbehaviorinformationby
ACT.Inaddition,inbothdatasets,ASRcontributesthemosttoalert
summarizing. As show in Figure 7(c), to capture the deep semantic
informationandbehaviorinformationofthealert,ASR,ABRand
OAS have higher 𝑇𝐶in summarizing stage than other approaches.
However, ASR, ABR, and OAS can still process the alert withinacceptable time. In case of OAS, which has the maximum
𝑇𝐶for
each dataset, its 𝑇𝐶for Bank A is 26s, which corresponds to more
than 240 alerts per second, and its 𝑇𝐶for Bank B is 147.73s, which
corresponds to more than 670 alerts per second.
8.5.2 RQ2: varying sample granularity 𝛼in ABR.Inthisexperiment,
we evaluate the influence of the sample granularity, 𝛼, for the
occurrence series in ABR. We vary 𝛼from 1 to 60 minutes. For
each𝛼, we train a new ABR model and evaluate its performance
by the dataset of Bank B. Although there are some fluctuations
inFigure8(a)andFigure8(b),whichrevealsthattherelationship
between𝛼andsummarizingperformanceisnotstronglylinear,a
smaller𝛼stilltendstogetbettersummarizingperformance.Because
whenthesamplelength 𝛽isunchanged,asmaller 𝛼cangeneratea
longeroccurrenceseries,whichisabletoretainmoredetailedalertbehavior information. As shown in Figure 8(c), since a larger
𝛼can
generate a shorter alert occurrence series, ABR is more efficient
with a larger 𝛼. However, even with the smallest 𝛼(1 minute),
ABR still can process 100,000 alerts in about 2 minutes (more than810 alerts per second). Thus, in conditions permit, we recommend
choosing the smallest possible 𝛼.
8.5.3 RQ3: varying sample length 𝛽in ABR.As the sample length,
𝛽, in ABR determines the time range of the alert occurrence series,
weevaluateitsinfluence byvarying 𝛽from1 to24 hours.Similar
to the above, for each 𝛽, we train a new ABR model by the dataset
of Bank B. From Figure 9(a) and Figure 9(b), we can find that when
the sample granularity 𝛼is unchanged, as 𝛽increases, 𝐴𝐶𝑅and
𝑉𝐶𝑅also increase at first, and then they both gradually stabilize.
A larger 𝛽results in a longer time range of the alert occurrence
series,whichcontainsricherbehaviorinformation.However,when
𝛽reachesacertainthreshold,thetimerangeofthealertoccurrence
series can already reveal the complete behavior information of the
alert. More specifically, in Figure 9(a) and Figure 9(b), when 𝛽>13
hours,𝑉𝐶𝑅stabilizes at about 54%, while 𝐴𝐶𝑅is greater than 99%.
Moreover, as shown in Figure 9(c), 𝑇𝐶of ABR in summarizing
stage has a linear relationship with 𝛽. When𝛽=13 hours, 𝑇𝐶is
about2minutes(morethan809alertspersecond).Therefore,we
recommend choosing a small 𝛽that achieves a stable summarizing
performance.
8.5.4 RQ4: varying time window 𝑤in online summarizing. Sincethe
timewindow, 𝑤,inonlinesummarizingcontrolsthemaximumtime
span between two correlated alerts, we thus evaluate its influence
onASR,ABR,andOASbyvarying 𝑤from1to60minutes.Same
as above, we adopt the dataset of Bank B as the experimental data.
AsshowninFigure10(a)andFigure10(b),OASalwayshasabetter
performance than ASR and ABR, proving that ACT can effectively
integrate ASR and ABR. For ASR, as 𝑤increases, 𝐴𝐶𝑅decreases at
first and then slowly increase until it stabilizes. Such phenomenon
indicates a trade-off between the number of alert correlations inresult incidents and the accuracy of result incidents. A small
𝑤
can find a small number of alert correlations with high 𝐴𝐶𝑅while
a large𝑤can find a large number of alert correlations with low
𝐴𝐶𝑅.Nevertheless,fordifferent 𝑤,bothABRandOAShavetheir
𝐴𝐶𝑅stable above 98%. Because ABR concentrates on the robust
historicalbehaviorinformationofalerts,andOASintegratesthe
strengths of ASR and ABR.
Itshouldbenotedthatweuseafive-minute 𝑤fortheexperiment

8.6 Threats to Validity
We identify following threats to validity in our study.

Noises in labeling : We obtain alert correlations from history
failure reports written by domain experts. A failure report records
therootcauseandtheimpactofafailure,aswellascorrelatedalerts.
Sincecorrelatedalertsinafailurereportaremanuallylabeledby
experts, mislabeling is hard to avoid during the manual process.
However,asourexpertsareallfront-linemaintenanceengineers
with rich domain knowledge, we are confident that the amount of
noises in labeling is small (if it exists).
Generalizability : In our experiments, we use alerts from sys-
tems of two large commercial banks, A and B. The performance of
our approaches depends on the number of alerts and the quality
of alert correlation data (failure reports). In our study, Bank A and
Bank B have accumulated many historical alerts, and their engi-
neersarerequiredtowritefailurereports,whichweusetolabelthe
alert correlation. Similarly, in most commercial companies, both
historical alerts and failure reports are maintained for a long time.
In addition, Bank A and Bank B are two very large-scale banks,
providingserviceformorethanabillionusersfromhundredsofcountries. Thus, we believe our experimental results can demon-strate the value of our proposed approaches and our approaches
can be generalized to alerts of other companies.
Measurements : To demonstrate the summarizing performance
of our approaches, we use 𝐴𝐶𝑅(Accuracy) and 𝑉𝐶𝑅(Valid Com-
pression Ratio) as measurements, which are defined in Section 8.4.
Although F-measure is a widely used measurement, it is unsuitable
for our study. Because the correctness verification in F-measure is
dichotomous. However, in alert summarizing, if an incident (notisolated) contains no uncorrelated alerts, then even if it does notcontain all alerts of its corresponding failure, it is still correct inpractical production. Therefore, after a discussion with domain
experts, we propose 𝐴𝐶𝑅and𝑉𝐶𝑅to measure the effectiveness of
our approaches. 𝐴𝐶𝑅measures the proportion of correct incidents,
and it ignores the impact of isolated incidents that only contain
onealert. 𝑉𝐶𝑅measurestheabilityofminedincidentstosumma-
rizealerts,anditignoresthe contributionofwrongincidentsand
isolated incidents to summarizing.
