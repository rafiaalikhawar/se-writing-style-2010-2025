ABSTRACT
Reviewingsourcecodefromasecurityperspectivehasproven
to be a difficult task. Indeed, previous researchhas shown that de-
velopers often miss even popular and easy-to-detect vulnerabilities
duringcodereview.Initialevidencesuggeststhatasignificantcause
may lie in the reviewers’ mental attitude and common practices.
In this study, we investigate whether and how explicitly asking
developers to focus on security during a code review affects the
detection of vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectof providing a security checklist to guide the security review. To
thisaim,weconductanonlineexperimentwith150participants,
of which 71% report to have three or more years of professional

review and the existing vulnerabilities in the change. These results
provideevidencesupportingthementalattitudehypothesisandcall
for further work on security checklists’ effectiveness and design.

Codereviewisawidelyagreed-onpractice[ 15]recognizedas
a valuable tool for reducing software defects and improving the
qualityofsoftwareprojects[ 3,4,10].Previousstudiesshowthat

securitybugsearlier[ 46,81]andhaspositiveeffectsonsecuresoft-
waredevelopment[ 48,49,70].However,adoptingsecuritypractices
requires a large amount of knowledge which takes time to learn,
anditcanbehardtomotivate[ 57,83].Infact,securityissues(even
popular ones, such as Sensitive Data Exposure [65]) still often reach
production code, despite code review practices. So, how can we
better support code reviewers in detecting vulnerabilities?
In the study we present in this paper, we investigate three inter-
ventions that aim to tackle the problem by guiding the focus of the
reviewer. One isbasedon the developer’s mentalattitude hypothesis
and two are based on an additional security checklists hypothesis.
Studies in the literature indicate developers’ mental attitude
as a leading cause for the introduction of vulnerabilities in thecode [
50,88,91]. Specifically, vulnerabilities may be introduced
because developers do not consider security as their responsibil-
ity[50]orstronglyrelyonotherprojectmembers,processes,and
technologies [ 88]. A potential solution to resolve issues related
to developers’ mental attitude is giving explicit instructions re-
garding security. Indeed, Naiakshina et al . [51,52]showed positive
effectswhenexplicitlyinstructingcomputersciencestudentsand
freelance developers to implement securepassword storage dur-
ing coding. Nevertheless, writing and reviewing code are different
activities [ 41], with even cultural differences among teams [ 10],
therefore evidence about the former may not translate to the latter.
Some preliminary yet promising evidence exists that the devel-opers’ mental attitude could play a role in the context of code
reviewtoo[ 17].Usingaone-grouppretest-posttestexperimental
design[24],Brazetal . [17]foundthatasignificantnumberofde-
velopers who missed a popular vulnerability during a code review
could find it when explicitly warned about its presence.
Inthecontextofcodeinspections[ 30],theuseofcheckliststo
support developers has been extensively studied [ 44,54,58,68]
with positive results [ 26]. The OWASP foundation [ 33] proposes a
popularcodereviewguidethatcontainsasecuritychecklist[ 63].It

In our study, we set up three interventions (treatments) that we
compare among themselves and to a review baseline (control). The
baseline(Nosecurity Instructions–NI)consistsof askingdevelop-
ers to perform a code review without giving special instructions.

2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In this section, we briefly introduce the concepts of code inspec-
tions and modern code review (the context of our study). Then, we
reviewtheliteratureonexplicitlyaskingdeveloperstousesecure
coding practices as a way to overcome issues due to the mental
attitude and on checklists for secure software development and in-
spections/reviews.Wealsoprovidebackgroundonthetwosecurity
vulnerabilities we focus on in our online experiment.
Software developers and security. Security often fails be-
cause of the lack of usability: users either misunderstand the se-curity implications of their actions or turn off security features
to workaround usability problems [ 11]. Software developers need
to design systems that are both usable and secure. Yet, they still
needsupporttocreatesecureapplicationsbeforeaddressingusable
security [79].
Existingfindingsaboutdevelopers’attitudetowardssecurityare
not conclusive. On the one hand, a number of studies [ 7,57,90]
found that developers prioritize more-visible functional require-
mentsoreveneasy -to-measureactivities,suchasclosingbugtrack-
ingtickets,oversecurity.Ontheotherhand,ChristakisandBird
[21]reported that developers care more about security issues than
otherreliabilityissues.Smithetal .[75]advocatethatstaticanalysis
toolsdetectvulnerabilitiesandhelpdevelopersresolvethosevul-
nerabilities. Previous studies have proposed and improved tooling
support according to developers’ needs [ 8,9,74], but tools are still
generally poorly adopted by developers [ 79] as they are confusing
for developers to use [75].
Developer-Centred Security (DCS). DCS studies have addre-
ssed some of developers’ needs and attempted to apply existingmethodologies from Human Computer Interaction and to adopt
well-established usable security measures to software develop-
ment[39,55,89].ThesystematicliteraturereviewbyTahaeiand
Vaniea[79]points out the lack of research on several aspects of
DCS. For instance,they reported only one study inthe context of
code review [28].
Codeinspectionsandmoderncodereview. Peercodereview
is a manual inspection of source code by developers other than
the author. In 1976, Fagan [29]formalized a highly structured pro-
cess for code reviewing, which includes a synchronous inspection
meeting–code inspections. Over the years, researchers conducted
several empirical studies on code inspections [42].
Nowadays,mostorganizationsadoptamorelightweightcode
review process to limit the inefficiencies of inspections: moderncode review [
22]. This form of review is the focus of our study.
Modern code review is asynchronous, tool- and change-based [ 12],
and widely used in practice nowadays across companies [ 10,69]
and community-driven projects [66, 67].
Contemporarycodereviewmitigatesseveralissuesofcodein-
spections but also removes the structure and checks devised tokeep the reliability of the process and its outcome. Researchers
providedstrongevidencethat,asaresultofthisdifferentapproach
to inspection, the outcome of contemporary code review is less
predictable and past theories from code inspections do not transferseamlessly[
10,12,45].Therefore,itisimportanttoconductstudies
specific to this different context.
Explicitly asking for secure coding practices. Naiakshina et
al. [51,52] conducted two studies with 40 computer science stu-
dents. Half the participants received a task description that did not
mentionsecurity,whiletheotherhalfwereexplicitlytaskedwith
implementingasecuresolution.Noneoftheparticipantsinthefirst
groupstoredpasswordssecurely;whiletwelveparticipantsinthe
group asked to create a secure solution implemented some level of
security.Moreover,Naiakshinaetal .[50]performedasimilarstudy
withfreelancedevelopersandfoundsignificantpositiveeffectof
security prompting on the secure storage of passwords.
Weiretal .[85]interviewedtwelveindustryexpertstoinvesti-
gatehowtoimprovethesecurityskillsofmobileappdevelopers.
They found that many of the most effective techniques for finding
securityissuesare dialectic,i.e.,thediscoveryofknowledgethrough
one person questioning another. Some of the techniques recom-
mended were penetration testing, code review, pair programming,
andavarietyofcodeanalysistools.Onthecontrary,Edmundson
etal.[28]statedthatmanualcodereviewcouldbeexpensiveand
impractical due to the need for several reviewers to inspect at a
pieceofcodetofindavulnerability.Later,Brazetal .[17]conducted
aone-grouppretest-posttestcodereviewexperimentwithsoftwaredevelopers.Theyfoundthatseveraldevelopersoftenmissapopularandeasy-to-detectvulnerabilitywhenreviewingcode(pretest);yet,

specific, focused instruction on security could steer the developers’
attention, thus overcoming their common mental attitude to not
consider security aspects in review.

undergraduatestudents,OladeleandAdedayo [54]foundthatCBR
is effective in finding more issues during inspections with a 50%
decrease in false positives compared to AHR. On the other hand,
Akinola and Osofisan [5]did not find any significant differences
in the efficiency of AHR and CBR in their study conducted withstudents in a distributed environment. Similarly, the findings of
Lanubile and Visaggio [44]and Porter et al .[58]showed no signifi-
cant differences between AHR and CBR in terms of the number of
defects detected during software requirements inspections.
Studiesonchecklistsforcontemporarycodereviewarefewer.
Rongetal . [68]conductedasemi-controlledexperimentwith stu-
dents and found evidence that checklists can help in guiding them
during code reviews. In the context of education, Chong et al .[20]
found that students are able to anticipate potential defects and cre-
atearelativelygoodcodereviewchecklist,whichcanbeusedto
find defects. Finally, Gonçalves et al . [38]registered an experiment
reportwiththegoalofinvestigatingwhetherreviewchecklistsand
guidance improve code review performance.
Checklists in software security. Previous studies have addre-
ssedthedesign ofchecklistsforsecurity-relatedaspects,such assoftware security requirements and security life-cycle [
6,34,37].
Gilliam et al . [37]provided guidelines for creating a software se-
curity checklist, emphasizing the importance of verifying security
requirements beforehand to create a viable checklist. Garrison and
Posey[34]suggestedthatsecuritychecklistsareparticularlyuseful
in guiding non-security professionals through a security-oriented
softwaredevelopmentprocess.OWASP[ 33]statedthatorganiza-
tionswithapropercodereviewprocessintegratedintothesoftware
development life-cycle produced remarkably better code from a
security standpoint [ 63]. To help businesses strengthen their secu-
rity,suchorganizationsdevelopeddifferentsecurecodingpractices,
which are widely adopted globally [ 73]. In fact, they proposed a
code review guide containing a security checklist [63].
Cruzes et al . [25]investigated secure coding checklists’ usage.
However, the authors disagree that developers should adopt thispractice. Smarjov
[73]assessed the OWASP checklist’s effective-
nessonthenumberofvulnerabilitiesreportedtotheHackerOne
platform[ 40].Theyfoundamoderateconnectionbetweenfilling
out the checklist during thedevelopment phase and thedistribu-
tionofthevulnerabilitiesreportedinHackerOne.Thelikelihood
ofHackerOneparticipantsfindinganewvulnerabilityis2.92times
higher if they do not follow the checklist during the code develop-
ment.Tobestofourknowledge,nostudyhasbeenconductedtoinvestigatetheimpactofsecuritychecklistsforsecurity-focusedcode review. We address this question by analyzing whether a
security checklist supports developers in this task.
Software Vulnerabilities. OWASP [ 33] and the Common Weak-
ness Enumeration Project (CWE) [ 1] are well-established projects
that provide guidance and best practices for organizations to avoid
security issues. Our study investigates whether security check-
listssupportdevelopersinvulnerabilitydetectionduringcodere-
views. Therefore, among the OWASP’s Top 10 Web Application
Security Risks list [ 64], we focus on the Sensitive Data Exposure
(SDE– CWE 1029) [ 59] group, which can be mapped to items in
our checklist. SDEoccurrences have increased significantly overthe last few years [ 72], leading to damaging leaks. For instance,
the largest instance of SDEto date impacted 3 billion Yahoo!’s user
accounts, leaking their credentials (i.e., email addresses, passwords,
andsecurityquestionsandanswers).Securityexpertsnotedthat
the majority of the passwords used a strong hashing algorithm,but many used the
𝑀𝐷5 algorithm, which can be broken rather
quickly [87].
There are many reasons for SDE, such as the Missing Encryp-
tion of Sensitive Data (CWE-311) [ 61] and the ones covered in our
experiments, namely Generation of Error Message Containing Sensi-
tive Information (MSI- CWE 209) [ 60] andUse of a Broken or Risky
Cryptographic Algorithm (BRA- CWE 327) [ 62]. The former refers
to software that generates an error message including sensitive
information about its environment, users, or associated data; while
the latter refers to the use of a not recommended algorithm that
may allow attackers to compromise data that has been protected.
3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
Inthissection,weintroduceourresearchquestionsanddetail
our experimental design.
3.1 Research Questions
We structure our study around two research questions. We aim
to understand the impact of (1) instructing developers to focuson security issues and (2) providing an additional checklists on
vulnerability detection.
We formulate our first research question as follows:
RQ1.Doesexplicitlyaskingdeveloperstofocusonsecurityissues
facilitate vulnerability detection during code review?
We hypothesize that explicitly asking developers to focus on
security issues increases vulnerability detection during in codereview, because it would steer developers’ mental attitude. Our
formal hypothesis for RQ1is:
H01:The presence of security instructions does not facilitate vul-
nerability detection during code review.
Evidence shows that generic checklists aid developers during
codeinspectionsandcanimprovetheinspections’outcome[ 54,68].
Weexplorethehypothesisthatprovidingdeveloperswithasecurity
checklist(inadditiontoinstructingthemtodoasecurityreview)
further increases the vulnerability detection during code review
becauseitwouldguidethereviewtasksonrelevantsecurityaspects.
We formulate our second research question as follows:
RQ2.How does the presence of a security checklist affect vulner-
ability detection during a security-focused code review?
We organize RQ2.in two sub-questions. First, we ask:
RQ2.1.To what extent does the presence of a security checklist
affectvulnerabilitydetectionduringasecurity-focusedcode
review?
Thepresenceofitemsirrelevanttothechangemightdeteriorate
developers’codereviewperformance.Brykczynski [18]suggests
that users are less likely to read through a multitude of checklistitems. To mitigate this problem, one could imagine that future

automation techniques will be able to generate a checklist tailored
to the code change to review. We manually create such an ideal
checklist to measure its effect and ask:
RQ2.2.To what extent does the presence of a tailoredsecurity
checklist affect vulnerability detection during a security-
focused code review?
Our formal hypotheses for RQ2.1andRQ2.2are as follows:
H02.1:Thepresenceofasecuritychecklistdoesnotaffectvulnera-
bility detection during a security-focused code review compared
to providing security instructions.
H02.2:The presence of a tailoredsecurity checklist does not affect
vulnerability detection during a security-focused code review
comparedtoprovidingsecurityinstructionsoramoregeneric

3.2 Experimental Design
Figure 1 presents the flow of our online experiment, which con-

to return to previous pages or redo the experiment.

improvecodereviewpracticesandthattheyaregoingtodoacodereview.Wealsopresentourdatahandlingpolicytotheparticipants
and ask for their consent to use their data.
(2) Code review task: We first ask the participants to take the
review task as seriously as possible and to assume that the code
they are going to see compiles and all tests pass. Depending on the
treatment, participants may receive further instructions:
– No security Instructions (NI): Participants are provided no
additional instruction.
–SecurityInstructions (SI):Participantsareinformedthatweare
interestedinsecurityissuesinth)isreview.Wealsoprovidethem
with a definition of software vulnerability.
–SecurityChecklist (SC):Participantsreceivethesameinstruc-
tions as in SI. In addition, they are informed that they will have
accestoavulnerabilitychecklisttoassisttheminthereviewandex-plainthateachchecklistitemcanbeansweredasyes/no/irrelevant

in the checklist.
–TailoredsecurityChecklist (TC):Participantsreceivethesame

add/edit/delete review comments.
When ready, the participants can press a button confirming that

Inaddition,weaskparticipantsofallfourtreatmentswhetherthey

(3)Disclosureofvulnerabilitiesandinquiryonperformance:
After they submit their review, we inform participants that the
source code contained two vulnerabilities ( MSIandBRA) and
showtheirlocation,types,definitions,andeffects.Then,foreach
vulnerability we ask whether they found it. We ask participants to
reason on why they could or could not detect it. In addition, we
asktheparticipantsassignedtothetreatments SCandTCwhether
the checklist helped them detect the vulnerabilities. We also ask
their general feedback about the checklist, including whether and
whytheyskippedanyitems.Thisstephelpsusbetterunderstand
the impact of the security checklist on vulnerability detection and
collect qualitative data for triangulating our quantitative findings.
(4)Securityknowledgeanddemographics: Weaskaseriesof
questionsdesignedtogatherinformationaboutfactorsthatmay
affecttheparticipants’detectionofthevulnerabilities.Questions
are mainly about the participants’ security knowledge, checklistexperience, and team culture. Most questions are in Likert scale
format [84]. All questions are in the enclosed material [ 16]. Finally,
weaskaseriesofdemographicsquestionsabouttheparticipants’
gender,highesteducationlevel,employmentstatus,andyearsof
experience in professional software development, Java program-
ming,codereviewing,webapplicationdevelopment,anddatabases.
These questions are mandatory to fill in as collecting such data
helps us identify which portion of the developer population our
study participants represent [ 31]. We also ask about the frequency
withwhichtheydesigned,developed,andreviewedcodeinthelast
year; this helps us investigate possible confounding factors.

CodeChange. ThecodechangeisimplementedinJava:beingJava

toreachabroaderpopulationofdevelopers.Thechangecomprises
a feature implemented to manage users’ online registration to a
webservice, consistingof two classes, five methods,and 160lines.
Toavoidgivingsomeparticipantsadvantagesoverothersdueto
familiarity with the code, our code change does not belong to any
existingcodebase.Instead, weimplementedacodechange thatis
suitable for injectingboth vulnerabilities. The code changeis self-
containedandsuitablefor beingpartofanexistingsoftware ( e.g.,
notatoyexampletoteachbeginnersJavaprogramming).Finally,
thecodechangeissufficienttoconsiderpossibleattackscenarios,
thus detecting the two vulnerabilities.
Weimplementedthefirstversionofthecodechange,aftersev-
eral brainstorming sessions. Later, we interviewed two security
engineerswithfiveandtwoyearsofprofessionalsecurityexperi-
ence.Theyperformedtheexperimentwithtreatment SC.Weasked
them to read the code change before reading the checklist. Both
securityengineerspointedoutthevulnerabilities.Wealsoasked
them to provide feedback on the checklist. Finally, we conducted a
pilotstudy(Section3.5).Basedonthefeedbackwereceivedfrom
thesecurityengineersandtheparticipantsofthepilotstudy,we
iterativelymodifiedthecodechangetoensureitsrealismandre-
move any confounding implementation or design-related issues
other than the two vulnerabilities.
Security Vulnerabilities. The code change contains two vulnera-
bilities.Thefirstoneisa GenerationofErrorMessageContainingSen-
sitiveInformation (MSI–CWE209)[ 60].Whenan SQLException
is raised, the query containing an unencrypted plain text password
and the user’s email address is output to a log file. The error logtry {
    con = DBConnection.createConnection();    statement = con.prepareStatement("insert into user values(?,?,?,?,?,?)");        statement.setString(1, firstName);    statement.setString(2, lastName);    statement.setString(3, email);    statement.setString(4, userName);    statement.setString(5, generateHash(password));    statement.setString(6, salt);
    int result = statement.executeUpdate();    if(result!=0) {
        return "SUCCESS";    }} catch (SQLException e) {    String logMessage = "Unable to retrieve account information from database,"             + "\n query: " + statement;
}
    CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information: The log message may contain sensitive 
information stored in the prepared statement ('statement') it includes. If an error is raised, this sensitive information is output to a log 
file which in turn can be used to simplify other attacks such as SQL Injection. Furthermore, a password salt separated from the password hash can be exploited using rainbow tables.

    CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm: The MD5 algorithm has been designed for speed and has 
been subject to several security breaches, as it became computationally possible to generate collisions, meaning different messages will lead to the same hash. Due to its fast design, MD5 is also susceptible to brute-force attacks.

ria: prevalence, recognition,and discoverability using the selected

confirmed that these vulnerabilities are known and prevalent.
SecurityChecklists. TheofficialchecklistavailableintheOWASP
Code ReviewGuideline has78 itemscovering themost criticalse-
curitycontrolsandvulnerabilityareas(including MSIandBRA).
We prepared the checklists for the SCandTCtreatments using
the OWASP checklist and improved it by applying the guidance
offered by the literature [ 18,19,36,92]. The literature suggests
that a checklist should be concise and no longer than one page for
best practice and usability [ 18,36,92]; moreover, the categories,
whichrepresentparticularfeaturesoftheapplication,shouldguide
the reviewers “where to look" in the code [ 19]. Therefore, we de-
signedthechecklistavailabletoparticipantsof SCbyreducingthe
OWASP checklist to 22 security items structured in 3 categories
and7subcategories.The SCchecklistincludesitemsrelevanttothe
application context and the programming language, including two
specificitemsrelatedtothevulnerabilitiesinthecodechange.In
addition,thischecklistcontainsitemsirrelevanttothecodechange
to represents a realistic situation in which not all the items are a
perfect fit. Moreover, to facilitate participants’ interaction with the
checklist, we phrased each checklist item in the form of a question
andprovidedadrop-downforthecorrespondinganswer.Finally,
the resulting checklist was used during our interview with twosecurity engineers (Section 3.3 – Code Change). They provided
feedbackoneachitemofthechecklistandpointedouttheitemsthat disclosed the vulnerabilities in the code change. To preparethe checklist for the treatment Tailored security Checklist (TC ),
we reduced the checklist to a shorter version containing ideal-case
scenario items, i.e.,only items relevant to the code change. This
shorterchecklistthatwemadeavailableto TCparticipantscontains
seven security items structured in three categories.
3.4 Variables, Measurements, and Analyses
Table 1 presents all the variables we consider in our experi-
ment. The independent variable ( 𝑉𝑢𝑙𝑛𝐹𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 ) measures whether
the participants found the vulnerability. The main independent
variable is 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 (NI,SI,SCorTC). We consider the other
variables as control variables, which also include the time spent on
the review, the participant’s role, years of experience in java, code
review, and using checklists during code reviews. Details aboutinterruptions (
𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑢𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 ) are collected from the participants,
andtheduration( 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝐸𝑥𝑝 )ofeachreviewiscomputedfrom
the experiment’s log. To answer RQ1, we build two multiple logis-
ticregressionmodels,oneforeachvulnerability(MSI andBRA)
asdependentvariable.Themodelsaresimilartotheoneusedby
Mcintosh et al. [47], Spadini et al. [77], and Braz et al. [17].
To ensure that the selected logistic regression models are ap-
propriate for the data we collect, we (i) reduced the number of
variables by removing those with Spearman’s correlation higher
than 0.5 using the VARCLUS procedure; (ii) ran a multilevel re-gression model to check whether there is a significant varianceTable 1: Variables used in the logistic regression models.

classificationwiththeanswersparticipants gavewhenindicating
whether they found the vulnerabilities (Step 3 in Figure 1).

Analysis of open answers on performance. We use open
card-sorting [ 78] to analyze the the open answers participants’
gaveontheirreviewperformance(step3,Figure1).Itallowedus
to identify factors that might affect the detection of vulnerabilities
during a review. From the open-text answers, the first and second
author separately created self-contained units, then sorted them
intothemes.Toensurethethemes’integrity,theauthorsiteratively
sortedtheunitsseveraltimes.Then,bothauthors comparedand
discussed their results to reach the final themes. The discussionhelped to evaluate controversial answers, reduce bias caused by
wronginterpretationsofparticipants’comments,andstrengthen
the confidence in the outcome. We also use the card sorting output
to triangulate our results and form new hypotheses, which we
challenged with experimental data (e.g., end of Section 4.2).
3.5 Pilot Runs
We conducted 13 pilot runs to verify (1) the absence of tech-
nical errors in the experiment platform, (2) the ratio with whichparticipants were able to find the injected vulnerabilities, (3) theunderstandability of the instructions and UI, (4) the absence of
design/implementationissuesbeyondtheinjectedvulnerabilities,
and (5) the usability of the security checklist. We also gathered
qualitative feedback from the participants.

the pilot runs werediscussed iteratively among the authors every

required changes were minimal. No data gathered from the pilot is
considered in the final experiment.
3.6 Recruiting Participants
To recruit participants, the study authors spread the experiment
through direct contacts from their professional network as wellas their social media accounts, such as Twitter. In addition, theexperiment was spread through practitioners blogs, web forums,and open source mailing lists. The actual aim of the experiment

A total of 522 people accessed our online experiment through
the provided link. Of these, 357 did not finish all experiment steps;
thus, we removed their entries from the results dataset. We consid-
ered the 165 people who completed all steps as potentially valid.

ence and practice. Most participants currently have an engineering
role (62%), have more than two years of professional development
experience (82%), and design, program, and review code daily (37%,
65%, and 65%, respectively). 121 participants self-described as male,
7 as female, and 22 preferred not to disclose.
4.2 RQ 1. Security instructions in review
Table 2 presents the results of the review in terms of vulnerabil-
ity finding: 92 participants found at least one of the vulnerabilities;
37% (55) of the participants found the MSI, while 53% (80) found
theBRA.Amongthecontrolparticipants(NI),3%foundthe MSI

Finding 1.Developerswhoareinstructedtofocusonsecurityissuesduringcodereviewareeighttimesmorelikelytodetect
a vulnerability than participants who are not.
Qualitative Analysis – NI participants. By analyzing the an-
swersNIparticipantsgaveonwhytheydid(not)identifythevul-
nerability, we find recurring themes. Considering the case of MSI,
onlyoneparticipantfounditandexplained:“Iworkinabankandinmy company they send warning emails about this kind of sensitive
information being logged (like card numbers being logged etc). So
it caught my attention that what is being logged.” The top-three
reasonsparticipantsgavefornotdetecting MSIarethey(i)focused
on aspects unrelated to security (nine mentions), overlooked the
vulnerablecode(six),orlackedthenecessaryknowledge(four).For
instance, a participant reported: “To be honest, I was optimizing
forcodestructure/readability/architectureinsteadofsecurity.Even
so, I would probably have missed that one anyways.”
Concerning BRA, No security Instructions (NI) participants re-
ported finding it due to prior knowledge (four mentions) or theexplicit use of the
𝑀𝐷5 algorithm (one). For instance, a partici-
pantwrote:“It’sveryobviousthatMD5isbeingusedtohashthe
passwordandMD5beingbrokenhasbeenknownforalongtime
now.” Yet, 79% of the NIparticipants did not find this vulnerability;
the top-three reported reasons are: (i) lack of knowledge and ex-
perience (ten mentions); (ii) focus on aspects unrelated to security
(five); and (iii) wrong assumptions about the code (four). Three
participants reported that detecting the vulnerability was not part
of their responsibility; as one putit: “I am not very familiar withcryptographyandIwouldassumetherewouldbesomeseparate
security assessment.”
QualitativeAnalysis–SIparticipants. TheSIparticipantsre-
ceived instructions to focus on security issues during the code
review.Concerning MSItheystatedtheyfounditbecause(i)the
codeinvolvesuserorsensitiveinformationthatisvaluabletohack-
ers and raises security warning (eight mentions); (ii) of previousknowledge (one); and (iii) of first-hand experience (one). For ex-ample, a stated: “It contains personal information which is to be
protectedaccordingtotheGDPR.Theleakofthepasswordhash
couldbea[vulnerability]dependingonhow[theaccess]tothelogs
differs from access to the database.” The SIwho did not detect the
MSIexplained that they missed it because they: (i) overlooked the
vulnerability (six mentions), (ii) lacked knowledge or experience
(four), and focused on factors unrelated to security (one).
Regarding BRA, the SIparticipants mostly reported reasons
related to previous knowledge as to why they found it: (i) priorknowledge or experience (seven mentions); the vulnerability is
well-known(two); 𝑀𝐷5canbehackedandquicklybroken(two);
and,𝑀𝐷5 is an old vulnerability. A participant pointed out: “It’s
ratherwellknownthatMD5isn’tsecureanymoresoIimmediately
noticed.’ Among the SIparticipants who did not find BRAmost
(sevenmentions)reportedthattheydidnotdetectthisvulnerability
due to a lack of knowledge or experience. In addition, a participantstatedtohavemadeawrongassumption:“Iwasexpectingthatthis
could be configured in another part of the software.”
We challenged these qualitative reasons using data collected in
step 5 (Figure1). We usedthe variables described inSection 3.4 to
mapthereasons.WeusedChi-Squaretestforthefirsttwovariablesof

only𝐶𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔wassignificantlyrelatedtodetectingthisvulnerability
(𝑝<0.01). On the other hand, all variables of 𝑃𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑒(𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 ,
𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 ,𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛,𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔,𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑔 )weresignificantlyrelated

𝑝𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑒variables group was also significantly related ( 𝑝=0.02).

Table 4 shows the results. While 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 and𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑢𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠
are still significant for the detection of MSI, neither TCnorSC
treatments are significant. Therefore, we cannot reject H02. The
presenceofasecuritychecklistdoesnotaffectthedetectionofsoft-
warevulnerabilitiesduringcodereviewcomparedtoonlyasking
developers to look for security issues.
Finding 3. Developersreceiving achecklist (evenif tailored
to the code change) did not find more vulnerabilities than
developers only instructed to focus on security issues.
QualitativeAnalysis–TCandSCparticipants. Weasked TC
andSCparticipantswhetherthechecklisthelpedthemdetecting
the vulnerabilities.
Checklist was helpful: Concerning MSI, the top-three reasons
givenbyparticipantsaboutwhythechecklisthelpedthemfindingitare:thechecklist(i)markedtheparticipantsrecheckthecode(eight
mentions),(ii)pointedoutspecificareas(seven),and(iii)primedthe participants to look for vulnerabilities (three). A participant
explained:“Didnotseethedatapassedintheloggeratfirst.Butafter
seeingthatiteminthechecklistIwentbacktocheckagain.”Twoparticipantsstatedtonotneedthechecklisttofindthevulnerability
but they still reported it as helpful; one stated: “Even though I
found this vulnerability before looking at the checklist, it made me
specifically look for that again which is probably a good thing.”
Regarding BRA,thetop-threereportedreasonsforthechecklist
being helpful are that the checklist: (i) helped participants to look
forvulnerabilities(fivementions),thechecklistpointedoutspecific
areas(five),andledthemsearchforfurtherinformation(external
sources)regardingthevulnerability(three).Aparticipantexplained:
“Did not notice which algorithm was used at first. After seeing the
checklistIrememberedtheissueaboutthemd5algorithm.’’Another
stated: “While review, I search[ed on] Google how strong MD5 is.”
Checklist was not helpful: SomeTCandSCparticipants who
identifiedthevulnerabilities statedthatthechecklistdid nothelp.
Regardingthe MSI,thetop-fourreportedanswersare:(i)thepar-
ticipant noticed the vulnerability before using the checklist (five
mentions);(ii)theparticipantalreadylooksforthisvulnerability
(one);and(iii)thevulnerabilitywaseasytospot(one).Forinstance,
aparticipantreported:“Iwasalreadyonthelookoutforthatkindofmistake,becauseinapastjobpartofmyresponsibilitywasmakingsurethatdidn’thappen.”Regardingthe BRA,thetop-fourreported
answers are: (i) the participant already knew about this vulnerabil-
ity(15mentions),(ii)thechecklistwasnotspecificenough(four),
(iii) theparticipant didnot payattention tothe checklist(two), and
this vulnerability requires explicit security knowledge (two).
Participantsin TCandSCwhodidnotfindthevulnerabilities
also explained why the checklist did not help. Regarding MSI, the
top-four answers are: (i) lack of attention (three mentions); (ii)theyfocusedonsomethingunrelatedtosecurity(three);and(iii)
they overlooked the vulnerability (two). For instance, a participant
reported:“Iwasn’tfocusedontheexceptionpart,henceImissed
the vulnerability.” Regarding the BRA, most participants reported
lack of knowledge (six mentions) as the reason the checklist did
nothelpthemdetectthevulnerability.Aparticipantexplained:“I
wasn’t aware that MD5 was this vulnerable: I estimated during the
review that it was a good choice.”
Finding 4.Overall,32outof76ofthedeveloperswhoreceived

to be able to detect the vulnerabilities without it.
4.4 Robustness Testing
We employ robustness testing [53] to further challenge the valid-
ity of our findings.
Finding the first vulnerability distracted the participants.
Participantswhodidnotreceivesecurityinstructions(treatment:

data:thepresenceofsecurityinstructions(aswellasthesecurity
checklists) is significant to the detection of both vulnerabilities.
Additionally, 𝐶𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔also remains significant. Therefore, even if
findingthefirstvulnerabilitydistractedtheparticipants,thisdid
not impact the final results.
Participantshavedifferentlevelsofexperience/practices. One
factor that may impact the participants’ performance in the review
task is their experience and practice (e.g., developers with fewer
years ofexperience might findit more challengingtoidentify the
vulnerability).Itisimportantthatthetreatmentgroupsarebalanced
in this aspect. In addition to adding experience and practice as
controlfactorsinourregressionmodels,wealsoperformedmultiple
pairwise-comparisonbetweenthemeansofthetreatmentsusing
theTukeyHSDtestandcorrectingformultipletestswiththeHolm
approach. We found no statistically significant difference.
The number participants is too low. To calculate the minimum
size sample of our experiment (i.e., number of participants with
valid responses), we performed a preliminary power analysis using
theG★Power[32],usingTwo-tailtestwithoddsratio =1.5,𝛼=0.05,
Power=1−𝛽=0.95, and 𝑅2=0.3. We used a manual distribution.
After running the analysis, we found that our experiment needed a
minimum of 143 participants. As our experiment reached 150 valid
participants (bigger than necessary), we believe that our sample
is representative. H owever, this sample size is valid only for the
first logistic regression model that we built to answer the research
question RQ1. To build the second logistic regression model for
RQ2,weexcludetheparticipantsassignedto NI.Therefore,forthis
analysis, we reduced our participants’ number to 117, which is still
a quite large sample compared to many experiments in software
engineering[ 13].However,wealsoconductedotherstatisticaltests
to verify the effect of single variables on the expected outcome
and reported the results as the sample size could have affected the
significativity of the multivariate statistics.
The vulnerabilities are too easy/hard to detect. The vulner-
abilities injected in the changes might have affected the validityof our results. Reviewers might not find a too hard to detect vul-
nerabilityandgetdiscouragedtocontinuetheexperiment,while
participants might detect a too easy vulnerability regardless of any
otherinfluencing factor,even withoutpayingtoo muchattention
to the review. We measure that 37% and 53% of the participantsfound the MSIand theBRA, respectively, suggesting that these
vulnerabilities were neither too trivial nor too difficult to find.
5 THREATS TO VALIDITY
Internal Validity. As our experiment was online, participants
conducted it in different environments (e.g., noise level and web
searches),whichcouldhaveinfluencedtheresults;yetitisexpected
that developers in real world settings also work with various tools
and environments. Interruptions could have also influenced the
results, so we asked participants about interruptions and their du-
ration and included this information in our statistical analyses. To
mitigate the possible threat from missing control over subjects,
we included some questions to characterize our sample, such as
experienceandrole(Step4inFigure1).Weconductedstatistical
teststoinvestigatehowthesefactorsaffecttheresults.Participants
wereallowedtotaketheexperimentonlyoncetopreventduplicateparticipation. We removed participantswho did not completethe
experiment and manually analyzed outliers in terms of duration.
Weacknowledgethatdevelopers’background,knowledge,and
practicemayimpacttheexperiment’sresults.However,wecould
only register a statistically significant (positive) effect for the vari-
able‘coding‘(i.e.,“theparticipantconsidersvulnerabilitieswhen
coding” – see table 1) when finding the MSIvulnerability (Ta-
bles 3 and 4). In their open-text responses, developers indicatedthattheyperceivetheseaspects(especiallyknowledge)toplaya
substantial role. In addition, we performed multiple pairwise com-
parisons between the means of the treatments using the Tukey
HSD test and correcting for multiple tests with the Holm approach
(section 4.4). We believe the impact of background knowledge and
practice should be investigated with further studies.
ConstructValidity. Thevulnerabilitieswerebasedontheexam-
plesoftheirCWEdescription[ 60,62]andthesecuritychecklists
were based on the OWASP code review checklist [ 63]. To mitigate
theriskthatthecodechangesandsecuritychecklistscouldhave
unanticipated characteristics that biased the results (e.g., due to
inappropriatequality),wevalidatedthemwithtwosecurityexperts
(Section 3.3) and through 13 pilot runs (Section 3.5).
The online platform showed all code on the same page, and
participants had to scroll down to proceed to the nextpage of the
online experiment.In this way,weaimed toensurethat subjects
saw the complete code change. To mitigate the fact that the online
reviewingplatform maydifferfromwhat participantsareusedto,
the experiment tool’s interface is designed to be identical to the
popular review tool Gerrit [ 35]. Documentation was also added to
make the experiment closer to a real world scenario.
We used different measurement techniques to mitigate mono-
methodbias [23]:weobtainedqualitativeresultsbyemployingcard
sorting on participants’ responses to their performance inquiry
(Step 3 in Figure 1). We also used this technique on the feedback of
TCandSCparticipantsonthehelpfulnessofthesecuritychecklist.
We ran statistical analyses on variables from participants’ answers
(Step4in Figure1)andtriangulatedthequalitative andstatistical
findings. To mitigate mono-operation bias [23], we used more than
onevariabletomeasureeachconstruct(e.g., securityknowledge,
practice).Eachofvariable(seeTable1)correspondstoaquestion
in the survey on vulnerabilities (Step 4 in Figure 1). To mitigate
interaction of different treatments [23]: participants were randomly
assignedtooneofthetreatments(NI, SI,TCorSC).Totest H01(i.e.,
theeffectofasecurityinstructionsonvulnerabilitiesdetection),we
analyzed responses of all participants. To test H02.1(i.e.,the effect
of a security checklist on vulnerability detection) and H02.2(i.e.,
theeffectofatailoredsecuritychecklistonvulnerabilitydetection),
we considered responses of participants assigned to SI,TCandSC.
Weusedthequalitativedata–collectedfrom SCandTC(𝑁=76)–
to understand developers’ perceptions of the checklist’s effect. We
used the qualitative data from NIandSIparticipants ( 𝑁=74)
to get insights into their perceived reasons for (not) finding the
vulnerabilities. Therefore, qualitative answers in these two groups
(SC-TC,NI-SI) refer to two different contexts. We used this design
tolimitthenumberofquestions(especiallythosewithopen-text
answers) to prevent overloading our participants and to ensure
broader participation in the experiment.

sentative of all developers. Moreover, further studies should be
designedandruntoestablishthegeneralizabilityofourfindings
with different changes and vulnerabilities.
6 DISCUSSION
We investigated the effects of instructing developers to focus
onsecurityissuesandoftwosecuritychecklistsonvulnerability
detection in code review. We now discuss the main implications
and results of our study.
Mentalattitudematters. Vulnerabilitiescanleadtostrongneg-
ative consequences when they go undetected. Almost every day
the media publishes news about successful cyberattacks, showing
more and more the urgency and need for advances in the secure
softwareengineeringfield.Previousstudiesreportedmentalatti-
tude as one leading cause of why vulnerabilities are introduced in
the code [ 50,88,91] and initial evidence suggests that it may be
one of the reasons for not being detected during code review [17].
In line with previous findings [ 17,50,88], our results suggest
that developers’ mental attitude plays an important role in thedetection of software vulnerabilities during code reviews. These
results strengthen the questions on the effectiveness of the current
development process, including coding and reviewing activities.Organizations may consider incorporating Secure Code Review
(SCR)intotheirdevelopmentprocesstocreateadifferentapproach.
SCRisanenhancementtothestandardcodereviewpracticewhere
thestructureofthereviewprocessplacessecurityconsiderations,
suchascompanysecuritystandards,attheforefrontofthedecision-making[
63].Furtherstudiesneedtobedesignedandcarriedoutto
determine how to better design SCR and evaluate its effectiveness.
Interestingly, our results show that security instructions are
helpful but the detection of vulnerabilities does not increase when
a security checklist is added to the code review. Thus, a less is
moreapproach can be adopted to improve the code review process:
keeping it as simple as possible with security instructions ratherthan incorporating advanced or complicated solutions, such as
securitychecklists.Studiescanbecarriedouttoinvestigatehowto
effectively address security instructions during SCR.
Security checklists are no silver bullets. Checklists are a well -
establishedreadingsupportmechanismoftenusedbyindividual
inspectorsforthepurposeofpreparation[ 27].Previousstudies[ 54,
68]foundthatChecklist-BasedReadingeffectivelyfindsmoreissues
duringcodereviewsthanAdHocReading.Brazetal .[17]suggested
security checklists as a way to improve the code review process.
Surprisingly,wefoundthattheydonotfacilitatethedetectionof
softwarevulnerabilitiescomparedtojustinstructingthedevelopers
to focus on security issues during the code review, even when the
checklist is strictly tailored to the code change.
Ourfindingsprovideinitialevidencethatreviewersmaymake
wrongassumptions,suchasassumingthatthedeveloperalreadyim-
plementedthechangeconsideringtheapplication’ssecurity.Infact,
checklistsmaynotalwaysbehelpful.Forexample,itcanremind
the developer to use hashing to protect passwords. However, in
practice, hashed passwords cannot be used for challenge-responseauthentication, negotiating a shared cryptographic session key, or
forothersuchthings[ 14].Thus,thedevelopermustdecidebetween
protecting against a stolen password file or being able to generate
asharedsessionkey.Althoughwell-intentioned,achecklistcannot
answerthisquestionand,withoutproperknowledge,developers
may take the wrong decision. In our study, developers reported
lackofknowledgeasoneofthemainreasonswhythechecklists
did not help in detecting the vulnerabilities. A security checklist
couldbeusedasareminderbutnotasasubstituteforanalysis[ 14].
Apossibleproblemofchecklistsisthattheyareoftentoogen-
eral and do not sufficiently tailored to a particular developmentenvironment [
43]. However, our results indicate that a security
checklist strictly tailored to the code change does not increase the
vulnerability detection in code reviews. This finding raises ques-
tions on whether the problem is not the security checklists but
howdevelopersperceivethem.Infact,afewdevelopersreportedtohavereadthechecklist afterthereviewortonotconsideritat

7 CONCLUSION
Weinvestigatedwhetherandtowhatextentinstructingdevel-
opers to focus on security issues and providing security checklists
during code reviews can support the detection of software vulnera-bilities.Specifically,wedesignedandconductedanexperimentwith
150participants,whichincludedacodereviewtaskandasurvey.
The code change to review contained two vulnerabilities: Gener-
ationofErrorMessageContainingSensitiveInformation (MSI)and
UseofaBrokenorRiskyCryptographicAlgorithm (BRA).Thepartic-
ipants were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments:
NosecurityInstructions(NI),SecurityInstructions(SI),Security
Checklist (SC), or Tailored security Checklist (TC ). The latter two
groups received a security checklist; SIreceived instructions to
focusonsecurityissuesduringthereview;and NIreceivedneither.
In total, 92 participants found at least one of the vulnerabilities.
Thosewhoreceivedtheinstructionstofocusonsecurityissueswere
at least eight times more likely to detect vulnerabilities. However—
surprisingly—adding security checklists did not increase further
the vulnerabilities detection during code review compared to only
receiving security instructions.
Our findings provide evidence that developers’ mental attitude
plays a role in detecting software vulnerabilities during code re-
views.Theeffectofthesecurityinstructionsprovidesevidencethatvulnerabilitydetectioncouldbetriggeredwithpropersecuritycon-
siderations, such as security standards for code reviews. Moreover,
the role and design of security checklists should be investigated
further to establish and improve their effectiveness.
