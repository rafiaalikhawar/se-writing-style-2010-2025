1 INTRODUCTION
OpenSourceSoftware(OSS) hasbecometheinfrastructureofour
society.OnepossibleexplanationforthesuccessofOSSisitsunique
developmentmodel[ 37,40],inwhichthesourcecodeisopenfor
everyone and everyone can contribute back to the source code.
Although such development model permits the emergence of enor-
mousOSSservingawidespectrumofrequirements,italsoposes
challengesonthesustainabilityofOSS.Existingstudieshaveshown
that OSS are prone to sustainability failures [ 9,58], which may im-
pact a large number of downstream clients and cause severe losses.
One major challenge of OSS sustainability is to attract and re-
taincapablenewcomers[ 65–67].SuccessfulonboardingintoOSS
projects can be very difficult, especially for developers who are
new to open-source and for projects with a long developmenthistory [
32]. To help newcomers become familiar with an OSS
project, GitHub provides a list of best practices, such as providing
READMEs,formulatingcontributionguidelines,etc[ 18].Evenif
sufficient documentation is provided, it is still very challenging for
newcomers to locate suitable development tasks to start with [ 49].
For example, not needed pull requests are among the most com-mon cause for rejected code in OSS projects because newcomers
often submit “superseded/duplicated pull-requests” [ 51]. Recently,
GitHubrecommendsproject maintainerstolabelissuesas“Good
First Issues” (GFIs) [ 14], which is an explicit signal showing that
this issue is suitable and welcome for newcomers to solve.1
However,severalrecentstudieshaveraisedalarmingconcerns
aboutthecurrentGFImechanism[ 1,23,56].First,manuallylabeled
GFIsareoftenhighlyinsufficient[ 1,56],whichindicatesthatmany

changeably throughout this paper.

actualGFIsdonothaveaGFIlabelandmaynotbediscoveredby
newcomers. Second, the cognitive mismatch between newcomers
andveteranshinderstheeffectivenessofGFIs[ 56],whichindicates
that labeling GFIs can be a challenging task and existing labeled
GFIs may be inappropriate for newcomers. To tackle the insuffi-
ciencyandinappropriatenessofcurrentGFIs,weenvisiontheuseof
anautomatedapproachforGFIrecommendation.Suchanapproach
cannotonlyeasetheburdenofmaintainersfromlabelingGFIs,but
can also provide the most suitable task for newcomers so that they
are more likely to succeed in making their initial contributions.
In this paper, we propose RecGFI, a machine learning approach
toward this vision. RecGFI learns from historical issues actually
resolvedbynewcomersinsteadoflearningfromissueshavingaGFI
label,astheselabelsarescarceandpotentiallyinappropriate[ 1,56].
Foreachhistoricalissue,RecGFIextractsfeaturesfromheteroge-
neous sources of information including issue content, background,
and dynamics. RecGFI further uses an XGBoost classifier [ 8]t o
learn the difference between issues resolved by newcomers and
non-newcomers. Then, for all open issues, RecGFI predicts their
probability of beingGFIs usingthe trainedmodeland returnsthe
most probable GFIs for human inspection. Newcomers can browse
through the recommendations tofind suitable tasks, while project
maintainerscaninspectandconfirmtherecommendations(e.g.,by
adding labels) with reduced manual effort.
To evaluate RecGFI, we collect 53,510 issues from 100 GitHub
projectsusing theGHTorrent dataset(dump 2021-03-06)[ 19]and
GitHub REST API [ 15]. To simulate realistic scenarios and avoid
leakage of future data [ 57], we create two ground truth datasets by
carefullyrestoringfeaturesfromtwotimepoints:thetimewhen
theissueiscreatedandthetimebeforetheissueisbeingworked
on.OurperformanceevaluationshowsthatRecGFIcanachieveup
to 0.801 AUC at 1st time point, and up to 0.853 AUC at 2nd time
point.RecGFIalsooutperforms otherbaseline approachesandal-
ternativeswithlessfeatures.Wefurtherinterpretthetrainedmodel
using Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) [ 41]
and analyze statistics on the dataset to study characteristics of
issues suitable for newcomers. Our analysis reveals that RecGFI
is more likely to predict an issue as a GFI if 1) the reporter has
“just enough” experience in commits and more experience in re-
portingissues; 2)experienced developersparticipate inthe issue
(e.g., by adding labels, etc); and 3) the project has an active owner
andmorerecentlyonboardednewcomers.Finally,toevaluatethe
practical usefulness of RecGFI, we collect 511 latest issues from
the 100 GitHub projects, report 60 issues (without GFI-signaling
labels) to project maintainers, and monitor how these issues are
resolved. At the time of writing, we receive response for 33 issues
and16areconfirmedasrealGFIs.Afterthe16issuesarelabeledas
GFIsbyprojectmaintainers,threehavealreadybeenresolvedby
a newcomer. Even for the 17 issues denied by project maintainers,
twohavealsobeenresolvedbyanewcomer.Weshareareplication

2 THE GFI RECOMMENDATION PROBLEM
2.1 Problem in Reality
Itiswell-knownthatmakingthefirstcontributiontoanOSSproject
is hard. For example, a newcomer recently complains that:There’s a lack of resources out there for someone who wants to get
started contributing to open-sourcemostly because they find it hard
to make the first contribution and write the first piece of code.2
Onemajorreasonhinderingnewcomers’contributiontoopen-
source is the lack of sufficient labeled GFIs in most GitHub OSS
projects.Inasampleof105highlypopularGitHubprojects,only
46 projects have GFIs and only 1.5% of all issues in the 46 projects
are labeled as GFIs [ 1]; another study reports a median proportion
of only 4% for projects with labeled GFIs [ 56]. The insufficiency of
GFIsisalreadypreventingnewcomersfromparticipatinginOSS
projects. For example, a newcomer complains on Reddit that:
Looking to contribute to open source, but issues labeled good-first-
issue are all taken...I’ve had a hard time finding issues that are good
for beginners that aren’t completely taken over already.3
WealsoobservesimilarrequestsinGitHubissuesbecausethe
newcomer cannot find any GFIs:
I had gone through the whole project and I’m really excited to
contributetoitifisthereanygoodfirstissuesthenpleaseassignme.4
The lack of labeled GFIs in an OSS project may harm its sustain-
abilityinthelongterm.However,atypicalOSSprojectgenerally
havehundredstothousandsofopenissuesandmaintainersmay
lacktimetomanuallyevaluatewhethertheseissuesareGFIs.For
example, netlify/netlify-cms has 591 open issues at the time of
writingbutonly97arelabeledasGFIs.Evenif netlify/netlify-cms
alreadyhaveamuchhigherGFIportioncomparedwiththemedian
4% [56], some real GFIs may still be missed by maintainers and
can not be discovered by newcomers. For example, the issue in Fig-
ure1is actually suitable for newcomers but nobody has added any
GFI-signaling label.5In addition, the manual labeling of GFIs may
be even challenging for project maintainers due to the cognitive
mismatch between newcomers and veterans. A well-understood
construct of the “zone of proximal development” [ 59] describes the
case where experts are usually not effective at training or teaching
novices.Thisobservationissupportedbydata:40.9%ofGFIsare
notsolved bynewcomers and31.2% ofnewcomers failtosolve a
GFI even after several attempts [ 56].
In such scenarios, an automated recommendation approach will
beuseful:newcomerscanbrowsethroughtherecommendations
to find issuesto work on, while projectmaintainers can check the
recommendations and label them with much less effort. In fact, the
issueinFigure 1isonlyaddedwithaGFIlabelafteritisdiscovered
by our RecGFI approach (see Section 4.5).
2.2 Problem Formulation
Given a list of open issues in a GitHub project, the goal of GFI
recommendationis tofinda subsetof issuesthatare likelysuitable

Figure1, some information (e.g., screenshots) is omitted due to space constraints. The
issue is suitable for newcomers because it is relatively simple, has reproduction steps,
detailed screenshots, and clear expectation of a resolution [ 56].

3 APPROACH
Inthissection,wepresentRecGFI,oursolutiontotheGFIrecom-
mendation problem, including how it extracts features from three
heterogeneous sources of information and how it uses an XGBoost
classifier to learn from these features for GFI classification.3.1 Feature Engineering
Identification and modeling of viable features is vital for the per-
formance of any recommender systems [ 45]. RecGFI extracts three
dimensionsoffeaturesfromanissuetoabstractandlearnevidence
indicating possible GFIs: Content,Background , andDynamics .
3.1.1 Content. Intuitively, one can infer whether an issue is a GFI
afterreadingitscontent,includingissuetitle,description,andlabels.
Many kinds of information in issue content may be helpful in such
inference,suchaswhethertheissueisclear,whatkindofissueit
is, etc. Therefore, we derive the following features:
Titleand Description. Intuitively,issueswithlonger,clearer,
and more detailed description should help newcomers understand
and resolve correctly. Therefore, we extract the following statistics
fromissuetitleanddescription:length(i.e.,numberofwords)of
issue title ( len_title ), length of issue description ( len_body), num-
ber of URLs ( #urls), number of code snippets ( #code_snips ), and
number of images ( #imgs). These statistical features are frequently
used in previous work to measure the quality and granularity of
issue reports [ 24,56]. We also compute the following readability
metricsfortitleanddescription:Coleman-Liauformula( coleman),
KincaidGrade Level ( kincaid),Flesch ReadingEase( flesch),and
Automated Readability Index (ARI) ( ari). These readability metrics
are also used in previous work to measure the readability of bug
reports [7,12,34]. Furthermore, we use the training set to find the
50 most frequent keywords from descriptions of issues resolved by
newcomers and non-newcomers respectively. We remove common
words and get two keyword lists. For description of an issue, we
separately count number of words ( #gfi_words and #nongfi_words )
in the two keyword lists. Finally, for issue title and description, we
compute TF-IDF [ 44] for the top 50 words with highest term fre-
quency (excluding stop words), forming two 50-dimension feature
vectors ( tfidf_title and tfidf_description ).
Labels.Labels are an effective approach to attach categorical
information to issues, such as topic, priority and development
task[54].Exceptforgenericlabels(e.g.,bug),avarietyofcustom
labelsarewidelyusedinprojects[ 26].Certaintypesoflabelsmayin-
dicateanissueaslikelysuitablefornewcomers.Tocaptureevidence
fromlabels, wedivide commonlabels into12categories including
1)Task Type :Bug,Documentation ,Test,Build,Enhancement ,
Coding,o rNew Feature ;2 )Difficulty/Priority :GFI-Signaling ,
Medium Difficulty ,o rDifficult/Important ; and 3)Status:Triaged
orUntriaged .Toderivelabelcategoriesandheuristicsforautomatic
categorization of labels, we count the occurrence of all labels in
our dataset (Section 4.2), manually categorize frequently-occurring
labels,anddiscussdetectionrulesuntilreachingaconsensus.For
each category, we derive detection rules based on keyword match-
ing.Forexample,alabelisconsideredas Bugifitcontainskeyword
“bug”,o rGFI-Signaling if it contains any of the common keywords
providedbyTanetal.fornewcomers[ 56],orUntriaged ifitcon-
tains keywords like “untriaged” ,“needs triage” , etc. For each issue,
we count the numbers of labels belonging to the 12 categories and
the total number of labels ( #labels), resulting in a 13-dimensional
feature vector.
3.1.2 Background. Apart from issue content, some issue back-
ground information may also be useful when inferring whether an
1832ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA Wenxin Xiao, Hao He, Weiwei Xu, Xin Tan, Jinhao Dong, and Minghui Zhou
issue is a GFI. In RecGFI, we extract features from the following
sources of background information:
Reporter. Developerswhohavereportednewcomer-resolved
issues may be more experienced in reporting issues and report
betterGFIs.Ontheotherhand,veteransmayreportcomplexissues
or issues missing information necessary for newcomers to resolve
this issue. Therefore, we collect the following features to charac-
terize reporter experience in 1) project development: being a new-
comerhim/herself( rptr_is_new ),numberofcommits( #cmt_proj ),
issues( #issues_proj ),andpullrequests( #pr_proj)intheproject;2)
OSSdevelopmentingeneral:numberofcommits( #cmt_all),issues
(#issues_all ), and pull requests ( #pr_all) in all over the GitHub,
number of repositories owned ( #repo), number of stars received
in their own repositories ( #stars_rptr ) and number of followers
(#followers ); and 3) GFI reporting: number of reported issues re-
solved by non-newcomers divided by number of reported issues
resolved by newcomers ( nongfi/gfi ). Additionally, we check ifre-
porters have comments for the issues ( has_comment ) or participated
in any kind of events ( has_event ) to measure their participation in
their reported issues.
Project.OSS participants tend to seek projects that match task
difficulty with their skill level [ 31], while projects may vary in
difficulty,skillrequirements,andattractivenesstoexternaldevel-
opers. Although project background information does not help
whenrecommendingwithinaspecificproject,theymayhelpcal-
ibrateotherfeaturesandtransferknowledgefromotherprojects
incross-projectrecommendationscenarios.Therefore,weextract
the following project-related features 1) basic information: number
of stars ( #stars), contributors ( #contributors ), commits ( #cmt) and
closed pull requests (#pr); 2) owner information: same set of fea-
turespreviouslyusedtocharacterizereporterexperience,excluding
rptr_is_new ; 3) issue-related information: number of open issues
(#iss_open ),medianissueclosetime( iss_cls_t ),andnumber/ratio
of issues resolved by newcomers ( #gfi_proj and :gfi_proj ).
3.1.3 Dynamics. An issue is not static after its creation. It may
attract attention from different stakeholders (maintainers, users,
etc), be supplemented with more information, or undergo status
changes.Thesedynamicsmayaffectwhetheranissueissuitablefor
newcomers and should also be considered during recommendation.
Therefore, we extract the following features:
Comments. After issue creation, other developers may com-
ment on issues to add supplementary information, provide guid-
ance/management (project maintainers), or express interest (poten-
tialresolvers).Foreachissue,wecountthenumberofcomments
(#comments )asthefirstfeature.Then,similartoissuetitleandde-
scription, we generate a 50-dimension feature vector based on the
TF-IDF computed from comment text ( tfidf_comment ).
Events.The events of an issue reflects change of issue status
afteritscreation.Eacheventcarriesdifferentmeaningsandmay
berelatedtoallkindsofactivitieswithinthisGitHubrepository.6
For example, a “subscribed” event indicates the issue is drawing at-
tentionfrommoredevelopers,whilea “mentioned” eventindicates
the issue is complicated and related with other issues. Similar to
labels, we first find the top-25 events with most occurrences in the
6https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/events/issue-event-
typestraining set. Then, for each issue, we count total number of events
(#events)andthenumberofeventsforeachfrequentlyoccurring
event type, forming a 26-dimension feature vector.
Participants. Similartotheissuereporter,theexpertiseofissue
participants may also play a role in determining whether the issue
isaGFI,sincetheymayimprovetheissue(byaddinglabels,editing
titles,etc)andprovidehelptonewcomers.Therefore,foralllabelers
and event operators, we compute the same features for characteriz-
ing project development expertise and OSS development expertise
as the issue reporter. For GFI reporting expertise, we compute the
number of reported issues resolved by newcomers ( #gfi_labeler
and #gfi_evtr )andratioofreportedissuesresolvedbynewcomers
(:gfi_labeler and :gfi_evtr ). Wetakethe averageofall labelers’
expertiseandtheaverageofalleventoperators’expertiseastwo
inputfeaturevectors.Wealsocomputethenumber/ratioofnew-
comers among event operators ( #event_new and :event_new ), and
thenumber/ratioofnewcomersamonglabelers( #labler_new and
:labeler_new ) as additional issue participant features.
3.2 The XGBoost Classifier
RecGFIusestheeXtremeGradientBoosting(XGBoost)[ 8]classifier
tolearnfromhistoricalgroundtruthdataandpredictwhetheran
issue is a GFI. XGBoost is a gradient boosted regression tree ap-
proachwithseveralcleveroptimizationswhichenablesitsexcellent
performanceandhighscalability.XGBoosthasachievedstate-of-
the-art performance in a diverse range of application scenarios [ 8]
including software engineering tasks (e.g., [ 61,63]). XGBoost is
alsoeasilyinterpretableusingthegeneratedfeatureweightsand
supports automated feature selection during ensemble of trees. We
will show in Section 4that XGBoost is also highly competitive for
theGFIrecommendationproblem,outperformingothermachine
learning approaches in our ground truth dataset.
Since the number of positive and negative samples is highly
imbalancedinthegroundtruthdata(Table 1),RecGFIresamples
thetrainingsetbeforetrainingtheXGBoostclassifier,whichisa
commonprocessingstrategyfordealingwithimbalanceddata[ 4,
47]. Specifically, issues belonging to the minor class (i.e., issues
resolved by newcomers) are oversampled and issues belonging
to the major class (i.e., issues resolved by non-newcomers) are
undersampled, so that the proportion of two classes in training set
isbalanced.Finally,givenanunseenissueinthetestset(Section 4.3)
or collected from GitHub (Section 4.5), RecGFI uses the trained
XGBoost classifier to output its probability of being an GFI.
4 EVALUATION
4.1 Research Questions
To test the ability of RecGFI in identifying suitable issues for new-
comersandtoenrichourunderstandingontheGFIrecommenda-
tion problem, we ask the following research questions:
RQ1:HowdoesRecGFIperforminpredictingwhetheran
issue is suitable for newcomers? As discussed in Section 2.2,
there is no clear boundary of experience to divide newcomers and
non-newcomers, so we set a threshold 𝑘in newcomer definition.
Therefore,weneedto evaluatetheperformanceof RecGFIunder

RQ3: Is RecGFI helpful in a real world setting? Finally, to
demonstrate the practical usefulness of our approach, we collect
latestopenissuesanduseourmodeltogeneraterecommendedGFIs.
Using the recommendations, we conduct a preliminary user study
among project maintainers and monitor how these recommended
GFIs are actually resolved.
4.2 Data Collection
We choose to build a dataset for the GFI recommendation prob-
lem because we are not aware of any prior work that provides
a similar dataset. To retrieve engineered open source software
projects willing to attract newcomers’ attention, we follow the
instructionsintroducedbyMunaiahetal.[ 38]toselectrepresen-
tative GitHub repositories. According to the Octoverse Report,7
JavaScript,Python,Java,TypeScript,C#,PHP,C++andCarethetop
eight popular programming languages on GitHub in 2020. We use
thelatestLibraries.io8datasettofilterouttherepositorieswhose
primary programming language is one of them and keep 25,793
repositorieswithmorethan100stars,5contributors,5forksand
10openissues.WefurtherusetheGHTorrentdataset[ 19](dump
2021-03-06) to collect all issues for these projects and locate issues
withGFI-signalinglabelsaccordingtothelabelsetprovidedbyTan
et al. [56]. To locate projects with a strong interest in attracting
newcomers, we sort projects by the number of issues with GFI-
signaling labels and only keep the top 100 projects. These projects
have 1,417,497 issues in total and only 27,445 (1.93%) issues with
GFI-signaling labels (this GFI ratio is in line with previous stud-
ies [1,56]).
SincetheGHTorrentdataset[ 19]doesnotcontainsufficientdata
forourapproach(e.g.,lackingissuetext),wefurtherusetheGitHub
REST API [ 15] to collect title, description, labels, comments, and
events forall issuesand pullrequests. Issue eventsare neededfor
restoringhistoricalissuestatebeforecertaintimepointsandpull
requestsareusedtotraceissuestotheirresolvers.Thiscollection
process takes about one month using 15 GitHub API tokens.
IssuesonGitHubhavedifferentnaturesuchasaskingquestions,
reporting bugs, and proposing features [ 28]. Not all issues corre-
spond to a specific development task to be assigned to a specific
developer. Therefore, we need to locate issues resolved by a spe-
cific developer. However, recovering links between issues and the
versioncontrolsystemisstillanopenproblem[ 43],soweresort
toaconservativebutreliableapproach:findingissuesclosedbya
commitorpullrequest(PR)accordingtoGitHubconventions.In
GitHub, developers can link commits/PRs to issues using certain
text patterns (e.g., closes #num ) which also tells GitHub to auto-
matically close the issue if the commit appears in the main branch
7https://octoverse.github.com/
8https://libraries.io/dataorthePRismerged[ 13,17].Ifanissueisclosedbyacommit,we
find the commit using the corresponding commit SHA recorded by
GitHubintheissuecloseevent[ 16].IfanissueisclosedbyaPR,
we scan patterns in PR text (as defined in [ 17]) to find whether a
PRclosedthisissue.Finally,weareabletocollect53,510issuesand
their corresponding resolver in the 100 projects.
When computing features, we need to take time into consid-
eration to avoid leakage of future data which frequently leads to
overly optimistic results [ 57]. To simulate real world scenarios and
diversifyourdataset,werestoreissuehistoricalstateattwotime
points:thetimewhentheissueiscreatedandbeforesomedevel-
operstartstoworkonthisissue.RecGFIshouldworkwellforboth
time points since any issue in between the two time points may be
apossibleGFIfornewcomers.Wecomputethesecondtimepoint
as follows: if an issue is referenced by a pull request or assigned
to a specific developer, it indicates that a developer may already
be working on it, so we use the first reference or assignment event
as the second time point; if the issue has never been referenced or
assigned,wesetthesecondtimepointtothetimebeforetheissueis
closed. We compute all features at the two time points for learning
and prediction. We then compute the number of commits made
by the issue resolver before the issue is closed (excluding commits
that resolved this issue). This number can be used to distinguish
betweennewcomers/non-newcomersandgenerategroundtruth
labels when training RecGFI with a given threshold.
4.3 RQ1: Performance
4.3.1 PerformanceMetrics. SinceRecGFIoutputsaprobability,the
datasetishighlyimbalanced(Table 1),andrelativerankingofissues
matters more than a specific classification threshold, we choose to
useAUC(AreaundertheROCCurve)[ 20]asthemainperformance
metric.AUCprovidesanaggregatedmeasureofperformanceacross
all classification thresholds and represents the probability that a
randomly chosen positive sample will be ranked higher than a ran-
domly chosen negative sample [ 35]. Additionally, we list accuracy
(𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁
𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁+𝐹𝑃+𝐹𝑁)andrecall(𝑇𝑃

Atthefirsttimepoint,RecGFIwithonlylabel-relatedfeatures

have no labels when they are reported but only 33.01% issues have
no labels at the second time point. As time goes by, more informa-
tion from labels is available and inaccurate labels are corrected.
Figure2showstheprobabilitydistributionofeachpredictionfor
issues resolved by non-newcomers and newcomers with threshold
𝑘=0 at the second time point. We can observe that the model
successfully learns to distinguish issues suitable/inappropriate for
newcomers, though without a clear boundary. This is expected
because the notion of “newcomer suitable issue” is inherently am-
biguous. If an issue’s predicted probability is close to 0 or 1, it is
much more likely to be a correct classification.

4.4 RQ2: Outline of Issues Suitable for
Newcomers
We use LIME [ 41] to explain the prediction results of RecGFI with
relative contributions of features for single sample. Given a test
sample,LIMEgeneratesadjacentdataaroundthesampleandfits
aninterpretablelinearmodellocallytolearnweightsoffeatures.
Then,wedrawanoutlineofissuessuitablefornewcomersthrough
interpretable predictions and statistical analysis of the dataset.
4.4.1 Interpretable Prediction for Feature Analysis. To understand
the role of different features of RecGFI in predicting issues within
a project, we apply LIME to the prediction results of issues from
the Microsoft/vscode10project. Figure 3shows weight distribution
offeaturesotherthanthoserelatedtoproject,labelandeventtypes
on all test issues of vscode. Outliers are removed from Figure 3.O n

groups divided by reporters’ commits number in project.
The boundaries are 200, 400, and 600 respectively.
Figure 5: Predicted probability of issues resolved by non-
newcomers (blue) and newcomers (orange) under different
reporters’ commits number in project.
Specifically, developers who have reported more issues and con-
tributedmorecommitsarelesslikelytoreportGFIs.Higherratio
of historical non-GFIs also plays a similar role.
To further observe issues reported by developers with different
experiences, we divide reporters into four groups according to the
numberofcommitstheycontributedtotheproject.Thecoefficients
of reporter-related features are presented in Figure 4. Although in
generalexperienceofreporterslowerstheprobabilityofprediction,
when they have fewer (less than 200) commits in project, more
experience means that issues reported by them are more likely
to be GFIs. Figure 5confirms that issues reported by developers
with less than 200 commits in project are more likely to be GFIs.
In general, “just enough” experience in project leads to a higher
probability for the developer to report a GFI.
Intuitively,project-relatedfeaturesarenothelpfulwhenpredict-
ing issues within the same project at the same time, because these

features are the samefor the issues. These features areused to ad-
just the predicted probabilities of issues across projects or different
periodsofthesameproject,sothatissuescanbeclassifiedusing
the same probability threshold. In this way, project maintainers do
not need to spend extra effort to adjust probability threshold for
different period based on expert knowledge. To show what kind of
projects RecGFI tends to provide higher prediction probability, we
countthenumberofprojectswithpositive/negativecoefficientsfor
project-related features in Figure 6. Although the trend is not obvi-
ousformostfeatures,wecanstillseethatissuesfromprojectswith
higherratio ofhistoricalGFIs ( :gfi_proj )and morecontributions
from project owner (e.g., issues_proj_owner and :gfi_owner )a r e
morelikelytobe suitablefornewcomers.Thereasonmay bethat
project owner’s investment in project implies that newcomers may
getmore supporttoresolveissues. Longertimeneededto resolve
issues ( iss_cls_t ) indicates that newcomers have more opportuni-
tiestocompleteissues.Thisinferenceisconsistentwiththefinding
in previous study that GFIs take longer time to be resolved [ 56].
4.4.2 Comparison of Issues Resolved by Non-Newcomers and New-
comers.We divide all issues in our dataset into two groups accord-
ingtowhethertheyareresolvedbynon-newcomersornewcomers.
We first test all numerical features (106 in total) of the two groups
usingMann–WhitneyUtesttoseeiftheirmedianvaluesaresig-
nificantly different [ 33]. Table5shows statistics of partial features
with𝑝-value<0.00047( ∼0.05/106,withBonferronicorrection[ 11]),
whichindicatesthatmediansofthesefeaturesinthetwogroups
aresignificantlydifferent.Wecanobservethatissuesresolvedby
newcomerstendtocontainlongerdescriptions,morehyperlinks,
andmorecodesnippets.ThestatisticsofreportersinTable 5are
consistent with the features of reporters discussed in Section 4.4.1.
Besides, reporters are more involved in issue-related activities for
issues resolved by newcomers. At the project level, projects owned
bymoreexperienceddevelopersorcompaniesmayhavemoreis-
sues resolved by newcomers. Projects with fewer stars, commits,
and more contributors tend to have more GFIs. In other words,
active projects in earlier development period may have more GFIs.
For issues resolved by newcomers, developers who label the
issuesorchangethestatusoftheissueshavericherdevelopment
experience.Therefore,wecanmakeareasonableinferencethatthe
participation ofveteransis helpful fornewcomersto resolveissues.
We classify common labels into 12 categories in Section 3.1. Fol-
lowing conclusions can be drawn from Table 6:1 )DocumentationTable 5: Statistics of features from issues resolved by non-
newcomers and newcomers.

4.4.3 Observationsof QuicklyResolved Issues. Thereasons foris-
suestoberesolvedquicklymaybethattheyareeasyortheyare

be suitable for newcomers. We choose a strict "short time" (two
hours)toensurethatissuesareresolvedquicklybecauseofsimplic-
ity, rather than veterans completing difficult tasks. Nevertheless,
itneedstobeclearthatsomeissuesthatareresolvedwithintwo

tics of all issues and issues resolved within two hours (hereinafter
referredtoaseasyissues).AscanbeseenfromTable 7,forissuesreportedbynewcomers,thereisalmostnodifferenceinthepropor-
tionofissuesresolvedbynewcomersineasyissuesandallissues.
Forissuesreportedbynon-newcomers,theproportionofeasyis-
sues resolved by newcomers (1.15%) is lower than the overall ratio
(5.49%), since newcomers do not have enough time to find easy
issues. The other reason is that developers, especially those who
are experienced in projects, tend to resolve easy issues reported
bythemselvescomparedwithoverallsituation(33.64%to61.05%).
While 61.05% of issues reported by non-newcomers are resolved
by themselves, the ratio is only 33.64% for issues reported by new-
comers.The reasonmay bethat somenewcomersarejustproject
usersanddonotplantoparticipateindevelopmentofproject.In
addition, newcomers need longer time to resolve issues. Even if
they want toresolveissues reported bythemselves,they may be
preempted by non-newcomers.

4.5 RQ3: Real World Evaluation
To demonstrate that RecGFI works on real-world unseen data and
also useful under realistic scenarios, we run a script on August
23, 2021 to collect and compute features for open issues with re-
cent activities in the last seven days in the 100 projects. We get
3,130 issues after this step. Then, we use our trained RecGFI model
to predict whether these issues are possible GFIs, and we retain
511issueswithpredictionprobabilityhigherthan0.7.Wechoose
theprobabilitythresholdof0.7becausewedonotwanttobother
project maintainers with too many recommended issues and these
issues with higher possibilities are more likely to be real GFIs as
demonstratedinFigure 2.Projectmaintainerscanchooseanappro-
priate probability threshold according to the needs of their project.
A lower probability threshold means more potential false positives
and fewer GFIs omissions, while a higher probability threshold
ensure that recommended issues are more likely to be GFIs and
more GFIs may be missed.

Figure 8: The issue in Section 2.1is labeled as a GFI by a
project maintainer after our recommendation.
Our first goal is to evaluate whether the recommended GFIs are
really perceived as GFIs by project maintainers. To achieve this
goal, we carefully check the 511 recommended issues by browsing
through issue titles, description, labels, comments, and timeline
events.Wealsocheckprojectcontributiondocumentationtounder-
standtheirissueworkflowwherenecessary.Asexpected,alarge
number of open issues are not in a suitable state for recommen-
dation: 70 issues still need further information or discussion to
be confirmed as a real issue; 115 issues are already being solved
by a specific developer; 25 issues do not correspond to a specific
development task (i.e., they may be discussions, proposals, etc);
finally, 9 issues are closed between script execution and manual
inspection.Fortunately,weobservethatmostprojectshavecustom
labelstospecifyissuestates(e.g.,“NeedsTriage”,“InDiscussion”,
“In Progress”, etc) and better recommendation can be facilitated by
customizing RecGFI to work on a subset of open issues (e.g., by
specifying filtering rules on issue labels).
Intheremaining216issues,67(31.0%)alreadyhaveGFI-signaling
labels while 28 (13.0%) have some evidence indicating they are
not suitable for newcomers (e.g., difficult, complex, etc). For the
remaining121issues,wegroupthembyprojectandreportthem
toprojectmaintainersinthefollowingway:ifaprojecthasmore
thanthreerecommendedissues,weopenanewissue/discussion
in the project to report up to 10 issues as possible GFIs; if the
project contribution guideline does not allow opening such issues,
wedirectlycommentonuptothreeissuestosuggestaddingGFI-
signaling labels. We limit the number of issues reported to avoid
being perceived as spamming or causing too much workload for
project maintainers, and we report 60 issues after this procedure.
Atthetimeofwriting,wehavereceivedresponsefor33reported
issues. 16 issues are confirmed as GFIs (see an example in Figure 8)
andprojectmaintainersaddGFI-signalinglabelsfortheseissues,
while17issuesarenotconsideredasGFIsbyprojectmaintainers.
In other words, our model reaches an estimated precision of (16+
67)/(16+17+67+28)=64.84%intherealworldsetting.Although
our recommendations stillcontain false positives (asperceived by
the project maintainers), we receive positive responses from the
maintainers about our approach:
(1)Marking more issues as GFI does have the potential of making
projects more accessible to new contributors, so I’m intrigued!12
(2)Thanks for suggesting those. I have gone ahead and added the

Our second goal is to evaluate to what extent are the recom-
mendedGFIsactuallyresolvedbynewcomersatthetimeofwriting
(January 4, 2022). For the 16 issues recommended by us and con-
firmedlaterbyprojectmaintainers,threeissues15,16,17(amongfive
resolved) are resolved by a newcomer. One issue18has attracted a
newcomerbutislater resolvedbyanon-newcomer.Interestingly,
for the 17 issues denied by project maintainers, two issues19,20
(among eight resolved) are also resolved by newcomers, both with
only several lines of changes. The two issues offer preliminary
evidence that project maintainers may not always be correct in
labeling GFIs and an automated recommendation approach adds
up more value in helping newcomers onboard.

5 DISCUSSION
Identifying Issues Suitable for Newcomers. Ideally, RecGFI
should be able to clearly distinguish between issues suitable / inap-
propriatefornewcomers.Becausesuchidealgroundtruthlabelsare
notavailable,RecGFIistrainedfromdifferentlabels(whetheran
issueisresolvedbyanewcomer),whichcomeswithanumberofad-
vantagesandlimitations.First,itworksonanyprojectwithatleast
someonboardnewcomerseveniftheprojectmaintainersdonot
addanyGFI-signalinglabelstoissues.However,althoughweshow
thatissuesresolvedbynewcomersarelessscarce(10.18%-16.26%in
Table1) than issues with GFI-signaling labels (1.93%), it is also pos-
siblethatissuesresolvedbynon-newcomersareactuallysuitable
fornewcomersbecauseitcanbehardfornewcomerstodiscover
these issues. Such cases canbe mitigated if RecGFI is deployed in
practice and continuously recommending GFIs to newcomers in
a project. We also do not consider the expertise or preference of
newcomers during recommendation and we plan to explore the
possibility of personalized GFI recommendation in future work.
Filteringof“NotTask”Issues. AsdemonstratedinSection 4.5,
theefficiencyof RecGFIishinderedbythefactthatasignificant
portionofissuesonGitHubdoesnotcorrespondtoaspecificde-
velopment task [ 28]. Although this limitation can be mitigated for
projectsthatmanageissues withwell-definedlabels,itmaymake
RecGFI less useful in other projects. Future work can design an
approachthatautomaticallylearnsandfilters“nottask”issuesto
make GFI recommendation more effective.
TheThreshold 𝑘.Thethresholdusedtodefinenewcomersisa
parameter that can be flexibly adjusted. If project maintainers tend
to define newcomers more strictly, 𝑘=0 is a reasonable choice.

Otherwise, previous work [ 56] has shown that the distribution
of commits are often sparse between newcomers and long-term
contributors, so a 𝑘value can also be chosen near this boundary,
which should be 𝑘=2o r𝑘=3 for most projects.
ExpertiseandExperienceintheNewcomerDefinition. In
thiswork,weonlyconsiderthenumberofcommitsfortheconcept
of newcomers and ignores other forms of experiences (e.g., code
review, issue reporting, commenting, etc.) because other experi-
ences are either not indicative of expertise in contributing code
(e.g., issue reporting, commenting), or are only possible when one
already becomes a veteran (e.g., code review). According to Baltes
and Diehl [ 6], knowledge, experience, and skills constitute one’s
expertise in a project. However, it is non-trivial to infer knowledge
and skills from data (which is important for personalized recom-
mendation), so we leave them for future work.
Learning from Issue Text. In RecGFI, we model issue text
using readability, keyword frequency, text length, number of im-
ages, number of code snippets and number of hyperlinks. Domain-
specific information in issue descriptions may be helpful for recog-
nizingGFIs,butwefindthatstraightforwarddeepneuralnetworks
(e.g., LSTM [ 22]) fail to capture such semantics and cannot outper-
form our current approach. Therefore, future work can be devoted
to approaches that better capture issue semantics.
GeneralizabilitytoOtherProjects. Theoretically,RecGFIcan
work on any GitHub project. However, to ensure the quality of
ourdataset,ourevaluationisbasedsolelyonprojectswithmany
manually labeled GFIs and high popularity. Future work is needed
to investigate to what extent can RecGFI perform on projects with
differentcharacteristics.Ifaprojectlackshistoricaldata(e.g.,few
onboardednewcomersandfewissues),RecGFImayperformless
well and its transferability to other projects should also be studied
in future work.
6 RELATED WORK
Keeping a good influx of new developers is critical for the survival,
long-term success, and continuity of OSS projects [ 21]. Substan-
tialeffortshavebeendevotedtounderstandingcontributors’mo-
tivation, newcomers’ barriers, exploring associated factors, and
identifying strategies to get people onboard.
Harset.al[ 21]identifiestwobroadtypesofmotivations:inter-
nal factors (e.g., intrinsic motivation and altruism) and external
rewards (e.g., expected future returns and personal needs). Ye et.
al [62] theorize that learning is one of the motivational forces. Von
Krogh et al. [ 30] conclude in a review that developers are moti-
vated by intrinsic, internalized extrinsic, and extrinsic motivations.
Krishnamurthy et al. [ 29] investigate the motivation of peripheral
developers and find that the recognition from project stakeholders
promotes the participation of peripheral developers.
Newcomers face many barriers when they participate in OSS
projects, including both technical (e.g., domain knowledge and
programmingskills[ 32,46])andnon-technicalfactors(e.g.,com-
munication[ 55]).Inaqualitativestudy,Shibuyaetal.[ 46]findthat
newcomers usually have difficulties in task selection due to lack of
documentation, constraints in contributor license agreement, no
technical support, etc. Steinmacher et al. [ 49] divide 58 difficulties
into six groups, e.g., newcomers’ characteristics and technical hur-
dles. Mendez et al. [ 36] take a new perspective of barriers fromtools and infrastructure and find that the barriers are implicated in
all six categories of previously established newcomer barrier types.
Inviewofthesebarriers,manyresearchersexploremethodsand
strategiestohelpnewcomers.Zhou[ 64]callsforresearchintoOSS
projectcommunication,modularization,taskdivision,andlearning

nical, contribution process, and social behavior guidelines to help

pable of automated recommendation. In this paper, we fill this gap
byproposingamachinelearningapproachspecificallydesignedfor
GFI recommendation,which canhelp relieve maintainers’burden
and get newcomers onboard. Recently, a parallel work from Huang
et al. [25] propose an automatic approach to characterize and pre-
dict GFIs. Our work has several notable differences compared with
theirs. First, their approach predicts whether an issue has a GFI
label while ours predicts whether an issue will be resolved by a
newcomer.Oursetupcanavoidbiasintroducedbymanuallabeling
and also works for projects with scarce or no GFI labels. Second,
weusetheeventstreamprovidedbyGHTorrent[ 19]torestorehis-
torical issue states. Finally, we build a larger dataset for evaluation,
with 10x more projects and two different time points.
7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have presented RecGFI, a machine learning ap-
proach based on extensive feature engineering and an XGBoost
classifierforrealGFIrecommendationscenarios.Weshowthrough
experiments that RecGFI achieves high performance, outperforms
other alternative methods, and reveals interesting observations on
GFIcharacteristics.Wealsoconductafieldevaluationtoprovethat
RecGFI is able to help project maintainers label GFIs and attract
newcomers onboard.In thefuture, we planto exploreways tode-
ployRecGFI(e.g.,viaGitHubBotsorPlugins)andderiveimproved
approaches for personalized GFI recommendation.
