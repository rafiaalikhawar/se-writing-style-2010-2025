Recently,variousDeepNeuralNetwork(DNN)modelshavebeen
proposed for environments like embedded systems with stringent
energyconstraints.Thefundamentalproblemofdeterminingthero-
bustness of a DNN with respect to its energy consumption (energy
robustness)isrelativelyunexploredcomparedtoaccuracy-basedro-
bustness.ThisworkinvestigatestheenergyrobustnessofAdaptiveNeuralNetworks(AdNNs),atypeofenergy-savingDNNsproposed
for many energy-sensitive domains and have recently gained trac-
tion. We propose EREBA, the first black-box testing method for
determiningtheenergyrobustnessofanAdNN.EREBAexplores
and infers the relationship between inputs and the energy con-
sumptionofAdNNstogenerateenergysurgingsamples.Extensive
implementation and evaluation using three state-of-the-art AdNNs
demonstrate that test inputs generated by EREBA could degrade
the performance of the system substantially. The test inputs gener-
ated by EREBA can increase the energy consumption of AdNNs by
2,000% compared to the original inputs. Our results also show that
testinputsgeneratedviaEREBAarevaluableindetectingenergy

Recentlytherehasbeenaconsiderableamountofresearchinde-
veloping energy-saving DNN models to allow state-of-art DNNs
with high computational costs to be deployed in mobile and em-
beddedarchitecture. AdaptiveNeuralNetworks(AdNNs) [2,7,33]
are energy-saving DNN models that determine when to switch off
certainpartsofthenetworktoreducethenumberofcomputations.
BecauseanAdNNmodeldetermineswhichpartsoftheneural
network to run based on inputs, an adversary’s ability to surge
the energy consumption by carefully crafting inputs is a crucial
concern in energy-critical environments. For example, AdNNs like
BlockDrop[ 41]andSkipNet[ 38]canreducethecomputationsin
ResNet significantly and an alteration on the input can nullify a
largeportionofthereducedcomputations,invalidatingthemodels’
purpose. Such behavior would lead the app or software using an
AdNN model to consume energy erratically, resulting in devices’
power failure and disastrous consequences. Thus, there is a strong
needtoprovideasystematictestingmethodtofindenergyhotspots
inthemodelandfilteroutpotential“power-surging”inputsthat
will negatively impact the model’s performance.
Creating testing inputs to increase the energy consumption of a
DNNmodelischallengingbecauseinferringtherelationbetween
energyconsumptionandinputis achallengingtask.Unlikeinfer-
ring the relation between input and output, where we can find the
derivatives from a series of computation functions in the model,
energy consumptioncan onlybe measured byrunning themodel.
Traditional DNN testing methods [ 22,30,37,43] and traditional
adversarial attacks [ 4,10,29] on DNNs have been designed to cre-
ate carefully crafted synthetic testing inputs using the gradient of
generated output with respect to the input. However, for energy
testing,itisunclearwhetherachangeintheinputinducesanin-
crease or decrease in the energy consumption of the model. Tothe best of our knowledge, ILFO [
13] is the first work that seeks
to formulate all types of AdNN’s energy robustness (Section 2.1)
problem by modeling the relation between input and intermediate
output [13] (DeepSloth [ 15] only evaluates energy robustness of
Early-terminationAdNNs).
However,ourinvestigations(Section3)showthatILFOgener-
ated energy surging samples lack traditional transferability, i.e.,,
the adversarial samples generated by ILFO for a target AdNN can-
not be applied to a new AdNN to increase its energy consumption.
Therefore, the traditional black-box accuracy testing method of
DNNs using surrogate model [ 5,21,28] can not be used for energy
robustnessevaluation.Therefore,ILFOgeneratedsamplescannot
evaluate the energy robustness of AdNNs in a black-box scenario.

This paper presents EREBA(EnergyRobustness using Estimator
BasedApproach)toperformenergytestingonAdNNsunderthe
black-box setting where there is no prior knowledge known about
the AdNN model. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt in
this direction. EREBAaims to evaluate the energy robustness of
AdNNandidentifyinputsthatwillnegativelyimpactthemodel’s
performance.Specifically,wedeveloptwotestingmethodstoassess
anygivenAdNNmodel’senergyrobustness,namelyInput-based

AdNN(e.g., meaningfulimages,compilableprograms).Ontheother
hand, universal testing evaluates worst-case energy robustness
whereeachtestinginputmaximizestheenergyconsumptionfor
each target AdNN.
ForgeneratingtestinginputsforAdNNsinablack-boxsetting,it
isneededtofindarelationbetweeninputandenergyconsumption
of AdNNs. Based on the working mechanism of AdNNs, we know
thatdifferentnumbersofresidualblocks/layersareactivatedduringinferencefordifferentinputs.Thenumberofactivatedblocks/layers
during inference has a semi-linear (step-wise) relation with energy
consumption,whichcan alsobenoticedin Figure7.Throughthis
step-wise relation between the number of activated blocks and
energyconsumption,wecanconcludethatinputandenergycon-
sumption of AdNNs are related. Because of this reason, EREBAis
able to learn a decent approximation of the energy consumption
of an AdNN given the input. Based on such approximation, EREBA
thengeneratesinputperturbationsthatsignificantlyincreasethe
energy consumption of the AdNN.
We evaluate EREBAon four criteria: effectiveness, sensitivity,
quality,androbustnessusingtheCIFAR-10andCIFAR-100datasets
[19,35,36]. First, to evaluate the effectiveness of the testing inputs
generated by EREBA, we calculate the energy required for AdNNs
to classifythese inputswhile running onan NvidiaTX2 server. Wethencomparethisvaluewiththeenergyrequiredbytheinputsgen-eratedfromcommoncorruptionsandperturbationstechniques[

The quality of the generated testing inputs is evaluated against
the original input through Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and
StructuralSimilarity Index(SSIM)[ 39,40].Finally, therobustness

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Energy Robustness
ILFO[13]hasdefinedtheenergyrobustnessofaDNNasthesta-
bility of the model’s energy consumption after getting a perturbed
input.However,amodel’senergyrobustnessshouldnotonlyde-
pend on the inputs that belong to the training data distribution
of the model. Energy robustness should also be evaluated basedon the out-of-distribution inputs. Because of this reason, we de-
fine two types of energy robustness for DNNs: Input-based Energy
Robustness ( 𝐸𝑖) and Universal Energy Robustness ( 𝐸𝑢).
𝐸𝑖isdefinedbythemaximumenergyconsumedbythemodel
for an input which belongs to the training data distribution ofthe model. Let us assume,
𝑥is an input that is within the data
distributionof aDNN 𝑓.Wewant toadd perturbation 𝛿to𝑥such
thatenergyconsumptionismaximum.Inthatscenario, 𝐸𝑖canbe
represented as,
𝐸𝑖=−max
𝛿∈𝑅(𝐸𝑁𝐺𝑓(𝑥+𝛿)−𝐸𝑁𝐺𝑓(𝑥))
,where𝑅issetofadmissibleperturbationssuchthat 𝑥+𝛿remains
within distribution, and 𝐸𝑁𝐺𝑓represents the energy consumption
of DNN 𝑓.
𝐸𝑢can be described as the highest possible energy consumed
by a model for any input. Inputs used to measure 𝐸𝑢can be out-of-
distribution inputsalso. Fora DNN 𝑓and anyinput 𝑥,𝐸𝑢can be
represented as,
𝐸𝑢=−max𝑥𝐸𝑁𝐺𝑓(𝑥)
, where𝐸𝑁𝐺𝑓representsenergy consumptionof DNN. Byincreas-
ing the value of 𝐸𝑖and𝐸𝑢, energy robustness of a model can be
increased.
2.2 AdNNs
The main objective of AdNNs is to minimize executing layers in
a Neural Network while maintaining reasonable accuracy. The
AdNNs can be divided mainly into two types: Conditional-skipping
AdNNs[38,41] andEarly-termination AdNNs [2,33]. Both types of
AdNNsreducecomputationsiftheirintermediateoutputvaluessat-

Motivation. In a black-box setting, existing techniques [ 5,21,28]
evaluate the accuracy-robustness of DNNs based on the traditional
transferabilityofadversarialsamples[ 27].Adversarialexamplesof
DNNs are perturbed inputs close to the original correctly classifiedinputsbutaremisclassifiedbyDNNs.Becauseadversarialexamples
are commonly used as testing inputs to measure the robustness
oftheneuralnetworks[ 23,43]),wewillalsousetheterm testing

Preliminarystudy. Wehaveconductedastudytoinvestigatethe
traditional transferability of energy-based testing input on AdNNs.
To our knowledge, this is the first effort to explore the transferabil-
ity of energy-based testing input on AdNNs. We define base and
target models for this study. The white-box attack is performed on
the base model, and the target model classifies the testing input.
Wefocusontwometricstomeasuretransferability:thepercentage
ofthetransferableadversarialinputsandtheaveragepercentageofthetransferableenergyconsumptionincrease.Wedefinetwoterms:
Effectiveness Transferability Percentage (ETP) andInput Transfer-
ability Percentage (ITP). ETPis defined based on IncRF, which is
the fractional increase in AdNN-reduced floating-point operations
(FLOPs)afterfeedingenergy-basedtestinginputs.Wealsodefine 𝑃𝑏
and𝑃𝑡,theaverage IncRFonbaseandtargetmodels,respectively,
with the same testing inputs. We define ETP=(𝑃𝑡/𝑃𝑏)×100.ITP
is defined as the percentage of testing inputs for which the FLOPs
count during inference increases in the target model. For an attack,
ifITPis high, it means that most of the generated testing inputs
for the base model can also increase the energy consumption inthe target model. If ETPis high, it means that the average increase
inthetargetmodel’senergyconsumptioniscomparablewiththe
base model. Thus, if both ETPandITPare high, then it confirms
transferabilityin the attack.
Forexample,weattackthebasemodelandperturbteninputs.If
theaverage 𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑅𝐹onbasemodelis0.5, i.e.,𝑃𝑏=0.5.Ifsevenoutof
ten testing inputs increase the FLOPs on the target model, 𝐼𝑇𝑃will
be 70 %. For target model, The average IncRFis 0.3.𝑃𝑡would be
0.3andETP=(0.3/0.5)×100=60%.Wehavesetmultiple thresholds
of𝐼𝑇𝑃and𝐸𝑇𝑃to determine whether an attack is transferable. In
this study, we explore how many combinations of base AdNN and
target AdNN exceeds the different ITPandETPthresholds.
WehaveconductedatransferabilitystudyonfourAdNNmodels:
RANet[44],BlockDrop(ResNet-38,ResNet-110)[ 41],andBranchyNet
[33]. 1000 images sampled from the CIFAR-10 dataset were used in
thisstudy.WegeneratetestinginputsusingtheILFOattack[ 13]
(Figure1 Sub-figure I)onthebase model.Tables1and 2showthe
ITPandETPamong the architectures. From the tables, we can see
thatonlyfourcombinations(outof12)ofbaseandtargetmodels
exceedthe50%thresholdforboth ITPandETP(Forotherthresh-
olds, we have added a table in the website). From these results, we
can conclude that for the majority of AdNN models, the white-box
attack is non-transferable.
Althoughtraditionaltransferabilitymaynotbefeasibleforat-
tackingAdNNs,theobservationofthisfailuremotivatesustode-
velop an effective alternative. Specifically, our key observation on
thenon-transferabilityofenergy-basedattacksisthattheenergy-
saving mechanisms of AdNN models behave differently for the
same input, i.e.,an input causing high energy consumption on one
modelmightconsumelowenergyforanothermodel.Hence,extend-
ing any white-box attack method such as ILFO through Surrogate
models is not viable in the black-box scenario.
4 APPROACH
As we have observed that Surrogate models are not feasible to test
the energy robustness of AdNNs, we develop EREBA, an Estimator
model-based black-box testing system. EREBA contains two ma-jor components, namely an Estimator model and a testing inputgenerator. Figure 1 illustrates the Estimator model’s training for
anAdNNusingitsenergyconsumptiononanNvidiaTX2server.
TheEstimatormodeladdressesthechallengeofnon-transferability
discoveredintheprevioussection.Additionally,thetestinginput
generator in EREBA has two modes of testing: Input-based, where
an input image is perturbed to achieve higher energy consump-
tion, and Universal, where a noisy testing input that can maximize
energyconsumptionisgenerated.ThesemodesenableEREBAto
assess the energy robustness of each AdNN effectively. Figure 1
(Sub-figure ii) shows the generation of testing inputs using the
trained Estimator model.

Figure 1: Difference between testing using Estimator model and Surrogate model
DNNasillustratedinFigure1(insidetheblue-dottedbox).How-
ever, this approach is not feasible for the current use-case due to a
lackoftraditionaltransferabilityinwhite-boxattacks(Section3).
Because building such a Surrogate model with the target function
ofmappinganimagetoaclasswouldnottransfersimilarenergy
characteristics to the Surrogate model. The target function should
be the energy-saving mechanism in an AdNN, but the output di-
mensions of these change with different AdNNs. So, we need a
separate Surrogate model for each AdNN; this is not viable for two
reasons.First,suchamodelwouldrequireanewneuralnetwork
architectureforeachAdNN,whichmakesithardtoapplytofuture
AdNNmodels.Second,theenergy-savingmechanisms’outputsare
intermediate values within an AdNN, which are not accessible in a
black-box scenario.
Totacklethis,webuildanEstimatormodeltoemulatethecharac-
teristicsoftheenergy-savingmechanisminAdNNs.ThefeasibilityoftheEstimatormodelfollowsfromthefollowingtwokeyobserva-tions.1)Wecanperceivetheenergy-savingmechanisms’character-
istics through system diagnostics such as the energy consumption
for each inference, which can be observed even in a black-box
setting.2)EventhougheachAdNNhasadifferentenergy-saving
mechanism, the resulting energy consumption is always expected
tolieinastep-wisepattern2;seeFigure7andSection7.3formore
details. Thus, we seek to leverage this patterned energy consump-
tioninourblack-boxapproachtotrainanEstimatormodelforeach

However, the energy consumption of an embedded system such
asNvidiaTX2isaffectedbynoisefromthesystemenvironment,
suchasbackgroundprocessesanddynamicfrequencyscaling,mak-
ingitchallengingtocreateanaccurate model. Further,inablack-
boxenvironment,itishardtocategorizewhichdataisnoisy.We
do not have any additional information (e.g., number of the exe-
cuted blocks) about the inference; our approach has to tackle these
challenges.
An overview of theEstimator model training is given in Figure

running.Additionally,werecordtheenergyconsumptionbythe
target AdNN during inference of an input image twenty times and
discard values, which are 50% higher than the median value. We
define the mean of the remaining values is defined as 𝐹(𝑥𝑖), where
𝑥𝑖represents an input in the dataset. We define the Estimator’s
DNN loss function as:
𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠=1

∑
𝑖=1[𝐹(𝑥𝑖)−𝐸𝑆𝑇(𝑥𝑖)]2
where𝐸𝑆𝑇denote the Estimator model, and 𝑁is the size of the
dataset.𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 isusedtotraintheEstimatorforeachtarget
AdNN, which enables the model to give a reasonable prediction of
energy consumption of the target AdNN for a given input.
4.2 Testing input generator
The objective of the testing input generator is to create testing
inputs that increase the Estimator model’s prediction, which in
turnshould increasethe actualenergy consumptionof theAdNN.
We explore two use cases of EREBA: 1) Input-based test, and 2)
Universal test for measuring the Input-based and Universal energy
robustness as defined in Section-2.1.

Additionally,wehavetoensurethatthemagnitudeofperturbation

minimization problem as follows:

where𝑐>0 is a hyperparameter chosen through grid search de-
pending on the AdNN model. Also, 𝑐controls the magnitude of

tion more dependant on the energy estimate, allowing for larger

into a non-constrained optimization problem in 𝑤𝑖, where the rela-

universal testing creates noisy testing inputs, which can maximize

this algorithm is repeated for 𝑁𝑟different random initializations of

for computing 𝑓𝑖.5 EVALUATION
We evaluate the performance of EREBAon three popular AdNNs,
RANet[44],BlockDrop [41]andBranchyNet [33,34],interms
of four research questions (RQs):
RQ1: Effectiveness. How much increase in energy consump-
tion is achievable by the testing inputs generated by EREBA?
RQ2:Sensitivity. HowdoestheenergyconsumptionofAdNNs
react to limiting the magnitude of perturbation in EREBA?
RQ3: Quality. What is the difference in semantic quality be-
tween original images and testing inputs generated by EREBA?
RQ4: Robustness. IsEREBArobust against distribution shifts?
5.1 Experimental Setup
Datasets. For all AdNN models, the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets [ 19,35,36] have been used to train the Estimator model
andgeneratetestinginputs.Boththedatasetsconsistof50000train-
ing and 10000 test images, where CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 have
10and100classlabels,respectively.Byusingthesetwodatasets,
we show that EREBAis useful for both easier (CIFAR-10) and more
complex prediction (CIFAR-100) tasks.
Baseline. As there are no existing black-box energy testing frame-
works, we compare our technique with two different types of
baseline techniques. First, we compare our techniques with real-
world corruption and perturbation techniques (like fog, frost) [ 14].
The datasets generated from these techniques are commonly used
[9,26,42]totesttherobustnessofneuralnetworks.Second,weuse
a surrogate model technique that utilizes ILFO to generate testing
inputs.
Commoncorruptiontechniques[ 14]containdifferentvisualcor-
ruption,whichincludespracticalcorruptionslikefog,snow,frost.
We use 19 different corruption types, and for each type, five visual
corruptions are created from severity level one to five, resulting in
atotalof95differentvisualcorruptions.Intheimagesgenerated

the perturbations in terms of energy consumption increase, EREBA
stilloutperformsSURRG.Also,weobservethatforallAdNNs,sam-

than the original data) with 254modes.

ilar to the CIFAR-10 dataset, SURRG generated inputs consume

of the magnitude of the perturbation ∣𝛿𝑖∣. Intuitively, if an AdNN

5.2.3 RQ3: Quality. In this section, we evaluate the quality of the
perturbationgeneratedbyInput-basedtestingof EREBAwiththe
hyper-parameters set to the values given in Section 5.1 using Peak
Signal to Noise ratio (PSNR) [ 39] and Structural Similarity Index
(SSIM) [40]. Bothof these metricsare used in theindustry to mea-
sure the image quality of noisy images. SNR of an image can be
represented by,
𝑆𝑁𝑅=𝜇𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒
𝜎𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒
where𝜇𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒isthemeanvalueoftheimagepixelsand 𝜎𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒is
theerrorvalueofthepixelvalues. ForPSNR,thehighestvalueof
theimagepixelsisusedinsteadofthemeanvalue.TheStructural
Similarity Index (SSIM) is a perceptual metric that quantifies the
image quality degradation caused by processing such as data com-pression or by losses in data transmission. Higher values for SSIM
and PSNR indicate higher quality test inputs.
Figure4andFigure5showthevaluesofSSIMandPSNRbetween

100 datasets. For both datasets, we see that SSIM for the generated
testinginputsissimilarforallthetargetAdNNs.WhereasPSNRforRANetisworsebutstillcomparabletoBlockDropandBranchyNet.
WeconcludethatmostoftheinputsgeneratedthroughInput-based
testing are of high quality; even if some test inputs might have
noise, they are structurally similar to the original inputs.Table 7: Effect of corruptions on EREBA. Average percentage

5.2.4 RQ4:Robustness. EREBAestimatesenergyconsumptionbased
onthetrainingdata,whichcanbeimpactedbydistributionshift[ 31].
Therefore, to evaluate the robustness of EREBAagainst distribution
shifts,wehaveanalyzedthebehaviorof EREBAagainstPracticalcor-
ruptions.Practicalcorruptions(e.g., fog,snowetc.)arefrequently
noticed, mainly when we use mobile phones or autonomous ve-hicles to take images. For this purpose, we have used real-world
common corruption techniques [14].
Table 7 shows the average percentage increase in energy con-
sumption for the testing inputs generated using the original and
corruptedimagesofCIFAR-10andCIFAR-100by EREBAinInput-
based testing. We picked the corruption classes of fog, frost, andsnow due to their natural occurrence. In general, the corruptedimages do not hinder the performance of
EREBAexcept for the
CIFAR-100 version of RANet. In other cases, the increase in energy
consumption achieved by EREBAusing corrupted images is, in fact,
higher than that achieved using the original CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-
100datasets.Thisismainlyduetothecommoncorruptions[ 14],
introducing better initialization spots (white areas). For CIFAR-100
RANet, EREBAmanagestoincreasetheenergyconsumptionslightly.
However, similar to the Universal testing case, inputs with high
noiseareclassifiedasroadorshrewwithhighconfidence,which
leads to lower performance in comparison to other settings.
Additionally,throughtheseresults,wefurthernoticethehigh

variance in how EREBAbehaves when provided with an image
with different corruption classes; the median energy consumption
increment is consistent for all target AdNNs.
6 INCREASING ENERGY ROBUSTNESS
In this section, we demonstrate two ways to increase the energy
robustness of AdNNs. In both ways, we use prior EREBAgenerated
inputs to detect new EREBAgenerated energy-surging inputs for
AdNNs. For detecting Universal test inputs, we use input filtering
method based on pixel values, while for detecting input-based test
inputs, we use gradient-based input detection.Input Filtering.
As we can notice that noisy samples generated
fromUniversaltestingcanincreaseenergyconsumptionbyasig-
nificantamount,henceitisessentialtoadapttheAdNNmechanism
against these noisy images. For traditional DNNs, highly noisy im-
ages consumethe same energyas the standard imagesand are no
threattotherobustnessoftheDNN(theobjectisnotvisibleinthose
noisy images). To adapt AdNNs against high energy-consuming
images, we propose to include a filter in AdNNs.

As a filter, we have created a ResNet model (binary classifier)
with only six residual blocks. The classifier can classify into two
categories: normal input andenergy-consuming noisy input .
For each AdNN, We have trained the ResNet model with 2500
normal dataset images and 2500 high energy-consuming noisy
images, creating three different trained ResNet models. For testing
the models, 1000 images have been used (500 from each class). Our
results show that the filter can identify each test image with the
correct class (100% accuracy) for all three AdNNs for both datasets.
Theresultsconfirmthatwecanfilterouthighenergy-consuming
noisy images with a model whose energy consumption is low.Gradient-based Input Detection.
In contrast to detecting adver-
sarial inputs similar to the samples generated by the Universal
testingmode,adversarialinputssimilartothesamplesgenerated
by the Input-based testing mode are harder to differentiate frombenign inputs. Additionally, the energy constraint on such a de-
tectionsystemisasignificantchallenge.Therefore,thedetection
techniquemust consumesignificantlylow energywithrespectto
theenergyconsumedbyInput-basedtestinginputsduringinfer-ence. To address these challenges, we propose a gradient-based
adversarialinputdetectionmechanismthatusespartialinference
from the AdNN.
In this detection mechanism, we leverage the behavior of the
energy-saving mechanism within various AdNNs. These mecha-nisms, in general, try to ensure that the difference between an
intermediate output and a predefined condition is large, which will
deactivate certain parts of the AdNN. In other words, if the loss
function of intermediate outputs is large for any input, the energy
consumption will be low [ 13]. Therefore, if the gradients of the
intermediatelossfunctionwithrespecttotheweightsarelarge,the
input is more likely to be a benign input. Hence, we only need par-
tialinference(weightgradientsofaninitiallayer)fromtheAdNNs,
and a linear SVM [ 6] to detect the energy-surging inputs, where
both are low energy consuming steps. So, the energy impact of our
detectioncomponentissignificantlylow.Iftheinputispredicted

approach’s efficacy. Additionally, we also report the accuracy drop
of the AdNNs due to false positives from the detection system. We
observe that the accuracy drop is minimal in all cases except for
the CIFAR-100 BlockDrop model.
Furthermore, to demonstrate the benefits of our gradient-based
detectionsystemfromtheenergyperspective,wealsoreportthe
average energy decrease percentage for an adversarial input (Adv
Eng Dec) and average energy increase percentage for a benigninput (Ben Eng Inc). We observe that our detection system cansignificantly reduce energy consumption induced by adversarialinputs (up to 95%) while introducing minimal energy burden as
evidenced by a low increase in consumption for benign inputs.

correlation between measured and estimated energy consumption,
and the correlation between energy consumption increased by

7.1 Alternative Defense.
Wehaveinvestigatedtheapplicationofadversarialtrainingasan
alternative defense mechanism against EREBAgenerated energy-
surging inputs. To understand the effect of adversarial training on
AdNNs, we use the EREBAgenerated testing inputs for CIFAR-10
dataset to retrain the original AdNNs. We used Input-based testing
inputsgeneratedfrom1000imagesoftheCIFAR-10trainingdatasetasthetrainingsetandretrainedtheBranchyNetandRANetAdNNs

the CIFAR-10 test dataset. We found that adversarial training does

RANet is easier to improve using adversarial training compared to
BranchyNet.Duetospaceconstraints,wehavereportedtheresults

7.3 Comparison to Misclassification Attacks
We can assume that the energy-saving mechanisms of Conditional-
Skipping networks like BlockDrop would classify an image into
𝑁−1 categories. 𝑁is the number of blocks in the DNN, with each
image in category 𝑖activating 𝑖+1 (the first block is always active)

7.4 Correlation between Actual Energy
Consumption and Estimated Energy
Consumption
Toillustratethecorrelationbetweenenergyconsumptionpredicted
bytheestimatormodelandoriginalenergyconsumption,weuse
the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) [ 1] and correlation p-value.
Iftwosetsofvaluesarecorrelated,thervaluewouldbesignificant,
and the p-value will be low.
For CIFAR-100 dataset, the r values are 0.38, 0.17, and 0.31 for
RANet, BlockDrop, and BranchtNet models, respectively, where allthep-valuesarelessthan0.0005.Theseresultsconcludethatthe
values are correlated.
ForCIFAR-10dataset,thevalueofrforRANetis0.021;however
p-value is 0.03; therefore, it is more likely that the values are corre-
lated.ForBlockDropmodel,thevalueofrandp-valueare0.004and
0.66, which suggests that the values are less likely to be correlated.
Butifweconsideronlytheinputswhoseenergyconsumptionis
higher than the 75th percentile value, the p-value becomes 0.14,
suggestingacorrelation.Therefore,iftheestimatormodelcanac-
curatelypredicthighenergy-consuminginputs(i.e.,differentiate
clearlybetweenlow/midandhighenergy-consuminginputs),we
can use the estimator model to generate energy-expensive testing

AdNNs.Among Conditional-skipping models, Hua et al.[16] and
Gaoetal.[8]explorechannelgatingtodeterminecomputational
blind spots for channel-specific regions unessential to classifica-tion. Liu et al.[
20] propose a new type of AdNN which utilizes
reinforcementlearningtoachieveselectiveexecutionofneurons.
SkipNet [ 38] uses gating techniques to skip residual blocks. On
the other hand, Graves et al.[11], Figurnov et al.[7], and Teer-
apittayanon et al.[33] propose SACT and BranchyNet respectively,
which are Early-termination AdNNs. SACT terminates the compu-
tation within a residual block early based on intermediate outputs,
while BranchyNet uses separate exits within network for early ter-
mination.CascadingmultipleDNNswithvariouscomputational

Adversarial Examples. AdversarialExamplesarethesynthe-
sizedinputs thatis ableto modifytheprediction ofthe MLmodel.
Szegedyet al.[32] and Goodfellow et al.[10] propose white-box
adversarial attacks on convolutional neural networks. Papernot et
al.[28] have used surrogate model to attack a DNN in black-box
setting.Liu etal.[21]useensembleofmultiplewhite-boxmodelsto
generate adversarial examples, which can attack black-box models.
Ilyasetal.[17]useevolutionarysearchstrategiestoestimatethe
gradient of a model to attack black-box models.
However, all these attacks focus on changing the prediction and
do not concentrate on increasing test time. ILFO [ 13] is the first
work to attack a DNN by increasing the energy consumption of
the model. However, ILFO uses white-box setting and does not
have transferability. Therefore, ILFO can not be used for black-box
attack.
Next, DeepSloth [ 15] uses modified PGD to attack against Early-
termination AdNNs using the confidence scores in each exit. How-
ever,DeepSlothcannotbeusedagainstConditional-skippingAdNNs.
Also, DeepSloth provides a study about the transferability of the
attack. The study considers the efficacy of the Early-termination
models as the transferability metric. However, we propose a more
systematic transferability study by introducing of metrics like ETP
and ITP.DNN Testing. Multiple testing methods have been proposed
recently to test DNNs. DeepGauge [ 22] is proposed based on a
test criteria set that verifies the corner neuron activation values.

9 CONCLUSION
Inthispaper,wehaveproposedpracticalblack-boxtestingmeth-
ods to evaluate energy robustness of AdNNs. The core idea behind
the technique is to create inputs which increase the energy con-
sumption of AdNN to a higher level. To achieve this goal, we have
presented EREBA5,wherewehaveproposedtwotypesoftesting:
UniversaltestingandInput-basedtesting.Toourknowledge,we
are the first to explore black-box testing on AdNNs. Test inputs
generated by EREBAcan improve the energy robustness of AdNNs.
Finally,thispaperalsoanalyzesthebehaviorofAdNNsandsuggests
model improvement strategies.
