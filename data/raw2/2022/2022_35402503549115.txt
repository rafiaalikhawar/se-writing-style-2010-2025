ABSTRACT
ModernCodereview(MCR)techniquesarewidelyadoptedinboth
open-source software platforms and organizations to ensure the
quality of their software products. However, the selection of re-
viewers for code review is cumbersome with the increasing size of
development teams. The recommendation of inappropriate review-
ersfor codereviewcantake moretimeandefforttocompletethe
taskeffectively.Inthispaper,weextendedthebaselineofreviewers’
recommendation framework - RevFinder - to handle issues with
newlycreatedfiles,retiredreviewers,theexternalvalidityofresults,
and the accuracies ofthe state-of-the-art RevFinder . Our proposed
hybrid approach, CORMS, works on similarity analysis to compute
similarities among file paths, projects/sub-projects, author infor-
mation,and predictionmodelstorecommendreviewersbasedon
the subject of the change. We conducted a detailed analysis on the
widely used 20 projects of both Gerrit and GitHub to compare our
results with RevFinder . Our results reveal that on average, CORMS,
can achieve top-1, top-3, top-5, and top-10 accuracies, and Mean
Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 45.1%, 67.5%, 74.6%, 79.9%and 0.58 for
the 20 projects, consequently improves the RevFinder approach by
44.9%, 34.4%, 20.8%, 12.3% and18.4%, respectively.

the potential to be more effective and enhancements in these areas.
GitHub is also a widely used OSS platform and supports pull-
based development. In GitHub, developers first fork a repository
andmakechangestofixbugsorimplementnewfeatures.Whenthe
developersarereadywiththechanges,theysubmitapullrequest
to merge the changed code into the repository. The submitted pull
request then needs to be evaluated by the reviewer. In GitHub,
the reviewers are categorising into core members and commenters.
Corememberstakethefinaldecisionforamerge,whilecommenters
help the code review process by providing their suggestions in
comments. Ideally, reviewers are assigned to pull requests right
after the change requests. However, reviewers may find difficulties
in prioritising the pull requests for some of the popular projects as

In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach, CORMS(Code
ReviewerRecommendationinGitHubandGerritbasedon Machine
Learningand SimilarityAnalysis),forrecommendingactivereview-
ers in code review. The approach considers both a similarity-based
approachandamachinelearning-basedapproachforsolvingthe
problem of recommending code reviewers. A review process in-
cludes several fields while reviewing the code: the subject of the
change(describesthedetailsofthechangeinaveryabstractform),
thefilelocation(recordsthepathsofmodifiedfiles),theauthorfield
(showstheownerinformation),andtheproject/sub-project(include
theprojectandsub-projectinformation).The CORMSmakesuse
ofallofthese fields.The CORMSfirstbuildsa Support Vector Ma-
chine(SVM)modelbyanalyzingtextinthesubjectofthechange
field of the reviews. Next, CORMSbuilds a Similarity Model by
computing the similarity of the file-paths, author information, and
project/sub-project of thecurrent pull request separatelywith the
file-paths, author information, project/sub-project of all the pull
requests historically studied by various developers. We have com-
putedthesimilarityofthesefieldsusingthefour-stringcomparison
techniques, namely longest common sub-sequence, longest com-
monprefix,longestcommonsuffix,andlongestcommonsub-string.

Next, these SVM and similarity models are combined to achieve
betterperformance.Ourworkaimstoimprovetheapproachpro-
posed by Thongtanunam et al. [ 18],RevFinder10. Consequently, we
have formulatedtworesearchquestions(RQs) for the study.
RQ1: How efficient is CORMSin recommending reviewers for
reviewing the code? What is the performance of CORMSin
comparison withthe state-of-the-art RevFinder ?
RQ2: How much improvement CORMSgain with each newly
addedfeature over state-of-the-art RevFinder ?
RevFinder computes the similarities between the file paths to
recommend code reviewers.Ourproposedapproach, CORMS, also
uses the same four-string comparison techniques defined in the
RevFinder to compute similarities. However, CORMSuses the more
effective ‘normalization’ technique for score propagation com-
paredtothe‘Bordacount’[ 13]techniqueusedinstate-of-the-art
RevFinder . Also, the CORMScomputes the similarities between
project/sub-project and authors’ information with the file paths.
TheCORMSalsoincludestheSVMmodeltoexaminethetextual
contentsinthe‘subjectofthechange’fieldofreviewrequeststo
recommendreviewers.The CORMSthenmergesboththeSVMand
similaritymodeltorecommendthereviewerswithimprovedperfor-
mance.Weevaluatetheperformanceofourapproachon20datasets
collected from both Gerrit and GitHub platforms. We mined and
analyzed 30,648 code reviews from 2020 to 2021. The evaluation
wasdonebycomputingthevaluesoftop-1,top-3,top-5,andtop-10
accuraciesandMeanReciprocalRank(MRR)[ 2].Next,wecompare
our experimental results with the RevFinder [18] and found that
CORMSachieves average top-1, top-3, top-5, and top-10 accuracies,
and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 45.1%, 67.5%, 74.6%, 79.9%
and 0.58 for the 20 projects, which improves the performance of
RevFinder by44.9%,34.4%,20.8%,12.3%and18.4%,respectively.The
individualmodelsof CORMSwhencombinedwiththe RevFinder ,
also positively improves the RevFinder w.r.t the evaluation criteria
andgenerateddataset.Our contributionsare as follows:
(1)We propose a hybrid approach CORMS, which combines the
SVM model and Similarity model to recommend active code
reviewers.
(2)We conduct experiments on the datasets of 20 projects of
both Gerrit and GitHub open-source platforms and examine
atotalof30,648reviewsofthem.
(3)We find that CORMSperforms better than the RevFinder
considering evaluation criteriaandadataset of20 projects.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents
the motivation behind proposing the approach. Section 3 provides
a brief description of MCR and presents existing literature. Section
4 discusses our approach, CORMS, that extends RevFinder . Section
5 reports the results of our experiments. The section also discusses
threats to validity and our contributions. Section 6 discusses study
limitations and summarises our observations. Finally, Section 7
presents the study conclusions &future directions.

and the file path field describes the locations of modified files in
the change. The last reviewed date specified the date when the
review got completed. We looked at several reviews from Gerrit

Whilechallengesofcodereviewinclude(1)understandingthe
reason for the change, (2) familiarity with the code - it takes more
time to review files for the reviewers who are not familiar with the
code, (3) dealing with understanding needs - reviewers, in general,
may try different paths like sending emails or talk in person for
asking clarifications, (4) lax review means directly approves the
changerequest,(5)codesizeandpoorquality,(6)delayedfeedbacks,
(7) difficulties infinding proper reviewers, (8) lack ofdevelopers’
plan for knowledge sharing, (9) change request rejections, and (10)
lackofavailable reviewing guidelines [ 1][6].
3.2 Related Work
Recommending reviewers is the most common support in MCR.
Mostly, recommendation techniques use a review history of the
reviewersandtheirintereststobuildrecommendations.Thefirst
published technique is Review Bot [3], which considers the line
change history for recommending reviewers and recommends the
same reviewers who have previously worked on the same lines.
However, the ReviewBot algorithmhas several issues.One iswith
thenewlycreatedfilesthatdonothaveanylinechangehistoryand
thuscannotbecorrectlyprocessedusingthisapproach.Another
problem is that most of the lines in the average project are only
changedonce.Therefore,theaccuracyofresultsreturnedbythe
ReviewBot algorithmislimited.Thongtanunametal.[ 18]proposed
an approach, RevFinder , which computes the similarity between
the file paths. The proposed work is now a baseline for evaluating
mostreviewerrecommendationapproaches.However, RevFinder

Another work CORRECT (Code Reviewer Recommendation based
onCross-ProjectandTechnologyexperience) ,proposedbyRahmanet
al.[12],isbasedontheexpertiseofthereviewerswithsimilartech-
nologiesandexternallibraries.However,thistechniquemaynot
be effective when the project does not have external dependencies.
Jiangetal.[ 8]proposedanapproach CoreDevRec(AutomaticCore
MemberRecommendationforContributionEvaluation) basedonMa-
chine Learning and uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm
and considers file-path information, reviewer’s activeness, and so-
cial relationship. However, this social data is not directly available
onsomeprojects(Apache/Mozilla) orsomeOSS platforms.
Yueetal.[ 22]proposeda CommentNetwork(CN) tocapturesim-
ilar interests in social activities among developers and accordingly
recommendappropriatereviewers.Anotherapproach revrec[21]
considers the participation types to recommend reviewers for code
review requests from the managerial and technical perspectives.
Theproposed hybridapproachcombines similarity,expertise,and
information retrieval methods to recommend reviewers. WhoRe-
view[4]approachusesamulti-objectivesearch-basedmethodfor
maximizing the reviewer collaboration and expertise and minimiz-
ing reviewer workload. It considers reviewers’ expertise by review
frequency(numberofcomments)andrecency(freshnessofcom-
ments),reviewers’ collaboration, andreviewers’ workload.
In the paper ‘Do Reviewer recommendations help developers?’ [9],
the authors showed the need for more user-centric approaches
toreviewerrecommendations.Xiaetal.[ 19]proposeda TIEthat
extends the state-of-the-art RevFinder by developing the hybrid
approach. The approach includes the commit message as a new
feature and using a Naive Bayes Classifier. The authors tested theirresults on the four projects Gerrit.In our proposed work,we have
consideredfeaturessuchasproject/sub-projectinformation,sub-
ject of the change, author information apart from file paths, and
reviewer activeness. We built a hybrid approach to combine the
proposedsimilaritymodelandtheSVMclassifier.Finally,wetested
the performance of RevFinder with our approach CORMSon 20
projectsofGerritandGitHub.
We summarized the well-known algorithms such as Review-
Bot [3], RevFinder [ 18], TIE [19], Correct [ 12], CoreDevRec [ 8],
Comment-Network [ 22], RevRec [ 21], WhoReview [ 4]. Table 6 rep-
resents the platforms, techniques and metrics used, the number

4 PROPOSEDAPPROACH
Figure 4 shows our proposed hybrid approach: CORMS. Our ap-
proach consists of three modules: the similarity model, the SVM
model,andthecontrollermodule.Thedetailsofeachofthesteps
ofthe modulesare as follows:
(1)SimilarityModel :computesthesimilaritiesbetweenFile-
Pathsalongwithsub-projectandauthorinformation.
(2)SVMModel :takesthevectorizeddataoftextualcontent-
the subjectofthe changeandpredicts the reviewers.
(3)CORMS Controller : combines and normalizes the similar-
ity and support vector machine (SVM) model results and
filtersoutthereviewersbasedonthereviewer’sactiveness.

4.1 Data Mining
As shown in Figure 4, the first step includes the data gathered
from mining Gerrit or GitHub repositories. We created two mining
algorithms:oneforminingGerritreviews andanotherformining

algorithms.Wemined30,648reviewsfromGerritandGitHub,from
which 27,157 reviews from 10 Gerrit projects and 3,491 reviews
from 10 GitHubprojects.
4.2 Data Pre-processing
AsshowninFigure4,thesecondstepincludesthepre-processed
data. From the mined data, we extracted the features such as 1)
File-Path info, 2) All Reviewer details, 3) Subject of the change,
4) Project/Sub-project Information, 5) Last reviewed date, 6) Au-
thordetails,7)Changesizewhichisequivalenttoinsertedlines+

Next, we built the reviewer workload dictionary containing the
key-value pair and the reviewer’s total number of ongoing reviews.
Weobservedthatthehighestworkloadwasassignedtobots.These

AsshowninFigure4,thethirdstepincludestheNLPandvector
transformation of the textual content. The subject of the change
contains the textual contents; thus, it is the most important feature
for understanding the developer’s semantics and the reason for the
change.(1)Lowered case : Our first pre-processing step includes lower-
ingthe textual content.
(2)Removal of Punctuation : We removed all punctuation
fromthestringusingthestringlibrary16.Forexample,for
the string ł(There is a tree, near the river!)ž, after removing
allpunctuation,we can getłThere isatree near the riverž.
(3)Removal of Stop Words : We removed all stop-words from
the subject of the change using gensim library17. For exam-
ple,afterremovingstop-wordsforthesamestring,wecan
get‘there’,‘tree’,‘near’,and‘river’.
(4)StringLemmatization :Weusedstringlemmatizationto
reduce the derivationally related forms to a common base
formofaword.Forinstance łam,arež fallsinthesameclass
łbžwhilełcar,car’s,cars’,carsž falls inthe same class łcarž.
(5)RemovalofCommonWords :Weidentifiedthemostcom-
monwordsfromthesubjectfieldbycreatingakey-valuepair
of each word used in the subject. Here, the key represents
theword,andthevaluerepresentsthefrequencyoftheword
usedintheentireproject.Then,wemanuallyselectedand
removedsuchcommonwordsfromthesubjectofthechange
field.These wordsare: łInsertž,łUpdatež,łDeletež,łAddž, etc.
Consequently, we have ensured that the remaining words
containmeaningfulinformationthroughwhichwecantrain
andtest variousmachine learningmodels.
WeusedtheTF-IDFvectorizertotransformastringintonumeric
vectors. Itcontains the following steps:
(1)Tokenization : The first step to implementing TF-IDF is
tokenization,whereastringistokenizedintoabagofwords.
(2)FindTF-IDFValues :TheTFvaluereferstotermfrequency

calculatedas follows:

linesfromTables4and5:1)Remove TripleOjob from"stein"

word łussuriž in the second sentence occurs only once in
that sentence, andthetotalnumberof wordsinthesecond
sentenceis6.Hence,theTF valuefortheword"ussuri"for
the second sentence is 1/6. Also, we have two sentences and
theword"ussuri"occursinthesecondsentence.Therefore
the IDFvalueofthe word"ussuri"is2/1 =2.
Ourtrainingdataset,i.e., TrainReviews determinesthetextvector
dimensions.Thesedimensionsvariesaccordingtothenumberof

Out-Of-Vocabulary(OOV)wordsaregettingignoredbytheTF-IDF
model.However,theOOVwordscanalsobereplacedbytheclosest
vocabulary wordbasedonLevenshtein Distance18as well.
4.4 Data Splitting
AsshowninFigure4,thefourthstepincludesdatasplitting.Finally,
we split the data into two parts: 80% data for training and 20% data
for testing. We define this data as NewReviews andTrainReviews .
NewReviews arethereviewsforwhichwewanttopredicttheresults,
andTrainReviews are the reviews on which we can train the model.
Here,splitting wasdone inchronologicalorder.
4.5 Similarity Model
AsshowninFigure4,inthefifthstep,oursimilaritymodelpredicts

the state-of-the-art RevFinder . However, we extendeditto compute
similaritiesbetweenprojectsorsub-projectsandauthorinforma-
tion. These code review similarity scores are then propagated to
each of the reviewers. In project or sub-project information, we
onlyconsideredthesub-project,asprojectinformationismostly
thesameinGitHubprojects.Thus,weremovedthatconstantvalues
andonlyconsideredsub-projectinformationaswewantedtobuild
our approach for ageneralizedpurpose.
WeimplementedthissimilaritymodelinPython.Algorithm1
showsthealgorithmofoursimilaritymodel.Ittakesthe NewReview
nrandallTrainReviews asinputandthenextractstheFile-Paths,
Sub-Projects, Authors information from it. It calculates the similar-
ity score as the combination of all similarity scores of File-Paths,
Sub-Projects,and Authors between each NewReview and allTrain-
Reviews. For computing the similarities, this algorithm uses the
four string comparison techniques: longest common sub-sequence,
longestcommonprefix,longestcommonsuffix,andlongestcom-
mon sub-string. Our file paths and sub-project features contain
strings separatedby‘/’.

four-string comparison techniques. If the author ID is the same (i.e.

Finally,thesimilaritymodelpropagatesthisscoretoallthere-

where,vis the values of dictionary dict. For instance, if we have
a dictionary with a key-value pair ofreviewer-score , then it sums
allthevaluesofthescoreandmeasuresthenormalizationfactor
by dividing this value by 1. Now, for normalizing the scores of the
reviewers,itmultipliesallthereviewers’scoreswiththenormaliza-
tion factor in four dictionaries separately: 1) reviewer-score dictio-
naryobtainedfromcomputingsimilaritiesusinglongestcommon
sub-sequence, 2) reviewer-score dictionary obtained from comput-
ingsimilaritiesusinglongestcommonsub-string,3)reviewer-score
dictionaryobtainedfromcomputingsimilaritiesusinglongestcom-
mon prefix, 4) reviewer-score dictionary obtained from computing
similarities using a longest common suffix. It then combines all
these dictionaries into the final reviewer’s dictionary and sorts this
set of reviewers based on their normalized scores in descending
order. The final output of this model is a set of reviewers with a
score assigned to them. Our results showed that for each newly
addedfeature,oursimilaritymodelgreatlyimprovestheaccuracies
ofstate-of-the-art RevFinder .
4.6 Ensemble Modeling
As shown in Figure 4, our sixth step includes the ensemble tech-
niquetopredictthesetofreviewersbasedontheselectedclassifica-
tion algorithm. We tested four classification algorithms of machine
learning:RandomForest,SupportVectorMachine(SVM),KNearest
Neighbour, and Multinomial Naive Bayes. Our results showed that
SVM gave the best results when used with the same settings for all
the 20 projectsofGerritandGitHub.

The CORMS Controller then combines these two results and
normalizesthemusingthesamenormalizationfactordefinedinthe

with a final score assigned to them. It then filters the reviewers
based on the Reviewer’s Activeness . We have chosen 12 months as a
thresholdtodistinguishbetweeninactiveandactivereviewers[ 10].
In other words, we have filtered out all reviewers whose last re-
viewed period is more than 12 months. The final output of this

5 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
In this section, we evaluate and report the results of the experi-
mental study conducted to assess the performance of CORMS. Our
experimental environment includes 14 GB of GPU memory and 12
GB ofRAM.
5.1 ExperimentalSetup
We searched the top projects on GitHub and Gerrit and selected 15
(10 from Gerrit and 5 from GitHub). We selected 5 more projects
fromGitHub byanalysing thecomments and commenters’contri-
butions to the project where the reviewer assignment problem was
found. We mined 30,648 reviews from these 20 selected projects
of both Gerrit and GitHub from 2020 to 2021. For the processing

The state-of-the-art RevFinder [18] andTIE [ 19] used the datasets
provided by Thongatanunam et al. [ 18] which contain a total of
42,045 reviews mined in time-period 2008-2014. These approaches
have experimented with four projects of Gerrit: 1) OpenStack, 2)

5.2 EvaluationMetrics
We evaluate the performance of the CORMSby computing the
Top-KpredictionaccuracyandtheMeanReciprocalRank(MRR)
commonly usedinMCRfor evaluation.
19https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/stem/wordnet.html5.2.1 Top-K. If we have a sorted list of reviewers, then Top-K
accuracy denotes the percentage of reviewers present at the Top-K
positions in this sorted list. The Top-K accuracy is computed as
follows:
Top-K accuracy =/summationtext.1
𝑟∈𝑅isPresent(𝑟,𝑘)
|𝑅𝑒𝑣|(4)
where,Revrefers to a set of reviews and isPresent (r,k) returns 1
ifatleastoneoftheactualreviewersriscorrectlyrecommended
attheTop-kposition,otherwisereturns0.Inthiswork,wehave
consideredKas1,3,5and10.ThevalueofKisdirectlyproportional
to the performance ofthe recommendation technique.
5.2.2 Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). MRR corresponds to the aver-
ageofthereciprocalranksofasetofrecommendations.Itdescribes
themeanpositionoftheactualreviewerinthesortedlist.TheMRR
iscomputedas follows:
MeanReciprocal Rank =1
|𝑅𝑒𝑣|∑︁
𝑟∈𝑅1
rank(𝑟,slist(𝑟))⟩(5)
where,Revrefers to a set of reviews and rank(r, slist(r)) returns the
position of a reviewer r present in the sorted list - slist. Hence, the
outcomeof 1/rankwillbe0ifnoreviewersarepresentinthelist,
otherwise, if the reviewer appears in the top positions, then 1/rank
will be near to 1, and if the reviewer appears far from the top, then
1/rankwillbe near to 0.
5.3 Research QuestionsandAnalysis
Here, we present the results of an experimental study to answer
the twoformulatedresearch questions(RQs).
RQ1:HowefficientisCORMSinrecommendingreviewersfor
reviewing the code? What is the performance of CORMS in
comparisonwith thestate-of-the-art RevFinder?
Motivation :InthisRQ,weevaluatetheperformanceof CORMS
in comparison with the state-of-the-art RevFinder . As the better
performance CORMScan achieve, the more benefits CORMScan
give to its users.
Approach : We compare CORMSwithRevFinder [18], and evaluate
themon20projectsofGerritandGitHub,andmeasuretheMRR
andTop-K prediction accuracies (k =10, 5, 3, and1).
Results: We defineimprovement(%) as:
Improve(%) =(𝐸𝑥𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑑𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦−𝑂𝑟𝑖𝑔𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦)∗100
𝑂𝑟𝑖𝑔𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦(6)
Table 9 shows the accuracy comparison between the CORMS
andstate-of-the-art RevFinder fortheTop-KandMRRvalues.Here,
column‘Rev’ correspondstotheaccuraciesof RevFinder and‘Ext’
corresponds to the extended accuracies of CORMS. We observe
thatCORMSoutperformsstate-of-the-art RevFinder byasignificant
margin.Onaverageforthe20projects, CORMSachievestop-1,top-
3,top-5,top-10andMRRaccuraciesof45.1%,67.5%,74.6%,79.9%
and0.58,whichimprovesthestate-of-the-art RevFinder by44.9%,
34.4%, 20.8%, 12.3% and 18.4%, respectively. Here, the improvement
of accuracies of Top-K prediction reduces as the k value of Top-
K increases. The reason for that is greater the k value, the more
accuracywillbe there,andthus improvement willbe less.

State-of-the-art RevFinder consideronlytheFile-Pathinforma-
tion. Hence, it cannot be able to predict reviewers for the newly
created file where no File-Path information is available. CORMS
considerotherfeaturessuchasAuthors,Subjectofthechange,and
Sub-project details for predicting reviewers. Here, we can observe
that each of the newly added features (sub-projects, authors and
subjects) of CORMSimproves the performance of RevFinder .
5.4 Threatsto Validity
Threats to construct validity refer to the selection of evaluation
criteria. We have used pre-defined Top-K prediction accuracies
and MRR commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of MCR
recommendationtechniques[ 3][18][19][12][8][22][21][4],andvar-
iousautomatedsoftwareengineeringtechniques[ 14][23][17][20].
Hence,the possibility ofevaluation biasisvery less.
Threats to internal validity refer to the code selection and check
forerror.Wehavechecked,tested,debuggedourcode,andensured
itwouldrun. However,there isstillapossibilityoferrorsthatwe
missed.Also,inthe CORMSapproach,thedataneedstobeupdated
daily/weekly,ormonthlybasedontheorganization’srequirements
and the frequencies of new reviews updated on the project. So, our
classificationmodelneedstobetrainedforeverynewdatacycle.
Though carefullydone,one can arguefor apotentialbiashere.
Another threat, external validity , may be related to the gener-
alizability of results. Mining data from open-source repositories
arechallenging,especiallyfromGitHub.Forinstance,inGitHub,
weneedtomakemorenestedAPI callstominecodereviewsand
reviewerdetails,complicatingthemining.However,wecanmine
manyreviewsinasingleAPIcallinGerrit.Wehaveanalyzed30,648
reviewsfrom20open-sourceprojectsfor2020to2021fromboth
GerritandGitHubplatforms.
The currently used dataset20can be further improved by analyz-
ingmorereviewsfromGerritandGitHub.Thisdatasetcontainsthe
reviews minedfrom a totalof 34 projectsfrom Gerrit andGitHub,
out of which we used 20 projects in this paper to test the perfor-
mance of CORMSandRevFinder .
6 DISCUSSIONS
A limitation of all such studies related to code reviewer recom-
mendation isestablishing the groundtruth for evaluatingthe rec-
ommendation approach. The reviewer who did the code review
may not have been the best to review, and finding out the best
reviewerfromthesetofrecommendedreviewerswouldbeinterest-
ing. Generally, reviewers are categorised into maintainers (or final
reviewers) and commenters. To analyse whether CORMS recom-
mends a wide range of reviewers or who is being recommended as
reviewers(commentersormaintainers),weselectedfiveprojects
(alreadyusedintheexperimentalsetup)fromGerritandGitHub.

This work’s primary focus is accessing performance of CORMS
for both Gerrit and GitHub OSS platforms. The proposed approach
is a conceptual replication of RevFinder , and the primary contribu-
tionisimprovementsandamorecomprehensiverangeoftestingfor
both OSS platforms. We highlighted how each of the newly added
features (projects/sub-projects, author information, subject) for the
approach positively improves the accuracy of RevFinder (in RQ1
and RQ2). Our results also showed that the author’s information is
animportantfeatureandimprovestheoverallTop-Kaccuracyby
12.1%.However,infuture,weplantoconductempiricalstudieswith

The run-time performance of the CORMS is time-consuming for a
newreviewrequest. The trainedmachinelearningSVMmodelin
CORMSissavedinafileandrestoredtoreusethetrainedmodel
on the new data. Subsequently, the similarity model metrics are
computed by comparing each New Review with all the TrainRe-
views. After combining both the models, the reviewer prediction
takes O(n) time for each new review request, which is the same as
theRevFinder .
7 CONCLUSION & FUTUREWORK
Weproposedahybridapproach, CORMS,whichworksonsimilarity
analysis to compute similarities among file paths, projects/sub-
projects, author information, and prediction models to recommend
reviewers based on the subject of the change. We conducted a
detailed analysis on the widely used 20 projects of both Gerrit and
GitHubtocompare our resultswith the state-of-the-art RevFinder .
Our results show that on average CORMScan achieve top-1, top-3,
top-5, and top-10 accuracies, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
of 45.1%, 67.5%, 74.6%, 79.9% and 0.58 for the 20 projects, which
improves thestate-of-the-art approach RevFinder by44.9%,34.4%,
20.8%, 12.3% and18.4%, respectively.
It would be interesting to investigate the results of the combina-
tion of our approach with TIE. As the proposed methodology does
not consider the workload issues and the effect of social collabora-
tionsbetween thedevelopers,hence, plan toconsideritfor future
work.
