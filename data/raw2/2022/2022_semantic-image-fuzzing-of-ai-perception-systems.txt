Current testing methods, however, are inadequate. The cost of hu-

systems based on semantic mutation of test cases that pair real-
world sensor readings with their ground-truth interpretations. We

physical world. Figure 1 illustrates a simplified AS pipeline where
the world is sensed through a camera. The resulting image is then
processed by 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑝to generate an interpretation that the AS will
use to inform navigation and other control decisions.
Faultyperceptionsystemscanmisinterpretthephysicalworld,
leading to dangerous, even deadly, actions. For example, Tesla has
recently admitted that its ASs sometimes misinterpret parked cars,
and the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has
now opened an investigation into almost a dozen instances where
aTesla vehiclehascrashedintoaparkedemergencyvehiclewith
its lights flashing. Those mishaps have resulted in at least one
fatalityandmultipleseriousinjuries[ 3,35].Otherexamplesinclude
miscalculatingtheexistenceorlocationofavehicle,orfailingto
detect people in the planned trajectory of a vehicle [1, 12, 18, 36].
Such mishaps point to fundamental shortcomings in current
methods of testing AS perception software. A key problem is that
thesemachine-learnedcomponentstendtobetrainedusingdata
fromnormaldriving,withfewifanyopportunitiestolearnfrom
rare but safety-critical events. When such events do occur, percep-
tion systems mustaccurately interpret the physical world.
The rarity of safety-critical but infrequent events then entails
that real-world test driving will never be adequate from a test-
ing perspective. A study by the RAND Corporation found that
autonomousvehicleswouldhavetodrivehundredsofmillionsof
milestodemonstratereliability,andthatdoingsowouldtakeexist-ingfleetstensorhundredsofyears[
16].Alongsimilarlines,Waymo
Corporation safety validation methods convey opportunities to
scaleuptestingusingsimulation,butultimatelyconcludethatre-
liance on real-world road driving for validation is required [ 21].
Augmentation of data captured in the real world has emerged as
a potentially viable alternative to reduce the need for real-worlddriving[
10,26,30,37].However,these techniquesoperateatthe
pixel-level,missinganopportunitytotrulyexploreimagesthatare
semantically interesting in challenging the perception pipeline.
What this work proposes is an approach to testing percep-
tion systems using sensor-reading/expected-interpretationtest case pairs derived from real-world AS perception testcases (for which we already have ground truth interpreta-tions), by mutating both sensor readings (e.g. images) andtheirexpectedinterpretationsinacoordinatedmanner

2 MOTIVATION AND RELATED WORK
Basic definitions. Atest case,𝑡=(𝑟,𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝)for the perception
system𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑝of an AS is a set of input sensor readings, 𝑟, paired
with a valid output interpretation, 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝, for𝑟. Figure 3a shows
an example of a single sensor reading 𝑟for an autonomous vehicle
perceptionsystemandbelowit,Figure3fshowsthecorresponding
ground-truth interpretation 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝. The system’s performance is
thenjudgedbasedonanoraclethatcompares 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑝(𝑟)and𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝.
Conformity. ASs operate in the physical world and thus a sen-
sor reading 𝑟used in a test case 𝑡must conform to the constraints
oftherealworld.If 𝑟couldhavebeenacquiredfrom(andisthus
sufficiently realistic with respect to) some configuration of the real
world,𝑤,wesaythat 𝑟conforms with𝑤.Thisnotionisimportant
as a failing 𝑡with nonconforming 𝑟is likely a false-positive—a
failure that would not occur in the real world.
Figure 2 outlines three common existing procedures to generate
asuiteof 𝑡andourapproach 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 ,whichwenowexplore.
2.1 Testing in the Real World
One common procedure, outlined in Figure 2a, is to operate the
AS in the physical world while recording the sensor readings. This
procedureisadvantageousinthatitcangeneratealargedatasetreflecting typical operating conditions. However, it is limited in
thatproducingspecificdesiredconditions(e.g.,haveacarsuddenly
turn in front of our fast moving vehicle) in the real world can be
impractical, dangerous, and expensive [ 21]. Crafting the ground-
truthinterpretationalsoincursgreatexpense,requiringahumanto
manually annotate the sensor readings. In prior studies, producing
high-qualityannotationsofcameraimagesforadrivingbenchmark

2.2 Testing in Simulation
Anothercommonprocedure,showninFigure2b,usesamodelof
the world embedded in a simulator to replace operating in the real
world.Usingthesimulator’smodeloftheworldtoautomatically
producesensor readingsand ground-truthinterpretations enables
constructing arbitrary simulated worlds at a lower cost [ 27,31,38].
However, this approach suffers from the simulation-reality fidelity
gap as𝑤≠𝑤𝑠𝑖𝑚[15]. This can diminish the value of the tests as
the results may be simulation-specific [ 40], which is why they are
oftenrevalidatedinthephysicalworld[ 21].Thatis,thesetestsmay
not conform to any configuration of the real world.
2.3 Generating Tests with Low-level Mutations
A third procedure mutates collected sensor readings to produce

in the vein of standard data augmentation techniques, performing
global mutations such as affine transforms or adding noise [ 10,
26,42].Forexample,Figure3banditsinterpretationinFigure3g

work has examined ways to use mutation strategies to generate
adversarial changes to the scene that do not change the semantics
but are likely to cause changes in the AS’s perception [ 2,17,43].

Figure 2d shows how our proposed approach, 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 , dif-
fers from prior mutation techniques in the semantic nature of
the mutations. Performingthesemutationsrequiresthatmu-
tatedsensorreadingscontinuetoconformtotheconstraints
oftherealworld ,leadingtoseveralchallenges.Ontheinterpreta-
tion side, we must craft domain-specific rules to validate potential
mutations and determine what types of mutations are likely to
yield perception failures, e.g. adding a pedestrian to a roadway.
Furthermore,wemustincreaseconformitylikelihoodbycrafting
preconditions based on the sensor modality. For example, for cam-
era images, this may include not just that an entity is in a viable
position,but alsothat theperspective, lighting,and shadows are
conforming. Sensor reading mutations must be associated with
interpretation mutations that will serve as an oracle. Section 3
describes how the approach tackles these challenges.
3 APPROACH
We describe our approach for using semantic mutations to test AS
perceptionsystemsregardlessofsensormodality.Weformalizethe
problemdefinition,presentthegeneralapproach,andinstantiate
theapproachforcamera-basedperceptionsystemsforautonomous
vehicles.
3.1 Problem definition
Asemantic mutation ,𝛿=(𝛿𝑟,𝛿𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝),transforms a test case,
𝑡=(𝑟,𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝),where𝑟conformswith someconfigurationof the
world,𝑤,intoanewtestcase, 𝑡/prime=𝛿(𝑡)=(𝛿𝑟(𝑟),𝛿𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝(𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝))=
(𝑟/prime,𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝/prime), where𝑟/primealso conforms with some world configura-
tion,𝑤/prime,and𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝/primeisavalidinterpretationof 𝑟/prime.Forexample,amutation, 𝛿𝑎𝑑𝑑𝐶𝑎𝑟may add a car to an image while mutating its
interpretation to indicate that a car is now there.
We say that 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑝passesa mutated test case 𝛿(𝑡), if and only
if𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑝(𝛿𝑟(𝑟))=𝛿𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝(𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝), highlighting the symmetry of
themutationfunctions.Figure4illustratesthisprocess.Inpractice,
onemightneedto(andinourexperimentswedo)useapproximate
equality: 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑝(𝛿𝑟(𝑟))−𝛿𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝(𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝)<𝜖forasuitablysmall
𝜖. At a conceptual level, our approach thus constitutes a form of
metamorphictesting[ 32]whereexistingtestcasesareconverted
into new ones in which the correct outputs for transformed inputs
are deduced using knowledge of properties of the physical world.

3.2 Semantic Mutations with 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧
A key insight driving 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 is that prior captured data sets
can be leveraged as a source of initial test cases and of resources to
designsemanticmutationsthataremorelikelytoresultinconform-
ing tests. That insight guides the scope of mutations considered in
any givendomain, includingmeans toensure reasonableconfor-
mity of mutated inputs with possible real worlds.
First,wescopethespaceofallmutations Δbasedontheentities
that appear in the 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝s of the available tests. For example, if the
interpretationsmarkcarsandpeople,weonlyallowmutationsthat
add, remove, or change cars and people. We argue that since those
arethecriteriabywhichexistingtestsarejudged,itissensibleto
focus just on those to try to find unexpected 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑝behaviors.
Second, weassociate aset of preconditions 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐with eachmu-
tation𝛿, specified in terms of the 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝that defines whether 𝛿
isapplicabletoagiven 𝑡.If𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐(𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝)isnotsatisfied,then 𝛿is
not applicable to that test. For example, for a mutation that adds
a car to an image, 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐may be the existence of a road in 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝;
for changing the color of a car, 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐would be the existence of at
least one car in 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝. The idea is to leverage an existing interpre-
tation to determine mutation applicability. This is a key distinction
1960ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA Trey Woodlief, Sebastian Elbaum, and Kevin Sullivan
compared to other strategies that allows for our semantic muta-
tionswhilerespectingconformity.Insteadofcraftingmutationsfor
sensorinputsandpropagatingthemutationtotheinterpretation
without respect for changing semantics, we craft our mutations for
the interpretation and then propagate to the sensor domain.
Third,weenabletheparameterizationof 𝛿𝑟toemployrealsensor
datatoincreasethelikelihoodofconformity.Forexample,when
addingacarto 𝑡𝑖=(𝑟𝑖,𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝 𝑖),ifthereexistsa 𝑡𝑗=(𝑟𝑗,𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝 𝑗)
that contains a car constrained by a similar context as per their
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝s, then𝛿𝑎𝑑𝑑𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑟could put the car from 𝑟𝑗into𝑟𝑖. In the case
ofimages,weusetheentitypose,perspective,lighting,andadja-
cententitiesintheinterpretationtodefinethecontext.Notethat
context is sensor modality and domain dependent, and that the
richness of the resource set will affect the diversity of generated
testcases.Additionally,weexploretheintegrationofdiscriminators
to determine conformity. We discuss this further in Section 4.4.4.

3.3 Semantic Mutation of Images by 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧

𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 requiresadatasetofreal-worldcameradatatobuild
its resource set to serve as the basis of its mutations. Camera based
perceptionsystemsarewidelystudied,withseveralavailablebench-
marks [5,7,11] consisting of thousands of test cases of image and
interpretation pairs. Each benchmark targets a different level of
precision which affects the strength of the resource set.
We now explore the space of semantic mutations, Δ, for the
domainofcamerasystemsforautonomousvehicles.Wefirstdefine
thesemanticentitytypes thatcanappearinimages,e.g.car,bicyclist,
etc. Each such entity has a state, e.g., orientation, color, position,
lighting,etc.Finallywedefineasetofsemanticactions:e.g.,add
entity, remove entity, change entity state. The space of mutations,
Δ,is then the set of actions, each parameterized by an entity and a
state, e.g. add (action) a car (entity) at location 𝑙(state).
In practice, semantically mutating images can be difficult due
totheconformityrequirement.Forexample,addingacartoalo-
cation in an image requires verifying that a car can exist in that
location: e.g., the car cannot intersect another car. Removing an
entity requires generating conforming image data with a known
interpretation for the vacated space, a process known as semantic
inpainting [ 20,39]. Changing the pose of an entity requires render-
ing the entity in a conforming manner from a different perspective
than it appeared in the original test case.

mentsthreemutations:changingthecolorofcars,addingcars,and
adding pedestrians1. We begin with the system architecture and
then discuss detailed implementations for the chosen mutations.

𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 requires a prior data set as a basis for mutation.
In the autonomous vehicle domain, there are several such data
sets, includingKITTI[ 11], nuScenes[ 5], andCityscapes [ 7]. Each
provides(𝑟,𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝)testcaseswhere 𝑟isacameraimageand 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝
isaper-pixelannotationthatprovidesaground-truthinterpretation
basedonthecategoriesprovidedinthedataset.Asapreprocessing
step,𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 parses the prior test set to build a resource set of
available data, e.g. a list of all cars and their poses.
Eachdatasethasadifferentlistoftrackedcategorieswithdiffer-
inglevelsofprecisionanddesignchoicesforhowtotreatcertain
entities.Forexample,nuSceneshas7labelsforhumansdifferentiat-
ing between, e.g. adults and children, while Cityscapes has 2 labels
that distinguish between a pedestrian and a person riding a bike or
motorcycle. We developed 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 using the Cityscapes data
setduetoitspopularityinrelatedliterature,thewidenumberof
perception systems that have been developed to target the data set,
and the availability of open sourced tools to evaluate performance.
Wenote,however,thatthedesignchoicesandavailabledataina
data set influence the richness and precision of 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 ’s re-
source set and thus the mutations available. For example, when
we aim to develop a mutation for adding a vehicle that has been
involved in a crash to a test case, under the theory that a deformed
vehicle would be more difficult to perceive, the data set’s lack of
thislabelwillprevent 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 fromleveragingsuchamutation.

using available image manipulation techniques. Although these
mutations are relatively simple, we conjecture that if the simple
mutations yield interesting test cases, then this will encourage
further research to enable more advanced techniques which can
then be incorporated. We describe the implementation details of
each mutation in the following sections.

the vehicle should not change the target perception category, and
so𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝/prime=𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝. Thus, we examine how to produce 𝑟/primefrom𝑟.
4.2.1 Implementation. For this mutation, the test selection step
chooses a test case containing a car as the base test 𝑡for mutation,
andneedsnoadditionalresources.Toaffectthecolorchange,we
manipulatethecolorintheHSLcolorspace,whichseparatesthe
components into hue, saturation, and lightness in a way that is
similar tohuman perception ofcolor [ 14]. Atthe most basiclevel,
thismutationperformsahueshiftontheentity,changingittoa
different color. However, this leads to two concerns. First, if we
only want to change the color of the vehicle’s paint, how do we
prevent changing the color of the vehicle’s windows? In this color
model, high lightness corresponds to white and low to black. This
meansthatsincemostwindowsappeardarkinimages,theywill
beunaffectedbyahueshift.Thisleadstothesecondissue:altering
the color of white vehicles. To facilitate this, 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 checks
for high lightness pixels and decreases the lightness and increases
the saturation so that the hue shift applied to the entire vehicle
produces another color. Specifically, if the average lightness of the
vehicleisover100,thenallpixelswithalightnessvalueover100
have their lightness decreased by a random amount between 20
and 50. Then, to prevent the colors from appearing faded, pixels
withalightnessover100andasaturationlessthan50havetheir
saturation increased. Figure 6 showcases an example application of
this mutation changing the car’s color from red to blue. As shown
in Figure 6, the change object color mutation can render results
that appear very realistic.

ationmustensurethat 𝑟/primeconformstosomeworld 𝑤/prime.Ingeneral,

may have identified in Figure 6 that not only does the car body
appear repainted blue but so do the brake lights. In the physical
world, it is possible for a car to have blue brake lights; however,
thisislikelynotplausibleduetoregulationsgoverningthecolor

Adding an entity to the sensor input produces a corresponding

adding the entity, the mutation takes the isolated portion of the
imageandoverlaysit atthesamepixelcoordinates onthebaseimage.
Figure 8 demonstrates this process.
Maintainingaconsistentperspectiveisonekeytoconformity.
If done improperly, the added entity will appear out of proportion
and misaligned with other image features. To this end, we add
theconstraintthattheentitymustbeplacedatthesamerelative
physical coordinates to the camera in the new test case as it was in
the source test case. If we want to add a car with pose 𝑝relative to
the camera from 𝑡𝑠to test case 𝑡to generate 𝑡/prime, the resulting 𝑡/primewill
consistof 𝑡withthecarfrom 𝑡𝑠addedatpose 𝑝relativetotheits
camera.Retaining thesame poseincreases thelikelihoodthat the
added car will appear in the correct perspective in 𝑡/prime.
However,addingtheentityatthesamepixelcoordinatesdoes
not guarantee that the entity is added at the same physical co-
ordinates relative to the camera. The relationship between pixel
coordinatesandphysicalcoordinatesdependsonthecharacteris-
tics of the camera, the vanishing point of the scene, and the size
of the object. We assume that the entire resource set consists of
images taken with cameras that have consistent characteristics.
Additionally, since the entity is always added so that it occupies
thesameregionofpixels,ithasthesamesize.Thus,ifthesource
and destination images have the same vanishing point, they will
be compatible because adding at the same pixel coordinates will
resultinthesamephysicalcoordinatesrelativetothecamera.How-
ever, finding pixel-perfect matches on the vanishing point between
images is extremely unlikely due to potential number of scenes. In-
stead,wedividetheimagesintoquadrantsandconsidertwoimages
to be compatible if their vanishing points are in the same quadrant.
Increasingtheprecisionwhenmatchingvanishingpointsincreases
thelikelihoodthattheperspectivewillbeadequatelymaintained,
butatthecostofallowingfewerpossiblemutationsandmoreex-
pense in searching for compatible images during mutation. We
utilize an implementation [ 41] of an algorithm that uses the in-
tersection of Hough lines to determine which region of the image
likelycontainsthevanishingpoint[ 22].Iftheimagethattheentity
issourcedfromand 𝑡anddonothavecompatiblevanishingpoints,
it fails the conformity check.
The new location of the entity must be physically feasible in
ordertoconformtoaworld 𝑤/prime.Tovalidatethis, 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 checks
if the lower left corner of the entity’s bounding box is on the road.Lighting also plays an important role in the conformity of a
mutatedimage,especiallythebrightness.Forexample,acarfrom
an image with bright sunlight cannot be added in the shade. To
addressthis, 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 takestheregionofpixelsinthebaseimage
that the entity would be placed over and the pixels of the entity
and converts them to the HSV (hue, saturation, value) color space.
In HSV, the value corresponds to the brightness of the pixels. To
ensure that the lighting conditions are similar, if the entity does
not have a median value within 5 units ( ∼2%) of the median value
of the base image target area, then it fails the conformity check.
Once𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 chooses a base image and entity to add, the
images are combined into a new test image. Similarly, the interpre-
tationofthebaseimageiseditedtoincludetheproperclassification
oftheentityatitsposition.ThisisshowninFigures3eand3j,where
the car has been added both in the image and the interpretation.
4.3.2 Potential for False Positives. The previous techniques im-
prove the likelihood to generate images with conforming perspec-
tive and brightness, but as seen in Figure 9 there are several condi-
tions that can lead to false positives.
While𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 takesstepstoincreasethelikelihoodofmatch-
ing consistent perspectives, this does not always happen. Figure
9a shows an example of a car that has been added to an image
withaperspectivemismatch,causingtheaddedcartoappearmuch
smaller than it should compared to the entities around it. Another
issue related to entity placement is overlap. Figure 9b shows an
instance where a car has been added on top of a person walking
their dog. At first it seems that this could have been avoided by
checkingforoverlappingpixels.However,thiswouldoverlycon-
strainthemutationandp reventmanyinteresting testcasesbecause
pixel-level occlusion does not imply that the entities overlap in the
physical world. Determining overlap involves reasoning about the
physicalsizesofentitiesandtheirdistancefromthecamera,which
future work could explore.

effects must be consistent with a single lighting configuration. For
example,addingacarwithabrightreflectiontoacloudyimagewill
result in a nonconforming image as shown in Figure 9c. Further, in

Determining the characteristics of the shadows requires a detailed
model of the scene with information about the physical location of
all entities and light sources. This level of data is not present in the
resource set derived from Cityscapes, andso 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 does not
attempttoaddashadowwhenaddinganentity.Thiscanleadto
nonconforming images, as shown in Figure 9d.
4.4 Challenges and Vision for Other Mutations

two key areas: entity repositioning and removal. We now examine

to support such advanced mutations, and we comment on our
preliminary prototypes and results.

is a widely studied area of computer graphics, encompassing all

renderarealisticimageofasceneusingreal-worlddata.Todosowe
need a technique to convert a scene into a rendered image that: (1)
is sufficiently novel from prior data, (2) has a known interpretation
and (3) conforms to a world 𝑤. We find that although state-of-the-
arttechniqueshavemadestridesinalloftheseareas,thereisno
technique that meets all three criteria.
4.4.1 Repositioning Entities. Recent machine learning research at-
tempts to render novel scene compositions distinct from that of
sampled data. Originally used to render the same entity from a
different perspective [ 23], the current state-of-the-art can remove
orslightlyrepositionentitiesinthescene[ 28].Whilethisapproach
can render very realistic and conforming images with known in-
terpretationusingpriordata,itislimitedinhow“faraway”from
the original scene it can operate. Entities can only be removed if
they did not occupy that space in a different video frame and repo-
sitioningis limitedtoa fewmetersand degreesdifferent thanthe
original scene. While this area is promising, it currently does allow
for sufficient variation from prior data to use in 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 .
4.4.2 RemovingEntities. Anotherrelevantthreadofgraphicsre-
search is the problem of inpainting, the task of filling in regions of
animagesuchthatthenewimageisconforming[ 20,39].Forexam-

4.4.4 Discriminators for Conformity Checking. In prior sections,

toidentifysuchnonconformingtests[ 25].Thesediscriminatorsare
aformofbinaryclassifierthatseektodetermineifaninputbelongs
to a distribution, so they could preemptively reject mutations that
are nonconforming with the real world defined by a training set.
Weexploredthisapproach,trainingabinaryclassifierbasedona
CNNusingover48,000imagestakenfromboththeCityscapesdata
set and those generated by 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 . The discriminator learned
to differentiate between the classes, but could not differentiate
conforming versus nonconforming images. In part, the problem is
that the generated images contain conforming and nonconforming
images,butchecking24,000ofthemwasprohibitivelyexpensive.
Moregenerally,abroaderchallengeisthatdiscriminatorstendto
require much larger data sets even for much smaller images. We
suspect that the discriminator requires much more training data to
targetaresolutionsuitableforASs,whichisnotfeasibleduetothe
cost to obtain real-world data. Future research in this direction has
the potential to reduce the false positive rate of 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 .
5 DISCUSSION OF TRADE-OFFS
𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 provides a framework for testing AS perception sys-
tems distinct from the prior approaches described in Section 2. We
noteherethatthesepriorapproachesarenotsuitablefordirectcom-
parisonduetothedifferinggoalsandintendedoutputs.Simulation,
low-levelmutation,and 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 providedifferenttrade-offs
intheirabilitytogeneratenoveloutputs,costtogeneratetests,and
conformity of outputs. We now discuss those trade-offs.
In terms of ability to generate novel inputs, simulation provides
the highest level of utility, allowing for practically unlimited en-
vironmentgeneration.Attheotherend,low-levelmutationtech-
niques provide a narrow range of possible test cases based on prior
data and the global mutation strategies employed, being limited

inthenoveltyofthemutateddatacomparedtotheoriginaldata.
𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 builds from the low-level mutation strategy in terms
ofutility,providingnewdimensions forthenoveltyof themutated
data. Although still limited by the availability of prior data, the
richer semantic mutation strategies allow for the generation of
more meaningful novel test cases that contain a substantive and
human-understandable semantic change.
Although simulation provides the highest level of utility for
generatingnovel inputs,itsefficiency ismore nuanced.Simulated
environments may be re-used between testing different systems,
butbuildinganewenvironmentcomesatahighcostintermsof
timeandexpertiserequired.Onceanenvironmentisinplacefor
testing, adapting the environment can be achieved at a lower cost.
For example, given an existing scenario, the simulator CARLA [ 8]
providesanautomatedwaytovaryweatherconditions.Forboth
low-level mutation and 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 , there is an initial cost to col-
lect the baseline data to mutate; however, readily available data
sets [5,7,11] can ameliorate these costs to the end-user. Using
available data, the low-level mutation strategies are likely the most
efficient in producing new test cases. Given the additional machin-
ery that𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 uses to leverage multiple facets of the prior
datawhilealsoperformingconformitychecks,thecomputational
cost is likely significantly higher than the low-level approaches.
AsdiscussedinSection2,oneofthekeylimitationsofsimulation
testingisthesimulation-realityfidelitygapthatcandiminishthe
applicability of the tests and require revalidation in the physical
world as they may not be conforming with any real world [ 15,
21,40]. The mutation-based strategies are designed to avoid this
limitation by using real-world data as the baseline and ensuring
thatthemutationspreservetheconformityoftheoriginaldata.We
note that 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 specifically identifies this need to preserve
conformity as a fundamental part of the framework.

6 EVALUATION
We have developed 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 , a test generation tool that can

systems using semantic mutations. To evaluate the potential of our
approach, 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 ,in thesedimensions weseek toanswerthe
following research questions:

regardless of the SUT assigned label.
6.2 Tests Generated
WeusedtheCityscapesdatasetasthebasisforourtesting,serving
as the original test suite and basis for building the resource set.
We pruned testcases thataretoo difficultfor the SUTsto prevent
mutating test cases where the mutation will not be the focus of the
test;iftheSUTstruggleswiththeimageasawhole,themutation
will not provide any additional utility. To perform this filter, we
ran the highest performing SUT on the baseline, as determined by
itsrankingontheCityscapesleaderboard[ 7],ontheoriginaltest

test case. Any test case on which the best SUT performs below the

induced directly by the mutation itself, allowing us to gauge the
strength of the mutations to find inconsistencies.
Moreformally,foragivenSUT 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑝,testcase (𝑟,𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝),and
corresponding mutation (𝑟/prime,𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝/prime), the drop is given by
𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑝=𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙(𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑝(𝑟),𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝)−𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙(𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑝(𝑟/prime),𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝/prime)
The larger the value, the more error the mutation induced in the
SUT.Wejudgedropsoflessthan1p.p.tobeinthenoiseasmost
tests result in SUTs misclassifying a few pixels around the edges
of objects, leading to small drops compared to the baseline. We
select 1 p.p. as the cut off to reduce the likelihood that we deem an
inconsistency noteworthy when it is not, and as a filter to main-
tain the feasibility to complete the manual reviews we conduct for
evaluation.We categorizedrops between1 and5p.p. asmoderate
inconsistencies, between 5 and 10 as significant, and those greater
than10asextremeinconsistencies.Foradditionalcontext,thehood
of the car visible at the bottom of all images in the Cityscapes data
set (see Fig. 3), occupies roughly 4 .3% of the image; a drop of more
than5p.p.meansanarealargerthanthehoodwasmisclassified.
We note that there is no additional filtering at this step based on
howwelltheSUTperformedontheoriginaltestcase.Forexample,
iftheSUTscoredonly85%ontheoriginaltestandthenscored78%

ine usingspecificperformance thresholdsinstead ofperformance
drops, specifically as this technique applies to testing a single SUT.
However, by measuring deterioration of performance, we are able
to use this metric to compare across the various SUTs even though
they show different levels of absolute performance.

We have shown that 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 can generate test cases that
induce inconsistencies in the SUTs. However, one potential issue is
thepresenceoftestcasesthatarenonconforming,whichleadsto
false inconsistencies. As highlighted in Section 4, there are several
factors that can result in a nonconforming test case, and determin-
ing conformity is subjective. Still, to gain a better grasp on the rate

SUT on those tests (3rd-7th row) in milliseconds, with standard

The color change mutation was the fastest, taking less than 20%
thetimeoftheaddmutations.Thisisbecausetheconformitycheck

selecting viable resources. The add car mutation was slightly faster
than the addperson mutation. This is likelybecause it is easier to
satisfy the conformity constraints—it is more likely for a randomly

son, meaning fewer samples are needed to find a suitable car. As
expected,wefoundthatforeachSUTthetimeittakestoexecute
the test is not different based on the mutation. While the fastest
SUT, HRNetV2+OCR [ 33], takes about as much time to execute
a test as 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 does to generate a test, we note that three

7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We introduced a novel approach that automatically generates test-
caseswithsensorreadingandground-truthinterpretationpairsfor
AS perception systems. The approach leverages domain-specific
semanticsandpriortestcasesbasedonreal-worldsensordatato
generatemutatedsensorreadingsthatstillconformtothephysical
world. Our experimental prototype for images showed that low-
cost and high-level semantic mutations such as adding a car can
uncover inconsistencies in state-of-the-art perception systems.
𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 and our implementation 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 set several
directions for future work. Following standard software fuzzing,

We willalso investigatehow to expandto other sensormodalities

directions of research in computer graphics, advances in which
would likely translate quickly into improvements in 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝐼𝑚𝐹𝑢𝑧𝑧 .
