ABSTRACT
Although the open source model bears many advantages in soft-
ware development, open source projects are always hard to sustain.
Previous research on open source sustainability mainly focuses on
projects that have already reached a certain level of maturity (e.g.,
with communities, releases, and downstream projects). However,
limited attention is paid to the development of (sustainable) open
source projects in their infancy, and we believe an understanding
of early sustainability determinants is crucial for project initiators,
incubators, newcomers, and users.
In this paper, we aim to explore the relationship between early
participation factors and long-term project sustainability. We lever-
age a novel methodology combining the Blumberg model of perfor-
mance and machine learning to predict the sustainability of 290,255
GitHub projects. Specificially, we train an XGBoost model based on
early participation (first three months of activity) in 290,255 GitHub
projects and we interpret the model using LIME. We quantitatively
show that early participants have a positive effect on project’s fu-
ture sustained activity if they have prior experience in OSS project
incubation and demonstrate concentrated focus and steady com-
mitment. Participation from non-code contributors and detailed
contribution documentation also promote project’s sustained ac-
tivity. Compared with individual projects, building a community
that consists of more experienced core developers and more active
peripheral developers is important for organizational projects. This

1 INTRODUCTION
Open Source Software (OSS) plays a fundamental role in both the
computing world and our daily life. As the advantages of open
source model are commonly recognized, the number of OSS projects
is rapidly growing. According to the GitHub Octoverse Report from
the last five years, about 32 million repositories were created in 2018,
44 million in 2019, 60 million in 2020, 61 million in 2021, and 86 mil-
lion in 2022 [ 7]. However, a significant number of GitHub projects
die in their first year [ 12]. Some projects (e.g., course assignments)
may have no intention of achieving long-term sustainability, but
even with these cases excluded, there are still a large amount of OSS
projects suffering from long-term sustainability failures [ 23,80,90].
If we search over GitHub with the term “is this dead” [ 11], more
than 329k issues will be returned, indicating an enormous interest
in whether a project has been abandoned. The large amount and
the high failure rate of OSS projects pose formidable challenges toarXiv:2308.06005v4  [cs.SE]  28 Sep 2023ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA Wenxin Xiao, Hao He, Weiwei Xu, Yuxia Zhang, and Minghui Zhou
OSS project initiators, incubators, newcomers, and users. Project
initiators (i.e., developers who wish to launch and sustain their OSS
projects) may face increased competition and decreased exposure to
potential downstream users. It will also be hard for incubators, new-
comers, and users to locate promising OSS projects in their early
stages to invest in, onboard early, or use. Despite the great needs,
guidelines for OSS project initiation come largely from the grey
literature with little empirical evidence to support them [1, 4–6].
A number of previous studies have investigated how various fac-
tors may affect long-term OSS project sustainability [ 21,22,39,57,
66,70,80,81,90]. However, they mainly focus on projects that have
already reached a certain level of maturity (e.g., Apache Incubator
projects [ 90]) and investigate factors unavailable or unmeaningful
for an OSS project in its early phase (e.g., developer and dependency
networks [ 80,81,90], organizational ecology [ 21,22], number of
downloads [ 57]). For factors available in the early phase, prior stud-
ies overwhelmingly focus on technical and process-related factors
while overlooking participant-related factors [39, 57, 70].
In this paper, we argue that early participation plays an im-
portant role in determining long-term OSS project sustainability,
analogical to how the initial effort of individuals determines the
future sustainability of their work teams [ 44,55]. To quantitatively
confirm this, we ask the first research question (using sustained
activity as the proxy for sustainability):
•RQ1: To what extent can early participation factors predict
an OSS project’s long-term sustained activity?
To provide empirical evidence and interpretations for the pre-
dictability of early participation in sustained activity, we compare
variables negatively/positively associated with sustained activity
and ask the second research question:
•RQ2: What early participation factors promote the long-
term sustained activity of an OSS project?
To answer the RQs, we sample 290,255 GitHub projects from
GHTorrent [ 40], all of which demonstrate signals of continuous
development in their first three months and rank top 5% according
to multiple popularity and activity metrics. With reference to the
Blumberg model [ 16], we design and extract a set of 54 variables
from each project to measure the project’s initial participation.
We use these variables and ten other control variables to train an
XGBoost model [ 19] that predicts whether the projects will have
two years of sustained activity, achieving an AUC of up to 0.84.
To identify determinants of sustained activity, we further apply
LIME [ 64] to generate local explanations for each prediction from
the trained XGBoost model. For each variable, we divide projects
into two groups (where the variable correlates negatively/positively
to sustained activity in the local explanations of LIME) and compare
variable distributions between the two groups to understand the
variable’s contribution to sustained activity.
The above analysis reveals that early participation factors can
indeed be used to predict project future sustained activity and sev-
eral determinants play an important role. We discover that the
steady attention and commitment of core developers, participa-
tion of experienced developers (especially those with prior experi-
ence on projects with long-term sustained activity), and newcomer
attractiveness have a positive effect on future sustained activity.
Organizational projects typically require more experienced coredevelopers and more active peripheral developers than individual
projects to achieve long-term sustainability. Based on our findings,
we identify practices and strategies effective for incubating sustain-
able OSS projects, and provide signals that can be used to recognize
long-term sustainable OSS projects. Our interpretable modeling
approach can also serve as a starting point for the development of
tools for OSS project initiation and selection.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In the context of OSS development, the notion of sustainability is
multifaceted [ 80], as is that of success [ 27], and they share certain
fostering factors (e.g., large team size can benefit both project sus-
tainability and success [ 26]). An OSS project’s sustainability indica-
tors may include: 1) artifact-related indicators [ 70] (e.g., following
a modular and extensible architecture, high quality documenta-
tion); 2) economic-related indicators [60, 80, 91] (e.g., well funded,
low cost of ownership, high added value); 3) supply chain indica-
tors [80, 83] (e.g., up-to-date dependencies, high number of down-
stream dependents); 4) development activity indicators [ 79,90]
(e.g., many commits, an adequately staffed team, influx of newcom-
ers). Among these indicators, sustained development activity is
an especially strong signal as any piece of software will become
progressively less useful if not maintained (i.e., Lehman’s Law [ 53]).
Although development activity has been used as a proxy for both
OSS success [ 57] and sustainability [ 80], Chengalur-Smith et al. [ 21]
argue that sustainability requires activity to be maintained over the
long run whereas success is measured at one particular time point.
In this paper, we use sustained activity as the main proxy for study-
ing OSS sustainability, following previous work [14, 25, 39, 80].
In recent years, the topic of OSS sustainability is gaining increas-
ing public attention because a failed OSS project can generate a huge
impact on our society. This situation happens because many inter-
dependent OSS projects form complex software ecosystems [ 29]
and a large fraction of our modern digital infrastructure relies on
such ecosystems [ 32]. Yet, even renowned OSS projects suffer from
sustainability failures. For example, the Log4Shell vulnerability
in the popular Log4j 2 library affects over 17,000 Java libraries in
Maven Central and countless Java applications [ 3], but the library
is painstakingly maintained by only four unpaid developers [8].
Due to the high failure rate of OSS projects [ 12,21], OSS sustain-
ability has been a long-lasting, multi-dimensional research topic
with a large body of literature. In the remainder of this section,
we motivate our research based on two realms of prior work: the
strategies for improving OSS sustainability and the determinants
of OSS sustainability (at either project or individual level).
Strategies for Improving OSS Sustainability. Sustainability
failures can be caused by many factors [ 23,24] (e.g., the departure
of main contributors, usurped by competitors, etc.), and existing
studies have focused on various strategies to overcome them. For
example, as a good influx of newcomers is often necessary to mit-
igate the risk of project abandonment [ 14,63], studies have in-
vestigated barriers to OSS newcomer onboarding [ 67,72–74] and
explored strategies to help OSS newcomer onboarding (e.g., timely
responses [ 46], expert mentoring [ 78,93], university courses [ 43],
and task recommendation [ 71,75,79,84,85]). Apart from this line
of work, studies have also shown how well-established foundationsHow Early Participation Determines Long-Term Sustained Activity in GitHub Projects? ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA

pacity (core/peripheral/non-code), and opportunity
(e.g., the Apache Software Foundation [87]), business models [18],
and management [26] may promote long-term sustainability.
Determinants of OSS Sustainability. To help stakeholders
take timely and proactive action against sustainability risks, a num-
ber of studies have modeled OSS project sustainability in different
settings and identified sustainability determinants from different
perspectives [ 21,22,39,57,66,70,80,81,90]. The main variables
of interest in prior studies are summarized in Table 1. We can ob-
serve that many variables in prior studies are unavailable in the
early phases of an OSS project (e.g., population niche [ 21], user and
developer base [ 57], dependency network metrics [ 80], and social-
technical network metrics [ 90]). Consequently, findings related
to these variables are only applicable to projects with established
communities (i.e., a socio-technical network) or reached milestones
(e.g., releases, artifacts, downstream projects). Even for the vari-
ables available during the early phase, prior studies extensively
focus on technical and process-related variables (e.g., code com-
plexity [ 57,70], license [ 57,81], features and bug fixes [ 39,70])
while overlooking participant-related factors. The only exception
is Wang [81], which investigated the amount of participation and
the quality/size of the external network (as a measure of available
resources and social capital) at a coarse granularity. On the other
hand, participants, especially early participants, can play a key role
in sustaining OSS projects, as evidenced by previous studies on OSS
participant motivation [ 38,51,89] and the modeling of individual
sustainability [ 15,35,54,60,92,93] (i.e., what drives an individual’s
sustained participation in OSS projects). For example, Zhou and

Mockus [92,93]empirically show how the initial behaviors and
experiences of OSS participants correlate to their sustained par-
ticipation. However, we are unaware of any prior study carrying
out an in-depth investigation between early participant factors and
long-term project sustainability, leaving an important knowledge
gap relevant for many stakeholders during OSS project incubation
(e.g., initiators, incubators, newcomers, and users).1
In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing an interpretable mod-
eling approach that predicts future sustained activity using early
participant factors. Our study takes a novel perspective showing
that early participation factors can effectively predict long-term
project sustainability and reveal interesting correlations. We will
discuss in Section 5.2 how filling this knowledge gap strengthens
previous findings and yields new implications for practitioners.
3 METHODOLOGY
In this Section, we first describe how a sample of GitHub projects
is collected from GHTorrent [ 40] to conduct this study. Then, we
design variables to measure early participation w.r.t. the Blumberg
model of performance [ 16]. Next, we introduce how XGBoost [ 19]
is employed to predict two-year sustained activity based on the
variables. Finally, we explain how the LIME [ 64] is applied to explain
the correlation between variables and the prediction (i.e., two-year
sustained activity) in the trained XGBoost model. An overview of
our study methodology is available in Figure 1.
3.1 Project Selection
In this study, we focus on GitHub projects and collect project data
from the latest GHTorrent dump (version 2021-03-06) [ 40]. GHTor-
rent provides event timeline data allowing us to reproduce historical
project states and collect project variables at any time point, which
have also been used in previous software engineering studies to
retrieve the historical data of GitHub projects [49, 84].
There are 189,467,746 projects (i.e., repositories) recorded in
GHTorrent. Similar to the dataset filtering process adopted by Mu-
naiah et al . [59] , we first remove deleted projects and forks of other
projects. Forks are removed because this study focuses on the incu-
bation of a new project at its initial stage (note that contributions
successfully merged from forks will be considered). Then, we filter
out projects created before 2012 as GitHub only became popular
after 2012 [ 80]; we also filter out projects created after March 2019
as their two-year sustained activity status cannot be observed from
our dataset. To filter out projects with no intention of sustaining
long-term development (e.g., toy projects, classwork projects, paper
1Note that project sustainability and individual sustainability are two different out-
comes for which project sustainability is the pre-condition of individual sustainability.
Studies of individual sustainability are typically conducted in long-term sustainable
projects, whose findings may not be applicable to OSS project incubation.ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA Wenxin Xiao, Hao He, Weiwei Xu, Yuxia Zhang, and Minghui Zhou
repositories, and projects for competitions), we only retain projects
with a certain level of activity, popularity, and development time
spans. Specifically, we compute the 95th percentile of all projects in
GHTorrent for the following popularity and activity metrics: num-
ber of commits, pull requests, issues, forks, and stars; we only retain
projects whose metrics are no less than the 95th percentile, i.e., with
no less than 57 commits, 4 PRs, 1 issue, 1 fork, and 2 stars, before the
time the GHTorrent dump was collected. Then, we further retain
projects with a time span of at least three months between the first
and last commits which could indicate some intention of sustained
development. After the above filtering steps, the final dataset con-
tains 290,255 projects. Although the above sampling heuristics have
limitations (to be discussed in Section 5.3), the resulting dataset
contains mostly engineered GitHub projects [ 59] with only a few
cases of noise (e.g., classwork).2
We observe in our dataset that it is common for seemingly aban-
doned projects to restart development after a period of time. This
observation is consistent with the results of Coelho and Valente [ 23],
that projects may switch ownership or accept new core developers
to get rid of the unmaintained status. Thus, it is inadequate to mea-
sure the sustained activity of a project with only the first and last
commits [ 80]. In this study, we consider a project as having 𝑡-year
sustained activity if 1) they have commit activity for more than 𝑡
year(s), and 2) the median number of commits per month is at least
𝑘.𝑘is an adjustable variable, and a higher value of 𝑘indicates a
stricter definition of projects with sustained activity.
We regard the first commit time of a repository as its start time.
Table 2 shows the survival status of projects started each year from
2012 to March 2019. The number of repositories started each year
that meet our filtering rules peaked in 2017. For 𝑡=2and𝑘=1,
we present the ratio and number of projects with sustained activity
(i.e., the Two-Year column), and projects that are still active within
two years before data truncation (i.e., the Still Active column), in
Table 2. We observe that the ratio of two-year sustainable projects
gradually decreases over years, despite the growing number of new
GitHub projects per year [ 7]. The ratio of still active projects in the
last three years is relatively high and fluctuated around 13% before
2To validate dataset quality, we sample 384 projects (confidence level: 95%, margin
of error: 5%) and check whether they are engineered software projects following the
labeling process in Munaiah et al . [59] . Among them, 19 have been deleted at the time
of writing, six store documents, and three are for classwork. In other words, 92.7 ±5%
of the projects in our dataset are engineered software projects (confidence level = 95%).

on GitHub [ 7] are also the most frequently used languages among
the selected projects, comprising the top 13 languages. The number
of commits for these projects ranged from 57 to 3,545,589, with a
median value of 190 and a mean value of 571.
3.2 Measuring Early Participation
In GHTorrent, about 1/4, 1/5, and 1/6 of the projects on GitHub
have commit activity over spans of one, three, and five month(s).
In this study, we measure early participation using development
activities from the first 𝑚=1,3,5month(s), respectively. We bor-
row the model of work performance proposed by Blumberg and
Pringle [ 16] to identify different dimensions of variables that affect
the performance of participants from three different groups: core
developers, peripheral developers, and non-code contributors.
The Blumberg Model of Performance. As a classic behavior
model in management science, the Blumberg model of performance
proposes that three interacting factors influence the performance
and/or behavior of an individual: willingness, capacity, and opportu-
nity. Among them, willingness refers to psychological antecedents
including personality, attitude, motivational effect, etc.; capacity
consists of physiological and cognitive determinants such as ex-
perience and ability; opportunity includes social or technological
factors that constrain or enable people’s work behavior in an or-
ganizational setting. This three-dimensional framework has been
used in software engineering studies to predict the likelihood of a
developer becoming a long-term contributor in OSS projects, ex-
plore why newcomers abandon OSS projects, and study developer
role evolution in OSS ecosystems [20, 76, 92].
Core Developers, Peripheral Developers, and Non-Code
Contributors . Participants in an OSS project may serve different
roles (e.g., code contributors, non-code contributors, users, potential
newcomers) and the tasks they perform vary greatly [ 45,47,92].
In previous work, code contributors in OSS projects are classified
into core and peripheral roles [ 28,58], in which core developers
are most productive and play a leading role in project development
and maintenance [ 58,86]. However, other contributors also have
their roles to take, i.e., given a large enough beta-tester and co-
developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly
and the fix obvious to someone [62]. In this study, we follow the most
common operationalization and distinguish among three types of
participants based on their commits to the project. Specifically, we
consider the participants who made the most commits and whose
commit counts add up to over 80% of the total as core developers ;
the remaining participants with at least one commit are regarded
asperipheral developers [48,58]; participants who only commented
on issues, pull requests (PRs) or reported issues are considered
asnon-code contributors , who may give ideas for project future
evolution, influence development, and enrich discussions [ 45]. For
each project, we compute participant-level variables as the average
of all participants in each group, and we expect different groups to
have different impacts on long-term sustained activity.
In the remainder of this Section, we introduce how the vari-
ables for modeling early participation are defined w.r.t. the three
dimensions of willingness, capacity, and opportunity. Regarding
willingness, we focus on variables that represent the strength and
trend of willingness. As for capability, we consider both general OSSHow Early Participation Determines Long-Term Sustained Activity in GitHub Projects? ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA
capability and project-specific capability. For opportunity, we focus
on opportunity for newcomers to participate in the project. We also
consider indirectly related control variables. Table 5 summarizes
all variables and their definitions.
Willingness of Participants. Early investment indicates intrin-
sic motivations to participate, which drives developers to sustain
contributions in the future [ 65]. Following previous studies [ 33,
50,92] that use effort spent on a project as the main proxy for de-
velopers’ willingness to long-term/actively contribute, we use the
effort in terms of cumulative amount andstability to measure
the strength and trend of developers’ willingness. We suspect that
developers whose attention is spread across multiple projects may
not be as inclined to focus their energy on a new project. Thus we
also use developers’ level of concentration to laterally measure
their willingness to incubate projects.
WP1Cumulative Effort Amount: As different types of contribu-
tions (e.g., commits, issues, and comments) require varying
amounts of effort [ 50,92], we measure developers’ efforts
in terms of the average number of different types of contri-
butions made by each group of participants to the project,
namely, number of commits , PRs, issues, issue comments,
commit comments, and issue events.
WP2Stability of Effort: We assume that declining commitment
may mean a weakened willingness to continue development
and a steady stream of contributions implies participants’ will-
ingness to sustain project development in the long term. Thus,
we measure the contribution “steadiness” using the following
variables: the number of days with commits and the num-
ber of commits in the first/second half of observation period;
the median and standard deviation of the commit numbers
for each day; and the standard deviation of the number of
commits made by all code contributors.
WP3Level of Concentration: Developers may follow each other
and star a repository for multiple reasons [ 17,68] (e.g., to
bookmark or to show appreciation [ 17]). If a developer fol-
lows many projects or developers, it may indicate their broad
curiosity, follow-ups to new technology, or divergent atten-
tion. Such a developer may be more interested in and willing
to participate in multiple mature projects, rather than dedi-
cating as much time and effort as possible to a startup project.
Therefore, we use the number of developers followed by par-
ticipants and the number of projects they starred to measure
their general level of concentration on GitHub.
Capacity of Participants. Historical experience is a commonly
used proxy to measure developer expertise in previous studies
(e.g., code reviewer and crowdsourcing developer recommenda-
tion [ 61,82]). Therefore, we measure how much and how well de-
velopers contribute on GitHub by their general OSS experience
including the cumulative volume of contributions and experience
of successfully incubating projects with long-term sustained activ-
ity. In addition, specific capabilities required by the project can be
directly measured through code-related variables. Stănciulescu et
al. [70] have identified code-related variables that may be associ-
ated with project sustainability, which will be discussed in detail in
Section 4.1.3. Meanwhile, developers are usually followed because
they are recognized for their historical work, so we use popularity
to portray developers’ capability.CP1General OSS Experience: Developers with rich experience
in OSS development and the successful incubation of sus-
tainable projects may be more capable of fostering a project
with long-term sustained activity. As previous work shows
that experience can be measured in terms of cumulative task
performance [ 13], we extract the following variables to char-
acterize the historical OSS experience of project participants:
the number of commits, issues, and PRs on GitHub, number
of owned projects, and number of owned projects with more
than one or two years of sustained activity.
CP2Popularity: Developers are often followed because other
developers consider their historical work interesting or use-
ful. Therefore, we use the number of followers to measure
developers’ ability to develop useful or interesting projects.
Opportunity of Contribution. A major reason for OSS sus-
tainability failures is the lack of time/interest from core developers
and the absence of new developers [ 23], and an effective way to
avoid such failure is to provide opportunities for newcomers to
contribute and support their onboarding. Specifically, developers
may have more chances to contribute if there are more available
tasks from open issues. We are also interested in the impact of using
good first issue labels, an increasingly popular label intended for
marking newcomer-friendly tasks [ 79]. In addition, projects usually
provide documents such as README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md
to help newcomers quickly understand project background and
contribution workflow. Therefore, we use the number and ratio of
open issues, the number of good first issues , the number of lines of
README and CONTRIBUTING documentation to measure the con-
tribution opportunity of potential newcomers. It should be noted
that open issues only represent potential opportunities for new-
comers, and they may not be suitable for all newcomers, because
some newcomers may lack the expertise to resolve the issues.
Control Variables. Some variables are related to inherent prop-
erties of developers or projects (e.g., development team size, project
popularity, project owner account type); they do not character-
ize early participation but have been shown to be associated with
project sustainability [ 21,80]. Thus, we include the following con-
trol variables in our study: the number of members, the number of
forks, project owner account type, the number of organizations par-
ticipants belong to, and the ratio of participants showing affiliated
companies/institutions on their overview page.
3.3 Training an XGBoost Model
Given the collected variables, our next task is to train a model
to effectively predict the project’s 𝑡-year sustained activity. The
problem is basically a binary classification task. We define project
status ( status ) as the prediction outcome: if a project has sustained
activity for more than 𝑡year(s), we set status=1 , and otherwise
status=0 . In this study, we use XGBoost [ 19], a library for gradient-
boosted regression tree learning with clever optimization tricks and
efficient implementations, for learning and prediction. We choose to
use XGBoost because: 1) it is highly flexible, supporting automated
feature selection and the handling of both numerical and categorical
variables; 2) it has exhibited competitive predictive performance
in diverse software engineering prediction tasks [ 30,42,84,88];
and 3) the learned model also outperforms two alternative machine
learning models (i.e., logistic regression and random forest) in ourESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA Wenxin Xiao, Hao He, Weiwei Xu, Yuxia Zhang, and Minghui Zhou
dataset in terms of AUC (as we will show in Section 4.1). With
current performance, we believe the model is able to learn some
generalizable patterns worthy of further analysis and interpretation.
3.4 The Interpretable LIME Approach
To investigate how variables contribute to the prediction results
of the XGBoost model, we further interpret the results using the
Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), which is
designed to explain the prediction results yielded by any pre-trained
black-box machine learning model [ 64]. LIME has two advantages:
one is that it is model-agnostic, i.e., applies to arbitrary linear or
nonlinear classifiers; the other is that it allows us to locally analyze
the variable contributions of individual samples by local fitting.
For complex nonlinear systems that are ubiquitous in reality,
the coefficient of a variable is determined by its position in the
system [ 34]; that is, when the values of other variables are different,
even if the value of this variable does not change, it may have
different coefficients. Thus, a variable with the same value may
have opposite effects on different projects. For example, as shown
in Figure 2, the standard deviation of commit number per code
contributor cmt_dev_std =4is more likely to have a negative effect
on sustained activity when type=0(the project is owned by an
organization), and is positive for sustained activity when type=1
(details are in Sec. 4.2). We use the local explanations generated
by LIME from the XGBoost model to analyze the contribution of
variables to sustained activity in different project contexts.
Given a trained model and a data point, LIME generates neighbor-
hood data points for that sample and learns a linear model locally
on these data points, so that the contribution of each variable to
the prediction result is locally interpretable within the linear model.
The coefficient of one variable for a data point can be either positive
or negative, indicating that the variable contributes positively or
negatively to 𝑡-year sustained activity in this data point. For each
variable 𝑣, to analyze the overall contribution of 𝑣to the prediction
results on the whole dataset, we divide projects into two groups:
thenegative group where LIME returns negative coefficients for
𝑣and the positive group where LIME returns positive coefficients
for𝑣. The overall value distributions of 𝑣in the two groups are
compared using the Mann–Whitney U test [ 56] with Bonferroni
correction [ 31]. We also compute the effect size ( |𝑟|) and consider
the effect size as large when |𝑟|≥ 0.5, medium when|𝑟|≥ 0.3,
small when|𝑟| ≥ 0.1, and negligible otherwise, following com-
mon recommendations in applied statistics [ 37]. A variable has a
large/medium/small positive effect on sustained activity if the me-
dian of 𝑣’s positive group is larger than the median of 𝑣’s negative
group and its effect size is greater than 0.5/0.3/0.1, and vice versa.
4 RESULTS
4.1 RQ1: Predictive Performance
We evaluate the prediction performance of our model under differ-
ent𝑚, 𝑡and𝑘. Here, the data of projects are collected at their first
𝑚month(s) and 𝑡-year sustained activity is defined with a hyperpa-
rameter 𝑘. We also compare our model with a number of baselines
to demonstrate the competitiveness of XGBoost on this problem
and investigate the contribution of each variable dimension.
4.1.1 Evaluation Metrics. In our study, we consider the Area Under
the ROC Curve (AUC) as the main evaluation metric because it canholistically measure the goodness of fit and prediction effectiveness
at all classification thresholds. Intuitively, AUC denotes the proba-
bility that a random positive sample ranks higher than a random
negative sample, and it is generally more appropriate to evaluate
classifiers with imbalanced data [ 36]. We also provide precision
and recall at the classification threshold 0.5, as a reference.
4.1.2 Experimental Performance under Different Scenarios. The
lower quartile, median, and upper quartile of monthly commit
counts for projects in our dataset with more than two years of
sustained activity are 1, 2, and 6, respectively. Table 3 presents the
performance of our approach in predicting 𝑡=1and 2year(s) of
sustained activity when the median number of commits per month
in the first 𝑡year(s) is at least 𝑘=1,2and 6with projects’ data
collected from the first 𝑚=1,3,5month(s) (about 1/4, 1/5, and 1/6
of the projects in GHTorrent database are developed longer than
them, respectively), reported from 10-fold cross-validation [77].

5 0.76 / 0.65 / 0.59 0.78 / 0.64 / 0.47 0.84 / 0.63 / 0.38
Obviously, the model can predict better with data collected over
longer time horizons (higher 𝑚). When 𝑚=3, moderately accu-
rate (0.7 <AUC⩽0.9) [ 41] can already be achieved for all 𝑘s and
𝑡s. Though 𝑡=2is a longer period for “sustained development”,
the model’s performance in predicting two-year sustainability is
slightly lower than that of one year, which is also expected as the
model needs to predict a more distant future. At larger 𝑘, AUC
becomes better, maybe because active projects are more easily
identified, but precision and recall become worse. Due to space
constraints, we only report the results for 𝑚=3,𝑡=2, and 𝑘=1
in the following experiments. The results are stable across other
parameter settings and are provided in the replication package.
4.1.3 Comparison with Alternatives. To demonstrate the contribu-
tion of our variables and XGBoost to the final performance, we
compare our approach with several alternative baselines.
•Alternative ML Models: Logistic Regression andRandom Forest
are popular models with widespread use in software engineer-
ing [71,80]. Logistic regression is especially popular for empirical
analysis [ 80,92]. We employ both models from the scikit-learn
Python package using all our variables as two baselines to show-
case the competitiveness of our approach and substantiate its
adoption over traditional data analysis approaches.
•Isolated Feature Dimension: Among the variables we propose,
#cmt_{c|p} ,#issue_{c|p|n} ,#cmt_actday ,type, and #member
are also studied by previous work shown in Table 1. To demon-
strate the effect of these variables, we show the performance
of two alternative XGBoost models with only these common
variables (i.e., Common ) and with all other variables (i.e., Other ),
respectively. As introduced in Section 3.2, the variables are col-
lected from seven sub-dimensions, i.e., Cumulative Effort Amount,
Stability of Effort, Level of Concentration, General OSS Experience,
Popularity, Opportunity of Contribution , and Control Variables . ToHow Early Participation Determines Long-Term Sustained Activity in GitHub Projects? ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA
examine the predictability of variables from each dimension on
projects’ sustained activity, we show the performance of seven
alternative XGBoost models, each of them using only variables
from one of the seven sub-dimensions.
•Previous Study: We compare our approach with Stănciulescu
et al. [70], who proposed using coding process and code quality
measures to predict project sustainability.
As shown in Table 4, the final model outperforms all other base-
lines in terms of AUC and precision. Although the recall is lower
than Random Forest , the higher AUC indicates a better overall per-
formance at all thresholds (and thus better fitness to data). Without
the common variables that are studied in other work, the AUC
of our model is maintained at 0.71. We compare our findings on
the common variables with other studies in Section 5.1. Among
various dimensions of variables, Stability of Effort andGeneral OSS
Experience are most effective in predicting sustainability.

Control Variables 0.61/0.57/0.30 Our Model 0.72/0.62/0.52
As Stănciulescu et al. [ 70] stated in their replication package [ 2],
it takes 5-10 days to collect code-related metrics of their 236 GitHub
projects. Since it is impractical to collect code-related metrics for a
large number of projects, we compare early participation metrics’
and code-related metrics’ ability to predict two-year sustainability
on their 236 projects. We obtain 0.71 AUC, 0.72 precision, and 0.74
recall with early participation metrics, 0.56 AUC, 0.64 precision,
and 0.70 recall with code-related metrics, and 0.68 AUC, 0.71 pre-
cision, and 0.77 recall with mixed metrics containing both early
participation metrics and code-related metrics, through 10-fold
cross-validation. It appears the two-year sustainability of projects
cannot be effectively predicted by the code-related metrics. Adding
the code-related metrics to our metrics may lead to the degradation
of AUC on the test sets. Further study is needed to achieve efficient
prediction of project sustainability with code-related metrics.
Summary for RQ1:
Early participation factors from an OSS project can effectively
predict long-term sustained activity: our modeling approach
for predicting two-year sustained activity can achieve an AUC
of up to 0.84 ( 𝑚=5, 𝑘=6) on 290,255 GitHub projects.
4.2 RQ2: Determinants of Sustained Activity
Table 5 summarizes the results we obtained from applying LIME
to the trained model using all projects in our dataset. We use
Mann–Whitney U test [ 56] to test all the 64 variables in both groups
and for all variables the 𝑝-value is less than 0.00078 (<0.05/64,
with Bonferroni correction [ 31]). More than half of the tests have
an effect size of more than 0.5, which indicates a large difference in
the variable values between the negative and positive groups. In
this Section, we discuss the effect of variables in detail.Willingness of Participants. Similar to Section 3.2, we discuss
the effect of variables in the three sub-dimensions.
WP1Cumulative Effort Amount: As expected, we find that the
willingness of participants in code contributions ( #cmt_{c|p} ,
#pr_{c|p} ) is a positive factor for long-term sustained activity
in project early stages. The effect of participant willingness in
submitting issues ( #issue_{c|p|n} ) and adding comments to
commits ( #cmt_comment_{c|p|n} ) is generally negative. Our
interpretation is that too many early issues and too much inter-
action effort in code contributions may diverge participants’
attention, harming sustainability in the long term. However,
issue discussions ( #iss_comment_{c|p|n} ) carry long-term
benefits. The reason could be that discussions usually clarify
the problem and solution before issue resolvers contribute,
which thus reduces unnecessary effort.
WP2Stability of Effort: We discover that a steady stream of com-
mits ( #cmt_actday ) has a large positive effect on project long-
term sustained activity. Furthermore, we find that making
most of the commits in the first half of the observation pe-
riod ( #cmt_front ) and having unevenly distributed commits
over time ( cmt_day_std ) has a large negative effect. How-
ever, the uneven distribution of workload among developers
(cmt_dev_std ) carries a large positive effect instead, which
may be because it indicates the presence of highly competent
developers and several peripheral developers, who are often
vital for the incubation of successful OSS.
WP3Level of Concentration: We discover that, for core devel-
opers and peripheral developers, both their average number
of followed developers ( #following_{c|p} ) and their average
number of starred projects ( #star_pro_{c|p} ) have a negative
effect on long-term sustained activity. However, for non-code
contributors, their average number of followed developers
(#following_n ) has a positive effect. This indicates that the
divergent attention of core and peripheral developers may
limit their effort and willingness in one single project, harm-
ing its sustainability. However, participation (discussions in
issues, iss_comment_n ) of such non-code contributors instead
carries a positive effect, maybe because those with a broad
interest can provide interesting and helpful suggestions.
To summarize, early participation from non-code contributors
and a large and steady coding effort has positive effects on project
sustainability, while too many early issues, commit discussions, and
divergent attention of code contributors can carry negative effects.
Capacity of Participants. We report the effect of variables in
the two sub-dimensions as in Section 3.2.
CP1General OSS Experience: We find that the number of previ-
ous commits and issues ( #cmt_all_{c|p|n} ,#issue_all_{c|
p|n} ) on GitHub generally has a positive effect on long-term
sustainability, as it measures prior OSS development expe-
riences. However, the number of previous PRs on GitHub
(#pr_all_{c|p|n} ) has a negative effect. This may be because
PRs are often submitted to external projects and thus, indicate
the developers’ capacity is distributed among many projects.
Furthermore, we find that the number of owned projects
(#pro_{c|p|n} ) has a large negative effect for all three types
of participants, while the number of owned projects with
one-year or two-year sustained activity ( #pro_oneyear{c|p} ,ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA Wenxin Xiao, Hao He, Weiwei Xu, Yuxia Zhang, and Minghui Zhou

#pro_twoyear{c|p} ) has a large positive effect for code con-
tributors. This indicates that prior experience in incubating
long-term sustainable projects is a key indicator of code con-
tributors’ capacity in sustaining an OSS project, but their
capacity does not help if distributed among too many projects.
Also, owning too many OSS projects may imply one’s haphaz-
ardness in creating projects that are often abandoned rapidly.
CP2Popularity: As expected, the number of followers ( #follower_
{c|p|n} ) has a large positive effect on long-term sustained
activity for all three types of participants, as a developer’s
popularity among other GitHub developers is a good indicator
of their ability to develop useful or interesting projects.
To summarize, we show that participants’ prior OSS experience
in coding and incubating long-term sustainable projects, and their
popularity among other developers, are positive indicators of their
capacity in fostering long-term sustainability.
Opportunity of Contribution. The opportunity of contribu-
tion, as measured by the ratio of open issues ( iss_open_ratio ) and
the number of lines of CONTRIBUTING file ( #line_contributing ),
has a positive effect on long-term sustained activity. One possible
explanation is that projects with higher open issue ratios have a
better chance of attracting new contributions. Besides, more de-
tailed contribution guidelines can reduce barriers for newcomers
to contribute. However, more open issues and GFIs ( #iss_open ,
#GFI ) are usually accompanied by more issues, both of which have
a negative effect on sustainability activities.
Control Variables. Consistent with previous findings [ 52,80],
we find that organizational projects are more likely to have long-
term sustained activity. Among other control variables, the number
of project members ( #member ) and the ratio of participants show-
ing their affiliated companies/institutions on their overview page
(show_comp_{c|p|n} ) have a positive effect, while the number of
stars ( #star ) and the number of forks ( #fork ) have a negative effect;
the number of organizations ( #org_{c|p|n} ) has a mixed effect for
participants. Our interpretation is that the positive factors often sig-
nal a larger development team (e.g., hosted under an organization,
members, affiliations), so they are more likely to sustain. However,
early stars, forks, and the number of GitHub organizations do not
serve as an indicator of initial projects’ future sustained activity.
As the largest effect size (0.87) comes from the type variable, we
are interested in whether the effects of variables differ between
projects owned by organizational and individual accounts. For each
variable, we divide projects by type and separately investigate the
differences between the positive group and the negative group. Af-
ter an investigation, we find that the most significant differences
come from the variables in Stability of Effort (i.e., cmt_dev_std ),
Cumulative Effort Amount (i.e., #cmt_p ), and General OSS Experi-
ence (i.e., #issue_all_c and#pro_oneyear_c ), as shown in Figure 2.
Compared with individual projects, higher cmt_dev_std is required
to have a positive effect on the sustained activity of organizational
projects. This indicates that sustainable organizational projects
generally require not only concentrated contributions from core de-
velopers, but also commitments from peripheral developers. Besides,
organizational projects have a larger #cmt_p in the group where it
has a positive effect, indicating that organizational projects may
require more commits from peripheral developers to demonstrate
their likelihood of being sustainable. On the other hand, sustainable

(red) and positive (green) groups for projects owned by orga-
nization accounts and individual accounts, respectively.
organizational projects generally require more OSS experience (i.e.,
higher #issue_all_c and#pro_oneyear_c ) from core developers.
Summary for RQ2:
We find that the following early participation factors promote
long-term project sustained activity:
•Willingness: Steady attention and commitment from de-
velopers; participation from non-code contributors.
•Capacity: Rich OSS experience, experience in sustaining
OSS projects, and many followers of the code contributors.
•Opportunity: A high ratio of open issues; detailed contri-
bution documentation.
To be sustainable, organizational projects require more experi-
enced core developers and more active peripheral developers
compared to individual projects.
5 DISCUSSION
5.1 Comparing Findings with Prior Work
As already mentioned in Section 2, our work takes a unique per-
spective, which is different from all prior work to the best of our
knowledge. However, due to similarities in operationalization, our
study has yielded some overlapping findings with prior work.
In terms of participant willingness, we identify the willingness in
code contributions (measured by the average number of commits in
each participant group) as a positive factor. This finding extends the
results of Yin et al. [ 90] and Stănciulescu et al. [ 70] showing the to-
tal effort of development (measured by the number of commits) as a
positive factor. However, operationalizing development effort with
the number of commits could be problematic in mature projects in
which merging large contributions into a single commit is a better
practice, turning the number of commits as a negative factor [ 80].
The willingness in opening issues is identified as a negative factor,
which is in line with Valiev et al. [ 80] reporting the number of early
issues as a risk factor of Python package activity. Consistent with
the observation of Stănciulescu et al. [ 70], our results also show
that a steady stream of commits ( #cmt_actday ) has a large positive
effect on project long-term sustained activity. For the remaining
participant factors, we are unaware of any prior empirical investi-
gation in the context of OSS project sustainability (e.g., the level of
concentration and experiences of prior OSS incubation).ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA Wenxin Xiao, Hao He, Weiwei Xu, Yuxia Zhang, and Minghui Zhou
For the control variables also investigated in prior work (Table 1),
their effect is also similar, including the presence of an organiza-
tion [ 80], and development team size [ 21,57,66,80,81,90]. We
believe the confirmation of prior findings from our control variables
could be a signal of validity for our methodology.
5.2 Practical Implications
5.2.1 Incubating Sustainable OSS Projects. It is hard to kickstart
an OSS project; it is even harder to incubate an OSS project with
long-term sustainability. Despite the presence of many guidelines
in the grey literature [ 1,4–6], they often do not explicitly mention
the sustainability problem, nor do they provide empirical evidence
supporting the effectiveness of their suggestions on sustainability.
Based on our findings, we discuss some practices that may help the
incubation of sustainable OSS projects.
Stability of Contributions. Our results for Willingness show
that not only the large number of commits ( #cmt_{c|p} ,#pr_{c|p} ,
#cmt_actday ) studied before is important for project sustainabil-
ity [70,90], but also continued investment ( #cmt_day_std ) and
concentration (small #following_{c|p} and #star_pro_{c|p} ) of
code contributors. To maintain stable contributions, we suggest
that initial project maintainers: 1) set clear goals for the project
so that developers clearly know what code contributions they can
make, thus the excessive time and energy spent on the debate after
the code is submitted ( #cmt_comment_{c|p|n} ) can be reduced; 2)
provide positive feedback (e.g., timely and friendly issue responses,
#iss_comment_{c|p|n} ) to other developers to motivate them to
continue contributing; and 3) watch for signs of developer attrition
in advance: a steady decline in contributions ( #cmt_day_std ) and a
shift of interest to other projects ( #pro_{c|p|n} ).
Welcome to Newcomers. Previous studies [ 79,92] point out
that reporting and resolving issues ( iss_open_ratio ) is an effective
way for newcomers to join projects. We further find that issue com-
ments from non-code contributors ( #iss_comment_n ) are positively
related to sustained activity, even if they do not resolve the issue. It
may suggest that commenting on issues is also an appropriate way
for external contributors to interact with the OSS community. Such
interactions can provide feedback to development or lead to future
contributions, and thus should not be ignored by project maintain-
ers. Some projects may overlook the role of contribution documen-
tation in the early stage [ 9,10]. Newcomers may find it difficult
to contribute, and even wonder if the project is actively accepting
new PRs [ 10]. Our results suggest that maintainers should provide
detailed contribution documentation ( #line_contributing ) early
on, which not only lowers the barriers for newcomers to contribute,
but also expresses the attitude of welcoming newcomers.
Competent Team. Different developers have different roles
in a project, and the required effort and experience may vary ac-
cordingly. As far as we know, we are the first to characterize the
requirements of sustainable projects for developers in different
roles. Our results suggest that projects, especially organizational
projects, should pay attention to the retention of experienced core
developers (with higher #issue_all_c ,#pro_oneyear_c ) and active
peripheral contributors (for higher cmt_dev_std ,#cmt_p ).
Activity Management. Previous studies find the positive effect
of making commits and the negative effect of reporting issues on
project sustainability [ 70,80,90]. Our results further demonstratethat direct code contributions ( #cmt_{c|p} ,#pr_{c|p} ) have a pos-
itive effect on sustained activity, while other types of activities
(#issue_{c|p|n} ,#cmt_comment_{c|p|n} ,#iss_event_{c|p|n} ,#
GFI) do not. Developers can engage in a variety of activities on
GitHub projects, however, their energy is limited. Therefore, we
suggest that initial project maintainers should be careful not to
let these “process” activities take up too much time and effort,
since some non-code activities take resources and sometimes slow
down development activities [ 80]. In the initial phase of a project,
it may be more appropriate to focus on “getting things done” (e.g.,
coding and documenting, as measured by #cmt_{c|p} ,#pr_{c|p} ,
#line_contributing ), than to focus on “process” (reflected by #issu
e_{c|p|n} ,#cmt_comment_{c|p|n} ). The latter may introduce un-
necessary overhead and harms the motivation of the early develop-
ment team. Some guidelines suggest labeling good first issues as soon
as the project launches [ 1]. However, only 2.7% of the projects in
our dataset adopted the GFI mechanism in their first three months.
Even in the projects that have adopted it, it may not be as helpful
in attracting high-capacity contributors ( #GFI has a small negative
effect on sustained activity). Further efforts are needed to make it
work to help initial projects actually attract valuable newcomers.
5.2.2 Identifying Potential Sustainable Projects. As open source
grows, it is likely that multiple GitHub projects belong to the same
subfield or provide similar functionality. For newcomers aspiring
to open source development, taking part in a project that will die
on the vine is not only frustrating, but also a waste of time and
energy. For developers deciding whether to use a third-party library,
end users deciding whether to use an OSS application, and compa-
nies/foundations deciding whether to invest in an initial project, it is
also important to identify potential long-term sustainable projects
from a large number of candidates.
Indicators . Based on our results, the following indicators can
be used to recognize potential sustainable projects at their early
stage: 1) the contributors make large (check #cmt_{c|p} ,#pr_{c|p} )
and steady (check #cmt_actday ,#cmt_day_std ,#cmt_front ) code
contributions; 2) the code contributors have focused attention
(check #following_{c|p} ,#star_pro_{c|p} ); 3) the participants
have rich experience in making commits, reporting issues, and in-
cubating long-term sustainable projects (check #cmt_all_{c|p|n} ,
#issue_all_{c|p|n} ,#pro_oneyear_{c|p|n} ,#pro_twoyear_{c|p
}); 4) the participants have many followers ( #follower_{c|p|n} );
5) the project provide a high ratio of open issues ( iss_open_ratio )
and detailed contribution documentation (check #line_contributi
ng); and 6) the project is owned by an organization account (check
type ) and has many members ( #member ). Among the signals, only
#cmt_{c|p} ,#cmt_actday ,type and#member are presented by other
work. Our results also reveal that signals in different contexts may
need to be adjusted, e.g. sustainable organizational projects are
more demanding for developers.
5.2.3 Future Research Directions.
Modeling Tools . Our study suggests the development of tools for
identifying potentially sustainable OSS projects and recommend-
ing interventions for improving the long-term sustainability in
the project’s early stages. Our methodology and results provide
a promising starting point and interesting implications for tool
design. For example, the methodology can be implemented as a
tool to aid judgment. The XGBoost model can predict the futureHow Early Participation Determines Long-Term Sustained Activity in GitHub Projects? ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA
sustainable probability of an initial project, and the interpretable
LIME model can further provide the contribution value of each
variable to the sustainability of the project. Newcomers can use
the XGBoost prediction model to quickly identify potentially sus-
tainable projects from the flood of GitHub projects, while project
maintainers can monitor their projects and learn how to derive
intervention on the projects from the LIME model’s interpretation.
Visualization Tools . Also, the determinants we identified are
often not obvious from the common sources of information, while
those common ones (e.g., the number of stars) are not good in-
dicators of long-term sustained activity. Therefore, it should also
be helpful to have a tool that aggregates and visualizes important
sustainability determinants into a central information panel.
Other Metrics . Apart from the early participation factors that
we have investigated, factors related to software artifact quality
(e.g., code, tests) may also have an important effect on long-term
sustainability. As well-known, high-quality code and tests facili-
tate long-term maintainability, so having them is generally recom-
mended for OSS project launching [ 5,6]. Previous studies have
established correlations between code quality metrics and OSS sus-
tainability [ 39,70]. But how to apply these code-related metrics
to learning and predicting sustainability for a larger number of
projects, and whether there are other code metrics that can predict
project sustainability more efficiently, deserve future investigations.
In addition, projects of different sizes, complexities, and domains
may emphasize different best practices to achieve long-term sustain-
ability. We leave the exploration of this aspect to future research.
Organizations and Companies . Finally, since the presence of
organizations and companies has largely positive effects in our anal-
ysis, we are interested in the underlying mechanisms and the roles
that organizations and companies may play during OSS launching.
This may provide explanations on why early participation from
organizations and companies helps long-term sustained activity.
5.3 Limitations
Correlation and Causation. We applied LIME to explain the con-
tribution of variables to the predicted probability from a non-linear
ML model, where LIME locally fits a linear regression model for each
sample. Similar to regression modeling approaches, this approach
only detects correlations and does not guarantee causality [ 69]. The
correlations we discover in this study can serve as hypotheses for
future studies that aim to establish causality relationships.
Construct Validity. First, our definition of sustained activity
may not cover all cases in which developers consider a project “sus-
tainable”. To mitigate this risk, we ensure that the determinants iden-
tified from our methodology are stable across different sustained
activity definitions (i.e., 𝑡,𝑚and𝑘choices). Second, while most
of the determinants remain stable for one- to four-year sustained
activity (see the results in the replication package), we acknowledge
that several determinants for longer-term sustained activity may
differ, and projects that aim to achieve sustainability over extended
periods may need to adjust some best practices. Third, our dataset
consists of projects with a certain level of activeness and popularity,
which may limit the generalizability of our findings to projects that
do not exhibit clear signals of long-term development interest. How-
ever, it is worth noting that over half (58%) of the projects in our
study failed to achieve sustainability beyond two years (see Table 2).The focus of our research is precisely on these projects that demon-
strate a willingness for long-term development but face challenges.
This mitigates the risk of our results being inapplicable to the target
projects. Fourth, our analysis solely focuses on variables available
on GitHub, which may not comprehensively capture developers’
willingness, capacity, and opportunity. Fifth, our dataset selection
approach may still involve projects with no intention of long-term
sustainability, and we mitigate this risk with aggressive filtering
criteria and a manual evaluation. The final threat comes from the
reliability of GHTorrent, which cannot be considered a full replica
of GitHub according to previous analysis [ 40]. However, for our
study protocol, we believe it is still the best choice and it would be
difficult to sample and collect data using only the GitHub API.
External Validity. Our study only focuses on GitHub projects
and does not consider fork projects. The findings may not gener-
alize to OSS projects hosted elsewhere or OSS projects that are
initiated as a fork of other projects. To mitigate the generalizability
threat to other OSS projects, we carefully selected a large-scale
dataset of top-ranked GitHub projects covering a diverse range of
software domains. Thus, we believe the findings and implications
should be applicable to a broad audience of OSS developers. The
generalizability threat to fork projects falls out of the scope of our
study and future work is needed to investigate sustainable “fork”.
Furthermore, the results and recommendations presented in this
paper are based on a general analysis of variable contributions, and
can be applied to most projects. However, they may vary slightly
for projects with different backgrounds. We suggest that initial
project maintainers seeking project-specific practical suggestions
follow a similar methodology by utilizing our interpretive LIME
model, which leads to more precise and tailored recommendations.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose an XGBoost-based model that uses early
participation factors to predict project’s long-term sustained activ-
ity on a dataset of 290,255 GitHub projects. More specifically, we
measure the willingness, capacity, and opportunity of participants
in the first three months of projects, train an XGBoost model to pre-
dict projects’ two-year sustained activity, and interpret the contribu-
tion of variables to the prediction outcome using LIME. We confirm
that early participation factors can indeed be used for prediction
and a number of determinants are identified from our studied fac-
tors. Our study provides quantitative evidences supporting the
effectiveness of certain practices and strategies on long-term OSS
sustainability, which benefits OSS practitioners. We also provide
insights for identifying potential long-term sustainable projects.
However, the topic of fostering OSS sustainability early is very
broad: other potential factors and their interplays may be missed
by our study and future research is needed for their investigation.
