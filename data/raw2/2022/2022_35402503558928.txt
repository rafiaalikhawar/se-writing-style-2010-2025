ABSTRACT
We introduce TAPHSIR ś a tool for anaphoric ambiguity detection
and anaphora resolution in requirements. TAPHSIR facilities re-
viewing the use of pronouns in a requirements specification and
revisingthosepronounsthatcanleadtomisunderstandingsduring
the development process. To this end, TAPHSIR detects the re-
quirements which have potential anaphoric ambiguity and further
attemptsinterpretinganaphoraoccurrencesautomatically.TAPH-
SIRemploysahybridsolutioncomposedofanambiguitydetection
solution based on machine learning and an anaphora resolution
solution based on a variant of the BERT language model. Given
arequirementsspecification,TAPHSIRdecidesforeachpronoun
occurrence in the specification whether the pronoun is ambiguous
or unambiguous, and further provides an automatic interpretation
forthepronoun.Theoutput generatedbyTAPHSIRcan beeasily
reviewedandvalidatedbyrequirementsengineers.TAPHSIRispub-
licly available on Zenodo( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5902117 ).

The overall success of a project depends to a large extent on the
quality of requirements [ 4,5,10]. In particular, ensuring the pre-
cision and consistency ofrequirements is paramount foravoiding
major development risks such as time and budget overruns, failure
to meet customers’ needs, and systems that are not trustworthy.
The requirements quality challenge is exacerbated by the fact that
requirements are often written in natural language [ 17]. Although
natural language facilitates communication among different stake-
holders, textual requirements are highly prone to ambiguity. At an
earlystageofsoftwaredevelopment,requirementsengineersspend
considerabletimeandeffortinspectingrequirementsspecifications
(RSs) to identify various quality issues such as incompleteness,
inconsistency and ambiguity. Doing such inspections entirely man-
uallyisnotonlytime-consumingbutcanalsobeerror-prone,since
engineers may overlook unacknowledged ambiguity . Ambiguity
isunacknowledgedwhendifferentindividualshavedivergingin-
terpretations for the same requirement, and yet, each individual
isconfidentabouttheirowninterpretation.Insuchcases,there-
quirementfromtheperspectiveofeachindividualisregardedas
unambiguousandthusnotflaggedforfurtherdiscussion.Compared
to acknowledged ambiguity that is often discussed and resolved
duringinspectionsessions,unacknowledgedambiguitymaypropa-
gate to later stages of development and lead to serious problems
due tounconscious misunderstandings.
Inthispaper,weproposethetool TAPHSIR,standingfor Towards
Anaphoric Ambiguity Detection and Re solutioninRequirements.
InArabic,TAPHSIRmeansłinterpretationž.TAPHSIRfocuseson
pronominal anaphoric ambiguity, an ambiguity type that has been
explored only to a limited extent in requirements engineering
(RE) [6,22]. There are noexisting tools in RE to handle anaphoric
ambiguity, although thistype of ambiguity is prevalent in NLre-
quirements: it is estimated that up to 20% of industrial require-
mentsmaysufferfromanaphoricambiguity[ 6,19].TAPHSIRim-
plements the best solution emerging from our multi-solution study
of anaphoric ambiguity in natural-language requirements, pub-
lished in a technical paper [ 3] at the 44th International Conference
onSoftwareEngineering(ICSE2022).Thisbestsolutionisahybrid
one, where feature-based machine learning (ML) is used for detect-
ing anaphoric ambiguity and a large-scale language model (LM)
fromthe BERT family is usedforanaphoraresolution.

consider the example in Figure 1. The figure shows a requirements
engineer reviewing the requirements in the file łmyRS.txtž and
using TAPHSIR for automated analysis of pronominal anaphora in
thatRS.ThepronounłthemžinR2containsanaphoricambiguity

TAPHSIR defines a contextfor each pronoun occurrence. This con-
text iscomposed oftherequirement inwhichthepronounoccurs
and the preceding requirement. Within this context, the tool iden-

In the remainder of this tool demonstration paper, we outline
TAPHSIR’s main components. We further discuss through the lens
of unacknowledged ambiguity the evaluation of TAPHSIR on a
manually curateddataset ( DAMIR[3]).
2 TOOL ARCHITECTURE

empirical examination of several alternative solutions [ 3]. Figure2
shows an overview of TAPHSIR architecture. The tool is imple-
mented in Python 3.8 [ 20]. Below, we discuss an end-to-endappli-
cation ofthe toolgoing throughsteps 1ś7of Figure 2.

downloads en_core_web_sm whichisneededforoperationalizing
the natural language processing pipeline in SpaCy. To be able to
applythetool,theuserfurtherneedstoensurethattheinputfile
is in the right format. TAPHSIR expects as input a text file (with
the extension *.txt) containing a set of requirements (or sentences).
2.2 Reader
This step parses the text of the input requirements specification,
preprocesses it using an NLP pipeline, and identifies the require-
ments that should be subject to anaphoric ambiguity analysis. The
NLP pipeline consists of the following seven modules illustrated in
Figure2: (i) tokenizer splits the input text into tokens, (ii) sentence
splitterdemarcatesthesentencesinthetext,(iii)part-of-speechtag-
ger(POS)assignsaPOStagforeachtoken,(iv)lemmatizeridentifies

structural units of sentences, (vi) dependency parser defines the
grammaticaldependenciesbetweenthetokensinsentences,and
(vii) semantic parser extractsinformation aboutwords’ meanings.
The output of this step is a set of triples, each of which includes

In Figure 1, there are three possible antecedents as discussed in

employanensembleMLclassifierthatcombinestheresultsofaclas-
sifiertrainedoverlanguagefeatures( 𝑀𝐿𝐿𝐹)andanothertrained
over feature embeddings ( 𝑀𝐿𝐹𝐸). For training and applying ML
classifiers, we use Scikit-learn 0.24.1 [ 16]. This component takes as
inputasetoftriplesassociatedwithonethepronounoccurrence
fromthepreviousstep,andderivesasoutputafinallabelforthat
pronoun (ambiguous orunambiguous).
2.3 Language FeaturesExtraction
This step extracts the different sets of learning features. In our
work,wecollectedasetof45languagefeatures(LFs)fromtheNLP
and RE literature. These features capture the characteristics of the
relationship between the pronoun and its likely antecedent, e.g.,
both agree in gender or number. For extracting LFs, we use SpaCy
3.0.5 [7], NLTK 3.5 [ 11], Stanza 1.2 [ 18], and CoreNLP 4.2.2 [ 12].
The result of this step is a vector representing each input triple,
whereeachentryinthisvectoristheresultofcomputinganLF.For
theexampleinFigure 1,wewillgeneratethreevectorsrepresenting
the LFs ofthe pronoun łthemž andeachofits likely antecedents.
2.4 ExtractionofFeaturesEmbeddings
Thisstepextractsthefeatureembeddings(FEs)foreachinputtriple.
FEs are mathematical vectors that encapsulate the semantic and
syntacticregularitiesofthesentence[ 9].Inourwork,weextract
768dimensionalFEsfromtheBERTlanguagemodel[ 2].Forthat,
we use the Transformers library, particularly the bert-base-cased
model. Similar to the previous step, the output of this step is a
vector representing each input triple. In a similar manner, this step
results inthree vectors for the example inFigure 1.
2.5 Classification
In thisstep,we pass thevectorrepresentation ofeachinputtriple
totwopre-trainedclassifiers,namely 𝑀𝐿𝐿𝐹thatistrainedoverLFs,
and𝑀𝐿𝐹𝐸trainedoverFEs.Foreachtriple,thetwoclassifiersinde-
pendentlypredictalabelasfollows: correct(conversely, incorrect)
indicating that the antecedent refers (conversely, does not refer) to
thepronoun,or inconclusive whentheanaphoricrelationcannotbe inferred. We then apply a set of rules on the predicted labels
for the triples associated with one pronoun occurrenceto conclude
whether the pronoun is deemed ambiguous or unambiguous by
each of the two classifiers. The rules, presented in the RE litera-
ture[22],considerthepredictionprobabilitiesproducedforeach
possible antecedent.
Finally,wecombineinanensemblemannertheresultsofthetwo
classifiers 𝑀𝐿𝐿𝐹and𝑀𝐿𝐹𝐸toderivethefinallabelforthepronoun
(i.e., ambiguous or unambiguous). If the two classifiers agree on
the label (e.g., both conclude that the pronoun is ambiguous), then
this label will be the final one for that pronoun. Otherwise, the
label withthehighestprediction probability willbe selected.This
ensemble learningmethodyieldsamore accurateprediction.
SpanBERT-based Anaphora Resolution. Based on the empir-
ical findings in our earlier work [ 3], we know that for the task
of anaphora resolution, the SpanBERT language model [ 8] out-
performs alternatives. Consequently, the resolution component in
TAPHSIRusesaSpanBERTmodelthatisfine-tunedonacurated
datasetfromrequirements.Thedatasetwillbediscussedinthenext
section. We implement SpanBERT using the Transformers 4.6.1 li-
brary [21] provided by Hugging Face ( https://huggingface.co/ ) and
operatedinPyTorch[ 15].Thismodeltakesasinput,fromthetriples
generated in the first step, only the pronoun and the context in
which it occurs (i.e., disregards the likely antecedents). As Span-
BERTisoriginallytrainedtoextracttextspans,SpanBERTinour
workpredictsasoutputthelikelyantecedentforthepronounfrom

Given an input RS, the output of our tool is a csv file listing all
pronoun occurrences in the input, and for each occurrence, provid-

3 EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate how accurately TAPHSIR can detect
unacknowledgedcasesofanaphoric ambiguityandbringthemto
the attention ofthe requirements engineer.
3.1 DatasetDescription
In this section, we use the curated dataset DAMIR(standing for
DatasetforAnaphoricAmbiguityInRequirements)[ 3].Wecurated
thisdatasetwiththehelpoftwothird-partyannotatorswhounder-
went half-day training on ambiguity in requirements. We collected
22industrialrequirementsspecificationscoveringeightdomains
including satellite communications, medicine, aerospace, security,
digitization,automotive,railway,anddefence.
Wepreprocessedthiscollectionandpreparedthelistoftriples
(a context, a pronoun occurrence and a possible antecedent) as
explained in Section 2. The possible antecedents for a pronoun
includeallofthenounphrasesprecedingthatpronoun[ 13].The
annotators then examined each pronoun occurrence and its pos-
sibleantecedentconsideringthecontext inwhichtheyoccur,and
assigned a label correct,incorrect, orinconclusive with the same
indicationsasexplainedinSection 2.Wethenpost-processedthe
annotations and grouped them per pronoun occurrence as follows.
We mark a pronoun as ambiguous in two cases: (i) if at least one
annotator acknowledges the ambiguity of this pronoun by labeling
one or more associated triples as inconclusive ; or (ii) if the same
tripleassociatedwiththispronounreceivesdifferentlabelsfrom
thetwo annotators(e.g., correctversusincorrect). The formercase
impliesacknowledgedambiguity,andthelatterimpliesunacknowl-
edgedambiguity.
Asaresult, DAMIRdatasetcontainsatotalof737pronounoc-
currences that are analyzed for anaphoric ambiguity. About 46%
of these pronouns (342/737) are deemed ambiguous by the anno-
tators. Out of the ambiguous pronouns, we identified ≈87% with
unacknowledgedambiguity,i.e.,theannotatorsassumedthatthe
pronounisunambiguousyethadtwodifferentinterpretationsfor
that pronoun.
3.2 Results andAnalysis
ToassesshowTAPHSIRperformsindetectingunacknowledgedam-
biguity, we run TAPHSIR (depicted in Figure 2) onDAMIRdataset.TAPHSIR applies the an ensemble ML classifier for detecting
ambiguityandSpanBERTforresolvinganaphoraasdiscussedin
Section2.OnDAMIRdataset,TAPHSIRdetectsambiguouscases
with a perfect recall of 100% with a precision of ≈60%, while rec-
ommends automated resolution with an accuracy of ≈96% [3]. The
perfect recall implies that TAPHSIR detects all unacknowledged
ambiguous cases that were not explicitly marked by the human
annotators as ambiguous.
Theprecisionvalueindicatesthattherequirementsengineerwill
investsomemanualeffortfilteringoutfalsepositives,i.e.,falsely
detectedambiguousrequirements.Inthecontextofambiguityin
RE, recallis oftenfavoredoverprecision[ 1]. Achieving 100%recall
ensuresthatallrequirementssufferingfromallpotentiallyambigu-
ous requirements will be brought to the attention of the engineers
andfurther discussedat an early stage.
In a practical scenario where requirements engineers review
requirements undertime pressure, only therequirements that are
found problematic by at least one engineer would be thoroughly
discussed. The engineers might not discuss those requirements
which they could confidently interpret unaware of having multiple
inconsistent interpretations.In conclusion, we believethat TAPH-
SIRhasapotentialinpracticesinceitperfectlydetectsalsothose

4 CONCLUSION
We presented TAPHSIR ś a tool for detecting anaphoric ambiguity
and resolving anaphora in natural-language requirements. Our
current implementation reflects our findings in a multi-solution
study[3]. TAPHSIR combines solutions basedon machine learning
andlanguagemodels.WefurtherevaluatedhowwellTAPHSIRcan
