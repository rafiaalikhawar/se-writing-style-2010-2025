ABSTRACT
The availability of open source projects on platforms like GitHub
has led to the wide use of the artifacts from these projects in soft-
ware engineering research. These publicly available artifacts have
been used to train artificial intelligence models used in various
empirical studies and the development of tools. However, these ad-
vancements have missed out on the artifacts from non-open source
projects due to the unavailability of the data. A major cause for
the unavailability of the data from non-open source repositories
is the issue concerning data privacy. In this paper, we propose
using federated learning to address the issue of data privacy to
enable the use of data from non-open source to train AI models
used in software engineering research. We believe that this can
potentially enable industries to collaborate with software engineer-
ing researchers without concerns about privacy. We present the
preliminary evaluation of the use of federated learning to train a
classifier to label bug-fix commits from an existing study to demon-
strate its feasibility. The federated approach achieved an F1 score
of 0.83 compared to a score of 0.84 using the centralized approach.
We also present our vision of the potential implications of the use
of federated learning in software engineering research.

1 INTRODUCTION
Open-source repository mining is one of the most important sources
of data for software engineering research. A platform like GitHub
has over 200 million repositories as of April 2022, with over 44
million being public. The artifacts such as source code, discussion
forums, pull requests, and so on from GitHub projects have been
used in a wide variety of research in the domain of software engi-
neering [3–5, 17, 20].
Due to the availability of huge amounts of data, AI techniques
are being applied to the data to arrive at insights about the projects,
the developers, and their behaviour and also in building AI based
tools that are aimed at helping the developers [ 14,23,29]. The
availability of huge data has also introduced the scope for the devel-
opment of AI tools aimed at helping the developers by automating
some of the tasks of the software development process, thereby
enabling them to make intelligent decisions and increasing their
efficiency [ 22,23,29,32]. Examples include automated identifica-
tion of non-functional requirements [ 6,29], effort estimation [ 23],
classification of issue reports [ 22], automatic tagging of pull re-
quests [ 14], clone detection [ 32] etc. In addition, machine learning
models have also been used in large-scale empirical studies based
on GitHub artifacts [ 10,24,25]. While these AI models have been
used in tool development and empirical studies, the data used to
train these models largely comes from open-source repositories.
Due to various restrictions, the data from non-open source projects
that include private GitHub repositories and proprietary software
projects by various organizations cannot be used for training.
This lack of access to non-open source repositories prevents the
researchers from leveraging a large amount of non-open source
data for software engineering research. Several factors contribute
to the unavailability of the data from non-open source reposito-
ries. Platforms such as GitHub do not provide access to the data
from private repositories. The projects involving the development
of proprietary software developed by various companies are also
reluctant to share the data from their software projects due to the
issues concerning the mindset of the industry, trust, confidentiality,
and intellectual property concerns [18, 27].
Collaborations between the industry and the researchers can
help overcome this issue to an extent. However, several factors
can hamper the prospects of such collaborations [ 18,27,34]. The
concept of technology transfer discourages researchers that are
1610
ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore Shriram Shanbhag and Sridhar Chimalakonda
focused on knowledge exchange from having collaborations with
the industry [ 34]. The collaborations are generally backed by con-
tracts with several terms and conditions [ 18]. The long-term goals
of the research often do not align with the short-term goals of the
industry [ 27], which introduces an additional impediment to start-
ing a collaboration. Even with collaboration, access to sufficient
data is an issue due to confidentiality, and the terms of the contract
[12]. It must be pointed out that software engineering research
collaborations do exist between academia and the industry. But
largely remain restricted to a few software companies [ 1,9,33]
such as Google, Microsoft, Meta, etc.
Missing out on the data from non-open source projects and
private repositories on GitHub has major downsides in software
engineering research. The research based on GitHub data misses
out on a majority of the GitHub repositories as only around 44 mil-
lion1of the over 200 million repositories on GitHub are public. The
results obtained from open source projects may not generalize well
for industry projects. Many factors such as geography, organization
factors, project characteristics, etc. influence software development
[13]. As an example, Fendler found that the software engineering
practices recommended for the western world did not fit well in the
African context in Namibia [ 8] demonstrating how geographic and
cultural factors influence software development. The type of organi-
zation also influences software development practices. For instance,
startups typically run on tight budgets, high uncertainty, lack of
resources, etc. [ 30] would have different practices and strategies
compared to a large organization with adequate budget, resources,
and teams. Research merely based on the data from publicly avail-
able projects may not be able to reflect these nuances. From the
industry perspective, it may be more desirable for them to have the
results that would include the data from their projects along with
the open source. A scenario where several companies can collab-
oratively use their data to support software engineering research
may generate better results and insights.
In this paper, we present the idea of leveraging federated learning
[19] to use the data from non-open source software projects in
software engineering research.
Our vision is to tap the potential of the largely under-
explored software artifacts and data available in non-open
source context to
➺Incorporate non-open source data in existing soft-
ware engineering research to gain insights that may
either confirm or contradict existing results.
➺Improve existing AI tools developed using models
trained by only using open-source data.
2 FEDERATED LEARNING
Federated learning [ 19] is an approach of distributed machine learn-
ing that enables training on decentralized data spread across devices.
In non-distributed machine learning approaches, the data from dif-
ferent devices is aggregated on a central server and is used for
training the model. In federated learning, however, the model from
a central server is shipped to the device, trained locally, and the
1https://web.archive.org/web/20220320121942/https://github.com/search?q=is:publicupdated model parameters are sent back to the central server. The
updated parameters from different devices are used to update the
model in the server using an appropriate aggregation algorithm.
Since federated learning brings the model over to the device instead
of sending the data over to the server, the data never leaves the
device. Thus it addresses the issues with data privacy and data
ownership to an extent. The potential implications of this have also
led the researchers to study the software development life cycle of
the federated learning systems [ 16]. The earliest use of federated
learning was its application in Google keyboard to collaboratively
learn from different devices running the Android operating system
[11]. Federated learning is being applied to areas where data privacy
is critical such as healthcare [ 26], banking [ 28], smart homes [ 36]
etc. However, the application of federated learning in software engi-
neering largely remains unexplored. Although Wang et al. [ 31] have
explored the use of federated learning for heterogeneous defect
prediction, their primary focus has been on model improvement,
motivating the need for our work.
Since data privacy and confidentiality are a major concern of
the non-open source projects, we see great potential for the use of
federated learning in software engineering research.
3 PRELIMINARY EVALUATION
In this section, we present a preliminary evaluation of the use of
federated learning to train a machine learning model using the data
from software repositories. The goal of our evaluation is to find
out whether the use of federated learning in a model with the data
from software repositories lets us achieve a performance similar to
centralized learning. We evaluated the use of federated learning to
train a model to classify the commits as "bug-fix" commit or not as
proposed by Zafar et al. [ 35] on the dataset shared by the authors.
We first give a brief description of the work by Zafar et al. [ 35], and
then we explain our federated learning approach.
Zafar et al. [ 35] proposed the use of deep neural networks model
called BERT to automatically label commit messages with high
accuracy. They focused on labeling classifying commit messages
as “bug-fix” commit or not. In the paper, the authors proposed the
use of BERT, that can understand the context of commit messages.
They first proposed rules for semantic interpretation of commit
comments. Using the rules, the authors labeled a dataset of 2155
commit messages as bug-fix and non bug-fix commits. The authors
then used this dataset to build a commit classification model by
fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model. The model achieved a
significant improvement over existing approaches with an accuracy
of 92.2% on the test set.
Figure 1 describes the federated learning approach we used to
train and evaluate the commit classification model. We split the
training dataset provided by Zafar et al. [ 35] into 3 smaller datasets
D1,D2andD3. The number of data points in D1,D2andD3were
1000, 500 and 332 respectively. These datasets in our evaluation
could be considered equivalent to the datasets from private reposi-
tories used to train the models locally. We choose to split the data
unevenly to simulate the likely scenario of different repositories
holding different amounts of data.
The architecture of the model we used is the same as described
by Zafar et al. [ 35] in their paper. We used the BERT uncased model
1611Exploring the Under-Explored Terrain of Non-open Source Data for Software Engineering ... ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore
Figure 1: Federated learning approach we used to train and evaluate the commit classification model. The datasets D1,D2and
D3represent the private repositories
with 12 transformer layers, 12 attention heads, and a hidden layer
size of 768. We added an additional dense layer containing a single
neuron with a sigmoid activation function. We set the learning rate
and maximum sequence lengths to 2e-5 and 512 tokens, respectively,
as mentioned in the original work [ 35]. We call this model the
central model depicted by M1.
We created 3 copies of the model and trained them on the datasets
D1,D2andD3. This can be thought of as sending the model to the
private repositories and training them with the private data. The
batch size of the training data was set to 8, and the models were
trained for 3 epochs as described by Zafar et al. [ 35]. The commit
messages did not have to be pre-processed as BERT already has
a word level tokenizer. The updated parameters of each of these
models, U1,U2, and U3after training was aggregated using the
federated averaging algorithm. This is equivalent to sending the
updated weights from each of the repositories to the central server
for aggregation. The resultant weights from the aggregation were
loaded into the central model to form the updated model M2.
The Federated averaging algorithm used for aggregation was
proposed in a paper by McMahan et al. [ 19] where the method was
experimentally shown to efficiently train high quality models while
minimizing the number of rounds of communication. The equation
to aggregate local models using the federated averaging algorithm
is shown below.

Here, 𝑤𝑡+1represents the parameters of the central model, 𝑤𝑘𝑡+1
represents the parameters of the updated local model from the client
k. The parameters of the local model at the client is scaled based on
the proportion of the data points held by the client. The fraction
𝑛𝑘
𝑛in the equation accounts for this scaling.4 RESULTS
We evaluated the performance of our model trained using federated
learning on a test dataset provided by Zafar et al. [ 35]. The test
dataset consisted of 324 labeled commit messages. The authors
reported the accuracy of the model as 92.2% on their test set. As no
code for replication of their work was shared in the paper, we imple-
mented the model ourselves using the instructions provided in the
paper. Considering the issues with reproducibility of deep learning
models [ 15], to ensure a fair comparison of the performance of the
federated learning approach, we also trained the model we built in
a centralized approach on all of the training data and evaluated its
performance.
The results of the models trained using the centralized and feder-
ated approaches are summarized in Table 1. The original work [ 35]
had achieved true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives
(FP), and false negatives (FN) of 97, 202, 15, and 10, respectively.
However, the model we trained in the centralized mode was able
to achieve TP, TN, FP, and FN values of 86, 206, 11, and 21, respec-
tively. The accuracy of the centralized approach was 90.1%, with
an F1 score of 0.84. The difference in the accuracy values could be
because of various factors such as framework, hardware, library
versions, etc. that are known to influence the reproducibility [ 7] in
deep learning models. The model trained in the federated approach
was able to achieve TP, TN, FP, and FN values of 90, 197, 20, and 17,
respectively, with an accuracy of 88.6%. The F1 score was 0.83.
To summarize, the federated approach where the central
model did not ever see the data, was able to achieve a
performance ( accuracy=88.6%, F1-score=0.83 ) close to the
centralized approach ( accuracy=90.1%, F1-score=0.84 ).
Although the performance of the federated approach is slightly
lower than the centralized approach, we believe that the results
are promising enough for further exploration as federated learning
provides several advantages concerning privacy preservation.

5 IMPLICATIONS
Majority of the research on software engineering today is based on
open source data. One of the major impediments to the use of non-
open source data is the data privacy concerns of the organizations
that own them. It is here that we envision the use of federated
learning to address this challenge in software engineering research.
Few of the potential implications of this include:
•The use of federated learning could enable different compa-
nies to collaboratively use their data to support research that
could help improve software development and maintenance.
Currently, this is being done by a select few companies such
as Google, Microsoft, Meta, etc. We see a potential for simi-
lar collaborations from companies across geographies, scale,
and domains to cater to their needs. As an example, the in-
formation technology services companies based out of India
could use data from thousands of their internal projects to
contribute to the research aimed at improving the software
engineering practices in the context of Indian IT services.
•The AI tools developed to solve problems in the software
development domain trained using open source data could
incorporate the data from non-open source domains. Given
the drastic variation in practices between open-source and
industry projects, this could enhance the usefulness of the
tools for the developers in the industry. As an example, a tool
like GitHub Copilot2could be further improved using the
data from private repositories owned by private companies.
This could enhance its utility and quality as the tool would
also learn practices followed in the industry.
•We envision the emergence of the area of "privacy-preserving
software engineering research" with the mechanisms estab-
lished for the private entities to grant the use of their data for
the research. The mechanisms could also be designed to ad-
dress many of the quirks currently associated with industry
research collaborations.
•Replication of existing work with non-open source data
could lead to novel insights that may confirm or challenge
existing results in software engineering research.
•The global nature of open source software development
makes it harder to perform organization and geography-
specific research by mining software repositories. This could
become easier to an extent as non-open source data becomes
available for use.
In summary, we envision a new line of research that integrates
and leverages open and non-open source data, and a wide spectrum
of AI tools for software engineering designed for multiple contexts
such as different geographies, organizations, cultures and domains.

In this paper, we proposed the idea of using the federated learning
approach to utilize the data from industrial and non-open source
projects in software engineering research. However, to get to the
point where researchers could use non-open source data, many
issues/questions require research.
While federated learning approach could protect the privacy of
the organization’s data, connecting to a central server to send/re-
ceive the model would require some kind of trust to be established
between the researcher and the organization. Establishing con-
nections to a third-party server could pose a security issue. Even
communicating the model updates could possibly reveal sensitive
information [ 21]. Even if federated learning could address the issue
of data privacy, other challenges exist in research industry collabo-
rations. As the data comes from multiple sources, it may not always
be in a format required for training the model. A key challenge
would also include establishing the mechanisms to get the data in
a format required for training at the source.
The data from the clients is never sent to the server, which
ensures data privacy. However, the clients get permission to up-
date the model parameters. This leaves a loophole for malicious
clients to the system to perform model poisoning attack [2]. Mali-
cious clients or clients with low-quality data may negatively affect
the model built using the federated process. Another challenge
would be dealing with the statistical heterogeneity of the data.
Since organizations and software development teams have varying
practices influenced by many factors [ 13], the data may be highly
non-identically distributed. This may add additional complexity.
Federated learning requires frequent transmission of the machine
learning model parameters between the clients and the central
server. The use of large deep learning models with large gradient
vectors resulting from training updates of each client could make
communication very expensive.
7 CONCLUSION
Driven by the need to explore non-open source data, we envisioned
the use of federated learning to enable the use of non-open source
artifacts in software engineering research. We believe that it ad-
dresses a major concern of data privacy that prevents organizations
from granting access to their data for research purposes. We per-
formed a preliminary evaluation of the approach on an existing
study of classifying bug-fix commits using the federated approach,
achieving an F1 score of 0.83 compared to the score of 0.84 from
the centralized approach. Furthermore, we presented the possible
implications of our work, which include the evolution of novel AI
tools based on open and non-open source data and the emergence
of areas such as context-specific and privacy-preserving software
engineering research.
