ABSTRACT
We introduce WikiDoMiner ś a tool for automatically generat-
ing domain-specific corpora by crawling Wikipedia. WikiDoMiner
helps requirements engineers create an external knowledge re-
source that is specific to the underlying domain of a given require-
ments specification (RS). Being able to build such a resource is
important since domain-specific datasets are scarce. WikiDoMiner
generates a corpusby first extracting aset of domain-specific key-
words from a given RS, and then querying Wikipedia for these
keywords. The output of WikiDoMiner is a set of Wikipedia ar-
ticles relevant to the domain of the input RS. Mining Wikipedia
for domain-specific knowledge can be beneficial for multiple re-
quirements engineering tasks, e.g., ambiguity handling, require-
ments classification, and question answering. WikiDoMiner is pub-
licly available on Zenodo under an open-source license ( https:

IntherecentREliterature,thereisanincreasingrelianceonnatu-

to the rapidly emerging research area of NLP4RE [ 19]. Meanwhile,
NLP is shifting towards the application of large-scale language
models,e.g.,BERT[ 3],forsolvingdownstreamNLPtaskssuchas
question answering, natural language inference, and paraphras-
ing [17]. Language models are often pre-trained on large bodies of
generictext.Forinstance,theoriginalBERTmodelispre-trainedon
the entire (English) Wikipedia and the BookCorpus. This way, pre-
trainedlanguagemodelswouldlearnaboutwordco-occurrencesas
well as syntactic and semantic regularities in passages. Pre-trained
language modelscanthenbe fine-tunedfor solvingdownstream
tasks.Fine-tuningistheprocessofexposingapre-trainedmodel

Due to this evolutionary development in NLP, many NLP4RE
solutions ś even some of the most recent ones ś need to be re-
examined and revamped to fit the new technological trend. The
reason is not only to improve the accuracy of the existing NLP4RE
solutions,butalsotoavoidrelyingonNLPlibrariesthatwillsoonbe
outdated, in turn leadingtomaintenance headaches andupgrading
difficulties.Anotheressentialaspectthatislikelytoimpactthecur-
rentNLP4REliteratureisreusability.Thecurrentimplementation

2 TOOL ARCHITECTURE
WikiDoMiner is a usable prototype tool for generating domain-
specificcorpora.Figure 1showsanoverviewofWikiDoMinerar-
chitecture. The tool is implemented in Python 3.7.13 [ 16] using
Google Colab1. Below, we discuss the different steps of the tool
markedA śC inFigure 1.
2.1 PreprocessText
Inthefirststep,weparsethetextualcontentoftheinputRSand
preprocess the text. To do so, we apply an NLP pipeline composed
ofsixmodules,fourofwhicharerelatedtoparsingandnormaliz-
ingthetext,andtwoareforperformingsyntacticparsing.These
modules include: A tokenizer splits the text into different tokens
(e.g., commas and words), sentence spitter identifies the boundaries
of sentences in the running text (e.g., a sentence in English can
end with a period), lemmatizer findsthe canonicalformofa word
(e.g.,thesingularwordłcommunicationžisthecanonicalformof
its plural variant łcommunicationsž and the infinitive łtransmitž
isthecanonicalformfor itspast-tense variant łtransmittedž),and
finally, a stopwords removal module removes the stopwords such
as articles (łthež) and prepositions (e.g., łinž). To perform syntactic
analysis,wefurtherapply: POStagger thatassignsapart-of-speech
tag for each token (e.g., the tag VBD is assigned to łtransmittedž
indicatingapast-tenseverb),anda syntacticparser thatidentifies
the syntactic units in the text (e.g., łthe notification servicež is a
noun phraseśNP).
TooperationalizetheNLPpipeline,weusetheTokenizer,Porter
StemmerandWordNetLemmatizeravailableinNLTK3.2.5[ 12].We
furtherapplyPythonRE2.2.1regexlibrary2,inadditiontoavailable
modulesinSpaCy3.3.0[ 10]includingtheEnglishstopwordslist,
Tokenizer, NP Chunker, Dependency Parser, and Entity Recognizer.
2.2 Extract Keywords
Inthisstep,weextractasetofkeywordsthatarerepresentativefor
the underlying domain. To do that, we adapt a glossary extraction
methodfromtheREliterature[ 2].Thebasicideainthisstepisto
collectthenounphrasesintheinputRS,andsortthemaccordingto
their frequency of use. To ensure that these keywords are domain-
specific,WikiDoMinerappliestwomeasures.First,weremovefrom
the list any keyword that is available in WordNet [ 6,14], which
isagenericlexicaldatabaseforEnglish.Theintuitionofthisstep
is to remove very common words that are not representative of
the underlying domain. For instance, the word łroverž exists in
WordNet3as a noun referring to łsomeone who leads a wandering
unsettled lifež orłan adultmemberofthe Boy Scouts movementž.
These two meanings do not fit the łroverž in the łlunar roverž

o2=&o0=1&o8=1&o1=1&o7=&o5=&o9=&o6=&o3=&o4=&h=context, and the NP łlunar roverž. This way, we filter out the word
łroveržwhenitoccursalone(i.e.,łtheroverž),andkeepitaspartof
theNP(łlunarroverž).WenotethatthetheNPłlunarroveržisnot
available inWordNet, but isinWikipedia4.
Asasecondmeasure,WikiDoMinercomputestermfrequency/in-
verse document frequency (TF/IDF) [ 13] instead of mere frequency.
TF/IDFisatraditionalmethodthatisoftenappliedinthecontext
of information retrieval (IR) to assign a score reflecting the impor-
tance of words to a specific document in a document collection.
In WikiDoMiner, the importance of the words (NPs in our case)
indicates that the words are significant for the underlying domain.
WenotethatIDFiscomputedonlywhentherearemultipledocu-
ments from other domains available. Otherwise the TF/IDF scores
are similar to term frequencies. Once the TF/IDF scores are com-
puted, we sort the keywords in descending order of these scores
and select the top- 𝐾keywords. While the default value applied by
WikiDoMiner is 𝐾=50,we showin the demoof the toolthatthis
parameter can be configured by the user according to the intended
application.
WeimplementthedifferentmodulesusingWordNetfromNLTK
3.2.5[12], andTF-IDF transformation from Scikit-learn1.0.2 [ 15].
2.3 QueryWikipedia
In this step, we use the keywords from the previous set to query
Wikipedia andcollecttherelevantarticleswhich willthenconsti-
tuteour final domain-specific corpus.
To better understand this step, we first explain the structure
of a category in Wikipedia, illustrated in Figure 2. Each article
in Wikipedia belongs to one or more categories. Each category
containsasetofarticlesandsub-categories.Toillustrate,assume
that we are querying Wikipedia for the keyword łrail transportž
within the łRailwayž domain. Our first hit will be a page titled
łRail Transportž5. Note that we refer to a page in Wikipedia as
anarticle. If we view the category structure for this article6, we
find out that it belongs to a category under the same name łRail
Transportž,i.e.,Category AinFigure 2.Inside this category,there
are31sub-categoriessuchasłLocomotivesž,łRailInfrastructurež,
and łElectric rail transportž. Category A contains22 other pages
alongside the above mentioned pages, such as łBi-directional vehi-
cležandłPocket wagonž.Viewing thestructure ofasub-category,
e.g., łRail Infrastructurež will show us again the available pages
andsub-categories.
In WikiDoMiner, the result of querying Wikipedia for a given
keyword is a Wikipedia article whose title partially matches the
keyword.WeconsiderthetitleofaWikipediaarticleaspartially
matchingthekeywordiftheyhavesomeoverlap.Forexample,if
we query Wikipedia for the keyword łEfficiency of rail transportž,
then we will retrieve the same article mentioned above whose title,
łRail Transportž,partiallymatches the keyword.
Foreachkeyword,weretrievefromWikipediaamatchingarticle
if applicable. Some applications might require that the domain-
specific corpus be sufficiently large. For example, to accurately
estimate the frequencies of words co-occurrences, one needs a

largecorpus[ 11].Similarly,topre-trainadomain-specificlanguage
model, a large text body should be available. Therefore, we expand
ourcorpusbydefiningaconfigurableparameter depthtocontrol
the level of expansion, thus allowing the user to adjust the size
and relevance of the corpus based on their needs. The minimal
depthdepth=0can be used to extract directly matching articles
only (leading most often to a few hundred articles). WikiDoMiner
further retrieves, for each matching article, all articles in the same
categoriesfor depth=1(e.g.,thetwootherpagesintheexample
above), subcategories of depth=2, sub-subcategories of depth=3,
andsoon.
Specific details of our implementation are as follows. We use
the Wikipedia 1.4.07and Wikipedia-API 0.5.48libraries to query
Wikipedia.Otherlibrarieswhichweusebutwhicharenotneces-

Inthissubsubsection,weapplyWikiDoMinertoautomaticallygen-
erate domain-specific corpora for two distinct domains, namely,
railway andtransportation. We further assess how representative
the corpus generated for each of these domains is. We do so by
computingthesemanticrelatednessofeachdomain-specificcor-
pusagainstRSsfromthesamedomainotherthanthoseusedfor
generatingthe corpus. Generating adomain-specific corpus is not
a frequent activity. In practice, requirements engineers would typ-
ically have a small set of RSs from a given domain at the time of
generating a domain-specific corpus and would utilize this corpus
toperformactivitiesonotherRSsnotinvolvedinthegeneration
process.
3.1 Data Collection
Forthetwodomainsconsideredinthissection,wecollectedatotal
of six RSs from the PURE dataset [ 9], with three RSs from each
domain.OneRSisusedforgeneratingthecorpusandtheothers
are used for evaluatingsemanticrelatedness against theresulting
corpus.
In the following we listthe six RSs:
•From the railway domain, we used RS1 ( ERTMS) abouttrain
control, RS2 (EIRENESYS15 )andRS3 ( EIRENEFUN 7 )both
aboutdigital radio standard for railway .
•From the transportation domain, we used RS4 ( CTC NET-
WORK) abouttraffic managementinfrastructure , RS5 (PON-
TIS)abouthighwaybridgeinformationmanagement ,andRS6
(MDOT) abouttransportation info management .

that frequently occur in the corpus. We see that the keywords rail,
track,train,railway,andrailroadcharacterizetherailwaycorpus,
whilethetransportationcorpusischaracterizedbythekeywords
traffic,road,street,andlane.Wenotethatthe railwaydomaincan
be regarded as a sub-domain of the transportation domain. This
observation is highlighted through the frequent terms that the two
corporahaveincommoninFigure 3,suchassignal,system,vehicle,
anddriver.
3.3 Domain Representativeness
To examinehow representative the resulting domain-specificcor-
pora are, we compute semantic relatedness as follows. We first
transform each article in the corpus into a vector representation
usingword2vec.WedothesameforthetestRS.Then,wecompute
the cosine similaritybetween the vector representingthe (test) RS
andthevectorrepresentingeacharticle.Inthefollowing,wereport
theminimum,average,andmaximumcosinesimilarityscoresfor
eachdomain:
•Railway domain (cosine similarity between the railway cor-
pusandtest RSs): min=0.27, average=0.94 ,andmax=0.98
•Transportation domain (cosine similarity between the trans-
portationcorpusandtestRSs):min=0.67, average=0.95 ,and
max=0.99.
Our results show that the domain-specific corpora are, on aver-
age, highly similar to the test (unseen) RSs not used for generating
thecorpora.Inparticular,theaveragesemanticsimilarityis ≥0.94,
indicating thatmanyarticlesinthecorpusare relevanttothetest
RSs.Theminimumscoreof0.27intherailwaydomainimpliesthat
there are articlesinthecorpuswhich aremore document-specific,
i.e.,morerelevanttotheRSthatinducedthecorpusbuthavinglittle
incommonwiththetestRSs.Notethat,despitesomedocument-
specificarticlesbeingpresentinthegeneratedcorpus,theveryhigh
average semantic similarity ( ≥0.94) indicates that such articles are
asmallminorityandthusdonothaveasignificantnegativeimpact
onthe in-domainusabilityofthe generatedcorpus.
The gap seen between the minimum scores reported for the
two domain-specific corpora can be explained by the following: As
mentionedinSection 3.1,allRSsfromthetransportationdomainin our collection are on the topic of traffic and transportation in-
formationmanagement.Thisleadstoextractingmanykeywords
related to information management. In contrast, the RSs in our
collection from the railway domain are tailored to more specific
topics, namely train control and digital radio standard for railway.
This in turn leads to extracting document-specific terms which are
related to train control (i.e., the topic of the RS used for corpus
generation)butnotsomuchtodigitalradiostandardforrailway
(i.e., the topic of the test RSs). To summarize, our experiments
show that WikiDoMiner has successfully generated representative
corporafor twodistinct domains.
4 CONCLUSION
We presented WikiDoMiner, a tool for automatically generating
domain-specific corpora from Wikipedia. Our current implementa-
tion is a significantly enhanced and usable adaptation of the cor-
pus generation component briefly outlined in our earlier work [ 5].
WikiDoMinerextracts keywordsfrom agiven requirementsspec-
ification(RS)andthenqueriesthesekeywordsinWikipedia.For
each keyword, WikiDoMiner looks for a matching article whose
titlehassomeoverlapwiththekeyword.Toexpandthecorpus,we
providetheuserwiththepossibilitytoconfigureaparameter depth
thatcontrols how deeplythe Wikipedia categorystructure should
be traversed. We assess the relatedness of the resulting corpora to
RSs different from those used for corpus generation. Our empirical
resultsshowthat,acrosstwodistinctdomains,WikiDoMineryields
