ABSTRACT
Robustness of neural networks need be guaranteed in many safety-
criticalscenarios,suchasautonomousdrivingandcyber-physical
controlling. In this paper, we present MpBP, a tool for verifying
the robustness of neural networks. MpBPis inspired by classi-
cal bound propagation methods for neural network verification,
and aims to improve the effectiveness by exploiting the notion
ofpropagationpaths.Specifically, MpBPextends classicalbound
propagation methods, including forward bound propagation, back-
ward bound propagation, and forward+backward bound propa-
gation, with multiple propagation paths. MpBPis based on the
widely-usedPyTorchmachinelearningframework,henceprovid-
ing efficient parallel verification on GPUs and user-friendly us-
age. We evaluate MpBPon neural networks trained on standard
datasets MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet. The results demon-
strate the effectiveness advantage of MpBPbeyond two state-of-
the-art bound propagation tools LiRPA and GPUPoly, with compa-
rableefficiencytoLiRPAandsignificantlyhigherefficiencythan
GPUPoly. A video demonstration that showcases the main fea-
tures ofMpBPcan be found at https://youtu.be/3KyPMuPpfR8 .

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly deployed in
manyrealisticscenarios[ 1,17,21,27].Nevertheless,thesafetyof
neural networks is difficult to be guaranteed. Especially, there are
many signs that DNNs are not robust[26]. That is, the output of
a DNN may be unstable against small perturbations to the input.
For instance, some dust on a łstopž traffic sign that is negligible
for humans,maylead to amisclassificationof the signinto anł80
km/hžtrafficsignbyanauto-drivingsystem,whichisintolerant.
The lack of robustness hinders the deployment of DNNs in such
safety-criticalscenarios.
Atypicalrobustnessevaluationtechniqueistesting,whichchecks
whetheraperturbedinputinducesanincorrectoutput.Alargebody
of techniques are developed to test the robustness of DNNs [ 33].
Theyareeffectivetofindadversarialexamplesviolatingrobustness,

provetherobustnessofagivenDNNagainstperturbedinputs,thus
providingaformalguarantee for safety-criticalapplications.
Bound propagation [29] plays an important role in DNN veri-
fication. It is a method for calculating provable lower and upper
bounds of each neuron in a DNN, according to the input region
generatedbyperturbations.Theprovableboundsofoutputneurons
arethenusedtodeterminewhetheramisclassificationmayexist.If
no,therobustnessw.r.t.theinputregionisguaranteed.Duetoits
effectivenessandefficiency,boundpropagationisoftenusedasa
stand-alone verification method [ 18,23,24,29,30], but also can be
utilized as an essential component in other verification techniques,
such as the Branch-and-Bound (BaB) method [ 8,28,30]. It is the
mainstream choice for bounding in BaB methods, which can be
usedtodeterminethe nextbranching.
Tightness is the most crucial measurement for the effectiveness
of bound propagation methods. Calculating tighter bounds means
thatamethodcandealwithmorerobustnessverificationproblems.
Accordingtopropagationstrategies,boundpropagation isfurther
categorized into backward bound propagation (BBP),forward bound
propagation (FBP),forward+backward bound propagation (FBBP)
andintervalboundpropagation (IBP),withdifferenttrade-offsbe-
tweentightnessandefficiency[ 29]. Manyeffortshave beenmade
to improve the tightness [ 8,25,28,30,31]. Our recent work pro-
posesthenotionof propagationpaths forBBP[34].Withthisnotion,
existing BBPmethods[ 24,29,32]canbe seen asemployingonly
one singlepropagationpath,whichis a specialcase of multi-path
BBP.Theexperimentalresultsin[ 34]showthatleveragingmultiple
pathsinBBPtightenstheoutputboundseffectively.Furthermore,
the notion ofpropagation paths is suitable for parallelization.

tendstheideaofmulti-pathBBPto Multi-pathBoundPropagation.
MpBPis implemented based on the widely-used machine learning
frameworkPyTorch[ 4].Itprovidesefficientparallelverification,es-
peciallyinthepresenceofGPUs.Specifically,thetwomainfeatures
ofMpBPare as follows:
•It is a multi-path bound propagation tool. MpBPsupports
fourboundpropagationtechniques:multi-pathBBP,multi-
path FBP, multi-path FBBP, and classical IBP. They offer
varioustrade-offs betweenverificationeffectivenessandef-
ficiency,whichcanaccommodatedifferentapplicationsce-
narios.
•It is a PyTorch based verification tool. With efficient parallel
tensorcomputationsprovidedbyPyTorch,boundpropaga-
tion through multiple paths spends almost the same time as
thesingle-pathboundpropagation.Ontheotherhand,for
the users who are already familiar with PyTorch, we believe
thatMpBPprovideseffortless andmore flexibleusage.
2 THE MPBPTOOL
Thearchitectureandworkflowof MpBParedepictedinFigure 1.
MpBPacceptsasinputsaDNNmodel,aspecification,andapath
configuration,then outputswhetherthegiven modelsatisfiesthe
expected specification ( verified) orunknown . The core of MpBP
consists of four modules: MpFBP,MpBBP,MpFBBPandIBP, which
calculate the output bounds of the given DNN via, respectively,
multi-pathFBP,multi-pathBBP,multi-pathFBBP,andtheclassical
IBP techniques. These modules inherit the different trade-offs from
theircorrespondingtechniques.Userscanchooseoneofthemto
fittheirrequirements.Theoutputboundscomputedbythespeci-
fied module constitute the output reachable region. The reachable
region is then compared against the unsafe region (the red square
in Figure 1), which is constructed by the constraint generator with
the input specification. According to the comparison, MpBPout-
puts an answer verified, indicating that the input specification (e.g.
robustness) issatisfiedbythe inputDNN, or unknown .
2.1 Input andOutput
MpBPsupportsfeedforwardfully-connectedneuralnetworks(FFNNs)
and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the most com-
monlyusedReLUactivationfunction.Thenetworkcanbespecified
in the PyTorch model format .pthor the.onnxformat. The input
specification identifies the properties that users want to verify. Itconsists of an input x0to the DNN, a perturbation threshold 𝛿and
a set of safe/unsafe labels. It specifies that all perturbed inputs,
which are in the neighborhood of x0w.r.t.𝐿𝑝-norm distance 𝛿, are
classified into safe labels (equivalently, not classified into unsafe
labels)bytheDNN.ForexampleinFigure 1,ifwewanttoverify
whetherałstopžsignimagepreservesthepredictionłstopževen
withperturbations under threshold 𝛿,we use theimageas x0and
set the łstopž label as safe label (hence others are unsafe). MpBP
supportsthree typesof 𝐿𝑝-normsto measurethedistancefor per-
turbation: 𝐿∞-,𝐿1-,and𝐿2-norms.Finally,inthe pathconfiguration ,
userscanspecifythenumberofpropagationpathsemployedfor
verification.Morepathsbringtighterbounds.Buttheimprovement
is not permanent. We suggest a default path number 4, which is
empirically chosenthroughsomepreliminary experiments.
Afterboundcalculationwiththespecifiedmodule, MpBPoutputs
the reachable region of the given model w.r.t. x0and𝛿. Meanwhile,
it also returns the verified/unknown answer, indicating whether
theinput modelsatisfies theinput specification.For the unknown
answer, users may try to change the configurations (path and/or
verification technique) to perform amore accuratecalculation.
Besidestheaforementionedinputs, MpBPprovidesoptions --bp
toselecttheboundpropagationtechnique,and --verbose tochoose
between differentkindsof outputinformation.
2.2 Multi-path BoundPropagation
InDNNverification,thegiveninput x0andtheperturbationthresh-
old𝛿constitutetheinputregion,usuallyrepresentedbyintervals.
Therefore,thevalueofeachneuroninthenetworkrangeswithinan
interval instead of being a single value. A comprehensive introduc-
tiontoboundpropagationcanbefoundin[ 29].Generallyspeaking,
backwardboundpropagationcomputestheneuronboundsviaa
depth-2nestingloop.Theouterloopiteratesthroughallneurons
from the input to the output layer by layer. For each neuron, the
innerloopcalculatesitslowerandupperboundfunctions,byiterat-
ing,conversely,towardtheinputlayerusingallneuronboundsthat
arealreadycomputed.Thedirectionoftheinnerloopdefinesthe
notion łbackward propagationž. The two bound functions are then
concretized by the input intervals to obtain the concrete bounds
of the neuron. These bounds are again leveraged to compute the
bound functionsfor neuronsinthe nextlayers inthe network.
Classical BBP tools, like ERAN[15] andCROWN [32], maintain
onlyasinglepairoflowerandupperboundfunctionsforeachneu-
ron.Thenotionofpropagationpathsregardsthespecifictechnique

forcomputingtheboundfunctionsasaspecificpath[ 34].Itisthen
natural to synergize different techniques to achieve better bounds.
Multi-pathBBPextendsclassicalBBPwithmultiplepropagation
paths to obtain multiple pairs of lower and upper bound functions
for each neuron. Multiple concrete bounds for a neuron can be
derived from these bound functions. Since they are all provable
bounds, their intersection provides a tighter, or at least identical,
provablebound. The possibly betterboundwill benefit thebound
computationfor neuronsinnextlayers.

ron𝑥𝑖+1,1,twolowerboundfunctions 𝑙1(𝑥0,1,𝑥0,2)and𝑙2(𝑥0,1,𝑥0,2)
areobtainedfromtwoover-approximationtechniquesforbound
propagation [ 24]:𝑥𝑖+1,1≥𝑥𝑖,1and𝑥𝑖+1,1≥0, respectively. These
two techniques constitute two propagation paths. By concretizing
𝑙1(𝑥0,1,𝑥0,2)and𝑙2(𝑥0,1,𝑥0,2)with input intervals, we get two con-
crete lower bounds 𝑙𝑏1and𝑙𝑏2of𝑥𝑖+1,1. Taking𝑙𝑏=max{𝑙𝑏1,𝑙𝑏2}
guarantees apossiblytighterlower bound of 𝑥𝑖+1,1.

Figure 2:AnExample ofTwo-path BBPforNeuron 𝑥𝑖+1,1
Although the notion of propagation paths is proposed when
considering BBP, it is applicable as well when discussing other
bound propagationmethodslike FBPandFBBP.
ForwardboundpropagationisanalternativetoBBP.UnlikeBBP,
FBPcalculatestheneuronboundsfromtheinputtotheoutputlayer
by layer, without performing backward propagation (i.e., the inner
loop). Therefore, it is extremely efficient, with time complexity
O(𝑁), where𝑁is the number of neurons in the DNN. As a conse-
quence, thebounds obtained by FBP are looserthan those by BBP.
ComparedtoBBP,FBPsacrificestightnessforefficiency.Butitis
an important alternative in the applications like BaB. In the BaB
method,boundpropagationisoftenthechoicehelpingtodecide
the next branching. It requires the bound propagation technique to
be fast enough with acceptable tightness, making FBP an excellent
choice. Like BBP, existing FBP techniques employ only a single
propagationpath.WeextendtheclassicalFBPtomulti-pathFBPin
MpBPusing multiple propagation paths. It guarantees tighter, at
leastidentical,bounds thanthe classicalsingle-path FBP.
Forward+backwardboundpropagationisacompromisebetween
FBPandBBP.Itcomputestheneuronbounds layerbylayer with-
out backward propagation like FBP until the last layer, but then
performs backward propagation for the neurons in the last layer
to obtain their bound functions. FBBP bridges the tightness gap
and efficiency gap between FBP and BBP. We extend it to multi-
path FBBP, which also bridges the tightness gap and efficiency gap
between multi-path FBPandmulti-path BBP.Note that in Figure 2, besides 𝑥𝑖+1,1≥𝑥𝑖,1and𝑥𝑖+1,1≥0, it
holds that 𝑥𝑖+1,1≥𝜆𝑥𝑖,1for any𝜆∈ [0,1]. We take the following
strategy [ 34] to prescribe the propagation paths in MpBP. The
first propagation path utilizes the heuristics in [ 24], adopting a
strategy to minimize local over-approximation errors. When the
path number 𝑚=2, besides the first path, we take 𝜆=0when
computing bounds as the second propagation path. For 𝑚=3, the
third propagation path takes 𝜆=1. When𝑚≥4, along with the
abovefirstthreepaths,wefurtheraddthe (𝑚−2)-sectionpoints
of the interval [0,1]as the𝜆’s for the other (𝑚−3)propagation
paths. For instance, 𝜆4=1
2for the 4th path when 𝑚=4;𝜆4=1
3
and𝜆5=2
3for the 4th and5th pathsrespectivelywhen 𝑚=5.
The computations by different propagation paths are easy to
parallelize.Theoretically,themulti-pathboundpropagationtech-
niques can improve tightness without sacrificing efficiency via
parallelization,comparedtotheirclassicalsingle-pathcounterparts.
We implement the multi-path bound propagation techniques in Py-
Torch.Byplacingdifferentpathsintoanewdimensionoftensors,
it enables the same time cost as the single-path bound propagation.
3 EXPERIMENTS
We evaluate MpBPagainst two state-of-the-art bound propagation
tools LiRPA [ 29] and GPUPoly [ 19]. LiRPA is the essential com-
ponent performing bound propagation in 𝛼-𝛽-CROWN [3], the
winner of the 2nd International Verification of Neural Networks
Competition [ 2]. GPUPoly is the GPU implementation of the main
boundpropagationenginein ERAN[15],anactivelyupdatedverifi-
cationtool.TheevaluationisconductedinthreeDNNs:(i)anFFNN

LiRPA andGPUPoly on all three DNNs with different bound prop-
agation techniques. The task is to verify whether the first 100

MpBPis slightly slower than the corresponding configuration of
LiRPA, but the difference is negligible. Using BBP, MpBPis even
much faster ( ≈212×) than GPUPoly, which is also accelerated by
GPUs. On the other hand, we can see from the figure that multi-
path FBBP does bridge the efficiency gap between multi-path FBP
andmulti-path BBP.
In summary, the evaluation shows that MpBPis much more

Thesemethodsaremostlysound(i.e.nofalsenegative)andcom-
plete(i.e.,nofalsepositive).Buttheysufferfromlimitedscalabil-
ity due to the computational complexity. Bound propagation is
a lightweight method in terms of complexity. It is sound but in-
complete, because of the over-approximation techniques that have
beenused[ 18,24,29].Itturnsouttobeeffectiveandefficient,thus
applicabletolarge-scalenetworks.Ourworkaimstoimprovethe
effectivenessofboundpropagationwithoutsacrificingitsefficiency.
Many efforts have been made to improve the tightness, hence
effectiveness, of bound propagation. A line of work focuses on de-
signingnovelover-approximationtechniquestobalancetightness
with efficiency, e.g. [ 10,23,24,32]. With the notion of propagation
paths,theseworksdesignbetterpropagation paths,whichcanbe
easilyintegratedin MpBP.Ontheotherhand, 𝛼-CROWN [30]lever-
ages optimization techniques to achieve better over-approximation
for neurons in the DNNs, while the authors in [ 25] and [31] ex-
ploit LP or MILP solving to calculate tighter bounds of neurons for
propagation. These works introduce constraint solving into bound
propagation,makingitmoreeffectivebutconsiderablylessefficient.
Instead,MpBPimprovestheeffectivenesswithmerelynegligible

is the BaB method, where bound propagation is usuallychosen as
the bounding component [ 8,28,30].MpBPis orthogonal to BaB
methods,andcan be usedinBaBfor boundingas well.
