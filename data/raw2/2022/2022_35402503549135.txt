perspective on assessing software security during code review, the
challenges they encounter, and the support that companies and
projects provide. To this end, we conduct a two-step investigation:

to cause harm to the stakeholders of a software system [ 28]. To

such as during code review [ 1]. Code review is a widely agreed-on
practice [ 12] recognized as a valuable tool for reducing software

Previous studies [ 49,73,76,77] have reported andinvestigated
thelimitedadoptionof SDAandinvestigatedthedeveloper’sper-
spectiveonsecurity.However,assoftwaresecurityseemstoincreas-
inglygainmorespaceamongdevelopers’responsibilities,further
studiesareneededtoinvestigatethisleft-shift.Inparticular,inthis
paper, we focus on the current state of security during code review
accordingtopractitioners.Ourdefinitionofsecurityisrootedin
the definition of software vulnerabilities. In fact, ensuring security
during code review means finding and proposing fixes for security
vulnerabilities in the code under review to avoid turning the appli-
cationinsecure[ 51].Moreover,findingsonthistopiccanprovide
insightfor practitioners,organizations,andresearchers.Develop-
ers and other software project stakeholders can use our insights
to improve their code review practices to better ensure security
during code review. Organizations can use evidence about develop-
ers’ challenges during code reviews to update and improve their
approaches and methodologies toward achieving and maintaining
secureapplications.Finally,researcherscanfocustheirattention
ondevelopers’ challenges to facilitate secure code review.
We set up our investigation as an explorative study. Thus, in-
stead of starting with preset hypotheseson how software security
isorshouldbeaddressedduringcodereviews,weinvestigate:(1)
the developer’s perspective on assessing software security dur-
ingcodereview;(2)theexpectationsandsupportthatcompanies
and projects have on this process; and (3) what problems software
engineers face when evaluating software security duringreviews.

at leastseveral times per week.
Our study reveals that most participants (105) develop security-
sensitivesoftwaresystems;yet,whenaskedwhichissuestheyfocus
onduringcodereview,only9surveyrespondentsexplicitlymention
security.Only afterwe mention security,111 respondentsstate to
alwaysconsider it during code review. This stark mismatch may
indicate that security is not a priority during review and may be
assessedlessfrequentlythanreported.Moreover,developersmay
disregard security aspects during reviews due to their assumptions
aboutthe security dynamicofthe applicationthey develop.
Concerningcompanies,mostrespondents(126)workforcompa-
niesorprojectsthatexpectdeveloperstoensuresecurity,including
through code review. However, the vast majority of the respon-
dents (149) think that companies should do more to support secure
practices. For example, 122 respondents are not acknowledged for
performing secure code reviews. Moreover, two-thirds of the re-
spondents state that companies do not provide security training,
ratherjustallowdeveloperstoacquiresecurityskillsbythemselves
duringworkinghours(reportedby95 respondents).
Indeed,whenitcomestochallengesofensuringsecurityincode
review, respondents mostly report lack of training and knowledge
as the main issue they face (mentioned by 44 respondents). Second,
the use of third-party libraries is problematic because they are not
always present in the code developers maintain; thus, checking
them actively during code review is not possible (mentioned by
eight respondents). Finally, some respondents explained that code
reviewis not theideal phase ofthe development process to detect
vulnerabilities.Forinstance,somevulnerabilitiesrequiretheexe-
cutionofthecodetoappear.Moreover,developersfindithardto
identifyinteractionsamongpartsof codethatcouldhave security
implicationsat low-level inspections.
Based on the findings of our study, we propose a series of rec-
ommendations andareas for future research.
2 BACKGROUNDAND RELATED WORK
In this section, we review the Software Engineering (SE) re-
search literature on topics investigating software security and the
developer-relatedfactors that influencevulnerabilitydetection.
Security in the Development Lifecycle. In 2018, the McAfee
institution [ 40] reported that, daily, 80 billion malicious scans look
forvulnerabletargets,and780thousandrecordsarelosttohack-
ing. However, security experts still have to motivate and convince
developersoftheimportanceoffindingvulnerabilities[ 66].Later,
GitLab performed a survey with over 3,650 respondents from 21
countries[ 1].In theirsurvey,securityexpertsreportedthatitisa
software developer’s job to develop secure code, but only less than
halfofthe developers can actually detectvulnerabilities.
Securityoftenfailsbecauseuserseithermisunderstandthese-
curity implications of their actions or turn off security features
toworkaroundusabilityproblems[ 10].Infact,securityusability
issuesalsoaffectdevelopers.Forinstance,storinguserlogindata
and authenticating users is prone to security issues due to the
highcomplexityofthetechnologiesandconceptsinvolvedinthe
process[33].UsabilityissuesexistinginsuchsecurityAPIsforcenon-security expert programmers to misuse these APIs and in-
troducesecurityvulnerabilitiestoapplicationstheydevelop[ 71].
Developer-Centred Security ( DCS) studies have addressed some
ofthedevelopers’needsandattemptedtoapplyexistingHuman-
Computer Interaction methodologies and to adopt well -established
usablesecuritymeasurestosoftwaredevelopment[ 33,47,75].How-
ever, Tahaei and Vaniea [64]report a lack of research on several
aspectsof DCS,includinghowtomakesecurityabusinessvalueand
security often being ignored because it is a secondary requirement.
In2004,MicrosoftreleasedaTrustworthyComputingSecurity
DevelopmentLifecycleinitiative[ 74],aprocessadoptedbythecom-
panytodevelopsoftwarethatneedstowithstandmaliciousattacks.
Theprocessincludedtheadditionofaseriesofsecurity-focusedac-
tivities to each phase of Microsoft’s software development process.
Lipner[38]investigatedtheeffectivenessofMicrosoft’sinitiative
and found that the practice of Secure Development of Applications
(SDA) providessecurity benefits.
In 2007, Woon and Kankanhalli [73]conducted a field survey
of184informationsystemprofessionalstoinvestigatethefactors
that may influence the intention of the participants to practice
SecureDevelopmentofApplications( SDA),i.e.,incorporatesecu-
rityaspartoftheapplicationdevelopmentlifecycle.Theirresults
show evidence that participants’ intention was determined pri-
marilybyattitude,followedbyproductusefulnessandsubjective
norm. Moreover, self-efficacy and facilitating conditions did not
appeartoimpacttheinformationsystemprofessionals’intention
to practice SDA.In addition,participants reportedthat companies
did not facilitate SDApractice other than allowing the respondents
toattendseminarsonthetopic.Professionalscoulddecidewhether
topracticeit,buttheorganizationsdidnotgivethemrewardsor
recognition for their extra efforts. Moreover, Woon and Kankan-
halli[73]reported limited adoption of SDAand a lack of studies
exploring the phenomenon. Later, Xie et al .[77]identified an łit is
notmyresponsibilityžattitudefromthedeveloperstowards SDA.
Several studies [ 5,49,76] found that developers prioritize more-
visible functional requirements or even easy -to-measure activities,
e.g.,closing bug tracking tickets, over security. On the contrary,
Christakis and Bird [17]reported that developers care more about
security thanotherreliabilityissues.
Smithetal .[60]advocatethatstaticanalysistoolsdetectvulner-
abilitiesandhelpdevelopersresolvethem.Previousstudieshave
proposedandimprovedtoolingsupportaccordingtodevelopers’
needs [6,7,59], but tools are still generally poorly adopted by
developers [ 64]as they are confusing for developers to use [ 60].
Theaforementionedstudies[ 5,17,49,73,76,77]provideinsights
onSDAandhowdevelopersperceivesecurity.However,theymight

to be gaining more space among developers’ responsibilities, in
thispaper,we investigatewhethertheirfindings stillhold.Tothis
aim, we investigate the current developer’s perspective on this
phenomenon and whether they assess software security during
codereviews.Wecreatedourinitialinterviewsguidelineaccording

Code Review and Security. Code review is a way to manually
inspect source code by developers other than the author [ 19]. In
its contemporary practice, code review is asynchronous, tool- and
change-based [ 11], and widely used across companies [ 8,56] as
wellascommunity-drivenprojects[ 54,55].BacchelliandBird [8]
surveyeddevelopersandmanagers’expectationsregardingcode
reviewatMicrosoft.Amongtheobservationstheycollectedduring
interviews,aseniordeveloperstated:łI’veseenquiteafewcode
reviewswheresomeonecommentedonformattingwhilemissing
the fact that there were security issues.ž
Edmundson et al . [24]stated that manualcode review could be
expensive and impractical due to the need for several reviewers to
inspectapieceofcodetofindavulnerability.Onthecontrary,Weir
etal.[69]interviewedtwelveindustryexpertstoinvestigatehow
to improve the security skills of mobile app developers. Some of
thetechniquesrecommendedincludedcodereviews.Inthisvein,
theOWASPinstitution[ 51]definedsecurecodereviewasprobably
the single-most effective technique for identifying security bugs
early inthe systemdevelopmentlifecycle.
Braz et al .[16]investigated to what extent software developers
can detect vulnerabilities during code reviews. They found that
severaldevelopersoftenmissapopularandeasy-to-detectvulnera-
bility when reviewing code; yet, when explicitly informed about
thepresenceofa vulnerabilityinthe change, a significantportion
of the additional developers could identify it. Later, Braz et al . [14]
investigated whether and to what extent instructing developers to
focusonsecurityissuesandprovidingsecuritychecklistsduring
code reviews can support the detection of software vulnerabilities.
Theyfoundthatdevelopers’mentalattitudeplaysaroleindetecting

also provided the first evidence on how developers could perceive

3.1 Research Questions
Our investigation is structured around three research questions.
We incorporatedtheminthe interviewguidelines andthe survey.
As software security seems to be gaining more space among
developers’ responsibilities, we first investigate the developer’s
perspective on this phenomenon and whether the developers in
fact assesssoftware security duringcode reviews:RQ1.What is the current developer’s perspective on ensuring
softwaresecurityduringcode review?
Organizations are shifting securityto earlierstages ofsoftware
development,increasingdevelopers’responsibilityaroundsecurity.
We investigate the support that companies and projects provide to
the software security assessment duringcode reviews:
RQ2.Towhatextentdocompanies/projectssupportsecurityas-
sessment duringcode review?
Finally, we focus on the challenges developers face when ensur-
ing software security during code reviews. Such an understanding
helpsusobtainacatalogofreasonswhythispracticeisnotadopted
andallowusto propose recommendations to mitigate them.
RQ3.What arethe main challenges experienced when ensuring
securityduringmoderncode reviews?
3.2 Semi-structuredInterviewDesign
Weperformedthefirstpartofourstudyasasetofone-to-one
semi-structuredinterviews[ 37]withprofessionalsoftwaredevelop-
ers of different backgrounds. Semi-structured interviews use of an
interviewguidethatcontainsgeneralgroupingsoftopicsandques-
tionsratherthanapre-determinedsetandorderofquestions[ 8,37].
They are often used in an exploratory context to łfind out what
ishappening[and]toseeknewinsightsž[ 70].Theguidelinewas
iteratively refined after each interview, particularly when develop-
ers started providing answers very similar to the earlier ones, thus
reachingasaturationeffect.Themainpathofthefinalinterview
guideline has 28questions. Table 1shows two of the questions we
askedparticipantsduringtheinterviews.Following,wedescribe
the guideline’smain points.
(1) Introduction and background questions. In the introduc-
tion, we spend a few minutes explaining who we are and our re-
searchÐ withoutmentioningsecurity .Wereviewthemainpoints

any questions they might have. For instance, we remind them they
were allowed to stop the interview at any moment and also skip
any question they did not feel like answering. We also explain that
there were no right or wrong answers. Following, we start record-
ing the interview and ask the participants questions about their
background, such as their current role and how many years of ex-
perience in programming they have. The discussion of participant
backgroundservesasanicebreakerandalsoprovidessomecontext
for laterinthe interview.

(2)Codereviewquestions. Inthispartoftheinterview,weask
general questions about code reviews. First, we ask participants if
theyperform codereviewsaspartoftheircurrentjob orwhether
theyhavepreviousexperiencewithit.Althoughweexplicitlystate

could happen that a participant answer they have no experience

codereviewsandwhattypeofissuestheylookforwhenreview-
ing. At this moment, we observe whether participants mention
securityorvulnerabilitiesbythemselves, i.e.,whethersecurityis
spontaneouslymentionedwithoutbeing primed.
(3) Security questions. We ask participants if they are familiar
withthetermłsoftwarevulnerabilitiesžandtheirdefinitionofit.
Forparticipantsunfamiliarwiththeterm,wereadOWASP’s[ 28]
definition andask iftheyagree withit.The subsequent questions
and discussion regarding security are in this context of vulnerabil-

quent analysis. The transcripts of the interviews are available [ 15].
3.3 SurveyDesign
In the second part of our study, we conducted a survey with
developerswhohave experience withcode reviews.Ourgoal was
to validate and expand on the findingscollected throughthe semi-
structuredinterviews,andfurtheranswerourresearchquestions
(see section 3.1). We builtandranthe survey onQualtrics [ 48].
Thesurveyhad22questionscompulsoryquestions,organized
into four open-ended questions, three multiple-choice, 15 single-
choice, andthree 5-pointLikert scale grids. Thesegrids asked par-
ticipants to rate 8, 7, and 4 items on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging
from‘stronglydisagree’to‘stronglyagree’).Themultiple-choice
and rate questions had randomized answer options and statements.
Table2shows an example of a closed and an open-ended question.
In the following, we detail the survey’s design and how the partici-
pantflowsthrougheachblockofquestions.Eachblockcorresponds
to at least one different page, and returning to previous pages is

themthat they are allowedto dropoutat any time.
(2) Qualification questions. We ask participants two random

tions. This way, we can identify participants who spontaneously
report to include security as part of their code reviews.
(3) Security knowledge and practices during code reviews.
In this step, we ask participants whether they are familiar with
thetermsoftwarevulnerabilities andprovidethemwithitsdefini-
tion [28]. The subsequentquestionsregarding securityareinthis
contextofvulnerabilitydetection.Weaskquestionstogatherinfor-
mationabout factors thatmay affect howthe participantsaddress
security during code reviews, such as their security knowledge,
practices, and company and team culture. Most of the questions
are closed in a Likert scale format. Depending on a participant’s
answers, somequestionswerefilteredand notpresentedtoavoid
asking unnecessary questions. Different from the interview, in the
surveywedidnotexplicitlyaskparticipantsaboutthesecuritypro-

4.2 RQ 1.SecurityduringCodeReviews
Ourfirstresearchquestionseekstoinvestigatethedeveloper’s
perspective on software security and whether the developers in
fact assesssoftware security duringcode reviews.
Security focus during code review. When askedÐas an open
questionÐ what they focus on during code review, only 9 out of
the182 surveyrespondents explicitlymentioned security.Instead,
other non-functional qualities of the code were mentioned more
frequently( e.g.,23respondentsreportedperformanceasanissue
they focus on during code review). However, after being prompted
about vulnerabilities, 111 respondents reported to alwaysconsider
securityduringreviews.Mostsurveyrespondents(81%)reported
they can decide what aspects/issues to inspect during reviews ( i.e.,
intheend,ensuringsecurityduringreviewsistheirchoice),and
81%ofthemstateitistheirresponsibilitytolookforvulnerabilities
duringreviews.
During the interviews, two interviewees mentioned, without
being prompted,tofocusonsecurity. I4explained:łThereare col-
lateral effectsthatcan be undesirablefor thechange...like perfor-
mance, security, maintainability, testability, extensibility. All these
thingsthatcanbetestedandgenerallyaretested.žEightintervie-
weesreportedtobefamiliarwiththetermsoftwarevulnerability
andprovidedtheirowndefinition,which wasinline withours in
allcases(seeSection 3.2).Thiswasalsothecaseof I1,whoreported
to have a security background. The two remaining interviewees
initially reported no familiaritywith theterm but agreed with the
definition we provided. One of them further explained that they
wereinitiallyunsureaboutthecorrectdefinitionoftheterm,but
our definitionconfirmedtheir initialopinion.
After being prompted about software vulnerabilities, five more
interviewees highlighted the importance of considering security
814ESEC/FSE ’22, November14ś18, 2022,Singapore, Singapore LarissaBraz andAlberto Bacchelli
during code reviews. Out of these five interviewees, I7stated: łI
consideritalot,becauseIalreadyworkedforcompaniesthatwe
had problems related to it: the security of the data, big companies.ž
Surveyparticipantsandintervieweesusedvarioustermsintheir
answers refer to the application’s security. This was the case of the
previous answer given by I7where they mentioned łsecurity of
thedatažwhen asked whether theyconsidersecurity during code
reviews, a follow-up question to the discussion on the software
vulnerability definition. In fact, vulnerabilities in the code may
lead to insecure data; for instance, a Use of a Broken or Risky
CryptographicAlgorithm(CWE327)[ 50]flawinthecodecanlead
to the exploit ofsensitive data.
Moreover,twointervieweesreportedusingautomatictoolsto
detect software vulnerabilities, not only during code review but
overall during development activities. For instance, I2said: łthis is
automaticallychecked.Thereisatool[that]ispartoftheautomatic
check, if that change that I am introducing, if it is exposing any
credential, if there is any hardcoded password, if I let any security
permissionleak.ž

Figure 2:respondents’demographics (absolute numbers).Participants’ familiarity with security. The familiarity of our
study’s participants with security and itsconcepts plays an impor-
tantroleinourresults’interpretation.Amongthesurveyrespon-
dents, 37 stated to be unfamiliar or unsure about the term software
vulnerability,while145reportedbeing familiar withit.
Two interviewees reported to not be familiar with the term
softwarevulnerability.Yet,theydemonstratedtobesecurity-aware
afterlisteningtothesoftwarevulnerabilitydefinition.Exceptfor
I1(whoreportedtohaveworkedwithsecurity),theinterviewees
pointed up not being security experts. I5explained: ł[security] is a
topic that mostofengineers tendto not look toomuchintoit.ž
Observation 1 . Developers are familiar with the term soft-
ware vulnerability and acknowledge the importance of en-
suring security during code reviews. Yet, the vast majority of
participantsmentionedsecurityasakeyfocusduringcode
review only after weexplicitlyasked them about this topic.
Developers’assumptionsaboutapplication’ssecurity. Thein-
terview format allowed us to reveal potentially dangerous assump-
tionsdevelopersmake.Intotal,sevenintervieweesassumedthat
security is the responsibility of another software component or
team.Forinstance, I1explained:łIdonotworrymuch[aboutse-
curity]... Iamsupposingthatanotherpartofthesystemalready

I am relatively secure and should not worry much about it.ž I9
stated:łIammoreafront-enddeveloper,wedeallesswithsecurity

be more for the back end, right? They deal more with data.ž In
addition, I6said łI am a back-end engineer ... I am not a front-end
person, I do not have front-end expertise, so verifying accessibility
[vulnerabilities], for example,issomething I could not easily do.ž
Twointervieweesrevealedthatbecausetheydevelopinternal
code, they do not extensively consider security during code review.
Forinstance, I3said:łIthinkaboutitforlike3secondsandIsee

Two interviewees commented about how their companies be-
came more security-aware over time. For instance, I7told us about
how their company started as a small business and how its growth
impacted the security of the application: łWhen I joined, the appli-
cationsupportedveryfewdevices... withverylowsales,soitwas

When asked whether it is challenging to ensure security during
code review, seven interviewees agreed. More than that, łit can be

Interviewees reported lack of knowledge, the large amount of
possiblevulnerabilitiesandattackpatterns,timeconstraints,and
human factors as their main challenges. I6said łBecause there are
many, many ways of attacking, a lot more that a person who is

Figure 4: Challenges developers face concerning security
duringcodereviews.Insufficient security knowledge and training. In our survey,
themostfrequentlymentionedchallenge(mentionedby44respon-
dents) is insufficient security knowledge and training. For instance,
R35said:łlackofknowledgeaboutthecurrentvulnerabilitieson
the language/ framework/libraries of choice,ž and R86explained
that łdevelopers often lack the low-level and/or platform expertise
necessary to detect some vulnerabilities.ž R15explained: ł[secu-
rity assessment] needs specialized knowledge (exploit techniques)
and it can be hard to convince colleagues that there is a security
[vulnerabilities] in their code without doing a demo if they do not
havethenecessaryknowledge.žSurveyrespondentsalsomentioned
thatvulnerabilitiesmightnotbeeasytoidentifyduringthereview:
"Vulnerabilitiesarenotalwaysobviousjustfromlookingatcode,
[they] sometimes slip through the cracks even when best practices
are followedž ( R86).
Respondents were also skeptical about developers’ abilities to
learnandperformsecurecodereviews.Forinstance, R154explained
łDedicatedsecurityexpertsarenoteconomicallyviableformost
smaller companies / teams / project. Some trainingmight help but
itisprobablyanunrealisticforalldeveloperstobecomecompetent
enough in IT security. Addressing this issue requires better tool
support (static code analysis) and improved frameworks / libraries
/ API, sothat developers have less ‘opportunity’to mess up.ž
Vulnerabilities are hard to detect and keep up with. The na-
ture ofsoftware vulnerabilitiesalsoimpactsitsdetection.Intotal,
nine survey participants reported that vulnerabilities are subtle
anddifficulttodetect,evenwhenthebestpracticesarefollowed.
For instance, R86explained that łvulnerabilities are not always
obviousjustfromlookingatcode,žand R154saidthatłsomevul-
nerabilitiesareverysubtle(yetdangerous)andthereforeeasyto
overlook.Thecodeactuallydoesnotlook‘bad’.žInadditiontothat,
thelargeamountofvulnerabilitiesandtheconstantdiscoveryof
new ones turns keeping up with security a hard task. For exam-
ple,R31reported the łever-changing development landscape, new
vulnerabilities are found in third-party packages every dayž as a
challenging factor to ensure security duringreview.
Lackof codebase knowledge. Lack of codebase knowledge was
mentioned nine times. Survey respondents reported lack of knowl-
edge about applications’ architecture, domain, and components
interaction as factors that influence the detection of vulnerabilities
during reviews. For instance, R39explained łI am not a security
expert;myreviewswillneverbeairtightonasecuritylevel.The
levelofthreatishardtodeterminesincecompany-widenetwork
policiesandotherteams’applicationsarealsopartoftheecosys-

said łlackof knowledge of the overalldomain (I work in a heavily
regulated financial environment and I am relatively junior) with
many existing security measures. Awareness of the interactions
between thesesystemsisdesirable when inspecting security.ž
Use of third-party libraries. Lack of knowledge also applies to
third-party libraries used in the application. The use of third-party
librarieswasmentionedbyeightsurveyrespondentsasachallenge
they face when ensuring security during code reviews. R86said
łVulnerabilities are not always present in the code we maintain,
often they are library/platform/integration issues."

Humanfactors. Surveyparticipantsalsomentionedhumanfac-
tors, such as fatigue and focus, as factors that impact the detection
of security issues during code reviews: łIt is time pressure, fatigue,

Code review limitations. In total, five survey respondents also
mentioned some limitations that code review poses to ensuring se-
curity. Forinstance, R64mentionedłtoomuch codeto reviewžas a
challengingfactortoensuresecurityduringreviews,and R112said:
ł[Iam]notalwayssurewhattolookfor,norsureifitismyrespon-
sibility instead of our security team’s responsibility.Code reviews
also show only a limited view of an application, and proper under-
standingofsecurityflawsmayrequireseeinghowcodeinteracts

often requires deep understanding of the subject code which is not
really requiredofcode reviewers.ž

5 LIMITATIONS
Assessing the validity of explorative qualitative research is chal-
lenging [32,46]. Despite our best efforts, some limitations exist; in
the following, we explainhowwe triedto minimizethem.
To mitigate the possible limitation from missing control over
subjects, we included questions to characterize our sample, such
as experience and role (Block 4 in Section 3.3). We also removed
participantswhodidnotcompletetheexperimentandreportednot
performing code reviews. We manually analyzed participants that
incorrectlyansweredthe qualification questions.Duringtheinterviews,wemighthaveledintervieweestoprovide
more desirable answers [ 34].Tomitigate this issue, we challenged
and triangulated our findings with the survey results. Our study
participantsmighthavegivensociallyacceptableanswerstoappear
in a positive light.To mitigate thissocial desirabilitybias [ 29], we
informed participants that the responses would be anonymous and
evaluatedinastatisticalform.Tomitigatequestion-ordereffect[ 58]
that mighthave ledthe surveyrespondents to specific answers, we
randomized the order of answers of the multiple-choice questions
andthe statements ofthe scaleratequestions.
We collected qualitative data from the interviews and the sur-
veytounderstanddevelopers’mainchallengestoensuresecurity
during code reviews. We used the data to get insights into their
perceived challenges and what they would do/recommend to do to
mitigate such issues. We used different measurement techniques
to mitigate mono-method bias [20]: we obtained qualitative results
by employing card sorting on participants’ responses to the sur-
vey’sopen-textquestions(Block3inSection 3.3).Wealsousedthis
techniqueonthe interviews’ transcripts.
Weonlycollecteddatathrough interviewsandsurveys,which
may not provide the full picture of developers’ perceptions. To
mitigate this limitation,one can examine code, designdocuments,
issue tracking system contents, and other repositories. We hope
thatfuture researchcan be inspired byourresultsand triangulate
selectedfindingswithotherdata sources.
Toobtainadiversesample ofparticipants,weinvited software
developers from several countries, organizations, education levels,
experiences, and backgrounds. Even though our sample comprises
several types of software developers and we found a large agree-
ment concerning their perceptions, we cannot claim it is repre-
sentativeofalldevelopers.Ifthestudyisrepeatedusingdifferent
participants, the results maybe different.
Participants could freely decide whether to participate in the

only participants who could spare enough time or were interested
in the incentive might have participated. We tried to mitigate this
riskbyadvertisingthroughvariouschannels.
6 DISCUSSION
We discuss how the findings on the developer’s perception of
softwaresecuritycodereviewscanbeusedtobettersupportthe
securedevelopmentofapplications,andweoutlineopportunities
for future work.
A change in developer’s perspective on security. In the past,
developers have shown an łit is not my responsibilityž attitude
towards software security [ 77]and limited adoptionof Secure De-
velopment of Applications ( SDA) [73]. However, software security
seems to be gaining more space among developers’ responsibili-
ties. In fact, a study [ 17] reported that developers care more about
securitythanotherreliabilityissues.Followingthistrend,ourre-
sults suggest a change in developer’s attitudeÐthey state it is their
responsibility to ensure security duringcode reviews.
818ESEC/FSE ’22, November14ś18, 2022,Singapore, Singapore LarissaBraz andAlberto Bacchelli
Securityneedstobebettermotivated. Eventhoughdevelopers
seem to have changed their attitude towards security, recent re-
search [14,16] has also provided initial evidence that security is
notinthedevelopers’mindłbydefaultžwhenreviewingcode.Our
results corroborate this evidence: We found that developers do not
have security in mind when describing their code review practices.
A reason for this might be that developers lack motivation to be
concernedaboutsecurityduringreviews.Indeed,companiesand
projectsexpectdeveloperstoensurethesecurityoftheirapplica-
tionsandallowthemtoacquiresecurityknowledgeduringwork
hours, but they do not provide the means for that, e.g.,security
training and workshops. Moreover, leaders do not acknowledge
developers that dosecure code reviews.
This situation raises questions on the effectiveness of how com-
paniesmotivatedevelopersinthesoftwaredevelopmentprocess,
especiallyatcodereviewtime.Organizationsmayconsiderincorpo-
rating explicitreward systemsfordevelopers whoensure security
in the applications. For instance, the Vulnerability Reward Pro-
gram [4] rewards any bug bounter who report vulnerabilities in
Google-ownedandAlphabetsubsidiarywebproperties.Inspired
bythisinitiative,companiesandprojectsmaycreateprogramsto
reward developers who detect vulnerabilities through code review.
Assumptions may hurt security. Developers make securityas-
sumptions during code reviews. For example, Braz et al . [14]re-
portedthatreviewersjustifiednotdetectingvulnerabilitiesbecause
they assumed the change author had already considered the appli-
cation’s security. In line with their findings, our study participants
assumethatsecurityistheresponsibilityofanotherapplication’s
component or team. For instance, back-end developers reported
assuming security as a front-end responsibility, while front end
developers reported theopposite. However, developers need to be
careful and spread awareness around these assumptions so that
they donot end uphurtingthe application’s security.
Somedevelopersalsothoughttheircodeisnotsecurity-sensitive
becausethesoftwareisintendedforinternaluse.However,mali-
ciousandinadvertentactivitiesmayhappeninsideanorganization.
Forexample,acknowledgingthesescenarios,Microsofthasanin-
sider risk management compliance solution that helps minimize

issue and incorporating more strict software security policies into
theirdevelopmentprocessto create adifferentattitude.
Securitycanbelearned. Participantsmainlyreportedinsufficient
security knowledge as a challenge when considering security dur-
ingcodereview.Ourresultsalignwithpreviouswork[ 14,16],in
which developers reported lack of knowledge as the reason for
not finding vulnerabilities in a code review task. These results
strengthenthequestionsonthesecurityeducation(orlackthereof)
thatdevelopersarereceiving.Tocreateadifferentapproach,educa-
tionalinstitutionsmayintroduceorgivemoreattentiontosecurity
inthesoftwareengineeringundergraduateandgraduatecourses.
Forinstance,in2004,ateamfromtheUSNavalPostgraduateSchool
wonthełCapturetheFlagžtournamentatDefcon,theworld’smostpopular hacker convention [ 22]. To learn security, students and de-
velopers must be able to switch from their traditional conditioning
to theattacker’swayof thinking[ 13]. Studiescan be carriedoutto
determinehowto bettereducate studentsonsoftware security.
Furthermore,toovercomedevelopers’insufficientsecurityknowl-
edge, companies and projects may provide security training and
allowtimeforlearning.ThefreeresourcesprovidedbyOWASP[ 28]
canbeusedtoeducatedevelopersonsecurity.Forinstance,organi-
zationscan adoptregulartalksabouttheOWASPTop10List[ 52]
tokeepdevelopersawareoftheriskiestvulnerabilities,aswellas
training andseminaraboutnewemergingvulnerabilities.
In addition, software developers can use Massively Open Online
Courses(MOOCs)tolearnsecuritybeyondthesettingoftheircom-
pany/project.MOOCsareonlinecoursesthat,additionallytotra-
ditional coursematerials, provideinteractive courses with user fo-
rumsorsocialmediadiscussionstosupportcommunityinteractions
among students, professors, and teaching assistants, as well as im-
mediate feedback to quick quizzes and assignments [ 72]. Although
previous research [ 65] has provided evidence that on-campus secu-
rity courses still have better results than security MOOCs, develop-
ers can still benefit from them. For instance, our results show that
companies allow developers to learn security during their work
hours. Thesedevelopers may follow MOOC activities from theof-
fice.Furtherstudiescanbeconductedtoinvestigatehowtoimprove
MOOCs to bettersupport developers learningsoftware security.
Alittlehelpfromtheexperts. Mostofourparticipantsreported
thattheydevelopsecurity-sensitiveapplications,buttheircodeis
rarelyreviewedbysecurityexperts.Thisisamissedopportunity
becausecodereviewcanbeusedasalearningtool[ 8].Includingan
expert in the review may not only increase the security of that spe-
cificchange,butdeveloperscanmakeuseoftheknowledgesharing
duringthereviewtolearn, e.g.,itcanbeawaytodoonboardingin
the security field.
The 2014 Cisco Annual Security Report estimated a potential
shortfallofamillionsecurityprofessionalsglobally[ 18].In2022,
the report of the World Economic Forum [ 27] stated: łThere is
an undersupply of cyber professionals Ð a gap of more than 3
million worldwide Ð who can provide cyber leadership, test and
secure systems, and train people in digital hygiene.ž This way,
even large companies do not have enough security experts to re-
vieweverychangemadebydevelopers.Infact,onlyone-thirdof
our survey respondents reported having a security team in their
companies/projects. As a solution, teams can select a developer to
increase their security expertise and propagate their knowledge to
other team members through code reviews. OWASP [ 28] suggests
that companies not only have a security team but also a further
groupofdeveloperswithaninterestinsecuritythatcanactasteam
localsecuritySubjectMatterExperts(SMEs)takingpartinthecode
reviews [ 51]. Further studies can be designed and conducted to
evaluate the effectoflearningsecurity inreviews.
The rightchange to the right reviewer. Whennotenoughex-
perts are available to review all code changes, the most security-
criticalchanges can be selectedandsenttothe expertsfor amore
scrutiny security analysis. Tools and processes can be developed
to recognize security-critical changes and automatically assign se-
curity experts as reviewers. Previous research [ 9,36,53,68] has
819Software SecurityduringModernCode Review: TheDeveloper’s Perspective ESEC/FSE ’22, November14ś18, 2022,Singapore, Singapore
investigated reviewer recommendation approaches, including rec-
ommendationsbasedoncross-projectworkexperienceofpotential
reviewers and estimation of their expertise in specific technolo-
gies[53].Theseapproachesmaybeadaptedtotakesecurityaspects
into consideration. For example, they may incorporate security
static analyzers, such as SonarQube [ 62] and Snyk Code [ 61], to
measure the change’ssecurity-critical level.
Codereviewisnotperfect. Codereviewisconsideredavaluable

7 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we investigated the developer’s perspective on
assessingsoftwaresecurityduringcontemporarycodereviews,the
support companies and projects provide to this process, and the
challengestheyfaceinthistask.Tothisaim,weinterviewedten
professional developers andsurveyed182practitioners.
Ourresultsshowachangeinthedeveloper’sattitudetowards
security ś they acknowledge it istheirresponsibility to ensure se-
curityduringcodereviews.Yet,wealsofindthatdevelopersdonot
have security in mind when describing their code review practices,
thus suggesting that security is not one of their main priorities
when reviewing code. Moreover, developers make assumptions
about the dynamic of the application for which they are review-
ingcode.Theseassumptionsmayleadthemtodisregardsecurity
aspectsduringtheircode reviews.
Our findings indicate that companies may need to change their
approachtowardssecurity:Theyexpectdeveloperstoensurethe

tivestodoso.Developersdenystrugglingtoensuresecuritydur-
ing code reviews. Yet, they report insufficient security knowledge,
lackofknowledgeregardingtheapplicationanditscomponents,
third-party libraries, human factors, and code review limitations as
challenging factors that hinder security assessment at review time.
