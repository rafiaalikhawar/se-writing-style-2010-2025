ABSTRACT
The traceability of software artifacts has been recognized as an
important factor to support various activities in software devel-
opmentprocesses.However,traceabilitycanbedifficultandtime-
consuming to create and maintain manually, thereby automated
approaches have gained much attention. Unfortunately, existing
automated approaches for traceability suffer from practical issues.
This paper aims to gain an understanding of the potential chal-
lengesfortheunderperformingofthestate-of-the-art,ML-based
tracelinkclassifiersappliedinreal-worldprojects.Byinvestigating
differentindustrialdatasets,wefoundthattwocritical(andclassic)
challenges,i.e.dataimbalanceandsparseproblems,lieinreal-world
projects’ traceability automation. To overcome these challenges,
we developed a framework called SPLINT to incorporate hybrid
textualsimilaritymeasuresandsemi-supervisedlearningstrategies
asenhancementstothelearning-basedtraceabilityapproaches.We
carried out experiments with six open-source platforms and ten in-
dustry datasets. The results confirm that SPLINT is able to operate
at higher performance on two communities’datasets. Specifically,
theindustrial datasets, whichsignificantly sufferfromdataimbal-
ance and sparsity problems, show an increase in F2-score over 14%
and AUC over 8% on average. The adjusted class-balancing and
self-trainingpoliciesusedinSPLINT(CBST-Adjust)alsoworkef-
fectivelyfortheselectionofpseudo-labelsonminorclassesfrom

Unfortunately, researchers have also found that high-quality
trace links are difficult to manually recover and maintain [ 25] due
to the large size of potential trace links among different artifacts
(e.g.,requirements,issues,andcode),andthefrequentchangesin
software artifacts caused by a more iterative development process.
Theubiquitousadoptionofversioncontrolsystems(e.g.,GitHub)
and issue tracking systems (e.g., Jira) is now the common practice
for developers to tag code commits with issue IDs during their
daily development tasks in a real-world project managed by the
software repository. These explicitly tagged trace links between
source code (e.g., recorded by commits) and system functionalities
(e.g., described by issues tagged with "New Feature" or "Bug") thus
lay a good foundation for learning-based approaches to support
automated traceability tasks for real-worldprojects, indicating an
appreciable save of human efforts when the project keeps evolving.
Totacklethisproblem,asignificantamountofresearchhasbeen
conducted with a goal of helping developers recover traceability
automatically[ 12,22,73].Theseincludeprobabilisticapproaches[ 5,
51], information retrieval (IR) techniques (the Vector Space Model
(VSM) [4], Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [ 47], Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) [ 7], Jenson Shannon model (JS) [ 1], etc.) and
learning-based approaches (machine learning [ 21,50] and deep
learning[ 30,43,62])to recover the missingtrace links.
Advancesinautomatictraceabilitytechniqueshavebeenachieved
and most of them evaluated in OSS projects [ 43,59,62] and also
gradually applied to industrial projects with positive improve-
ments [30,51,61]. Many existing studies use datasets gathered
either from the Center of Excellence for Software & System Trace-
ability2(e.g., academic-led projects)or fromfree and opensource
(OSS) community projects [ 32,58,73]. We found, however, that au-
tomated traceability techniques are not well validated empirically,
especially in industrial environments. Even with rapid progress in
learning-based technologies, industry partners are struggling to
integrateautomatedtraceabilitypracticesandintegratetheminto
theirdevelopmentprocesses[ 48].Therefore,westilllackenough
knowledge about the practical reasons for underperformance of
automatedtraceability approachesinindustrialprojects.
Thus, the goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of
learning-based automated traceability approaches in real-world
projects. In order to better understand how automated traceability
worksfordifferenttypesofprojectsindifferentcommunities,we
firstevaluatetheperformanceoflearning-basedtrace-linkclassi-
fiers using six OSS projects from GitHub [ 59], and ten industrial
projects from our collaborative organization. We seek to charac-
terize the severity of the underperforming trace-link classifier and
to identify potential problems for outcome prediction through our
study.Fromtheanalysisofoverallperformanceondifferentcom-
munities’(i.e.OSSandindustrial)datasets,weobservedthattwo
classic challengesare most relevant to hinderreal-worldprojects’
traceability prediction:data imbalance andsparseness.
To meet these two challenges in traceability research, we found
that the semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm is efficient to
solvetheproblemsofbothimbalancedlabelsandinsufficientsample
labels for many practical applications at the same time [ 72]. In
particular, SSL algorithms can be used to augment the training set
2http://coest.org/withunlabelledsampleswhenthelabeleddataissparse.Inthiscase,
theaddedsamplesareassignedpseudo-labelsbasedontheoriginal
labelled data model. SSL has also been extensively studied in class
imbalance scenarios in recent research. Researchers [ 34,67,70]
suggestthatleveraging unlabeled databySSL and self-supervised
learningcan benefitclass-imbalancedlearning.
Hence,inlightoftheaboveissues,wepresentedaframework
based on the Semi-Supervised Pre-processing for LearnINg-based
Traceability (SPLINT) to address the data imbalance and sparsity
problemthatexistinlearning-basedtraceabilityapproaches,and
furtherenhancethetraceabilityscenariosforreal-worldsoftware
projects.WeemployedSSL[ 34,70]toupdatethetrainingsetand
adjustedclass-balancingself-training(CBST-Adjust)strategiesto
rebalancethetrainingsetdistribution.Further,toaddressdataspar-
sity in the feature matrix of trace-link classifier, we evaluated how
features contribute in theprojects from both communities, respec-
tively. The result shows that textual information from software
artifacts in industrial projects accounts for the most important fea-
tures.Thus,weinvestigatedthesemanticsofsoftwareartifactsand
mergedhybridIR-basedtextual similaritymeasures intoSPLINT.
ToevaluatetheeffectivenessofSPLINT,wecomparedSPLINT
withtwostate-of-the-arttraceabilityapproaches(i.e.pureIR-based

AUC value across the six OSS projects, and 14.87% better F2 and

Data Collection. Firstly, we reviewed data provided by one of
our collaborators, a leading global supplier of information and
communicationtechnology(ICT)andsmartdeviceswithoperations
in over 100 countries and regions. To conduct our investigative
study, we selected 10 of the 54 initiatives that enable access to
software repositoriesandmeetthe following criteria:
1)The projects chosen are representative of the key product
services developed by our industrial collaborators (e.g., Plat-
form, App );
2)Themetadataofsoftwareartifactsisavailabletousandcan
be taken from associatedsoftware repositories;
3) Continuous release versionsofthe projectare available.
Itisgenerallythecasethat Appprojectsprovidedirectservice
to external users.Typically, theyupdateartifactsfrequently, have
larger project sizes, more iterative development processes, and
more involved engineers, which lead to poor traceability and main-
tenance. In contrast, Platformprojects are mainly focused on inter-
nalengineers.Duetotheirsmallersize,seniordevelopersusually
handle artifact managementandmaintenancedirectly.
Recently,ourcollaboratorsbegantofocusonrequirements-to-
commitstraceability.Theyexpectedthesetracelinkstoimprove
the credibility of the software development process. Thus, they
established a rule that software engineersare unabletoclosea re-
quirement without at least one traced commit. However, we found
thatourcollaboratorshadrelativelyweaktraceabilitymanagement
for other artifacts, especially in issue-commit links where tight
developmentcycles(i.e.,aroundone-monthreleasecycles)make
it difficult to force developers to create and maintain 100% issue
(defects)-commit links. Meanwhile, the requirements traceability
rulehasjustbeenestablished.Itis notadvisabletoforcesoftware

erate software process digitization. To this end, the organization
seeksautomatedwaysto manage traceability issues.

sizes of code commits (e.g., 100, 1,000 to 10,000), it ensures real-

2.3 EncounteredChallenges
Wefoundthefollowingtwochallengesaffectingtheeffectiveness
of current ML-based tracing approaches. Industrial initiatives may
cause the higher imbalance ratio (e.g., the imbalance ratio reaches
around120onaverage)andlimitedsamplingtracelinksbecause
ofthe lower linkedissuesratio,withonly around 36.72%.
2.3.1 DataImbalance. Thedataimbalanceproblemisexacerbated
bythetightdevelopmentprocessesforindustrialsoftwareprojects.
Ontheonehand,industrialprojectsarebusiness-orientedwithlim-
iteddevelopmenttimeanddeadlinesandintensivecodingactivities.
As a result, whencompared tothe sixOSS projects, these projects
producedahigherproportionofcodecommitswithfewersource
artifacts.WeseeOSSprojectsthathavemaintainedcomparablesize
issuesandcodecommitswithroughlyN*1,000forovertenyears.
In contrast, as shown in Table 1, most industrial projects have just
≈ (𝑁∗100)ofissueswith ≈ (𝑁∗1,000),even≈ (𝑁∗10,000)of
code commits in their shorter history. As a result, the discrepancy
in the ratio between source and target artifacts exacerbates the
severityofdata imbalance insampling datasets.
Second,thenatureofsoftwaretraceabilitymakesitlikelythat
an issue will be traced back to one or more code commits, so all
potentialcodecommitsproducedduringtheissuelifecyclewere
selected as target artifacts. In an industrial setting, where code
commits are made more frequently, a greater proportion of code
commits will be selected as candidate target artifacts for issues.This will result in a substantial imbalance between candidate links
tagged‘True’andthosetagged‘False’.
2.3.2 Data Sparseness. The sparsity of data can be seen from the
following twoperspectives.
1) Feature space sparsity: The first one is the data sparsity in
the extracted feature matrix, which impairs the effectiveness of
industrialsamplingdatasets.Wedonatefeaturesetsas 𝑎1to𝑎18,
thedetaileddescriptionsshowninTable 3asdefinedin[ 59].Fig-
ure2displays the sparsity of each column in the feature matrix
(#(null)/#(all)) intwocommunitydatasets.Industrialprojectsreturn
more sparse process features (e.g., a3, a6, a9, and a12) than OSS
datasets, while textual similarity features (e.g., a17) had more valid
values. As a result, industrial projects have trouble offering mean-
ingfulprocessfeatures. Thedefinedfeaturesetsinpreviouswork
(a1toa18),whichperformwellinsixOSSprojects[ 59],however,
failtocapturethedetailsoftracelinkagesintheselectedindustrial
projects. This is because the recorded information on industrial
projects reveals incorrect metadata on derived artifacts, and the
process features can be incorrect or distorted when compared with
whatactuallyoccurs.Theassignedauthorsofissuesmay,forex-
ample, be core developers, while the code committers and fixers
may go to another developer (i.e. outsourcing developers). In an
enterprise environment, itisawidely usedcooperative solution.

is costly for developers to manually tag the links again in real-

Thus, due to the above issues, we propose a framework based
on the semi-supervised pre-processing method (SPLINT), to ad-
dressthedataimbalanceandsparsityproblemsthatareinherent
to learning-based traceability approaches and to predict better out-
comes inreal-world situations.

datarebalancing,whichisthecoreofSPLINT.Specifically,itisused
to solve one of the major challenges we discussed in Section 2.1(i.e.
reduce the effect of sampling sparsity caused by the low ratio of
existing links). Additionally, it is used to resolve the problem of
data imbalance, which is caused by the traceability approaches’
inherent difficulty and the frequent production of and evolution
ofartifactsovertime.InSPLINT,CBSTideaisincorporatedwith
SSLbyestimatingthelikelihoodforanunlabeledtracelinktobe-
long to each class instead of dependent on deterministic labels,which might exacerbate the data imbalance ratio of the training
set again. Further,we adjustedthe selectionpolicy forunlabeled
dataofclass-balancingself-training(CBST-Adjust)andsystemati-
cally investigated the effectiveness of CBST-Adjust in a real-world
scenario inthe following experiments.
3.2 Data Selection
We collected our experiment datasets from responding software
repositoriesbycleaninginitialartifactsetsandmining‘resolved’
issues and ‘not abandoned’ commits. During the data selection
phase, SPLINT extracts the cleaned artifacts and uses the adjust
time-based heuristic function 𝑖𝑠_𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 [59] for each project to
combine the candidate trace links.
Thedelayintervalsinreal-worldprojectsaredifferentinvarious
domains,setting 𝜖asastaticvariablecouldnotfitthereal-world
project context. Given that the code commits were linked with
requirements and issues that are already ‘closed’ or ‘resolved’ is
a common phenomenon, we readjusted and computed 𝜖in each
projectindividuallytoensurewecouldsampleasmanypotential
candidate target artifacts as possible.

3.3 FeatureExtraction
Textual Similarity Features. We discussed in Section 2.1how
generalprocess-relatedfeatures[ 59]areunsuitableinreal-world
industrial projects causing feature sparsity problems and under-
performing results (see Figure 2). Furthermore, ten more textual
similarityfeatureshavebeenaddedbasedonthepreviouswork[ 51]
totakefulladvantageofthesemanticinformationtohelpdistin-
guish ‘True’ from ‘False’ links (refer to Table 2) and build powerful
trace links classifier model. New features are highlighted in bold in
Table3.

between the issuedescriptionandcode messages.

combine different techniques. When normalizing the measures,
eachsimilarity measure is weighted.As a result, hybridsimilarity
measures can be generated from any two IR-based techniques. For
each technique, the weighting factor 𝜆is equal to 0.5 as similar
to[51],asthiswasthebestperformingconfigurationreportedin

linkclassifier ( 𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙) byfollowing steps:
a)BaseClassifier 𝑓𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒Learning. Abinarytracelinkclassification
problem can have either ‘True’(b) or ‘False’ (0) as the label with
equal probability (i.e. 0.5). With the help of the original labeled
imbalanced training trace set 𝐷𝑙, we have obtained a base trace
linksclassifier, 𝑓𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒.b)Pseudo-labelsGeneration. Inthedatalabelingphase,thefea-
tures matrixof theunlabeled tracedata ( 𝐷𝑢)are extracted aswell.
Specifically,thebasetracelinkclassifier 𝑓𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒isappliedtoproduce
pseudo-labels ˆ𝐷𝑢for unlabeledtrace sets.
c) Pseudo-labels Selection. For updating training trace set, the
binary pseudo-labels with high prediction probability scores (>
𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 ) are given preference to be selected, and
integratedintolabeledtracesetsonthebasisofthebaseclassifier’s
(𝑓𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒) prediction.
d) Training Set Updating. Afterˆ𝐷𝑢for unlabeled trace set 𝐷𝑢
are generated, the subset 𝑆𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑡of generated pseudo-labels of
ˆ𝐷𝑢are combined with original labeled training trace set 𝐷𝑙. The
updatingtrainingset( 𝐷𝑙∪𝑆𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑡)arearrangedaccordingtothe

usedfortrainingtracelinkmodeliterativelyforobtainingafinal
classifier 𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙untiltominimizethelossfunctiononbothmajor
andminorclasses.
Traditional SSLShortcomings. Pseudo-labels ˆ𝐷𝑢are vitalto
the outcome. Traditional self-training (ST) in SSL [ 40,63] can ef-
fectively detect binary trace links on balanced class datasets, since
the classifier’s accuracy improves with time. The traditional ST
algorithm,however,didnotfitmorepracticalscenarioswithheavy
imbalancedistribution[ 67].ToimplementSSLinthetracelinkclas-
sifier more effectively and practically, the following shortcomings
needto be addressed:
First,theheavierclassimbalancedistributioninlabeledtraceset
could cause trace link classifier to be biased, and thus generated
pseudo-labels ˆ𝐷𝑢of unlabelled trace links 𝐷𝑢could also be biased.
Infact,theuniformselectionthresholdintraditionalSTproducesa

andminorclasses,duetomajorclasseshavinghigherprobability

that, under traditional SSL algorithms [ 40,63], is either one-hot
or entirely zero. As a result of such a large logit difference, the
modelwillassignpseudo-labelsleadingtooverfitting.Therefore,
575Semi-supervisedPre-processingforLearning-BasedTraceability Framework onReal-WorldSoftware Projects ESEC/FSE ’22, November14ś18, 2022,Singapore, Singapore
this decreases the model’s adaptability and overconfidence in its
predictions. In this way, a subset of unlabeled data 𝑆𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑡ignores
minorclassesalongthetrainingprocessandtrainsanoverconfident
trace linkclassifier.
3.4.2 Pseudo-labels Generation and Selection. We used the con-
fidence regularization and CBST proposed by [ 74,75] in SSL as
references to conduct the self-training policy in step b) and c) in
order to overcome the problems mentionedabove.
Label Smoothing. At step b), the loss function instructs the
classifier to predict that a probability in the target class will con-
vergeto1and0inthenon-targetclass,i.e.generatingpseudo-labels
usingone-hotvectors.Itmakesthemodelselectthesparsepseudo-
labelswithlesscontributiontowardsthetraining.Tosmooththe
pseudo-labels, we implemented the negative entropy label regu-
larizer (LRENT) proposed in [ 75] and let the model choose the
pseudo-labels with smoothness instead of sparse ones. Specifically,
regularizedlabelsreducetheconfidence(themaxofoutputsoftmax)
andraisethe probability level for otherclasses.
Class-BalancingSelf-Training(CBST). Toensuremorebal-
ancedpseudo-labelselectioninstepc),weusedtheCBSTpolicy.
The threshold property 𝑇𝑧is transformed into a pseudo-label by
normalizingitwithatargetclass 𝑧.Forclass 𝑧,𝑇𝑧isaparameterfor

CBST-Adjust. The data distribution in 𝑆𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑡obtained from
CBST framework is still biased toward major classes, due to the
numberofunlabeleddatawithprobabilityrankedat 𝑝𝑧∗100%in
major class is far larger than that in minor class. As an example,unlabeled trace set 𝐷𝑢contains approximately (N*10,000) ‘False’
linksand(N*100)‘True’links.Subsetprobabilities 𝑇𝑧formajorand

and𝑆𝑢,1≈ (𝑁∗10)minorclasseswereselectedin 𝑆𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑡.Thisis
duetothefactthatmostpseudo-labelsarepredictedas‘False’links
withhigherprobabilities,thus,evenwithsuchahighprobability
threshold, still return a substantial amount of pseudo-labels for
major classes that could be higher than the selection threshold
𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑗𝑜𝑟. We used the sampling rate introduced in by Wei et al. [ 67]
to select more pseudo-labels from minor classes in the subsequent
iterationofSSLtoobtainalessbiasedtracelinkclassifier.Unlabeled
tracelinks thatarepredictedasmajor classesappearin 𝑆𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑡as
the balance of 𝑟1=(#𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒/#𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒)𝛼, and𝑟0=(#𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒/#𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒)𝛼,
where𝛼≥0tunesthe sampling, respectively.
Also, it should be noted that there are other mechanisms to
smooth and select pseudo-labels in class-balancing policies [ 71] of
SSL, and we merely use one of the simple and effective strategies.
3.4.3 Re-sampling. The SSL framework is also compatible with
existing re-sampling methods, hence, we used SMOTE [ 16] on
updated training set 𝐷𝑙∪𝑆𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑡in each round of SSL phase, to
generate minor trace instances artificially by interpolating data
from knownminorcasesinsampling data.
4 EXPERIMENTSETUP
This experiment investigates the following research questions:
•RQ1:CanSPLINTbettersupportautomatictracelinkpredictiontasks
in real-world projects?
•RQ2: How is each component enhanced in SPLINT contributing to
effectiveness?
•RQ3:HowdoesdifferentCBST-Adjustparametersimpacttheeffec-
tivenessofSPLINT?
In order to answer our three research questions, we conducted
the several experiments with six OSS software projects and ten
industrialprojects.

is used to measure the classifier’s performance as a trade-off be-
tween precision and recall. In traceability research, higher recall is
arguablymoreimportantthanprecisioninpractice[ 43].Hence,we
report the best F2 scores in our experiments by enumerating the
thresholds. AUC is the global area under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curve that is independent and robust of class
distributions of the sample dataset [ 13,41]. The performance of
the classifier was evaluated using the AUC when imbalance effects
were eliminated.

4.2.1 Comparison Experiment. As SPLINT is an enhancing ap-
proach based on ML-based traceability, we compared it with the
state-of-the-art supervised ML-based trace link classifier proposed
by Rath et al. [ 59]. Throughout the research, we aim to explore
whether SPLINT can mitigate some of the challenges hindering
current traceability approaches in practice. To what extent can per-
formance improvements be achieved tosupport traceability tasks.

Acomparisonofthedifferentvaluesof 𝑝/𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 withthe

of AUC showed an increase trend no matter what 𝑝/𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒
values were used. However, continually addingunlabeled samples
to the training set resulted in a slight decline in the latter round.

But there are clear boundaries between different sampling rates

in order to strengthen the performance on ‘True’ links because

pseudo-labeled samples towards minority classes. Indeed, large
𝛼achieves better AUC as shown in Figure 6(b). Across multiple
parameter configurations, we find that 𝛼=1achieves the best
class-rebalancing strength.
AswiththetrendsinFigure 6(b),inthetailrounds,itwasstill
difficult to avoid the low-quality samples found within selected
pseudo-labels hindering the models’ performance. CBST-Adjust,

CBST-Adjust is sensitive to different configurations of hyper-

6.1 LessonsLearned
Specifically,ourpaperempiricallyanalyzedtwogeneralchallenges
oflearning-basedtraceabilityapproachesinindustrialprojects,data
sparsityandimbalance,whichenablesresearchersandpractitioners
tobetterunderstandthereasonbehindtheunderperformanceof
current automated traceability techniques in practice. As part of
our objectives, SPLINT indeed improved the effectiveness of the
baseline trace link classifier model and classic IR model across
industrialandOSS projectsas showninour study.
Asalimitationofourstudy,weexaminedonlyissues-commit
links recovery tasks. Ideally, enterprises strive to ensure end-to-
end traceability, including traceability between artifacts generated
during various activities, including architecture design, detailed
design,coding,testing,andmaintenance.Aconnectionshouldalso
existbetweeneachoftwoartifacts.Asamatteroffact,differentar-
tifactsaregeneratedbydifferentroleswithindifferentteams.With
more developers and tighter schedule pressure, coding activities
may cause more severe traceability issues. Thus, ensuring code-
relatedtraceabilityshouldbenefitmoreusersandhaveabroader
impact. There is a higher demand for companies for creating, re-
covering,andmaintainingcode-relatedartifacts’traceability(e.g.,
codecommitsandsourcecode)Indeed,SPLINTneedstobefurther
investigated for the potential of recovering other types of artifacts’
traceability.Whenlearning-basedapproachesareusedtotracetwo
artifacts,webelieveSPLINTisaviableoption.Ourfutureworkwill

artifacts,e.g.,testcases-to-code,wealsoexpecttouseintermediate
artifacts, e.g., requirement [ 61] to improve our approach. Addi-
tionally, a more detailed validation and analysis of SPLINT across
variousorganizations’ projectsisrequiredinthe near future.
WeobservethatSPLINTisnotyetabletoachievesatisfactory
performance in industrial projects. Source code file information is
limited(becauseofconfidentiality),sowewerenotabletomeasure
the most crucial feature, i.e. textual similarity between the most
similar committed source code file and the issue [ 59]. We therefore
only measured the textual similarity of two artifact descriptions
bysegmentingChinesewordsusing Jiebaandcalculatingtheco-
sinesimilaritythrough tf-idfschema.Anothermainreasonsisthat
existing linkstaggedbyhumans havea largeproportionofincor-
rect ground truthtrace linksinlabeled data.In real-life situations,
finding the really useful and correct links to form training samples
isoneofthemajorchallengesoflearning-basedapproaches.Itispossibletoincreasegroundtruthtracelinkaccuracybyusing active
learning[49,56]toselectrepresentativeandlessdatafortraining
rather than all labeled data at once. Although this requires some
effortfromdevelopers,thedatasetswilleliminateincorrectlinks
and train models based on representative data. Furthermore, the
incorporationofactivelearningintoSSLmechanisms[ 31]might
leadto more beneficialresults.
Finally, as discussed in RQ3, the optimal configuration of hyper-
parameters with the appropriate iteration rounds needs further
studytoensurethequalityofselectedunlabeledsamplesanden-
hancethestrengthofclass-balancingmechanismwhenapplying
CBST-Adjust to support real-world traceability with large imbal-

7 RELATED WORK
7.1 AutomaticTraceability Approaches
The studies have devoted considerable effort to developing new
approaches to automatic traceability. The most commonly used
approachesincludeIRtechniques(e.g.,VSM[ 33,69],LSI[36,46],
JS [2]) to rank artifacts or candidate links based on document sim-
ilarity. Further, the topic modeling techniques, e.g., LDA [ 8,53]
579Semi-supervisedPre-processingforLearning-BasedTraceability Framework onReal-WorldSoftware Projects ESEC/FSE ’22, November14ś18, 2022,Singapore, Singapore
andNonNegative MatrixFactorization(NMF)[ 51]can effectively
captureuniqueinformation.Thus,weappliedhybridtextualsim-
ilarity measures used in[ 51] to achieve deep parsing into textual
similarity features to mitigate sparseness in features matrix for
real-world industrial applications. The learning-based models (e.g.,
RCLinker [ 39], TRAIL [ 50]) to traceability is also being used for
developing classifiers that can determine whether the links are
related[26,45].Comparativelytopreviousstudiesthatproposed
ML-basedapproaches,ourworkdoesnotonlyfocusonapplying
aML-basedtracelinkmodelbutalsoempiricallyinvestigatesthe
reasonsforML-basedmodelsperformpoorlyinreal-worldprojects.
Few studies have examined possible solutions to the data imbal-
ance problem. Researchers have used under-sampling to rebalance
the training set when modeling trace links [ 39,59,64]. Contrary
to this, TRAIL [ 50] suggests the use of oversampling (SMOTE).

ios,[35,38].Differentfrompreviousworks,weincorporatesemi-

which has the ability to predict trace links better with unlabeled
sets,aswellasmitigateimbalancesbyincorporatingtheadjusted
CBST policy. Furthermore, integrating semi-supervised learning
strategies help mitigate the problems caused by data sparsity as
well as the limited amount of training data, which is one of the
obvious weaknesses of [ 43,49]. Other previous studies provide
some specific solutions for limited data challenge, such as using
deep learning techniques (TraceBERT [ 43]), capturing developer
feedback [ 51], and integrating active learning [ 49]. Despite this,
thesesolutionshavenotbeenempiricallyevaluatedinvariousscale
real-worldindustrialprojects.OurpaperdemonstratesthatSPLINT
is more effective than a state-of-the-art supervised approach, as
evidencedbyboththeOSSaswellasindustrialcommunityprojects.
7.2EmpiricalEvaluationonIndustrialDatasets
Ingeneral,researchersexamined theevaluationoftraceabilityap-
proaches onindustrial datasets inlessclosely related research[ 20,
28,52,73]. This is largely due to the availability of industrial
datasets.Severalrecentpublicationshaveconcentratedonempir-
ical analyses on real-world traceability applications [ 6,9,11,60].
Forexample,thepriorworkusedIRtechniquestorecoverthetrace

found that scaling IR techniques to industry data is challenging.

veloper feedback, and transitive links, Moran et al. [ 51] implement

system(i.e.Cisco). anddevelopedaJenkinsPlugin.
The work we do contributes to the two newly identified chal-
lenges (i.e. the availability of traceability datasets and the appli-
cation of traceability approaches in real-world scenarios) in the
2017 Grand Challenges of Traceability [ 6], in order to facilitate
theapplicationoftraceabilityapproachestoreal-worldsituations.
The focus of our work is not only on real-world applications of
traceability approaches, but also on exploring the root causes ofunderperformanceoflearning-basedtraceabilityapproachesem-
pirically by analyzing data based on multiple scales of industry
systemsfrom alarge ICT enterprise.
7.3 Semi-SupervisedLearning in Traceability
RecentpapershavestartedimprovingSSLapproachesfortheim-
balanceddistributionofdataincomputervisionresearch[ 37,67,
70]. In two similar studies, the use of unlabeled data was investi-
gated[10,49].Bellaetal.[ 10]presentedasemi-supervisedlearning
approach based on IR-based similarity measures. This technique
involves choosing the training set heuristically based on the IR re-
sults.Ascomparedtotheheuristicthresholdsuggestedin[ 10],our
adjusted framework (CBST-Adjust) is more practical and effective
in mitigating the data imbalance and sparsity problems encoun-
teredinreal-worldsettings.Millsetal.,[ 49]usedactivelearning
(ALCATRAL) and trace link classifier to work with less training
data. Active learning is suggested for preparing initial labeled data
for training purposes, which is then verified by developers. The
difficultyliesinthefactthat,afteralongevolution,trainingdata
is difficult to tag. In this paper, we propose a trace link classifier
frameworkwithSSLtogenerateunlabeleddataautomaticallyto
eliminaterepetitive manual labeling.

Traceability framework (SPLINT) with the incorporationof an ad-
justed class-balancing self-training in semi-supervised learning
(SSL) mechanism and hybrid semantic similarities. It is capable
of solving data imbalance and sparsity problems encountered in
real-world projects. SPLINT was evaluated on six large-scale open-
sourceprojectsandtenindustrialprojectsselectedfromourpart-
ners. The results were compared against two state-of-the-art trace-
ability approaches (simple IR and classic trace links classifiers [ 59]
that are used to predict issue-commit trace links. SPLINT was also
examined separately for the contributions of incorporated compo-
nents. Evaluation results confirm hybrid semantic similarity and
