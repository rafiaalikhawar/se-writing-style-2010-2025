ABSTRACT
Cloud services are omnipresent and critical cloud service failure
is a fact of life. In order to retain customers and prevent revenue
loss, it is important to provide high reliability guarantees for these
services. One way to do this is by predicting outages in advance,
which can help in reducing the severity as well as time to recovery.
It is difficult to forecast critical failures due to the rarity of these
events. Moreover, critical failures are ill-defined in terms of observ-
able data. Our proposed method, Outage-Watch , defines critical
service outages as deteriorations in the Quality of Service (QoS)
captured by a set of metrics. Outage-Watch detects such outages
in advance by using current system state to predict whether the
QoS metrics will cross a threshold and initiate an extreme event. A
mixture of Gaussian is used to model the distribution of the QoS
metrics for flexibility and an extreme event regularizer helps in
improving learning in tail of the distribution. An outage is predicted
if the probability of any one of the QoS metrics crossing threshold
changes significantly. Our evaluation on a real-world SaaS com-
pany dataset shows that Outage-Watch significantly outperforms
traditional methods with an average AUC of 0.98. Additionally,
Outage-Watch detects all the outages exhibiting a change in ser-
vice metrics and reduces the Mean Time To Detection (MTTD) of
outages by up to 88%when deployed in an enterprise cloud-service
system, demonstrating efficacy of our proposed method.

1 INTRODUCTION
The use of cloud services for deploying applications has seen a
tremendous growth. According to a recent report [ 4], about 94%
of enterprises already use cloud services. However, these cloud
services, with numerous components, are complex and prone to fail-
ures [ 29,64] and outages [ 46,47] due to frequent updates, changes
in operation, repairs, and device mobility. Cloud providers offer
services with specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, which
are technical specifications defining various aspects of system qual-
ity, such as performance, availability, scalability, and serviceability.
These QoS requirements are driven by business needs outlined in
the business requirements. Any failure to meet these predefined
QoS standards can lead to Service Level Agreement (SLA) viola-
tions, resulting in revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction [ 39].
A study1found that a 3-6 day outage by a leading cloud provider
in the US could result in $15 billion loss. As a result, cloud system

reliability is critical for business success, as outages can severely
impact QoS metrics (resource availability, latency, etc.) resulting in
compromised system availability and a poor user experience.
Several monitoring and alerting tools (refer §3) are employed to
monitor and ensure the performance of cloud services. Automating
system troubleshooting has been found to improve reliability, effi-
ciency, and agility for enterprises [ 25,31,57]. Despite these efforts,
cloud systems still experience incidents and outages [ 12,15,38].
Timely detection and remediation of outages is essential for reduc-
ing system downtime. However, a reactive approach to incident
detection is often used in practice, hindering effective outage man-
agement [ 23,50,83]. With a possible innovation in being able to
predict the outages well in advance, the time to detect these outages
can be reduced significantly.
Consider a real-world scenario in Figure 1 showing the timeline
of an outage caused by a flawed configuration change in a Storage
service. In this scenario, a 3:54 am (A) failure sparked a sequence
of problems, including SQL errors at 4:10 am and an increase in
latency that starts affecting the QoS at 4:18 am (B). Alerts were
triggered at 5:08 am when latency exceeded pre-defined thresholds.
It took nearly 55 minutes (from 4:18 am (B)) to realize it was a
cross-service issue and declare an outage at 5:12 am (C). An ex-
perienced Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) [ 14,39] was engaged to
mitigate the issue, which was resolved at 6:15 am (D) with all ser-
vices back to normal. Here, the flawed change impacted several
SQL databases and spread to other services. The current reactive
approach relying on alerts showed significant delay in detecting
the outage, as seen by the ramp up in underlying metrics affecting
QoS between 4:18 am (B) and 5:12 am (C). This example highlights
the potential to predict a substantial fraction of outages in advance
by utilizing the information available during the ramp-up phase. In
consideration of the strict downtime constraints, with only 500 to
50 minutes of allowable downtime per year corresponding to the
uptime guarantees of 99.9% and 99.99% respectively, the early detec-
tion of outages, even minutes in advance, can result in significant
benefits. The objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive
solution aimed at reducing the mean time to detection (MTTD)
through early detection of outages.
Outages manifest in two major ways, (i) as degradation in QoS
and other metrics, (ii) detected only through user reports and do not
manifest in observable metrics. The first type of outages, account-
ing for 50-70% of the incidents as observed from our data (see §6),
exhibit characteristics that allow for prediction. However, outage
prediction in cloud systems is a complex task due to the vast num-
ber of interdependent metrics. An SRE, who traditionally detect
outages using rule-based alerts, often only have a limited view of
the overall system, leading to difficulties in quickly and accurately
identifying issues. Such approaches rely on human knowledge and
is insufficient for large-scale production cloud systems, which have
a vast number of complex and ever-changing rules. Our interviews
with engineers from various service teams revealed that detection
could take hours, particularly in cases where there are multiple
concurrent alerts. This highlights the importance of developing a
more efficient method for predicting outages in cloud systems.
Previous works [ 23,45,50] on failure prediction through runtime
monitoring which requires a substantial amount of data from the
faulty state of the system are not applicable in this scenario, as
Figure 1: Illustration of the life-cycle of an outage. A refers to
the point when the root cause of a fault occurred, B represents
the time when it started affecting the performance metrics.
When the metrics crossed their respective thresholds, alerts
fired which led to an outage being declared at C. The time
between C to D is when the engineers diagnose and resolve
the issue. The plots below show the variation in the root
cause metric and the QoS metric at these times.
outages are rare events [ 3] and hence, data is not available in the
faulty state in plenty. In addition, using alerts to detect outages takes
a toll on MTTD since they are fired after a significant ramp-up in
metrics has been identified. Failure detection literature from other
domains [ 13,58] are not extensible to our case since the nature and
the quantity of failures is very different in an enterprise service.
Our scenario has very few outages and directly extending those
works fail.
In this work, we propose a novel system ( Outage-Watch ) for
predicting outages in cloud services to enhance early detection. We
define outages as extreme events where deterioration in the QoS
captured by a set of metrics goes beyond control. Outage-Watch
models the variations of QoS metrics as a mixture of Gaussian
to predict their distribution. We also introduce a classifier that is
trained in a multi-task setting with extreme value loss to learn
the distribution better at the tail, thus acting as a regularizer [ 67].
Outage-Watch predicts an outage if there is a significant change
in the probability of the QoS metrics exceeding the threshold. Our
evaluation on real-world data from an enterprise system shows
significant improvement over traditional methods with an average
AUC of 0.98. Furthermore, we deployed Outage-Watch in a cloud
system to predict outages, which resulted in a 100% recall and
reduced MTTD by up to 88% (20 - 60 minutes reduction).
Our major contributions can be summarized as follows:
(1)We propose a novel approach Outage-Watch to predict out-
ages in advance, which are manifested as large deteriorations
in a chosen set of metrics (QoS) reflecting customer experi-
ence degradation. Outage-Watch works even in the absence
of actual outages in training data.
(2)Outage-Watch generates the probability of a metric cross-
ing any threshold, making it flexible to define the threshold,
unlike classification tasks. It predicts the distribution of QoS
metric values in future given current system state, and im-
proves learning the tail distribution via extreme value loss
to capture outages before they happen.
(3)An evaluation of the approach on real service data shows an
improvement of 7−15%over the baselines in terms of AUC,Outage-Watch : Early Prediction of Outages using Extreme Event Regularizer ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA
while its deployment in a real setting was able to predict all
the outages which exhibited any change in the observable
metrics, thus reducing the MTTD.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We briefly talk
about related works in Section 2 followed by the background and
problem formulation in Section 3. In Section 4 and 5 we outline the
motivation and describe Outage-Watch . With Section 7 analyzing
its performance, we conclude in Section 8.
2 RELATED WORK
Service reliability has been a well-researched area in both academia
and industry [ 18,21,23,45,50]. Several works have attempted
to address the problems of detecting, localizing, and mitigating
outages and failures. Alerts are often used in detecting outages [ 48,
53,84], which are triggered when a system fault occurs and metric
values crosses a threshold. Recent approaches such as AirAlert [ 23],
Fog of War [ 50], and eWarn [ 83] compute features based on alerts
and predict outages using tree-based models. However, alerts only
trigger when a system is already in a critical state, thus incurring
low reduction in MTTD.
Previous research in the area of time series forecasting consti-
tutes a relevant body of literature since changes in metric value time
series can be forecasted to detect outages. Classical auto-regressive
models [ 10,41] to predict future metric values have limitations
that have been overcome by recent advancements in deep neural
network (DNN) based models, such as RNNs, LSTMs and GRUs,
which have proven to be more effective in modelling time series
data [ 27,32,43,55,70,78]. Empirical evidence supports the use of
these deep recurrent models for time series prediction [54, 63, 85].
However, they perform poorly [ 49] in predicting rare events like
outages due to imbalanced data [ 49,56], also known as extreme
events [ 11,36]. Predicting extreme events remains a challenging
and active area of research [35, 42].
Recent studies [ 33,49] have attempted to address the challenge
of forecasting extreme events in time series data through innova-
tive DNN architectures. [ 49] employs an auto-encoder for feature
extraction while [ 33] uses an Extreme Value Loss (EVL) function.
However, modelling point prediction of extreme events as classifica-
tion task would need re-estimation of the model if the threshold def-
inition changes for defining such events. However, Outage-Watch
sets itself apart by combining the EVL function with LSTM and
predicting the future distribution of events using a mixture normal
network, thus allowing a flexible change of threshold.
In the domain of reliability engineering, prior studies have con-
centrated on detecting anomalies in time series data for monitoring
systems [ 26]. Supervised anomaly detection models like [ 24,50,61]
are effective in predicting anomalies, but they require a substantial
amount of labelled data, making them unsuitable for our applica-
tion. On the other hand, unsupervised methods [ 81] can be used
to identify anomalies in data without the need for labelled data.
More recently, ML-based models including autoencoders and trans-
formers are used for anomaly detection in seasonal metric time
series [ 60,73,75]. However, they are limited to detecting events as
they happen and lack interpretability to distinguish significant ser-
vice degradation. Our approach differs by predicting the probability
of metric exceeding threshold through its probability distributionanalysis, instead of simply detecting whether the actual metric
crosses a threshold or not, as in traditional anomaly detection.
In related literature of failure detection, several efforts have been
made to predict specific types of failures, utilizing large sets of
system logs and metrics [ 59,77,80]. Our approach differs in pre-
dicting general incidents based on a limited set of relevant metrics,
determined by domain knowledge. Previous works like [ 13,34,58]
have used ML and DNN techniques to predict disk failures. A com-
parison of disk failure prediction methods was presented in [ 58].
However, they are not suitable for predicting rare and extreme
outages. Our approach, based on distribution forecasting, is flexible
and outperforms some of the baselines discussed in [58].
3BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM DEFINITION
In this section, we briefly describe basic monitoring system con-
cepts, followed by the problem formulation.
Monitoring Metrics: In any enterprise level service deploy-
ment, reliability engineers monitor the performance of these de-
ployed services. Various monitoring tools like grafana [ 5], new-
relic [ 7], splunk [ 8], etc. are employed to monitor the services and
collect service metrics that can be used to measure the performance
of the system. Monitoring metrics provide the most granular infor-
mation, with these tools recording them at specific time intervals.
Alerts: Alerts are defined on monitoring metrics. Whenever
these metrics cross a certain pre-defined threshold defined by the
reliability engineers, an alert is triggered. They represent system
events that require attention, such as API timeouts, exceeding re-
sponse latencies, service errors and network jitters. An alert con-
tains several fields like the alert definition, time of alert, which
service fired the alert, text description of the alert, datacenter re-
gion where the alert was fired and severity level which can be
"high", "medium" or "low".
Extreme Events: An extreme event is characterized by a set
of monitoring metrics exceeding their respective thresholds (95%-
ile metric threshold based on our data), causing unusual system
behaviour. This results in multiple alerts with varying levels of
severity being triggered, prompting engineers to take action. It’s
important to note that not all extreme events lead to outages, as they
may not necessarily indicate a fault in the system. Extreme events
which lead to outages cause violations in Service Level Agreements
(SLAs). Extreme events can be perceived as situations when the
system starts showing signs of degradation, and the metric values
surpass their 95 or 99%-ile thresholds. In addition, it is important to
note that extreme events are not recorded as separate incidents. We
generate proxy labels (see §5.1.3) to identify the extreme events.
Outage: In general, outages are declared under severe situations,
when extreme events persist for a long time, leading to a degrada-
tion in the service quality and often leading to a customer impact.
Often, outages affect multiple services where a fault propagates
based on service dependency. Mitigating outages require cross-team
collaboration. An outage usually triggers correlated alerts [ 22,82]
and escalates from a single or a group of alerts. Not all extreme
events manifest as an outage since engineers manage these systems
through constant monitoring, and they identify and intervene in
the system during potential issues even before they escalate into
full-scale outage.ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA S Agarwal, S Chakraborty, S Garg, S Bisht, C Jain, A Gonuguntla, S Saini
3.1 Problem Formulation
We now formally define our problem statement. Metrics M𝑡𝑜𝑡are
continuously monitored in the system, essentially forming a time
series. The task is to understand the trends in some or all of the
metrics inM𝑡𝑜𝑡and predict an impending outage, with the goal
of predicting it as early as possible. It is obvious that a change in
the metrics will show up only when a fault has occurred. Thus, the
goal of an outage forecasting solution is to minimize the lag time
between the actual occurrence of the fault and its identification as
an extreme event, while also minimizing false positive cases.
With𝑡as the wall-clock time, the input to the outage forecasting
module is a set of relevant metrics (see §5.1.1) from [𝑡−𝑤,𝑡]where
𝑤is the window length. More details on the pre-processing of
metrics is elucidated in §5.1.2. With ground-truth labels generated
based on the occurrence of extreme events, the supervised ML
model Outage-Watch aims to forecast an outage by learning the
distribution of the relevant metrics at a certain time in the future. A
distribution of metrics is essentially a probability density function
of the metric values at a certain time.
4 SOLUTION MOTIVATION
In this section, we present the rationale behind our solution design
and provide a concise overview of how it functions.
Figure 2: Multiple performance metrics, some of which are
QoS metric gets impacted during an outage. The collective
information from all these metrics help in detecting the
outage. A, B and D corresponds to the time defined in Fig. 1
4.1 Design Motivation
As discussed in §1, outage prediction models should aim to predict
the probability of an outage in advance to ensure timely recovery
during a fault. One way to achieve this is to monitor the system
metrics for deviations from their regular trend, as these deviations
are often indicative of an outage. However, the current system
monitoring tools often fail to detect deviations until they surpass
a specific threshold and activate an alert, provided that an alert
has been defined for those system metrics. However, proactive
monitoring of system metrics allows for earlier and more efficient
identification of outages. This motivates the design of our proposed
approach, Outage-Watch .
We have observed from the data (Figure 2) that during an outage,
multiple metrics [ 1] show disturbances and deviations from trends
simultaneously. These metrics progressively become more extreme
and affect multiple interdependent services. Outage-Watch takes
multiple monitoring metrics as input and aims to predict the futurebehaviour or change in the values of certain metrics (which we refer
to as Quality of Service (QoS) metrics, and will be further defined in
§5.1.1). By predicting the distribution of these metrics in advance,
we can compute the probability of an upcoming outage based on the
likelihood of the metric value crossing a certain threshold. These
thresholds can be dynamic and may be defined by Service Level
Agreements (SLAs) on QoS metrics for each service.
Why do we need to learn the distribution of metrics? Out-
ages are often scarce in any established production-level service.
Hence, if the outage prediction task is modelled as a simple classifi-
cation problem, a machine learning model will tend to fail even after
the imbalance in the dataset is addressed, because of the extremely
skewed distribution of data points coming from one class (outage
occurrences). For example, it is often the case that one observes
only two outages over a period of 6 months. However, one way
to circumvent this issue is to design our problem as a distribution
learning task. We then have a corresponding metric value at every
timestamp of the data, and a learned regression model can predict
a metric value at any other time stamp. We can also use the same
strategy to learn a more accurate distribution in the tail, where
extreme events are often manifested. This allows the flexibility of
constructing the entire distribution and using variable threshold
based on Service Level Agreements (SLA) requirements.
We provide further technical details on how the model predicts
the distribution of the relevant metrics and how it can be used to
predict outages in subsequent sections.
4.2 Architecture Overview
The proposed framework of Outage-Watch (Fig. 3) comprises two
main phases: a metric processing phase (denoted as 1in Fig. 3 and
a distribution learning phase (denoted as 2in Fig. 3). Module 1
first selects the relevant metrics that will be used to forecast the
outages, pre-processes them and then generates proxy labels . What
we mean by labels here and why do we need to generate them will
be elucidated in details in §5.1.3. On the other hand, module 2
forecasts the outage by predicting the distribution of the relevant
metrics selected from phase 1at a future time.
In order for the distribution learner to predict outages at a future
time𝑡+𝛾where𝛾is the prediction look-ahead, the machine learning
algorithm must learn from the appropriate ground truth. Thus, with
input data at 𝑡, the ground truth is constructed such that our method
can predict the distribution of the metrics at time 𝑡+𝛾and hence
predict potential outages. The distribution learner framework first
uses a metric encoder to encode the system state in the past trend
of monitoring metrics, and then the distribution of the relevant
metrics is forecasted using a Mixture Density Network (MDN).
MDN aims to predict the parameters of the forecasted distribution.
Additionally, the framework uses a classifier as an extreme value
regularizer for better learning in the tail of the distribution. The
technical details are presented in §5.2.
Though the pipeline is trained to predict the parametric distri-
bution of metrics, inference on whether and when the outage is
being detected need to be developed. §5.4 focuses on identifying
the likelihood of outages by evaluating the probability of each of
the relevant metric crossing a defined threshold. If there is a sudden
increase in the probability of exhibiting extreme values based on theOutage-Watch : Early Prediction of Outages using Extreme Event Regularizer ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA

phase. The distribution and label prediction generated from (2) at time step 𝑡are evaluated against ground-truth metric value

distribution learnt, Outage-Watch takes this as an indication of an
outage. A thresholding mechanism is employed on the probability
value to predict an outage.
5OUTAGE-WATCH
In §4.2, we have discussed the overall architecture of Outage-Watch
and talked about its two main components briefly. We shall now
delve into the details of each component.
5.1 Metric Processing
5.1.1 Metric Selection and Quality of Service (QoS) Metrics (Fig.
3[1A]). The monitoring tools collect a large set of service metrics
M𝑡𝑜𝑡for a system. However, many such metrics recorded by these
tools are often never used by the SREs [ 2]. Also, storage and han-
dling of metrics data is non-scalable and gets expensive over time.
Consequently, we derived a condensed subset of metrics, denoted
asM. In our specific scenario, we filtered down the number of
metrics from∼2000 inM𝑡𝑜𝑡[6] to 42 using a step-wise procedure.
We employed established techniques [ 62] for feature selection
process. Firstly, features were filtered using correlation analysis
and rank coefficient tests. Then, time series features that were
constant throughout the time series or exhibited low variance were
omitted due to their limited informational value. To refine our
feature set further, we incorporated domain-specific knowledge:
retaining only those metrics that either trigger alerts or have been
emphasized in previous outage analysis reports that are generated
post-identification and mitigation of outages by engineers. This
process yielded a focused feature set well-suited for effective service
monitoring and analysis.
However, only a fraction of Mdirectly reflects the service quality
as perceived by the customer, for example, latency of a service,
number of service failure errors, resource availability, etc. These
metrics, known as Quality of Service (QoS) metricsM𝑄𝑜𝑆or the
golden metrics [ 16], are used by the SRE to define outages. These
metrics are crucial to monitor because cloud service providers face
revenue loss if QoS is not met due to violations of Service Level
Agreements (SLAs). Based on the alert severity used by the SRE team
and the SLA definitions, we select five golden metrics comprising
of (i) Workload, (ii) CPU Utilization, (iii) Memory Utilization (iv)
Latency, and (v) Errors. These metrics are often used for system
monitoring in industries and have been utilized in prior works [ 19,51]. The golden signals can often refer to different metrics based
on service components. For example, the latency metric refer to
disk I/O latency for storage service, web transaction time for web
services, query latency for databases, etc.
Outage-Watch uses the entire set of metrics M, to forecast the
likelihood thatM𝑄𝑜𝑆metrics will surpass a threshold in the future.
We do not specifically forecast the likelihood of metric values of
M\M𝑄𝑜𝑆crossing the threshold since these capture small issues
which propagates within the system and gets manifested into the
QoS metrics. Also, QoS metrics capture the user impact directly. It
should be noted that our choice of M𝑄𝑜𝑆is based on system domain
knowledge which we gathered from the inputs from reliability
engineers on the most important metrics that define an outage.
Nonetheless, our approach will work in the same way for a different
set ofM𝑄𝑜𝑆metrics.
5.1.2 Pre-processing (Fig. 3[1B]). After the selection of metrics M,
we handle the missing values differently for different category of
metrics. For some metrics, a missing value might indicate a null
value, which can be replaced with a zero. For other metrics, the rows
containing missing values may be dropped. For example, if there
are missing values in a metric that defines an error, these can be
replaced with zeroes, as this indicates that there were no errors in
the service. However, if there are missing values in utilization-based
metrics, it may be necessary to drop those rows, as the missing
values could be due to a fault with the monitoring system. Once
the missing values are handled, each metric 𝑚𝑖is normalized using
Equation 1.
𝑚𝑖=𝑚𝑖−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑚𝑖)
𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑚𝑖)−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑚𝑖)+𝜖(1)
Following this, we create a time series of Mmetrics with a
rolling-window of size 𝑤. That is, for each time instant 𝑡and metric
𝑚𝑖∈M , we create a time series 𝑚𝑖𝑤={𝑚𝑖
𝑡−𝑤,...,𝑚𝑖
𝑡}, where𝑚𝑖
𝑡
refers to the value of the metric 𝑚𝑖at𝑡𝑡ℎtime instant. We thus
create𝑋={𝑚1𝑤,𝑚2𝑤,...,𝑚|M|
𝑤}, which forms a sequence of metric
values that can be used as an input to our encoder model.
5.1.3 Label Generation (Fig. 3[1C]). In real-world production ser-
vices, outages are rare due to the robust deployment architecture
and constant monitoring system in place. SREs often intervene to
prevent the full-scale outages resulting in a rarity of such events.
However, these potential issues when interventions are performedESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA S Agarwal, S Chakraborty, S Garg, S Bisht, C Jain, A Gonuguntla, S Saini
can still be considered as extreme situations (see §3), which will
allows us to better understand the system’s behaviour and predict
critical issues in advance. Thus, instead of having the time periods
when an outage was actually declared as the ground truth, we mod-
ify our definition of labels to the time periods of extreme events.
Such modifications facilitate us in forecasting the distribution of the
relevant metrics. However, the challenge of labelling the data during
these extreme events remain. To address this issue, we perform the
following algorithmic steps that incorporates domain knowledge
to generate proxy labels for outages or extreme situations.
(1)Take𝑤′minutes windows for each of the metrics 𝑚𝑖from
the setM𝑄𝑜𝑆.
(2)Select those windows where the value of 𝑚𝑖crosses a per-
centile thresholdTfor at least𝛼fraction of𝑤′window.
(3)Filter the previously obtained time windows by keeping only
those where at least kalerts were fired in the system.
These chosen time windows serve as proxy labels for extreme
events. Here, we take 𝑤′as 10 minutes,Tas 95,𝛼as0.5,kas 1.
These steps indirectly incorporate domain knowledge to accu-
rately generate labels for outages and extreme situations using
alerts defined by SRE. This process not only allows us to create a
denser labelling of extreme events, which can aid in the prediction
of potential outages or situations that could have escalated to an
outage in advance, but it also includes some less severe cases, which
can aid in model training recall. The proxy labels serve as positive
training samples for the model.
5.2 Distribution Forecasting
Through this module, Outage-Watch aims to learn how the QoS
metrics will behave in a future time to forecast the probability of
an outage. We outline the component details below.
5.2.1 Metric-Encoder (Fig. 3[2A]). Before we can learn the distri-
bution of QoS metrics, we must encode the past behaviour of the
service metrics which captures the system state as a latent vector
representation. Metric-Encoder extracts information via ML tech-
nique to encode spatial as well as temporal relation [ 69] between
the metrics. Spatial correlation captures how each behaviour of
metric𝑚𝑖∈M affects the QoS metrics M𝑄𝑜𝑆, while the tempo-
ral dependence captures the time series trend in 𝑋. Though both
statistical and ML-based techniques have been studied in this re-
gard [ 20,44,52,74], it has been shown that ML-based models, and
especially Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models outperform
conventional methods [ 70] in encoding a time series due to their
ability to capture sequential dependencies and temporal patterns
in data. Several RNN-based models like Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) [ 43] or Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) [ 40,68] models can
be used for our purpose. Based on our experimental results with
various RNN architectures (see §7.1.1), we choose BiLSTM as the
metric encoder model.
LSTM uses gating mechanism to control information encoding,
while the hidden state ( ℎ𝑡), a multi-dimensional vector, maintains
the encoding of the input time series. BiLSTMs extend LSTMs by
applying two LSTMs, one forward and one backward, to input data
to capture information from both directions. The Metric-Encoder
takes𝑋as input and outputs a vector representation ( ℎ) capturing
the temporal and spatial relationship of the metrics.5.2.2 Multi-Task Learning. We propose a multi-task learning [ 17,
66] problem, where one task is to learn the distribution of each QoS
metric𝑦∈M𝑄𝑜𝑆from the Metric-Encoder output, while the other
task classifies the Metric-Encoder output as an outage or not. We
now describe each of the task in detail.
Task 1: Distribution Learning (Fig. 3[2B]). The first task
aims to learn a parametric distribution governing the QoS met-
rics conditional on the encoded system state representation. More
precisely, given a time series of metrics 𝑋which was encoded to
form a vector ℎ, we wish to estimate the probability of a metric
𝑦∈M𝑄𝑜𝑆given𝑋,𝑝(𝑦|𝑋). Learning a distribution is essentially
learning the parameters governing it. In general, the metric 𝑦is
often assumed to follow a normal distribution N(𝑦;𝜇,𝜎), since we
observe limited data points in the tail of the distribution. However,
in a real production system, a normal distribution might underfit
the actual data distribution. Often, we don’t necessarily have simple
normal distributions. To overcome this limitation, we estimate the
distribution of the QoS metric via a mixture of normal distributions
with𝐶mixture components, where the probability distribution of
a metric𝑦given𝑋is of the form:
𝑝(𝑦|𝑋)=𝐶∑︁
𝑐=1𝛼𝑐,𝑦(𝑋)N(𝑦|𝜇𝑐,𝑦(𝑋),𝜎𝑐,𝑦(𝑋)), (2)
where𝑐denotes the index of the corresponding mixture component,
and𝛼𝑐,𝑦is the mixture proportion representing the probability that
𝑦belongs to the 𝑐𝑡ℎmixture component N(𝑦|𝜇𝑐,𝑦,𝜎𝑐,𝑦).
It is well known in the literature that a mixture of Gaussian/normal
distributions is capable of modelling any arbitrary probability dis-
tribution with correct choice of 𝐶,𝛼𝑐,𝜇𝑐and𝜎𝑐[65]. We aim to
estimate a mixture distribution for each QoS metric 𝑦via a separate
Mixture Density Network (MDN), that comprises a feed-forward
neural network to learn the mixture parameters 𝜇𝑦,𝜎𝑦and the
mixing coefficient 𝛼𝑦. We have chosen 𝐶=3after experimental
analysis (see Fig. 6a), and hence each MDN has 3 values of 𝛼𝑦,𝜇𝑦
and𝜎𝑦. The network is learnt through minimizing the negative
log-likelihood loss of obtaining the ground truth metric value of
𝑦given the mixture distribution, averaged over all metrics M𝑄𝑜𝑆.

HereRcorresponds to the realm of possibilities. MDN hence
learns the parameters of the distribution of QoS metrics, which
can then be further used to compute the probability of 𝑦crossing a
certain threshold to predict outages.
Task 2: Outage Classification (Fig. 3[2C]). We have observed
through experiments (see §7.1.3) that the distribution learnt by
MDN performs poorly at the tail, where extreme values are gen-
erally observed and can be used to forecast outages (Figure 4).
To overcome this limitation, a feed-forward neural network per-
forms outage classification in a multi-task setting, where we predict
whether an outage will happen or not from the encoded output
from the Metric-Encoder . We use the output proxy labels generated
in §5.1.3 as a ground truth.
This module acts the extreme value regularizer. where the intu-
ition is that the synthetically generated proxy labels will act as aOutage-Watch : Early Prediction of Outages using Extreme Event Regularizer ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA

to distribution learning, we have separate neural networks for each
QoS metric inM𝑄𝑜𝑆.
To classify outages, we have used the Extreme Value Loss (EVL) [ 28,
33], which is a modified form of Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) Loss
as the loss function. EVL reduces the number of false positives
by assigning more weight to the penalty of incorrectly predicting
outages. EVL works well with imbalanced data as we have observed
through experiments. EVL can be formally defined as,

𝛽0is the proportion of normal events in the batch and 𝛽1is the
proportion of extreme events in the batch. We use 𝛿=2in the loss
function for the experiments.
5.3 Training
Since we want to predict the probability of an outage in advance
and reduce the MTTD, the ground truth metric values and the proxy
labels should also correspond to a future time 𝑡+𝛾. Thus, at a time
𝑡, the Metric-Encoder takes 𝑋which is a time series of all metric
values from 𝑡−𝑤to𝑡as input. The ground truth value for Task 1
is the metric value for each QoS metric 𝑦at time𝑡+𝛾and while
for Task 2, we use the proxy label (see §5.1.3) computed from the
QoS metric values at 𝑡+𝛾. We train the entire pipeline consisting
of the Metric-Encoder, mixture density network and the classifier
in an end-to-end fashion.
It should also be noted that with a large 𝛾, one can aim to predict
an outage well in advance, but the distribution followed by the
QoS metric will not be accurate. Hence, a careful selection of 𝛾is
necessary. By our experiments (see Fig. 6b), we show that 𝛾=10
mins works the best for our purpose.
5.4 Inference
At inference time, we predict and use only the distribution of the
QoS metrics, while excluding the classifier from our inference
pipeline to predict an outage. The distribution of the QoS metrics
provide us with more flexibility and enables us to define outages
Figure 5: Tasks performed during inference time to predict
potential outages from the predicted distribution
based on custom thresholds. Moreover, the distribution captures
the entire spectrum and specifically the tail metric values. However,
the steps to predict an outage from the distribution of the QoS
metrics can be summarized as below.
5.4.1 Probability Computation (Fig. 5[3A]). We first compute the
probability of an outage occurring by computing the probability
that the value of the QoS metric crosses a pre-defined threshold.
These thresholds are generally defined by the SLAs that have been
agreed with a particular customer. As an example, an agreement of
achieving a service latency of at most 𝜌milli-seconds for 99% of
the times might have been signed with the cloud service provider,
and can be termed as an SLA. Hence, in this case, the threshold is
99%. Formally, the probability of a QoS metric value 𝑦crossing a
thresholdT, and hence the probability of an outage occurring can
be defined as
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒)=𝐶∑︁
𝑐=1𝛼𝑐[N(𝑦|𝜇𝑐,𝜎𝑐)>T] (5)
5.4.2 Outage Prediction (Fig. 5[3B]). From the probability com-
puted above, we use a thresholding technique on 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒)to
predict the outages. We compute the threshold based on Youden’s J
Index [79] on training data. It is a popular thresholding technique
for imbalanced data (extreme events are very few as compared to
theusual metric values), which uses the Area under the ROC curve
(AUC) to compute the threshold. On the training data containing
the proxy labels and the corresponding probability of an outage
occurring, Youden’s J Index tries to compute the threshold such
that it increases the precision and recall. We maintain the same
threshold for all our evaluations.
6 IMPLEMENTATION SETUP
In this section, we outline the experimental process and the setup
we followed. We have implemented Outage-Watch inpython and
used tensorflow2[9], a standard open-source library to implement
the ML models. We have run Outage-Watch on a system having
Intel Xeon E5-2686 v4 2.3GHz CPU with 8 cores.
Source of Data: The data is sourced from a prominent SaaS
enterprise offering extensive software and digital services. It lever-
ages Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure for cloud

provisions. The software infrastructure covers diverse domains in-
cluding programming languages, databases, AWS, Azure, Docker,
Kubernetes, Jenkins, and more.
Dataset: We collect the dataset for evaluating Outage-Watch
from a real-world service hosted by a large cloud-based service
provider. The metrics data was obtained through a message queue
pipeline deployed on the monitoring system of the service. We have
collected a total of 3 months of metrics and outage data from the
monitoring system for training and testing purposes where data
from the last 3 weeks were used for testing. We collected ∼2000
metrics, which was reduced to 42 as discussed in §5.1.1. Outages
have a widespread impact within the enterprise affecting multiple
services. Since there were no outages observed during the period
of the training data while one outage was observed during the
period of test data, we generated time periods when the extreme
situations occurred (see §5.1.3). It amounted to around 5-7% of the
total training data, thus exhibiting a skewed label imbalance.
Model Hyperparameters: The implementation details for the
ML models used in Outage-Watch (§4.2) are outlined as follows. The
BiLSTM model in the Metric Encoder has 128 hidden units ( ℎ=128),
followed by a dropout layer with 𝑝=0.2. Regularization techniques
were used while training the model to prevent overfitting. The
feed-forward Mixture Density Network (MDN) which models the
distribution parameters of QoS metrics has two hidden layers with
200 neurons each, with ReLU [ 37] activation function in the hidden
layers. The neuron outputting the mixing factor of components ( 𝛼)
use a softmax function. The classifier feed-forward network has
one hidden layer with 20 neurons with ReLU activation, while the
output layer use the sigmoid function. We use a learning rate of
0.001 with the Adam optimizer for training.
Baselines: The baselines for evaluation are chosen following
an approach similar to the work presented in [ 58]. We leverage
some of the fundamental classification and regression techniques
for outage prediction. It includes Naive Bayes classifier, random
forests and gradient boosted decision trees. Naive bayes is a proba-
bilistic machine learning model while the other two are ensemble
methods that are constructed using a multitude of individual trees.
We implement these baselines to use them as a proxy for prior
learning based outage prediction models. We also use a BiLSTM
classifier as a baseline, which uses only classifier network on the
encoded BiLSTM representation to predict outages.
Evaluation Metrics: To evaluate the effectiveness of various
approaches, we use AUC-PR and F1 score. AUC-PR calculates the
area under the precision-recall (PR) curve and is commonly used for
heavily imbalanced datasets [ 71] where we are optimizing for the
positive class (outage being detected) only. AUC-PR is computed
using the probability of an outage occurring or not (from Equation
5). Also, based on the probability values, we use the procedure in
§5.4.2 on training data to compute a threshold for detecting outages,
which we use to compute the F1 score in test data.
Other Hyperparameters: For all the experiments, we choose a
window3𝑤=60mins to create a windowed time series of metric
data. On the contrary, we vary the prediction look-ahead 𝛾from
5 mins to 30 mins. In §7.1.4, we experimentally show the optimal

for all the experiments.
7 EVALUATION
In this section, we present the experimental results and aim to
address the following research questions:
•RQ1: How do our design decisions align with the ablation
studies performed?
•RQ2: How does our approach compare to the established
baselines?
•RQ3: How does our approach perform in a real-world cloud
deployment scenario?
7.1 Design Choices (RQ1)
7.1.1 Metric Encoder Model. In §5.2.1, we claim to use Bidirectional
LSTM (BiLSTM) as the model for metric encoder. In this subsection,
we discuss the experiments conducted to determine the optimal
architecture and the rationale behind using BiLSTM. We conducted
experiments using four different types of RNNs: LSTM [ 43], BiL-
STM [ 40], Stacked LSTM [ 30], and Stacked BiLSTM [ 30]. The en-
coded representation was then used to forecast the distribution in
a multi-task setting with EVL in the classifier network. The perfor-
mance of each architecture was evaluated using AUC-PR metric.
We have experimented with varying values of 𝛾∈{5,10,15,30}
min. The results are presented in Table 1.
Table 1: Design choice: Comparison of different RNN archi-
tectures over different prediction windows in terms of AUC.
ModelPrediction Look-Ahead ( 𝛾)
5 mins 10 mins 15 mins 30 mins
LSTM 0.950 0.950 0.950 0.948
BiLSTM 0.974 0.977 0.968 0.959
Stacked LSTM 0.961 0.944 0.925 0.914
Stacked BiLSTM 0.956 0.938 0.933 0.918
We see that BiLSTM encoder performs the best in our case for all
values of𝛾. BiLSTM can track a time series in the forward as well
as the backward direction. Thus, it can help to encode the overall
variation in performance metrics as well as retain recent trends,
which makes BiLSTM an ideal choice for encoding the information
in the metric time series.
7.1.2 Multi-Task Learning. Table 2 illustrates that incorporating
the proposed multi-task learning approach improves performance
compared to using only a single task: classification network or
MDN. We used BiLSTM as the Metric Encoder. We evaluate the dif-
ferent schemes using the AUC-PR metric. For the classifier network
(individually as well as when evaluated in a multi-task setting),
we employed the EVL loss. In a similar setting as of the above, we
perform the experiments with 𝛾∈{5,10,15,30}min.
We observe that when the BiLSTM encoded representation was
used to learn a distribution of the QoS metrics in a multi-task
setting (learning the distribution and classifying the time periods
of extreme values), it performed better than when the tasks wereOutage-Watch : Early Prediction of Outages using Extreme Event Regularizer ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA

performed individually. This corroborates our design choice of
using a multi-task learning in the distribution forecasting module.
7.1.3 Classifier Network Loss. Additionally, we perform further
experiments to show the performance enhancement of using EVL
loss over Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss for the classifier network
in §5.2.2. The results, as shown in Table 3, indicate that the use of
EVL in conjunction with multi-task learning improves performance
in predicting extreme events as compared to solely using BCE loss.
The metric used to evaluate the performance of the models is the
F1-score, and the results demonstrate that EVL outperforms BCE.

7.1.4 Ablations. We perform further ablation studies to prove our
parameter choices for Outage-Watch . We first illustrate through
Figure 6a that predicting the distribution of QoS metrics using a
mixture Gaussian distribution with 3 components performs the
best for predicting the outages. We see in the figure that with more
or less components, there is a drop in the overall performance. We
also conducted an analysis to determine the optimal prediction
look-ahead𝛾. With large look-ahead 𝛾, we can forecast the outage
well in advance. It however suffers in accuracy of the prediction
probability since the inherent trend in the metric changes. Thus,
there is a trade-off between 𝛾and accuracy metric. Through our
experiments, we found that a look-ahead of 10 minutes resulted in
the most satisfactory performance, as the validation loss showed
negligible increase before reaching a sudden jump beyond this
point. Thus, Outage-Watch can forecast an outage and reduce the
MTTD by at least 10 mins than the current approaches (§7.3).
7.2 Baseline Comparison (RQ2)
With our design choices fixed, that is, using a BiLSTM for encoding
the metrics and then forecasting the distribution of the QoS met-
rics in a multi-task learning setting, we compare Outage-Watch
with several baselines as described in §6. We use AUC-PR to com-
pare the performance and tabulate the results in Table 4. Similar to
the previous evaluations, we experiment with multiple values of
𝛾∈{5,10,15,30}min. The results demonstrate that our proposed
(a)
 (b)

ture components 𝐶to predict by MDN; (b) Loss of the MDN
(Eq. 3) vs Prediction look-ahead 𝛾
approach of forecasting the distribution outperforms all other tech-
niques, including traditional methods, by a significant margin. It
has been shown to be a highly effective approach for predicting
outages through QoS metrics
One key advantage of Outage-Watch is its ability to predict the
probability of an outage occurring based on any threshold T(see
Equation 5) since we are forecasting the distribution as opposed
to just learning a classifier with the ground truth proxy labels. On
the contrary, traditional methods are limited to predicting outages
to a specific threshold (similar to the threshold used for creating
the ground-truth labels in training data). As discussed in §5.1.3,
we create proxy labels based on the threshold of 95%, i.e., if the
metric value crosses the 95 percentile mark, it is considered to be a
potential extreme event. Thus, the classifier network was trained
using the generated proxy labels as a ground-truth. However, when
we evaluate the distribution forecasted by Outage-Watch based on
the probability of the metric value crossing a threshold of T=97%
andT=99%, we achieve high F1 scores, as seen in Table 5. 𝛾was
maintained at 10 minutes. This flexibility in threshold selection is
a major advantage of our proposed method and sets it apart from
traditional techniques as the model need not be trained again to
get the results on a different threshold.

diction windows in terms of AUC score.

of the metric value exceeding a threshold of T=99%.Outage-Watch was able to correctly predict both the outages in advance
(in comparison to the current approach which is indicated by the light red rectangular shaded region).
7.3 Deployment Results (RQ3)
We deployed Outage-Watch in an enterprise system for 2 months
and predicted the probability of impending outages. The overall
objective of Outage-Watch is to predict outages in timely manner,
thereby assisting the engineers. From the forecasted distribution,
we first predict the probability of a metric value crossing the thresh-
oldT=99%. We then predict potential outage situations through
the thresholding technique as described in §5.4.2 on the metric
probability that crosses the threshold first. The threshold is gener-
ated based on the 9 weeks of training data. We report the precision
and recall of the prediction made by Outage-Watch . We also report
the reduction in time to detect outages by the model against the
current reactive approach which is used to report an outage.
In this deployment, we implemented a continuous re-training
strategy for Outage-Watch , updating the model after every outage
detected with full data for up to two days after the outage ended.
This approach was taken to ensure that the system state changes
during an outage are reflected in the updated model. Our strategy
balances effective model retraining with efficiency. It’s worth not-
ing that our focus here does not encompass a robust retraining
strategy [ 76] targeting drift issues. The potential for addressing
data distribution changes, arising from factors such as the imple-
mentation of new business functionalities, could influence outage
detection. However, this aspect falls outside the purview of our
current work.
We present a case study for multiple outages that were flagged by
the engineers during the deployment period and how Outage-Watch
performed in forecasting them. During the deployment period, a
total of 4 outages ( Outage A, B, C, D ) took place, out of which
Outage A, B andCmanifested through the QoS metrics in the cloud
service. Outage-Watch was able to accurately predict all these three
outages and reduced the mean time to detection as compared to the
current approach followed by the engineers. However, Outage D
was not evident through the QoS metrics and hence it was not pre-
dicted. We report the precision, recall and the reduction in MTTD
forOutage A, B andCin Table 6. For each outage, we consider data
from a day before and 2 days after to report the precision. Precisionhere refers to the number of outages correctly predicted over the
number of times the probability value was above the threshold for
a sustained period (15 mins). Recall refers to the number of outages
predicted correctly over the total outages that could have been
predicted, which is 3. Finally, MTTD reduction for each outage
is reported as a percentage of (C - time of prediction)/(C-B) (see
Figure 1 for the notations of B, C). We observe that Outage-Watch
outperforms other baselines in terms of precision and recall. Recall
is 100%, while precision is 30-40%. We also observe a large reduction
in MTTD4forOutage-Watch (‘-’ implies outage was not predicted).
When EVL is used with Outage-Watch , precision improves.

To provide a deeper understanding of how the system works,
we present two case studies of outages (Outage A and Outage B)
that were successfully predicted by Outage-Watch .
7.3.1 Outages Predicted. An illustration of these two outages and
the performance of Outage-Watch are presented in Figure 7.
(1)Outage A: The outage was auto-launched at time 𝑡𝐴by the
monitoring systems due to out-of-heap memory issues on
several app store nodes in one of the regions. The system
Outage-Watch was able to predict the out-of-heap memory
4MTTD improvement: There is a decrease of tens of minutes, particularly notable

issue correctly and flagged the outage 67minutes before the
outage was actually launched. The system failed due to a
fault in the event consumer queue which got stuck and was
not processing since 𝑡𝐴−100minutes in one of the regions.
(2)Outage B: In another outage, alerts regarding high error
rates in a serviceSwere fired. The outage was auto-launched
at𝑡𝐵by monitoring the high error rate. It was found that a
faulty update in one of the AWS components had caused the
component to fail. That component was being used by Sand
therefore after the update, Swas unable to process incom-
ing requests. The issue commenced since 𝑡𝐵−25minutes.
Outage-Watch correctly detected this outage and reduced
the MTTD by 22 minutes from the auto-launched approach.
7.3.2 Outages Not Predicted. In addition, we also present a case
study of an outage ( Outage D ) which occurred after a change was
implemented that inadvertently tripped an UI feature blocking
protocols from making requests. However, such outages due to
UI issues are not meant to be manifested in the QoS metrics. As
a result, it was not detected by our model. However, this is not a
false negative in our case since no changes were observed on the
QoS metrics, and hence Outage-Watch could not have detected the
outage. This also highlights the limitations of our proposed method,
as it relies on the monitoring metrics to predict outages.
7.4 Discussion
From the above results, we see that Outage-Watch performs better
than the other comparable baselines, as well as on real-world de-
ployment setting. However, it can be observed from Table 6 that
Outage-Watch reports multiple false positives, which is dependent
on the quality of threshold we choose to detect an outage. One can
circumvent this issue by having a higher threshold (which might re-
duce the reduction in MTTD according to Figure 7). However, since
we are working with the constraints of data, our training data set
did not have any outages and the number of extreme events were
very less as compared to the test data. This resulted in Youden’s
index to compute a threshold lower than 0.5. However, with more
data in the training set reflecting the extreme events, thresholding
model becomes more proficient to distinguish true positives from
the false positives, which results in a higher Youden’s index [ 72]. As
and when data arrives, Youden’s Index model should be retrained
to get an improved threshold. Hence, thresholds can be re-adjusted
as well with the predicted distribution, reducing the false positives.
However, in real-world scenarios, the presence of false positive
cases is nuanced in this context. Our analysis of model predictions,
along with SRE input, identified false positive cases where predicted
extreme values didn’t lead to outages. Some of these issues were
resolved manually or self-corrected. Consequently, the occurrences
of false positives are not necessarily negative indicators, as they
can capture mild issues that resemble potential disruptions. How-
ever, false positives are always undesirable in the workflow of SRE.
While SREs can get insights from false positives, their presence is
undesirable due to the risk of alert fatigue from frequent, possibly
minor, predicted outputs. To tackle this, we provide the benefit of
adaptable threshold selection as discussed in §5.4. A detailed study
on how SREs can distinguish a false positive from a true positive
output in their workflow remains an open question.Overall, Outage-Watch proves to be very helpful for production
outage management as it was able to predict the outages well in
advance. This could help in reducing the severity and consequently
helps with quick mitigation of the outages. We also highlight a
limitation of the model, which relies solely on monitoring data
and the QoS metrics and cannot predict those outages that are
not indicative from these metrics. Nevertheless, we believe that
by incorporating additional sources of data, such as log files and
change details, we can improve the performance of our model in
detecting these types of outages. Overall, our proposed method is a
valuable tool for predicting outages using QoS metrics and has the
potential to improve system performance and reliability.
8 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present a novel approach Outage-Watch for pre-
dicting outages by forecasting the distribution of the relevant QoS
metrics. This approach takes a time series input of multiple moni-
toring metrics representing the current system state within a time
window to encode the information present in the time series in
a vector representation. It then uses the encoded information to
learn the distribution of the relevant metrics using a feed-forward
neural network. In addition, Outage-Watch uses extreme value loss
to classify the extreme events in a multi-task manner which helps
in learning the distribution of the metrics in the tail.
At inference time, our model uses the distribution learnt to com-
pute the probability of the metric to cross a certain threshold, and
then predicts outages based on a thresholding technique. Our exper-
iments on real-data show the efficacy of our method with an average
AUC of 0.98. The applicability and robustness of our approach has
been verified by deploying it on an enterprise system.
Future Works: Our future works include extending the eval-
uation duration on production systems to provide insights into
long-term performance. Few interesting modifications include au-
tomated dynamic threshold selection and providing a confidence
bound for our prediction to distinguish between the true positives
and the false positive predictions. Furthermore, refining the def-
inition of extreme events could enhance predictive capabilities.
Incorporating diverse data sources, such as log files and trace data,
may extend the scope of outage detection. We also plan on explor-
ing robust re-training strategies [ 76] to improve model performance
in production. Lastly, implementing a feedback loop or introduc-
ing human-in-the-loop dynamics may further refine the model’s
predictive abilities.
9 DATA AVAILABILITY
The metrics data used in this research is proprietary and cannot
be shared due to confidentiality agreements with the enterprise
service provider. However, the model code along with a sample data
are made available at Outage-Watch5. The sample data includes the
format of the input data required for the model with random metric
values. Any real dataset can be pre-processed to the specified format
for implementing the approach. We believe that the model code
and sample data provided in the paper are sufficient for replication
and working with similar datasets.
