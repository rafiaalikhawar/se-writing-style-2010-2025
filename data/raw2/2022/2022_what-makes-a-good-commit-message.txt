ABSTRACT
A key issue in collaborative software development is communi-
cation among developers. One modality of communication is a
commit message, in which developers describe the changes they
make in a repository. As such, commit messages serve as an “audit
trail” by which developers can understand how the source codeof a project has changed—and why. Hence, the quality of com-mit messages affects the effectiveness of communication amongdevelopers. Commit messages are often of poor quality as devel-opers lack time and motivation to craft a good message. Several
automaticapproacheshavebeenproposedtogeneratecommitmes-
sages.However,thesearebasedonuncurateddatasetsincluding
considerableproportionsofpoorlyphrasedcommitmessages.In
this multi-method study, we first define what constitutes a “good”
commit message, and then establish what proportion of commit
messageslackinformationusingasampleofalmost1,600messages
from five highly active open source projects. We find that an aver-
ageofcirca44%ofmessagescouldbeimproved,suggestingtheuseofuncurateddatasetsmaybeamajorthreatwhencommitmessage
generatorsaretrainedwithsuchdata.Wealsoobservethatprior
work has not considered semantics of commit messages, and there
is surprisingly little guidance available for writing good commit
messages. To that end, we develop a taxonomy based on recurring
patterns in commit messages’ expressions. Finally, we investigate
whether“good” commit messages can be automatically identified;

1 INTRODUCTION
Collaborativesoftwaredevelopmentisaninherentlysocialactivity,
and is commonly facilitated through version control systems (VCS)
such as Git [ 75,82]. A VCS maintains a record of code changes,
and manages simultaneous access to development artifacts [ 82].
Each commit should contain both changes to source code (andotherstoredartifacts)andamessagethatexplains whatchanges
aremade,and why[13,49].Figure1showsanexampleofacommit

is needed to communicate the context of a change to collaborators
whichallowsthemtoreviewthechangeandunderstanditsimpact
[2,69].Forlong-livedprojects,suchastheLinuxkernel,commit
messages might be the only source of information left for future
developers to understand what changes were made and why those
were made, when the original developers have left a project [68].
Software development is increasingly done in distributed set-
tings involving developers from many different cultures and back-
grounds. As well, in the past 20 years, commercial participation
in opensource software(OSS) projects hasincreased dramatically

the quality of commit messages as individual developers and orga-
nizationsmay exhibit different development cultures and habits.
Severalresearchershavefoundthatthequalityofcommitmes-
sages in repositories varies due to a lack of motivation or time
[26,44,45,47].Forexample,previousstudiesobservedthatca.14%
ofcommitmessagesinover23,000OSSprojectswerecompletely
empty, 66% of the messages contained only a few words, and only
10%ofcommitshadmessagescontaining“normal”descriptiveEng-
lish sentences [ 26]. Chahal and Saini [ 14] proposed a syntactic
modeltocalculatethequalityofcommitmessages.However,this
model can only assess the quality at the syntactic level through
evaluationof“rules,”suchas “thefirstcharacterofthesubjectline
shouldbe capitalized” ; this model does not consider the semantics
of commit message contents. Further, developers may not know
what kind of information should be written to produce a good
commit message [ 68]. The practitioner community is keen to help
theircontributorsunderstandhowtowriteagoodcommitmessage,
as evidenced by guidelines such as: “the commit message should
describe what changes our commit makes to the behavior of the code,
not whatchanged in the code” [51].
To help developers write commit messages (addressing a poten-
tial lack of motivation and time), several tools have been proposed
thatcangeneratecommitmessagesautomatically[ 13,18,45].Tools
likeDeltaDoc[ 13]andChangeScribe[ 18]canproducedetailedmes-
sages based on the changes contained within a commit, that can
mainly answer whatwas changed. However, the generated mes-
sages cannot reveal whythe change was necessary. Inspired by
previous observations that commit messages follow certain pat-
terns [49], recent approaches [ 38,39,45] generated commit mes-
sages from prior changes and their associated commit messages,
whichmaycontaintherationaleforanycodechanges.Forthose
approaches, the quality of generated commit messages relies on
messagesofsimilarcodechangesinthetrainingdata.Amajorprob-
lem is that the quality of commit messages in OSS projects used in
trainingdatasetsforautomaticgeneratorsmightvaryconsiderably.
Therefore, using low-quality commit messages in training datasets
introduces a major threat if these “poor” commit messages are not
filtered out. Moreover, when the generated messages are the same
orsimilartothelow-qualitymessagesintestingdatasets,automatic
tools may yield an artificially high precision. Unfortunately, many
modelsproposedthusfarweretrainedandevaluatedondatasetsof
commit messages, which simply removed trivial messages without
payingattentionto the content quality of these messages.
This state of affairs leaves a number of important open ques-
tions unanswered. First, (RQ1) to what extent do poorly composed
commit messages exist? To the best of our knowledge, no prior
work hasdefined oranalyzed whatmakes a “good” commit mes-
sage, and subsequently analyzed commit messages to assess the
extentofhowthequalityofmessagesvaries.Second,(RQ2)having
established what makes a good commit message at a high level,
what are recurring patterns of how these well-written messages
are expressed? As we observed, the current state of the art does
not considerthe semanticsofmessages, only their syntax.Finally,
future tools that could assist developers in writing good commit
messagesshouldbeabletorecognizewhetherawrittenmessage
is “good” or not—for example, tools that can prompt developers in
real-time as they attempt to make a commit may help improve thequality of commit messages. These tools would also be very useful
for researchers in constructing high-quality datasets of commit
messagegeneration.Hence,ourthirdresearchquestionis(RQ3):
can commitmessages of good quality be automatically identified?
To answer these questions, we conducted a multi-method study.
Wefirststudiedandanalyzeda setofca.1,600 commitmessages
sampledfromfivemajorOSSprojects.Wedefineda“good”commit
messageasonethatexplainswhatwaschanged,andwhyachange
was made. We found that around 44% of commit messages lack
‘why’ or ‘what’ information. This highlights the risk of generating
messages based on an unfiltered training dataset that includes low-
quality commit messages. Second, we qualitatively analyzed 252
messageswith“good”messagelabelstoidentifyexpressioncharac-
teristics.Third,webuiltamodelbasedonBi-LSTMtoautomatically

Thispapermakesanumberofpracticalandtheoreticalcontri-
butions to the literature on understanding and identification of
high-quality commit messages. Specifically, we 1) propose a set
of criteria for identifying well-written messages; 2) demonstrate
that considerable proportions of commit messages lack essential
information,thushighlightingthatthisvariationinqualityrequires
measures to mitigate; 3) propose a taxonomy of the expressions of
commitmessages;and4)buildanautomatedclassifiertoidentify

2 RELATED WORK
Commitmessagesconstituteanimportantmodalityincollaborative
software development for sharing knowledge among developers
and in establishing an audit trail of the evolution of a software
project. We discuss prior literature that has focused on understand-
ingandutilizingcommitmessagesandhowtoautomaticallygen-
eratecommitmessages.
Commitmessagesareakeyresourcewhenaddressingseveral
software engineering challenges. One stream of research has fo-
cused on classifying code changes into different types by utilizing
commit messages manually or automatically to assist maintenance
[25,49,54]. For example, Mockus and Votta [ 49] identified three
typesofcommits:adaptive,corrective,andperfective,consistent
with Swanson’s typology of maintenance activities [ 67]. Based
on the proposed commit types, numerous classification models
have been proposed, and commit messages play an important role
[25, 42, 74].
A second stream of research has focused on the measurement
of quality of code changes by analyzing commit messages. For
example,Agrawaletal.[ 2]studiedtheevolutionofcommitqual-
ity in five projects by measuring (among others) the number of
unique commit messages, and found that the quality of commits
declined over time. Santos et al. [ 58] studied the relationship be-
tween “unusual messages” and code quality in commits, and found
thatunusualmessagescorrelatewithbuildfailures,suggestingthat
these messagesserve as a warning sign.

While it is clear that commit messages play an important role
in communication among developers, developers may lack time
or motivation to craft good commit messages that clearly commu-
nicatewhatisbeingcommitted.Toaddressthis,severalscholars
have proposed automatic approaches to automatically generate
messages.Someofthemarerule-basedorusepredefinedtemplates
[13,18,43,63]. For instance, Buse and Weimer [ 13] used symbolic
execution to generate path predicates between versions of code
changes, then populated pre-defined templates and applied sum-
marization transformations to generate commit messages for code
changes. Two important limitations of these commit messages gen-
eratedbasedontemplatesare(1)alackofflexibility,and(2)they
cannotconveytheintentofcommittingchanges,whichonlyexists
ina developer’smind untilit iswritten.Recent studiesrely onad-
vancedtechniques,suchasinformationretrievalanddeeplearning
[35,38,44–46,50,72] to generate commit messages automatically.
Thesetendtorelyonreusingmessagesofsimilarcodechanges.For
example, Huang et al. [ 36] calculated syntax, semantic, pre-syntax,
andpre-semanticsimilaritiesofchangedcodefragmentsbetween
twoversionstofindsimilarcodechangesandreusetheirmessages.
Whilespecificmodelsvaryintheirtechniques,acommonfeature
isthattheytakepriorcommitmessagesasakeyinput.Forthese
information retrieval and deep learning based tools, the quality
ofthemanuallywrittencommitmessageisdifficulttoguarantee
[26, 45],which maythreatenthe effectivenessof these tools.
A fewstudies investigated thecontent ofcommit messages but
mainlyfocusedonspecificaspects.Forexample,Alomaret al.ex-
plored how developers document their refactoring activities in
commitmessages,andfoundthatdeveloperstendtoexplicitlymen-
tion the improvement of certain quality attributes and code smells
[4].ChahalandSaini[ 14]constructedamodelthatcanjudgethe
quality of commit messages by calculating 11 syntactical measures.
Text content in other OSS development activities has been studied,
such as what/how to document when submitting patches [ 68] and
what information is needed in a bug report [ 83]. The results of our
studyonthedistributionandexpressioncategoriesofgoodcommit
messages and their relationship with maintenance activities can
complement prior understanding of what is a good commit mes-
sage and how to write one. Moreover, we propose a good-message
identificationtoolthatcanbeusedtopromptdeveloperstowrite

3 STUDY DESIGN
To address the three research questions introduced in Sec. 1, we
conducted a multi-method study. To address RQ1, we compiled
adatasetofcommitsandmanuallyclassifiedthemessagesbased
on our definition of a “good” commit message. Sec. 3.1 describes
sampleselection,datacollection,anddataprocessingsteps.Sec.3.2
describes our approach to classifying commit messages. To address
RQ2, we develop a taxonomy that describes how commit messages
convey “what” and “why” information (see Sec. 3.3). Finally, to
address RQ3 we propose a model that could identify these well-
written messages automatically (see Sec. 3.4). Figure 2 presents
an overview of this approach. The appendix offers a replication
package[71].3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing
To ensure that our sample would contain sufficient high-quality
commitmessages,weselectedactiveandpopularprojectswitha
high level of collaboration. We assumed that those projects would
have at least some non-trivial portion of good commit messages.
Considering the impact of different programming languages on
software development [ 11], in this study, we focused on projects
writteninJava,oneofthemostpopularprogramminglanguagesin
GitHub[30]andwidelyusedinindustry.Weselectedthetop100
Java projects sorted by their “star” rating in GitHub. While review-
ing these projects, we prioritized projects that had previously been
subject of studies that focused on automatic generation of commit
messages.Byaddressingsomeofthelimitationsofthosestudies,we
seektooffertheresultsofthisstudyinfutureimprovementofthose
prior studies focusing on commit message generation. As a result,
weselectedfiveOSSprojectsforthisstudy,listedinTable1. Spring-
boot[64]helpsdeveloperscreateandrunSpring-basedapplications

these projects.
WecollectedallthecommitsfromthefiveprojectsusingGitHub’s

considered commits in which the messages are written in English.
Thisresulted ina datasetcontaining 41,886commits(see Table1).
Weeliminated commitmessages generatedautomaticallyby tools

existing work [ 7,22,23,27], these bot messages can be easily iden-
tifiedandfiltered.Table2showsseveralpatternsofbotmessagesin

3.2 IdentifyingWell-Written Messages
It is known that the quality of commit messages varies [ 26,45,47],
but a widely recognized standard of high-quality messages is as of
yet lacking. Before investigating the characteristics of well-written
messages, we constructed the standards to identify them via a
survey of both academic papers and developer forums and validate
thestandardswithexperiencedOSSdevelopers,asdescribedbelow:

•To obtain a scientific perspective of commit messages, we
identifiedandreviewed46relevantstudies(thefullpapers
arelistedinouronlineappendix[ 71]),mainlyfocusingon
the expectation of commit messages and whether there is a
standard of good messages.
•To obtain a pragmatic and practice-oriented view of commit
messages,weusedGoogle’ssearchenginewiththe phrase
“good commitmessage.”In the top50 resultssorted by rele-
vance, we manually selected and studied the online records
(andtheirreferences)fromOSScommunitiesorOSSdevel-
opers(thewholesetoflinksisincludedintheappendix[ 71]).
Furthermore,wealsosolicitedopinionsfrom30experienced
OSSdeveloperstogathertheirviewsonwhatconstitutesa
goodmessage;wedefined“experienced”hereasthosedevel-
opers who contributed more than 10 commits to the studied
projects.
Throughqualitativeanalysisoftheselectedrecords,weobserved
thatthemostfrequentlyrecognizedexpectationofacommitmes-
sage isto summarize the changes in this commit (noted as
‘What’) and describe the reasons for the changes (noted as
‘Why’).The surveyed developers showed a high degree of con-
sistency in the content of commit messages: approximately 93% of
themheldtheviewthatacommitmessageshouldsummarize what
was changed, and describe whythose changes are needed. That is,
ratherthanonlysummarizingchangesordescribingthereasons
for the changes, a commit message should have both What and
Whyinformationto help collaborators understand the changes.Therefore, weconducted thisresearch basedon thehypothesis
that a good commit message should contain a justification (i.e.,
“Why”) that describes the motivation of the change, and a change
summary(i.e., “What”).Dependingonwhetherornotthetwokey
elements,WhyandWhat,areincluded,wedividedthecommitmes-
sagesin ourdatasetinto fourtypes: “WhyandWhat” (containing
both),“No Why” (only What information, but no Why); “No What”
(onlyWhy,butnoWhat);and “NeitherWhynorWhat”. Wenotethat
Why information for certain changes might be common sense. For
example,thecommitmessage “fix typo a->an” omitsthereason
of making this commit, which can be easily inferred as “improving
readability.”Fromtheperspectiveofreducingdevelopers’workload,
wedidnotclassifythesecommitmessagesas“NoWhy”because
the rationale is trivial. Similarly, some What information could be
easily inferred from diffs,1and we took the same approach as
we did for Why. More details of the categories of common sense
Why and easy-to-infer What can be found in Sections 4.2.1 and
4.2.2.Further,wefoundsomecommitsexpressWhyinformation
byprovidingalinktoanissuereportorpullrequest,whichusually
includesadetailedmotivationanddiscussionsofthechange[ 8,82].
This approach is controversial, however: one school of thought ar-
gues that these linked resources provide a convenient way to offer
full details that lay out the rationale for a change [ 60,68]. Another
school of thought argues that suchlinks pose a risk as they might
gostale,resultinginalossoftheinformationtheypointto,thus
resultingincommit messagesthataredifficult tounderstand[ 41].
In this study, we took the former view and treated links of issue
reports and pull requests in commit messages as a way to provide
Whyinformation.
To study the distribution of the four message types in the se-
lectedprojects(Table1),weusedtheclusteredrandomsampling
technique [ 5] on thefive projects’ commit dataand selected 1,649
commitmessages(confidencelevel:95%,marginoferror:5%),which
werecommittedby339developers.Onaverage,eachdevelopersub-
mitted approximately five commits in our dataset. The first two
authorsofthisstudylabeledthecommitmessagesindependently,
categorizingeachintooneofthefourmessagetypes.Duringthe
labeling process, we identified and eliminated 52 non-atomic com-
mits,wheremorethanonechangewassubmitted.Makingmultiple

resultslabeledbydevelopers(eachrespondentlabeledfourcommit
messages),wefoundthat102resultswerelabeledconsistentlywith
ours.Thisindicatesthattheaccuracyofthedatasetreachedalmost
85%.
3.3 CharacterizingWell-Written Messages
In the second phase, we sought to identify the characteristics of
well-writtenmessages(labeledinSec.3.2).Wemanuallysampled
271(confidencelevel:95%,marginoferror:5%)commitmessages
with a labeled type as “Why and What” —that is, messages that
contained both Why and What information, and thus did not miss
importantinformation.Amongthe271commits,weremoved19
commits that only use links of pull requests or issue reports to
expressWhy.Fortheremaining252messages,weusedthematic
analysis[20]tocharacterizehowdevelopersexpressWhyandWhat
information in the commit messages, according to the following
process. (1) We first read and analyzed all the commit messages, to
understandhowdevelopersdescribedcodechangesandmotivation,
andidentifiedphrasesthatexpressedWhyandWhat.(2)Wereread
the whole commit messages and related phrases carefully to gener-
ateinitialcodesandorganizetheminasystematicway.(3)After
completing the generation of the initial code, we aggregated codes
with similar meanings, and identified an initial theme representing
thatcluster.Afterthisstep,allcodesweredividedintooneofthe
initial themes, which helped in identifying any emergent patterns
that characterized the descriptions of Why and What. (4) We then
reviewedtheinitialsetofthemestoidentifyopportunitiestomerge
similar themes. By clarifying the essence of each theme, similar
themesweremergedintoanewtheme,orathemewasincludedas
a sub-theme. (5) In the last step, we defined the final set of themes.
To reduce any researcher bias, steps (1) to (4) described above
were performed independently by the first two authors [ 57]. After
this,asequenceofmeetingswasheldtoresolveconflictsandassign
the final themes(step 5).
Duringthematicanalysisofthe252commitmessages,wefound
thewaydevelopersdescribeWhyandWhatinmessagestendsto
vary across different types of maintenance activities. Therefore,
wealsoclassifiedcommittypestoinvestigatetherelationshipbe-
tweenmessageexpressioncategoriesandmaintenanceactivities.
Prior literature provides a variety of code change classifications
[49,56,67,73], but no consensus was reached regarding the differ-
enttypesofclassificationtowhichacommitrefers.Therefore,after
an ad-hoc literature review, we adopted the widely used definitionof Mockus and Votta [ 49] for three commit types: (1) corrective
changes address processing, performance, and implementation fail-
ures;(2)adaptivechangesrepresentchangesinthedataenviron-
mentorprocessingenvironment.Forexample,toimplementanew
function; and (3) perfective changes, which focus on improving
non-functional attributes such as efficiency, performance, cleanup,
etc.Then,weidentifiedcommittypebydeductivethematicanalysis
[53],whichcanmatchthedatawiththemesfromextantresearch.
More specifically, the first two authors independently took the the-
oreticalpropositionsderivedfromMockusandVotta[ 49]asapoint
ofdeparture,andappliedthemtothe252commitmessages.Weob-
tainedahighlevelofconsistency(Cohen’skappacoefficient=0.92)
between the two coders. The two coders discussed and resolved
any disagreements.
3.4 Automatic Identification
In the third phase, we sought to develop a solution that could
automaticallyidentifywell-writtenmessages.Aswedefinedhigh-
quality commit messages as those containing both Why and What
information,we first designed two classifiers that could automati-
cally identify whether a message contains Why (labeled C-Why,
andCmeans“classifier”)andWhat(labeled C-What)separately.
Training the two separate classifiers can offer more fine-grained
feedbacktodevelopersbyindicatingwhichofthetwokeyelements
(Why and What) is missing. We then selected and combined the
two classifiers with the best performance to automatically identify
well-writtenmessagesthatcontainbothWhyandWhat(labeled
asC-Good).
3.4.1 Data Preparation. We used the commit messages labeled in
Sec. 3.2 to train and test the three classifiers. Commit messages
usuallyincludeseveraltokensthatarenot“naturallanguage,”such
aslinkstopullrequests.Sincetheirfullsemanticsarehighlyspecific
tothecontentsofthecommits,whichwedonotconsiderinthis
paper,wereplacedthesetokenswithplaceholdersindicatingthe
kindofinformation,toensurethemodelswerenotaffectedbysuch
trivial commitcontent. Specifically, we identified and replaced the
followingtokensofnon-naturallanguage:1)wereplacedanyURLs
in a message with “<X url>” , where “X” refers to the types of
URLs, i.e., “pr” (indicating pull request links), “issue” (indicating
links of issue reports), and “other.” 2) We replaced code elements
in the messages with “<X name>” , where “X” refers to the types of
code elements, such as method and file. These code elements were
identified by comparing messages with the corresponding code
changes. 3) We retained the paragraph information for commit
messages by replacing newline characters with “<enter>” .
3.4.2 Identification. Itislikelythattheoriginaldatasetisimbal-
anced, i.e., the number of messages that contain Why (or What)
is larger than the messages that do not contain this information.
However, imbalanced datasets can cause machine learning (ML)
modelstofocusonmajorcategoriesandundervalueotherminor
categories [ 3] that we are more concerned about in this paper. ML-
based classifiers often use over-sampling methods to solve the data
imbalance problem so as to achieve better performance. To this
end, wetried three widelyused over-sampling techniques,includ-
ing random sampling with replacement [ 37], synthetic minority

4.1 QualityDistributionof Commit Messages
We manually classified 1,597 commits (sampled from five OSS
projects) into four types based on whether their messages con-
tainWhyandWhatinformation(seeSec.3.2).Wecalculatedthe
distributionofthesefourtypesofcommitmessagesinthefiveOSS
projects.Figure3presentstheresults.Wecanseethatthedominat-
ing type in four projects (except Retrofit) is well-written messages,
i.e., these messages contain both Why and What information. The
ratioofthismessagetypeinthefiveprojectsvariesfromca.42%to
ca.82%,withanaverageratioofca.56%,suggestingthataround44%

Tofurtherinvestigatewhatinformationthetype“NeitherWhynor
What” exactly contains, we manually analyzed all the 65 messages
of this type. Following the same set of steps of thematic analysis
[20]describedinSec.3.3,weidentifiedfivecategories,eachwith
unique characteristics:
•Single-word message : containing only one token which
hardly expresses any information. “ Merge”, “Polish”, and
“<file name> ” are typical examples in our labeled data.
•Submit-centeredmessage :expressingnothingbutthefact
that it is a commit. For example, “ Loader changes .” It is obvi-
ous that this is a commit, but it is impossible to know what
the changes are, and why they were made.
•Scope-centeredmessage :explainingnothingbutthescope
of the changes. Typical messages of this category include
“minor changes in test .” Most of such messages contain qual-
ifyingwordslike“major”and“minor”andcannotexpress
otherinformation.
•Redundant message : describing content that is easy to
inferfromcodediffs.Forexample,“ Add<filename> ”, “Delete
<file name> .” Even without reading this message, the fact
that a file was added or removed can be easily established.
•Irrelevantmessage :describingsomethingirrelevanttothe
change.Amessagesuchas “Kent&Erichpatchswallowing
inMerlin” iswrittentocommitanon-emptymessage,which
conveys no information at all.
The analysis above clearly demonstrates that a considerable
portion of commit messages is problematic, i.e., they do not con-
tain important information. That is, they either miss What or Why

information,orboth.AswediscussedinSec.2,severalmessagegen-
erators have been trained and evaluated using commit messages as
datasets,withoutfilteringoutsub-optimalmessages.Consequently,
a major threat was introduced due to using sub-optimal data. The
fourth type, “Neither Why nor What”, might be easy to identify
andremove,butthistypeonlyaccountsforalimitedproportion.
In other words, filtering this type of message cannot address the
threatsufficiently,andamorepowerfulautomaticidentifierofgood
messagesis needed.
Summary for RQ1: The quality of commit messages varies
in the five studied OSS projects, with on average ca. 44% of
messagesinneedofimprovement.Further,weidentifiedfive
categories of messages that contain neither “Why” nor “What.”
4.2 A Taxonomy of Commit Messages
WenowturntoRQ2,whichseekstoshedlightonwhatmakesa
well-written commit message. We identified the various categories
of rationales (the “Why”) as well as the contents (the “What”),
and analyzed the relationships between these categories and the
typologyofMockusandVotta[ 49].Notethatmultiplecategories
of Why (or What) may exist in the same message. Specifically,
we introduce these categories in Sec. 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, and present
the prevalence of these categories in Sec. 4.2.3. We summarize the
detailedcodesandstatisticsoftheWhyandWhatcategoriesinour
online appendix [71].
4.2.1 Why Expression Categories. By analyzing the various ways
in which developers express the change rationale (i.e., Why), we
found that developers tend to express this directly or indirectly,
orsometimesnotatallwhenthereasonforachangeiscommon
senseorcanbeexplainedbythechangeitself.Usingtheprocedure
outlined in Sec. 3.3, we identified five main categories with 18
subcategories.Weintroducethese(sub)categorieswithexamples
as follows, including their counts and percentages (indicated in
parentheses)in the 252 analyzed commit messages.
DescribeIssue .Thiscategorydirectlyelaboratesthemotivation
ofacodechange;itismainlyconcernedwithanissueinthecurrent
code implementation. Developers explained their motivation for a
change by describing the issues and the specific scenario in which
they occurred. This makes the context of a commit easier to under-
standfor othercontributors.We identified three subcategories:
di1Describe error scenario (#50,19.8%):thissubcategorydi-
rectly describes where and how an error occurs. It is the
mostcommonwayofdescribingWhyachangewasmade.
Developersfrequentlyindicatedthesourceofabug,orspec-
ified the steps for reproducing it, and also explained their
impact; for example: “As-is it throws unchecked exceptions on
unexpectedcharsets.Thisisaproblembecauseitcancausea
misbehavingwebserver to crash the client.” [#S243]
di2Introduce issue report (#11, 4.4%): this subcategory de-
scribes issues mainly by citing errors/defects or warnings
fromqualityassurancetools.Somerecognizedorcommon
tools are usually chosen to achieve the contributor’s com-
monunderstandingofthemistakes.Forexample, “removewarningsfoundbyerrorprone.[...]CallTest.java:2056:warning:
[UnnecessaryParentheses] Unnecessary use of grouping paren-
these [...]” [#S88]. This message cites a warning message
from the tool “errorprone” [ 32] to describe the motivation
for thiscommit.
di3Describe shortcoming (#9, 3.6%): this subcategory high-
lights the shortcomings or weaknesses in the current imple-
mentation,whichisthemotivationtomakethiscommit.For
example, “I’munhappywithjava.io:Notimeouts[...]Features
like mark/resetand available()are clumsy [...]” [#S141].
IllustrateRequirement .Thesecondcategory, IllustrateRequire-
ment, describes the source of requirements that led to this commit.
Theserequirementsincludetheneedforsoftwaredevelopmentand
addressingproblemsintheprocessofsoftwaremaintenance.We
identified three subcategories:
ir1Usage need (#11, 4.4%): these commit messages describe
specific needs or requirements of users in software devel-
opment.Thismessagehelpsothercontributorsunderstand
thebackgroundandnecessityofthischange.Forexample,
“Error-prone only works on pre-12 at the moment and we need
this configurationto apply for all JDKs” [#S225].
ir2Out of date (#24, 9.5%): these commit messages indi-
cate the obsolescence of some features or code. This in-
cludes the deprecation and subsequent removal of un-
used code objects such as classes, methods, or attributes
as the software evolved. Other object version upgrades
may also cause a dependency to become obsolete requir-
ingmodifications.Forexample: “Removeoutdatedkey.The
‘spring.metrics.export.redis.aggregate-key-pattern’isnolonger
definedbutwasstillreferencedinthedocumentation.” [#S127].
ir3Runtime or development environment change (#11,
4.4%): commit messages in this subcategory indicate an
adaptationtothecurrentcodedevelopmentorruntimeen-
vironment. This includes changes to the implementation to
adapt dependent functional changes, modify documents, re-
turnvalues,orexamplestoaccommodateAPImodifications,
etc. For example, “API has changed, fixing the example,” indi-
catesthatthedeveloperchangedtheexampletomatchthe
changes of an API [#S142].
DescribeObjective .Thethirdcategoryofrationaleprovidesthe
purpose of a change, such as the future prevention of defects or
optimization of functionality or performance. We identified two
types of objectives:
do1To fix defects (#9,3.6%):thesecommitmessagesmakeex-
plicit that the purpose of a change is to resolve a defect. Dif-
ferentfrom Describe error scenario (di1)thatdescribes
how a defect occurs or can be observed, this type of expres-
sion clarifies how the proposed change will resolvea de-
fect, as in this example: “Fix concurrent problem of zookeeper
configcenter, wait to start until cache being fully populated”
[#S250].
do2Tomakeimprovements (#13,5.2%):amessageinthissub-
category directly describes the improvement of an author’s
codeimplementation, e.g.,functionalimprovementornon-
functionalgoals.Themessageexplainsthereasonsforthe

change by describing a specific promotion goal. Commit
messagesin thiscategory usually use phrasessuch as to do
something orforsomething todescribewhatanauthorseeks
to achieve. For example, the message “AndroidLog: Added
[...]methods for easier subclassing.” [#S181]clarifies thatthe
change willsimplifythe actof subclassing.
Imply Necessity .Different from commit messages in the pre-
vious three categories, messages in the Imply Necessity category
onlyindirectly describetheneedforchanges.Developersindirectly
describedthenecessityofchangesusingthemessagesthatfallinto
the followingsubcategories:
in1Conventions and standards (#15,6.0%):thissubcategory
describes or refers to any conventions or standards that are
thebasisforachange,thusdemonstratingasoundrationale
of the change. Conventions are agreements among develop-
erswithintheproject,orcouldalsobeindustry-widecon-
ventions.Standardsarewrittenspecifications,oftenrather
technical and more formal, and thus are more rigid than
conventions. A common understanding among contributors
expressed in commit message makes a commit easier to
understand. For example, one developer referred to a con-
vention regarding the location of tests, thus explaining why
thecommitmovesthelocationofthetest: “itiscommonto
add teststo the same package as the class under test” [#S8].
in2Relation to prior commits (#9,3.6%):thesecommitmes-
sagesexplaintherelationshipbetweenthecurrentcommit
and any commits that were already merged into the reposi-
tory. These messages clarify the motivation by improving
anyproblemswithaprioracceptedchangeorusingthenew
features introduced by a previous change, etc. Therefore,
whilethe Describe Issue categorymaybeusedtoindicate
that there is a problem beforechanging it, the nature of this
subcategory is to introduce prior accepted changes as the
context for the current commit. For example, this commit
adds a test because “the code was changed by commit <other
url> but unfortunately the test was not part of the commit”
[#S40].
in3Relation to an implemented feature (#9, 3.6%): some
commits are related to an existing feature, and this relation-
ship provides the context of the new commit. The current
change is part of a large operation that may be underway,
suchasthemessage[#S44]indicatesthatthecurrentchange
is“a short step on the road to HTTP body format agnostic
support.” The current change may also be preparation work
for an accepted feature, such as message [#S41] which di-
rectly explains that the change will “make a future change
easier to land.” In the context of established goals (achieving
functionalityorlargeroperations),themotivationforthis
change willbe clear.
in4Improvementsandbenefits (#39, 15.5%): the last subcate-
gory refers to commit messages that indirectly describe the
need for a change by explaining the improvements and ben-
efitsthatthechangewillbring.Suchcommitsmayinclude
eitherfunctionalornon-functionalimprovementssuchas
readability and maintainability. The commit message may
alsoinclude a comparison between “before” and “after” thecommit, which gives collaborators a better understanding
of the motivation for change. For example, the following
commit message suggestsa proposed improvement and the
associatedbenefit: “Usecustomexceptiontype[...].Sincewe
omitthestacktrace,thismoreclearlyindicatesthesourcebeing
from Retrofit’s mock behavior” [#S103].
MissingWhy .Thiscategoryincludescommitmessagesthatdo
not offer a rationale, for example, when it is common sense or easy
toinfer.Insuchcases,thereisnoneedtoprovidearationale.These
includethe following six subcategories:
mw1Test cases (#4, 1.6%): these commits involve adding test
cases to the repository; in many projects, there is consensus
among developers to add test cases for each feature. For
example, “testsfor cancelingasyncrequests.” [#S21].
mw2Typographic fixes (#7, 2.8%): these commits involve the
correction of typographic errors. Fixing such errors helps to
increasethecorrectnessandreadabilityofcodeordocumen-
tation,for example: “fix typo a->an” [#S4].
mw3Textfilechanges (#13,5.2%):thesecommitsinvolvechanges
made only in text files. Such files have specific functions,
suchas“ChangeLog”filesthatrecordchanges,“README”
files that outlinethe project, and so on.
mw4Annotationchanges (#5,2.0%):annotationchangesspecif-
ically refer to the motivation to modify the content of an-
notations. Annotations are descriptions of code objects, and
their main purpose is to increase the readability of the code,
so the “Why” for comment changes is common sense. For
example, “add docs about null responses” [#261].
mw5Code refactoring (#15,6.0%):thesechanges involverefac-
toring and formatting of code. Changes may include pol-
ishing, formatting, renaming, cleaning up and other similar
operations to imp rove the r eadability of the code. For exam-
ple,“Polish pom.xml. Apply consistent formatting, drop JDK 8
support andcleanup repo [...]” [#S47].
mw6Version management (#5, 2.0%): these commits include
changesthatinvolveversionmanagement,suchastheup-
datingofversionnumbers.Thisisanessentialstepasittags
a specific version of the software, which is important for
maintainability, e,g., “prepare version 2.8.1” [#S150].
4.2.2 What Expression Categories. Weidentifiedfourcategories
to express change, i.e. how to express “What” in commit messages.
We introduce these categories with examples as follows, including
their counts and percentages in the 252 analyzed commit messages
(indicated in parentheses).
Summarize Code Object Change .The first category repre-
sents commit messages that summarize the changes; effectively
asummaryofthe diffs.Weidentifiedthefollowingsubcategories:
sc1Characteristics of changes (#13, 5.2%): this subcategory
highlights the characteristics of the current code change
andcompares them with other alternative implementations
to summarize code changes. For example, in this commit
message the developer described an “attempt at a 3rd I/O in-
terface”,anddescribedtheimplementationasbeing “inspired
by InputStream and OutputStream, but using growing buffers
2396WhatMakesa Good Commit Message? ICSE’22,May21–29,2022,Pittsburgh,PA, USA
instead of byte arrays as the core data container” [#S141]
(advocating against fixed-size byte arrays).
sc2Object of change (#143, 56.8%): commit messages in this
subcategory summarize the changes from the point of view
ofthe codeobjects.Overhalf ofthecommits expressWhat
was changed by pointing out the changed object, which
refers to the key component of this change, and developers
highlight this in the message. These code objects include at-
tributes, methods, classes, packages, and so on. For example,
“remove creation of ‘fat’ jar...” [#S157].
sc3Changelist (#6,2.4%):commitmessagesinthissubcategory
indicate changes of several code objects, involving one or
more source files. For example, “this commit removes the
following deprecated properties: * ‘server.connection-timeout’
* ‘server.use-forward-headers’ [...]” [#S154].
sc4Contrast before and after (#16, 6.4%): messages in this
subcategory contrast the state of code objects before and
after changes. The following is an example of a contrast be-
fore/aftermessage: “renameHeldCertificate.Builder.issuedBy()
to signedBy()” [#S64].
DescribeImplementationPrinciple .Thiscategoryrepresents
commit messages describing technical principles underpinning the
changes.Theimplementationrationaleshowstheprocessbywhich
the code executes correctly. For example, “SslContextBuilder was
usingInetAddress.getByName(null)[...]OnAndroid,nullreturnsIPv6
loopback, which has the name ‘ip6-localhost’ ” [#S251]. Only six
commits(out of 252, 2.4%) fell in this category.
Illustrate Function .Commit messages in this category sum-
marize and explain code changes from a functional perspective.
Unlike describing specific changes in code, these messages pay
more attention to functional changes. Such messages inform other
contributorswhathaschangedbydescribinganynewbehaviorsin-
troducedbythesechanges.Forexample, “Renamepreferred-mapper
property so its clear it only applies to JSON” [#S169]. This category
iscommon,65outofthe252analyzedcommitsexpresswhatwas

lack any specification of what was changed. Typically any such
changesaresmallandsimplethatcanbeeasilyinferred.Wefindthis
categoryin19commits(accountingfor7.5%).Commonexamples
are the correction of typographic errors, renaming of source code
objects, and addingand removing spaces.
4.2.3 Linking Maintenance Dimensions to Commit Messages. As
discussed in Sec. 2, the nature of maintenance activities varies
by type as defined by Mockus and Votta [ 49]. Different types of
maintenanceactivities(as perthe typology ofMockus andVotta
[49]) tend to take different ways to describe changes. We analyzed
the distribution of the expression categories of Why and What
in the different development activities (see Table 3). It is worth
notingthatsomedevelopersusemultiple(butnomorethantwo)
expression categories together when describing Why or What, and
thesemessagesaccountforonlyasmallpercentage,i.e.,nomore

Describe Issue is the most common expression category to ex-

of45.7%.Developersalsoexpresstherationaleofcodechangeby
combining Describe Issue with Describe objective (0.8%)and
Imply necessity (2.6%). Likewise, Summary of code object
changes is the most common category to describe the What for
this maintenancetype in a commit message, at 58.6%.
For Adaptive changes, developers often describe Why by in-
directly implying the necessity of the change (category Imply
Necessity ), with the highest proportion of 39.7%, and followed
bythe Illustrate Requirement category, whichclarifies the re-
quirementsthatunderpinthechange.Apossiblereasonmightbe

However, the implementation of most new features requires multi-

Summary for RQ2: We identified five expression categories
of “Why” and four expression categories of “What.” Further,
we found that developers have different expression preferences
when writing commit messages for different activities. The
results can help developers write a good commit message.
4.3 Automatically Classifying Good Messages
We performed a ten-fold cross-validation to estimate the classi-
fiers’ performance. The 1,597 messages were randomly partitioned
intotensubsetsofsimilarsize.Thevalidationhadtenrounds;in
each round, nine subsets were used to train the model, and the
remaining one was used for testing. A different subset was used
for testing in each round. We reported the average performance
ofthetenrounds.Toinvestigatetheimpactofdifferentclassifica-
tion techniques on the performance of our approach, we achieved
our classifiers based on eight common classification techniques
respectively (see Sec. 3.4) and repeated the evaluation on the same
dataset. Table 4 presents the performance of C-WhyandC-What
usingdifferentclassificationtechniques.Theseresultsindicatethat
Bi-LSTMhasthebestperformanceonboth C-WhyandC-What,
with an accuracy of 84.7% and 91.0%. This result is consistent with
prior findings [ 40,80], namely that deep learning based neural net-
worksarebetteratprocessingtextclassificationtasks.Therefore,
we chose Bi-LSTM to build our classifiers.

5 IMPLICATIONS
Commitmessages are of pivotal importance to facilitate coordina-
tionandcommunicationamongdevelopersandthusitisimportant
tounderstandwhatconstitutesgoodmessagesandhowtheyare
written.We discuss implications for developers and researchers.
Implications for Developers . Our analysis of how the Why
and What information is expressed offers developers an under-
standing of what constitutes a good commit message. At the same
time,theresultsoflinkingmaintenanceactivitiestothemessage
expressioncategoriescanpromptdeveloperstowritebettercom-
mit messages. For example, when performing a corrective task,
developers could initially choose the most common expression cat-
egory (applicable in many scenarios), i.e., Describe Issue ; this
would not only improve the commit message, but may also inspire

key code objects so that other developers can grasp the focus more
quickly.Wehopethesecanimprovethequalityofcommitmessages
in the long term.
We also designed two automatic tools for developers to check
whether the commit message being written conforms to a good
one, i.e., containing both Why and What. With the help of these
tools,thedevelopercanknowwhatismissinginhis/hercommit

Implications for Researchers . Our study demonstrates that
considerableproportionsofcommitmessagesareofpoorquality
(an average of 44% in the five popular OSS projects), suggesting
that this important modality for developers to share knowledge is
not used optimally. While this has consequences for the long-term
maintainabilityofanyproject,wealsoobservedthatapproaches
for automatic generation of commit messages are trained with
uncurated data, i.e., datasets with commit messages that are not
filtered based onquality. In turn,such models generate low-quality
commit messages as well, which exacerbates the issue of poorly
writtencommitmessages.
Nevertheless,itistime-consumingforresearcherstocurategood
commitmessagesmanually.Weproposedanautomaticclassifier
(i.e.,C-Good) thatperforms wellin identifyinggood commitmes-
sages (precision: 81.6%). This classifier has the potential to help
researchersconstructalargedatasetofhigh-qualitycommitmes-
sagesfrommassivehistoricaldatastoredinGitHubandotherVCSs.
In the future, it is necessary to construct a standard dataset of com-
mitmessages to facilitate comparison among different generation
methods and promote the quality of generated messages.

We are aware of some threats to validity which we discuss next.
When constructing the dataset, we removed commit messages gen-
erated by known bots [ 7,22,23,27]. It may be that new bots are
becoming more advanced and generating more human-like mes-
sages, suggesting a threat where the filtered data may still contain
somenon-human-writtenmessages.Futurework shouldconsider
suchdevelopmentsofnewbotsastheymayrequiremorecareful
data filtering. Notably, among the 1,649 manually analyzed mes-
sages, we did not find any new bot patterns, which suggest the
results of our qualitative analysis were not affected.
Manuallabelingofcommitmessagesposesasubjectivethreat
to validity. To minimize this threat, two authors labeled commit
messagesindependentlyandintroduced anexperiencedcolleague
inqualitativeresearchtoreachanagreementthroughseveraldis-
cussions. The agreement level (0.91) is high, indicating a high level
of reliability. Some of the labeled messages were subsequently con-
firmed by experienced OSS contributors. Further, the manually
analyzed messages come from 339 developers. It means that multi-
ple commit messages may originate from the same authors, which
pose a threat of limiting the diversity of the message taxonomy.
One strandof future workcan extendthis analysisto includemore
projects(andwritteninotherlanguagesthanJava),toverifyand,if
needed, enrich the taxonomy of commit messages reported in this
study.
Another threat is that the dataset (1,597 messages in total) is
notlargeenough fortrainingclassifiers.Thedatasetwas randomlysampled from the five OSS projects, and its limited scale is because
ofthecomplexityinvolvedinmanuallabelingandanalysisofthe
commitmessages.Toreducethisthreat,weusedaten-foldcross-
validationproceduretogetasmuchvalidinformation(nine-fold)
fromthedatasetaspossibleandusetheaverageperformanceon
different test datasets to improve the models’ capability to general-
ize [59]. However, developers may write better messages over time.
The ten-fold cross-validation, i.e., randomly divided ten subsets,
did not consider the influence of time on developers’ experience
in writing message. This is one potential strand for future work to
furtheradd rigorto these results.
When automatically classifying commit messages, other factors
may be related to the quality of commit messages. For example,
ChahalandSaini[ 14]proposed11format-relatedmetricstomea-
sure the syntax quality of commit messages. Our classifiers only
used the text content of messages as input for training. To alle-
viatethisthreat,wereplacedthoseformat-relatedelementswith
aunifiedtokenduringpreprocessing(seeSec.3.4),suchasusing
“<enter>” to represent line brakes. This preprocessing ensures that
syntacticfeaturesareconsideredduringtheclassificationofcommit
messages.
Threats to external validity consider the generalization of our
findings. The dataset we analyzed was collected from five popular
projects on GitHub implemented in Java, thus posing a threat to
external validity. Our findings may not be generalizable to other
projects,whethertheyareopenorclosed-source,orprojectsthat
use other languages. It is very well possible that developers us-
ing other programming languages have different message-written
patterns that have not been explored in the scope of this work.
Future studies could investigate more diverse projects to gain a
deeper understanding of what constitutes a good commit message.
Notwithstandingtheselimitations,theautomaticclassificationtools
we proposed can be easily adapted to other projects with other lan-
guages by simply replacing datasets.
7 CONCLUSION
Commit messages play an important role in collaborating software
developmentand evolution. Nonetheless,theconsiderable propor-
tionsoflow-qualitymessagesinOSSprojectsreflectthedifficulties
that developers face when writing commit messages, and threaten
the effectiveness of existing automatic commit message generation
tools. Our study explored the distribution and expression patterns
of these well-written messages, linked message expression cate-
gories to different maintenance activities, and construct several
automatic identification models of good commit messages. Our
study findings can help developers write good commit messages
and assist researchers to construct high-quality datasets before
generatingmessagesautomatically.
