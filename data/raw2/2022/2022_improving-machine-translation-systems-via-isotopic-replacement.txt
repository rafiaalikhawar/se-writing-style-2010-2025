ABSTRACT
Machinetranslationplaysanessentialroleinpeople’sdailyinterna-
tional communication. However, machine translation systems are
farfromperfect. To tacklethisproblem,researchershaveproposed
several approaches to testing machine translation. A promising
trendamongtheseapproachesistousewordreplacement,where
only one word in the original sentence is replaced with another
wordtoformasentencepair.However,precisecontroloftheim-
pact of word replacement remains an outstanding issue in these
approaches.
Toaddressthisissue,weproposeCAT,anovelword-replacement-
basedapproach,whosebasic ideaistoidentifywordreplacement
with controlled impact (referred to as isotopic replacement). To
achieve this purpose, we use a neural-based language model to
encodethesentencecontext,anddesignaneural-network-based
algorithmtoevaluatecontext-awaresemanticsimilaritybetween

word-replacement-basedapproach,CATalsoprovidesautomatic
fixing of revealed bugs without model retraining.
Our evaluation on Google Translate and Transformer indicates
thatCATachievessignificantimprovementsoverTransRepair.In
particular, 1) CAT detects seven more types of bugs than TransRe-
pair; 2) CAT detects 129% more translation bugs than TransRepair;
3) CAT repairs twice more bugs than TransRepair, many of which
may bring serious consequences if left unfixed; and 4) CAT has
better efficiency than TransRepair in input generation (0.01s v.s.0.41s) and comparable efficiency with TransRepair in bug repair
(1.92s v.s. 1.34s).

1 INTRODUCTION
Machine translation systems, such as Google Translate, translate a
textfromasourcelanguageintoatargetlanguageautomatically.
They play an essential role in overcoming communication barriers
acrosstheglobe,providingtranslationservicestomillionsofend
users everyday. In2018, Facebook reportedits deployment ofma-
chinetranslationsupportingapproximately2,000languagepairs,
servingapproximately4.5billiontranslatedpostimpressionsevery
day,therebyallowing600millionpeopletoreadtranslatedposts
in their mother tongue [ 14]. By January of 2021, Google Translate
has been reported to support 109 languages, with more than 100
billion words translated per day [34].
Poortranslationshavebeenknowntobeaseriousproblemfor
a considerably long period of time. For example, mistranslations of
Article 17 of the Treaty of Uccialli led to a war [ 9], while mistrans-
lation of the Japanese government’s response may have influenced
American Government’s decision to use the atom bomb during
WorldWar II[ 1]. Theseproblems predate theadvent ofmachine
translation,butarearguablyexacerbatedbytheapparenteasewith

ation become, as we rely more and more on automated machinetranslation; currently with translation processes that afford few
checks and corrections?

As we move to a scenario in which machines routinely translate
natural language sentences, the potential for misunderstandings
maybecomemagnified.Thismakesautomatedtranslationanim-
portantnewapplicationfortestingandevaluation.Furthermore,
given that machine translation is typically used in scenarios where
there is no human in the loop, and thus no time to respond to
failedtestcases,itisalsohighlyimportantthatwehaveinplace
techniques for automated repair.
Machinetranslationsystemscurrentlyhavefarmorefrequent
mistranslations than human translations, causing problems in eco-
nomics and safety, becoming a source of international tension, and
alsopotentiallyviolatinghumanrights[ 32].Theseissueshighlight
the importance of automatic improvement of machine translations.
Recently,quiteafewapproaches(e.g.,SIT[ 15],TransRepair[ 32],
and PathInv [ 12]) have been proposed for testing machine transla-
tion systems. In particular, approaches based on word replacement,
whereonlyonewordintheoriginalsentenceisreplacedwithan-
other word, have received intensive attention. Intuitively, since
onlyonewordintheoriginalsentenceischanged,theprediction
of the corresponding change on the translation is thus easier than
the situation where multiple words in the original sentence are
changed.However,precisecontroloftheimpactofwordreplace-
ment in word-replacement-based approaches is still difficult due to
the fuzzy semantics of natural language words.
Inthispaper,weproposeanovelword-replacement-basedap-
proach (namedCAT1) tomachine translationtesting. Given asen-
tence in the source language, CAT performs isotopic replacement,
which is a special type of word replacement, to generate new sen-
tences. The goal of isotopic replacement is to control the impactof word replacement so that the translation of the sentence after
wordreplacementshouldverylikelybesimilartothetranslation
of the sentence before word replacement. Our insight is that thekey to control the impact of word replacement is to control thesemantic difference between the two words. In a typical natural
language, the semantics of a word is comparatively stable, but the
semantics mayalso varyto someextent indifferent sentences[ 8].
Therefore, it is necessary to consider the impact of contexts on the
semantics of words when performing isotopic replacement. As a
result, we design an algorithm to calculate context-aware semantic
similarity between each pair of words. Our algorithm uses a neural
architecture to encode the sentence context during replacement,
thereby making the replacement context-aware. On top of context
encoding,ouralgorithmfurtherperformsneural-basedsemantic
evaluationtoguaranteethatthesemanticdifferencebetweenthe
words under replacement is small enough. Following TransRepair,
our approach is also able to repair bugs revealed during testing.
WeempiricallyevaluatedCATtogetherwithTransRepairontwo
state-of-the-artmachinetranslationsystems,GoogleTranslate[ 10]
and Transformer [ 33]. The translation is between the top two most
widelyusedlanguages,EnglishandChinese,with2,001sentence
pairs. Our experimental results show that CAT significantly out-performs TransRepair in both effectiveness and efficiency: CATdetects
seven more types of bugs than TransRepair. It detects
129%/129%morebugsandrepairs199% /238%morebugsthanTran-
sRepaironGoogleTranslate/Transformer,respectively.Overhalf

replacementshouldbesimilar.Heetal.[ 15]replaceonewordin
the original sentence with another word that would also fit intothe structure of the original sentence, and expect that the twotranslations of the original sentence and the generated sentenceshould also have a similar structure. In particular, this approach
(namedSIT)adoptsthemaskedlanguagemodel(MLM)[ 5]todeter-
mine which words are likely to fit into the structure of the original
sentence.NotethatthewordreplacementinSITisprimarilysyn-
tacticalwithoutexplicitconsiderationofsemantics.Furthermore,
sinceMLMconsidersthecontextoftheoriginalsentencewhengen-
erating the replacement, many syntactically suitable replacements
are excluded. For example, when facing Make it a requirement that
only half is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales)., SIT gen-
erates a sentence by replacing “half” with “English”. The approach
(named TransRepair) to machine translation testing proposed in
Sun et al. [ 32] replaces a word with another semantically similar
word (e.g., girls − →boys), and expect the generated sentence may
lead to a similar translation with the original translation for the
unchanged part in thesentence. In particular, TransRepair adopts
vectorrepresentationofwords[ 26,29]tocalculatethesimilarity
ofeach pairofwords.Sincethe vectorrepresentation ofeachword
is calculated on the basis of all sentences containing the word in a
corpus,thesimilarityvaluesbetweenwordsusedinTransRepair
do not consider the specific context of the original sentence.
Ourapproach(namedCAT)tomachinetranslationtestinggener-
ally falls into the category of word-replacement-based approaches.
Similar to SIT [ 15] and TransRepair [ 32], our approach also ex-
pectsthatthechangeofonewordwouldnotresultinsubstantial
differenceinthetranslations.However,ourapproachisbasedon
the concept of isotopic replacement, where one word is replaced
with only words that differ subtly from the original word. Then

topicreplacementisapplicabletoallpartsofspeech,whileexisting
word-replacement-based approaches are specific to only few parts
ofspeech.Forexample,wordreplacementinSITisspecifictonouns
and adjectives; and word replacement in TransRepair is specific to
nouns, adjectives, and numbers.Therehavebeenwordreplacementresearchforothertasks,such
as attacking/testing/defending models on different classification
tasks[11,19,20,24,28,37].Therequirementoftheirwordreplace-
ment is to keep the classification result unchanged. As a result, the

tence, thereby not being applicable for machine translation testing.

2.2 Machine Translation Repair
Torepairtherevealedbugsandimprovemachinetranslation,exist-
ing approaches are typically based on data augmentation. Heigold
etal.[17],Sperberetal.[ 30],andBelinkovandBisk[ 2]proposed
to add the generated sentences (noises) used for robustness testing
to the training data and retrain the model. Cheng et al. [ 4] and
Ebrahimi et al. [ 7] used the gradient-based approach to generating
sentences for model retraining. Different from these approaches,
therearealsosomeapproachesimprovingrobustnessofmachine
translationbydesigningsomeadditionalneuralcomponents.Cheng
et al. [4] added a component to distinguish the noises from the
training set, while Belinkov and Bisk [ 2] used a character-level
representation.
Theaboveapproachesneedmodelretraining.Toourknowledge,
theonlyapproachthatisabletorepairmachinetranslationwithout
model retraining is TransRepair by Sun et al. [ 32]. In particular,
TransRepair adopts a post processing based strategy for repair. For
a bug-revealing sentence, TransRepair generates several similarsentences via the same word replacement strategy in its testing
phase;andthencombinesthetranslationsofthesesimilarsentencesandtheoriginalsentencetorepairthebug.OurCATadoptsasimilar
strategy withTransRepair forrepair, butthe generationof similar
sentencesfor repairin CAT isalso basedon isotopicreplacement.
Accordingtoourevaluationresults,therepaireffectivenessofCAT

our approach further ensures thatthe replacement of 𝑤with𝑤𝑓
in𝑠isisotopicreplacement,whichonlysubtlyimpacts 𝑠.Thekey
idea to realise isotopic replacement is to evaluate context-aware
semantic similarity between 𝑤and each candidate replacement
word𝑤𝑟∈𝐶𝑤in the context of 𝑠.
Figure 1 depicts an overview of CAT. There are two stages in
CAT for conducting isotopic replacement. In the first stage, CAT
generates a set of word replacement candidates 𝐶𝑤for each word
𝑤intheinputsentence 𝑠.Inthesecondstage,CATidentifiesthe
final set of words 𝑊𝑤from word candidates 𝐶𝑤to achieve iso-
topicreplacementviaevaluatingcontext-awaresemanticsimilarity
between each word in 𝑤𝑟∈𝐶𝑤and the word 𝑤in sentence 𝑠.
This section mainly introduces these two parts (candidate word
generationinSection3.2andsemanticevaluationinSection3.3).
The remaining steps of translation testing and repair are similar
to the corresponding steps in TransRepair. To make our presen-tation self-contained, we provide some necessary information in
Section 3.4 for convenience.
3.2 Candidate Word Generation
Inordertorealiseisotopicreplacement,wefirstgenerateasetof
candidatewords 𝐶𝑤foreachword 𝑤intheinputoriginalsentence

context-aware semantic similarity.
Given an input sentence 𝑠, CAT generates such candidate words
𝐶𝑤byensuringthateachwordin 𝐶𝑤isalsosuitableforthecontext.
Torealiseouridea,weusetheBidirectionalEncoderRepresenta-
tionsfromTransformers(BERT)[ 5]toencodethesentencecontext
and check which words are suitable for the context.

aninputsentenceandoutputsareal-valued vectorforeachword
withinthesentencebasedonthecontext.Whenperformingaword
replacement, a word to be replaced in the input sentence is first
masked by a special mark “[MASK]”. For example, in Figure 2, the
word“Within”ismaskedfortheinputsentence“Withinthepast
decades...”.Thesentencewiththemaskedwordisthenfedtothe
BERTmodel,whichextractsasetofreal-valuedvectors.Toconduct
word replacement, BERT feeds the vector of the word “[MASK]” to
apre-trainedlinearclassifierandgetsasetofpredictedwordswith
different prediction probability.Givenaninputsentence 𝑠withawordsequence 𝑤1,𝑤2,···,𝑤𝑁,
where𝑁isthetotalnumberofwords,wemaskthewordsinthe
sentence in turn (one word being masked each time) and feed each
masked sentence into BERT.
TheoutputsofBERTareasetofvectors 𝒉1,𝒉2,···,𝒉𝑁,which
denotesthecontext-awarevectorrepresentationoftheinputwords.
Then, a pre-trained linear classifier takes the vector of the masked
word 𝒉maskasaninput,andoutputsasetofinitialcandidatewords
𝐶𝑖. Each word in 𝐶𝑖has a predictive probability. The sum of the
probabilitiesofallthecandidatewordsis1.0.Wethenuseaprob-
ability filter to discard the words with low predictive probability
(we set the threshold as 0.05 to remove the words that are most
unlikely to be qualified). In addition, if the word is the same as the
originalwordwemasked,wediscardthisword.Finally,wetreatthe remaining words as word candidates

word𝑤𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘, each of which can be used to fill the masked word in
the original input sentence for replacement.
Notethat,theaboveprocedureforwordgenerationiscontext-
aware,becauseBERTpredictsthemaskedwordbasedonexactly
the remaining parts of the sentence.
3.3 Semantic Evaluation
Isotopicreplacementaimstoidentifyasetofwords 𝑊𝑤foreach
word𝑤in input sentence 𝑠such that each word in 𝑊𝑤only subtly
differsfrom 𝑤inthecontextof 𝑠.Incandidatewordgeneration,we
generateasetofcandidatewords 𝐶𝑤fortheword 𝑤in𝑠.However,
there are occasions that BERT predicts a masked word that has
similarcontextwiththeoriginalword,butwithdifferentmeanings.
Therefore, we next compute the context-aware semantic similarity
and use it to discard the inappropriate words in 𝐶𝑤for identifying
the final word set 𝑊𝑤.
To achieve our purpose, we propose a novel neural-based mech-
anism for the evaluation of context-aware semantic similarity. The
key step to compute the context-aware semantic similarity in CAT
is to measure the wordvector similarity between the originalword
anditsreplacedword.Inourapproach,weagainuseBERTtoget
the output word vectors, which is the most widely used word2vec
approach in natural language processing [ 5,21,40]. Unlike the us-
age of BERT in candidate word generation in the previous section,
we do not feed BERT with a masked sentence, but directly take the
wholetokenisedsentenceasitsinput.Inthismanner,BERTfirst
representsawordasavectortrainedfromthetrainingcorpus.The
vector indicates the semantics of this single word. BERT further
considersthesentencecontextandcomputesacontext-awarese-
mantic representation. In this way, we get a series of word vectors
for each word in each sentence, as the final word vectors.
Then, we measure the context-aware semantic similarity be-
tween the word 𝑤in𝑠(denoted by 𝒉𝑎) and the candidate word
𝑤𝑟∈𝐶𝑤in𝑠𝑟, which is generated via replacing 𝑤in𝑠with𝑤𝑟,
(denotedby 𝒉𝑏)byusingthecosinesimilarity CosSimoftheirword
vectors:
CosSim(𝒉𝑎,𝒉𝑏)=𝒉𝑎𝒉𝑏
|𝒉𝑎||𝒉𝑏|. (1)
The overall process of our semantic evaluation is detailed by
Algorithm 1. Foran input sentence 𝑠,aw o r d𝑤in𝑠, and theset of
the candidatewords 𝐶𝑤generated viacandidate wordgeneration,
we aim at getting a final word set 𝑊𝑤. We first define an empty set

𝑊𝑤for collecting the words after evaluation (Line 1). For the word
𝑤in𝑠, we further extract its word vector 𝒉𝑎via BERT (Lines 2).
Next,foreachcandidateword 𝑤𝑟∈𝐶𝑤,weuseittoreplace 𝑤in
𝑠andgenerateamutantsentence 𝑠𝑟(Lines3and4).Fortheword
𝑤𝑟in𝑠𝑟, we extract its word vector 𝒉𝑏(Line 5). Then, to capture
the context-aware semantic similarity of the above two words, we
compute the introduced cosine similarity 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑆𝑖𝑚of their word
vectors 𝒉𝑎and𝒉𝑏(Line 6). If the similarity is above the predefined
threshold 𝑆𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 (we set the threshold to be 0.85), it passes
the evaluation (Line 7). Thus, we add the word 𝑤𝑟to the set 𝑊𝑤as
afinalgeneratedone(Line8).Afterwehaveevaluatedallwords
automatically,weoutputthefinalwordset 𝑊𝑤forword𝑤in𝑠(Line
11). This process ensures that the replacement of 𝑤with𝑤𝑓∈𝑊𝑤
in𝑠is isotopic.
Finally,weinturnusetheword 𝑤𝑓∈𝑊𝑤toreplacetheword
𝑤in𝑠and repeat this process for each word in 𝑠to generate a final
set of sentences 𝑀𝑓. We refer to each of these finally generated
sentences as a mutant [ 18,25]. This generated set of mutants is
further used for automatic testing (each mutant is paired with the
original sentence as one test input pair) and repair.

3.4 Testing and Repair
The process of test oraclegeneration and black/grey-box repair in
CAT is the same as TransRepair. We briefly introduce the details in
this section.
3.4.1 Test Oracle Generation. Foreachtestinput (𝑠,𝑚),where𝑚∈
𝑀𝑓,let𝑟(𝑠)and𝑟(𝑚)bethetranslationresultsofinputsentences
𝑠and its mutant 𝑚. Mutant 𝑚is generated by replacing a word
𝑤1in𝑠with another word 𝑤2. CAT generates the test oracle by
computing the similarity between 𝑟(𝑠)and𝑟(𝑚)excluding the
translationchangescausedby 𝑤1and𝑤2.Toremovethecontext
changes, we computes the similarity of the subsequences of 𝑟(𝑠)
and𝑟(𝑚)andfurtherselectsthelargestsimilaritytoapproximate
the similarity of 𝑟(𝑠)and𝑟(𝑚). When the similarity is below the
predefined threshold, CAT reports an inconsistency bug.3.4.2 Black/Grey-box Repair. Black-box and grey-box repair trans-
formthe originaltranslation basedon thebesttranslation among
thetranslationsformutants.Therearetwowaysofchoosingthe
best translation, one using predictive probability (grey-box), the
other using cross-reference (black-box).
In detail, CAT first repairs the translation of the original sen-
tences in a bug-revealing test case and then it seeks to find a trans-
lation for the mutant, which passes the consistency test.
For the original sentence, CAT generates a set of mutants and
gets their translations. It further ranks these translations based
on thepredictive probability ofthe machinetranslation orcross-
reference in decreasing order. CAT maps back the translation with
thehighestrankingtothetranslationoforiginalsentenceviaword
alignment [ 23]. If the mapping back fails, it selects the translation
with a lower ranking.
Forthemutant,CATusesthesamerepairprocessastheoriginal
sentence but marks the output as a candidate solution. We then
checks whether the candidate solution passes the testing with the
repaired translation of the original sentence as test input. If not,
CAT proceeds by checking other candidate solutions.
4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Inthissection,weintroducetheprocedurewefollowtoevaluate
CAT.
4.1 Research Questions
To evaluate CAT we begin by investigating the extent to which iso-
topicreplacementbringsvalueintesting,i.e.,helpstheconstruction
of test cases. Thus, we ask:RQ1: How effective is CAT in generating test inputs?
To answer this question, we consider the quantity, distribution,
validity, and diversity of the test inputs generated with isotopic
replacement. To ensure validity, we conduct a manual check on
whether the replaced word in the mutant leads to grammatical
errors, whether the semantic meaning of the mutant sentence is
reasonable,andwhetherthemutantoughttohaveconsistenttrans-
lations with the original sentence.
By showing that CAT helps designing test inputs, we then turn
our attention to the actual value of interest, bug detection and bug
repair. We first focus on bug detection and ask:RQ2: How effective is CAT in bug detection?
Here,wefocusonthebug-revealingabilityofCAT.Tothisend,we
test Google Translate (GT) and Transformer with the test inputsgenerated in RQ1 to investigate: 1) the number of inconsistency
bugs reported by automated test oracles; 2) the diversity of the de-
tected inconsistency bugs; 3) the precision, recall, and F-1 measure
of bug detection based on manual inspection.
Having presented the bug-revealing ability of CAT, we turn our
attention to its repairing ability. Hence, we ask:RQ3: How effective is CAT in bug repair?
Toanswerthisquestion,foreachreportedbugonGoogleTranslate
(GT) and Transformer, we use CAT to repair the bug automatically
(withbothblack-boxandgrey-boxrepair).Wethusfollowthesame
procedureasinRQ2andinvestigate:1)therepaireffectivenessmea-
suredbyautomatedtestoracles;2)thediversityofrepairedbugs;
and 3) the validity of reported fixes based on manual inspection.

Uptothispoint,inouranalysis,weonlyinvestigatedtestand
repair effectiveness. However, this analysis tells nothing about the
time required to conduct the testing and repair tasks. Therefore,
we ask:
RQ4: What is the efficiency of CAT?
Toanswerthisquestion,werepeattheexperimentsofCATinRQ1-
3andrecordthetimecost.Then,weinvestigate:1)thetimecost
ofisotopicreplacement;2)thetimecostofbugdetectionforeach

Since CAT follows TransRepair for improving machine trans-
lation, for eachresearch question, we set TransRepair [ 32]a sa
baseline, and report the improvement of CAT over TransRepair
underidenticalconfiguration. Thecomparisonwithother testing
approaches can be referred to the extended analysis in Section 6.1.

Transformer: Transformerisanattention-basedsequence-to-sequence

shown to be effective in various areas including machine trans-

Google Translate is a neural machine trans-
lation system developed by Google. We select Google Translatedue to it being a mainstream translation system, which has over
500 million total users with more than 100 billion words translated
daily [34].
4.3 Implementation Settings
The implementation of CAT is based on the standard BERT that is
publiclyavailable[ 36].TheBERTmodelcontains24-layers,1024
hidden size, 16 heads. The model was trained on 16 TPU chips for
one million steps with a batch size of 256. For TransRepair, we
implement it with the same setting according to the paper [ 32]. To
perform a fair comparison, we follow the setting of the previous
approach [ 32] and generate at most 5 valid mutants for each input
sentence during testing and at most 16 valid mutants for eachsentence in a each buggy test case during repair. We perform an
additionalexperimentinSection6.2tostudytheinfluenceofthis
mutant number upper bound.
We conduct experiments on Ubuntu 16 .04 with 256GB RAM
andfourIntelE5-2620v4CPUs.Theneuralnetworks(BERTand
Transformer) are all trained and inference on 8 Nvidia Titan RTXs.

5 RESULTS
Inthissection,weintroducetheresultsofourexperimenttoanswer
the research questions.
5.1 Effectiveness of Test Generation (RQ1)
Toanswerthisquestion,foreachtestsentenceinourdataset(2,001
alltogether),wegeneratemutantswithCATandTransRepair.Each
mutant is paired with the original sentence to form a test input.
Wethenrecordthequantity(i.e.,totalnumberoftestinputs),dis-
tribution (i.e., the number of generated test inputs per sentence),
validity(i.e.,whetherthemutantandtheoriginalsentenceinatest
inputshouldyieldconsistenttranslationsforbugdetection),and
diversity (i.e., the types of generated mutants).Quantity:
Forthe2,001inputsentences,11,045candidatewords
are generated by isotopic replacement, and 1,103 are further dis-
cardedbycandidatefiltering(usingautomaticsemanticevaluation).Intotal,CATgenerates9,942mutantsthatcouldbepairedwiththe
originalsentencesastestinputsfortranslationtesting.ForTran-
sRepair,itgenerates21,960mutantcandidatesbywordreplacement
with17,268discardedbycandidatefiltering(usingStandfordparser).
It finally yields 4,692 test inputs.
TheseresultsshowthatCATgeneratessignificantlymoretest
inputs than TransRepair. In particular, CAT’s isotopic replacement
increases candidates’ possibility of passing semantic evaluation.
For CAT, 90% of the mutant candidates pass the filtering; for Tran-
sRepair, only 21% mutant candidates pass the filtering due to its
ignoranceofthecontextinformationoftheoriginalinputsentences.
Inthefollowing,wedigdeepintothedistribution,diversity,and
validity of the generated mutants.
Distribution: We use violin graphs to demonstrate the entire dis-
tributionoftestinputsgeneratedforeachsentence.Figure3showstheresults.Inthisfigure,weobservethatthenumberoftestinputs
generated by CAT reaches 5 (the upper bound, more details in Sec-
tion 4.3) for most of the input sentences. However, for TransRepair,
many sentences have fewer than 5 test inputs.
In particular, the isotopic replacement enables CAT to generate
test inputs for almost all the sentences (with only three sentences,
i.e., 0.15%, having no generated test inputs). However, for Tran-sRepair, it fails to generate test inputs for as many as 43.7% of
the sentences. Consequently, TransRepair is not able to detect any
translation bugs for those sentences.Diversity:
We further compare CAT and TransRepair from the as-
pectofmutantdiversity,i.e.,thetypeofgeneratedmutantsinterms
ofpart-of-speechofthereplacedw ord.Thepart-of-speechtypes
include Noun, Adj. (Adjective), Adv. (Adverb), Num. (Numeral),
Verb, Deter. (Determiner), Conj. (Conjunction), Pron. (Pronoun),
Prep. (Preposition), and Others.
Figure4showsthenumberofmutantsbelongingtoeachtype.
Overall, we observe that most mutants TransRepair generated are
for nouns, adjectives, and numerals as mentioned in Section 1.
By contrast, CAT generates mutants for seven more types of

different types of test inputs reveal different types of inconsis-tency bugs. For example, TransRepair will miss the detection of
inconsistency bugs aroused by verbs, which plays a key role in the
understanding of the sentence translation.

vestigate the effectiveness of semantic evaluation. It turns out that
withoutsemanticevaluation,10.0%ofthetestinputsareinvalid4.
With semantic evaluation, this proportion is reduced to 3.5%. Thus,
semantic evaluationremoves (10%- 3.5%)/ 10%= 65%invalid test
inputs.
We further investigate the validity of test inputs on different
typesofmutants.Table1showstheresults.Ineachcell,thefirst/second
number is for the valid/total number of inputs belonging to the
corresponding type. The ratio in brackets is the proportion of valid
inputs. Interestingly, we observe that the “Adj.” mutant type has
thelowestvalidityforbothCATandTransRepair.Thisobservation
shows possibilities for further validity improvement for test input
generation in machine translation testing.
Overall, for RQ1, we have the following conclusion:
Answer to RQ1 : CAT outperforms TransRepair in the
quantity, distribution, diversity, and validity of the gen-
eratedtestinputs.Inparticular,CATgenerates 9,942test
inputs, covering 99.9%of the input sentences and 10types
of mutants, with a validity score of 96.5%based on man-
ualinspection.ForTransRepair,thesenumbersare4,692,
66.3%, 3, and 93.0%, respectively.
5.2 Effectiveness of Bug Detection (RQ2)
To answer RQ2, for each test input generated by CAT or Tran-
sRepair,wefeeditintoGoogleTranslateandTransformertoget
itstranslations,thenapplythesimilaritymetricstoautomatically
decide the test input reveals a bug.
Table2showsthenumberofbugsreportedbyCATandTransRe-
pairwitheachsimilaritymetric.WeobservethatCATsignificantly
outperforms TransRepair in the number of reported bugs. On aver-
age,CATdetects129%morebugsthanTransRepaironbothGoogle
Translate and Transformer.
We further investigate the diversity of the reported bugs. The
results are shown in Figure 5, where we select the reported bugs
ontheLCSsimilaritymetricasanexample.WeobservethatCAT
reports diverse bugs aroused by 1 0 types of part-of-speeches. Tran-
sRepaircanonlydetectthebugsfornouns,adjectives,andnumerals
but could hardly detect bugs aroused by the words in other part-of-
speeches.
The overall results are as expected because as shown by RQ1,
CAT generates a larger quantity of, more diverse, and more widely
distributed mutants than TransRepair, which contributes to its
overall bug detection ability.

Validity of repaired translations. The first two authors manu-
ally check the bug fixes on the LCS similarity metric with cross-
reference on Transformer. The purpose is to check whether a bug
fixbased onthesimilarity metricindeedimproves thetranslation
consistency.
Although CAT aims to repair translation inconsistency, it has a
“bonus” benefit of improving translation acceptability, which cap-
tures the property that a translation meets human assessment of a
reasonable(akaacceptable)translation.Thus,themanualinspec-
tionconsiderstwoaspects:1)theconsistencyoftranslationsbeforeand after repair; 2) the acceptability of the translations for the orig-
inal sentence as well as the mutants before and after repair. For

metric as an exampleeachdimension,wesetupthreelabels“Improved”,“Unchanged”,
and “Decreased”. We randomly sampled 100 reported fixes. Foracceptability, it checks the translation improvement of both the
original sentence and the mutant, thus all together 200 inspections
are conducted.

ability, CAT improves the translation acceptability for 32 (16.0%)sentences, with 15 (7.5%) sentences’ acceptability being dropped
(duetopossibletrade-offbetweenqualityandconsistencyaswell
as the incorrect alignment from the word alignment tool during
repair).TransRepairimprovesacceptabilityforthesamenumber

cases.
Table 5 shows some examples of translations that could be re-
paired by onlyCAT (TransRepair could repair none of them). In
this table, the first column is the input sentence. The second col-
umn is the Chinese translation of the input as well as the detected
translation bug (explained in blue text). The last column shows the
repaired translations.
AnswertoRQ3 :CATrepairstwicemorebugsthanTran-
sRepair. For diversity, CAT repairs approximately halfof the bugs under each bug type, whereas TransRepair
achieves competitive performance on only numerals (53%
for CATv.s. 47% for TransRepair),failing to repair 89% ofthe bugs under other types.

Approach TransRepair CAT
Mutantgeneration 0.41s0.01s
Bug detection 0.99s0.27s
Bug Repair 1.34s1.92s
The lower cost of CAT in mutant generation also contributes
to itslower costin bugdetection: CAT needs0.27s onaverage for
examining each sentence to report bugs, while TransRepair needs
0.99s.
For each reported bug, CAT spends 1.92s to conduct the auto-
matic repair, TransRepair spends 1.34s. The reason is that Tran-sRepair is not able to generate many mutants when fixing a bug,
yet each mutant requires a fetch of translation from Google Trans-
late/Transformerfortherepairprocess.Consequently,itstimespent
on each bug is lower than CAT. However, this lower time comes at
a significant cost: most bugs could not be repaired successfully (as
we have observed in RQ2) due to the insufficiency of mutants.
The overall results lead to the following conclusion:
Answerto RQ4 : CAT is significantly more efficient than
TransRepairinmutantgeneration(0.01sv.s.0.41s)andbug
detection (0.27s v.s. 0.99s). CAT has comparable efficiency
(slightlyworse)withTransRepairinbugrepair(1.92sv.s.
1.34s),whichisattributedtothelargernumberofmutants
that it employs.
6 EXTENDED ANALYSIS
In this section, we provide an analysis beyond the scope of our
research questions that can improve the understanding and better
explain the effectiveness of CAT.6.1 Comparison with Other Translation
Testing Approaches
AsintroducedinSection2,apartfromTransRepair,therearealso
some other translation testing approaches. This section explores
their effectiveness and discusses their differences with CAT.
We compare CAT (with LCS metric) with three most recently
publishedtestingmethods:SIT[ 15],PatInv[ 12],andPurity[ 16].For
SIT,PatInv,andPurityweusedtheirreleasedcodeandparameterise
themaccordingtotheirbestperformingparameters,asshownby
theirpapers.Table7presentsthenumberofbugsdetectedbythesefourapproachesonGoogleTranslate(GT)andTransformer.Ascanbe seen by these results, CAT and SIT detect many more bugs than
TransRepair, PatInv, and Purity.

GT 2,198 5,576 82 3,459 5,109
Transformer 1,957 5,368 99 3,518 4,545
These bugs are reported according to each approach’s own test
oracles.Thus,theyhavevariousbugtypes,notnecessarilyinconsis-tency bugs. To explore the possibility of employing these approachforthesamepurposeofCAT(i.e.,todetectinconsistencybugs),we
further conduct a manual inspection on the bugs each approach
reported, and report their validity in detecting inconsistency bugs.
To this end, the first two authors manually inspected9the reported
bugs and checked whether they actually exposed inconsistencytranslationissues.TheresultsofthisanalysisarerecordedinTa-ble 8. In this table, false positive (FP) means that the approachreports the translations as problematic (buggy) but the manualinspection actually finds out that it is correct, i.e., it is not a bug.False negative (FN) means that the approach reports the transla-tions as non-buggy but the manual inspection reveals that it isactually problematic (it is a bug). We observe that CAT achievesa significantly higher F1-score than SIT, PatInv, and Purity. Thisis not surprising considering that SIT, PatInv, and Purity aim to
detect different types of bugs.
9The Cohen’ Kappa score of SIT / PatInv / Purity is 0.94 / 0.89 / 0.92, respectively.

TransRepairfailstogeneratemutantsformanysentences(aswe
have observed from Figure 3), thus it is not able to repair any of
the bugs falling into these cases.
7 THREATS TO VALIDITY
Threats to external validity mainly lie in the evaluation dataset
and the models we used. First, though our approach applies todifferent datasets and translation models, so far, we follow Tran-sRepair [
32] and have only implemented and evaluated it on the
same2,001sentencesandtwotranslationmodels.Sofuturework
is needed to understand the performance of CAT on other datasets
andmodels.Second,thoughweonlyuseBERTmodel[ 5]toextractTable10:Influenceoftheupperboundofmutantnumberin
bug repair.

the context-aware word embeddings, our approach is still compati-
blewithothercontext-awareembeddingmodels(e.g.,Roberta[ 22]).
This is a future work to be explored.
Threatstointernalvalidity mainlylieinourmanualassessment.
We follow TransRepair [ 32] and use the same human evaluation
criteria.Tofurtherreducethebiaswhencomparingdifferentmeth-
ods, we randomised the sentences/test inputs to guarantee thatthe method each sentence belongs to remains unknown to theauthors. The high kappa scores indicate that the bias in human
evaluation is minor. We also release the details of human labelling
on Github (available at https://github.com/zysszy/CAT) to improve
the transparency and replicability.
8 CONCLUSION
We propose CAT, an isotopic replacement based approach to im-
proving machine translation. As a special type of replacement, iso-
topicreplacementsubtlycontrolstheimpactwhenreplacingwords.
Thisisachievedbyusinganeural-basedlanguagemodeltoencode
the sentence context and designing another neural-network-based
algorithmtoevaluatecontext-awaresemanticsimilaritybetween
twowords.SuchreplacementisthenusedinasimilarwayasTran-
sRepair to detect and repair translation bugs. The experimental
resultsonGoogleTranslateandTransformershowthatCATsuc-
cessfullydetects129%/129%morebugsandrepairs199%/238%more
bugs than TransRepair on Google Translate/Transformer.
For future work, we plan to investigate other oracle approxi-
mationtechniquestofurtherimproveCAT’sperformanceinbug
detection and repair.
