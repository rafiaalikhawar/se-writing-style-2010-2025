ABSTRACT
Understanding what affects software developer productivity can
help organizations choose wise investments in their technical and
social environment. But the research literature either focuses on
whatcorrelateswithdeveloperproductivityinecologicallyvalid
settingsorfocusesonwhatcausesdeveloperproductivityinhighly
constrainedsettings.Inthispaper,webridgethe gapbystudying
software developers at Google through two analyses. In the first
analysis,weusepaneldatawith39productivityfactors,findingthat
code quality, technical debt, infrastructure tools and support, team
communication, goals and priorities, and organizational change
andprocessareallcausallylinkedtoself-reporteddeveloperpro-
ductivity. In the second analysis, we use a lagged panel analysis to
strengthenourcausalclaims.Wefindthatincreasesinperceived
code quality tend to be followed by increased perceived developer
productivity,butnotviceversa,providingthestrongestevidence

A wide spectrum of prior research provides some answers to
this question, but with significant caveats. For example, at one end
of the research spectrum, Ko and Myers’ controlled experiment
showed that a novel debugging tool called Whyline helped Java de-
velopers fix bugs twice as fast as those using traditional debugging
techniques [ 30]. While this evidence is compelling,organizational

sions in an ecologically valid context about what affects individual
developer productivity.
2 MOTIVATION
The paper’s main technical contribution ś the ability to draw
stronger causal inferences about productivity drivers than in prior
workśisenabledbytheuseofthe paneldataanalysis technique[ 25].
In this section, we motivate the technique with a running example.
Much of the prior work on developer productivity (Section 3)
reliesoncross-sectionaldata .Toillustratethelimitationsofcrosssec-
tionaldata,letusintroduceanexample.Considerasurveythatasks
aboutrespondents’productivityandthequalityoftheircodebase.
Thesurveyisdistributedatalargecompany,andtwodevelopers
respond, Aruj and Rusla. Let’s assume their responses are repre-
sentative of thedeveloper population. Their survey responses are
showninTable 1.
From this survey, we see that productivity correlates with code
quality.Butwecannotconfidentlysaythathighcodequalitycauses
high developer productivity, due in part to the following confound-
ingexplanations [ 1]:
•Time-invariant effects. These are effects that have the
same influenceover time.For example,if Rusla went to col-
lege and Aruj did not, from cross-sectional data, we cannot
distinguish between the effect of college and the effect of
code qualityonproductivity.•Respondent-independenttimeeffects. Theseareeffects
that influence all respondents uniformly, such as seasonal
effects or company-wide initiatives. For example, prior to
the survey, perhaps all engineers were given their annual
bonus, artificiallyraising everyone’sproductivity.
•Non-differentiated response effects. These are effects
whererespondentswillgivethesameorsimilarresponsesto
everysurveyquestion,sometimesknownasstraightlining.
For example, perhaps Aruj tends to choose the middle op-
tiontoeveryquestionandRuslatendstoanswerthehighest
optionfor every question.
We use panel analysis to address these confounds, enabling
strongercausalinferencethanwhatcanbeobtainedfromcrosssec-
tionaldata[ 25].Thepowerofpaneldataisthatitusesdatacollected
at multiple points in time from the same individuals, examining
howmeasurements changeover time.
Toillustratehowpaneldataenablesstrongercausalinference,
letusreturntotherunningexample.Supposewerunthesurvey
again, three months later,andobtain the data showninTable 2.
OneinterestingobservationisthatifweanalyzeTable 2inisola-
tion, we notice that there’snot acorrelationbetween productivity
and codequalityś bothrespondentsreportthesamecodequality,
regardlessoftheirproductivity.Butmoreimportantly,lookingat
thechangesin responsesfrom Table 1andTable 2,we see produc-
tivitychangesarenowcorrelated:Aruj’sincreasingproductivity
correlates with increasing code quality, and Rusla’s decreasing pro-
ductivitycorrelates withdecreasing code quality.
Panel analysis rules out the three confounding explanations
present inthe cross-sectionalanalysis:
•In the cross-sectional analysis, we could not determine if
Rusla’s high productivity was driven by her college edu-
cation. But in this panel analysis, we can rule out that ex-
planation,becausecollegeisatimeinvariantexposureśit
theoreticallywouldhavethesameeffectonherproductivity
in the first survey as in the second survey. This ability to
rule out other potential causes that are time invariant exists
whether or not the researcher can observe those potential
causes.Whilewithcross-sectionalanalysis,researchersmay
be able to control for these potential causes using control
variables, researchers have to anticipate and measure those
controlvariablesduringanalysis.Thisisunnecessarywith
panel analysis because time invariant factors are eliminated
bydesign.
•In the cross-sectional analysis, we could not determine if
productivitywasdrivenbyarecentannualbonus.Thisex-
planation is ruled out in the panel analysis. If the annual
bonushadaneffect,thechangeinproductivityscoresacross
both participants wouldbe uniform.
•In the cross-sectional analysis, we could not determine if
respondents were just choosing similar answers to every
question. This explanation is also ruled out with panel anal-
ysis. If respondents were choosing similar answers, there
would be no change in productivity scores, and thus we
wouldnot see acorrelation among the changes.

The ability of panel analyses to draw relatively strong causal
inferences makes it a quasi-experimental method, combining some
ofthe advantagesofexperiments withthoseoffield studies[ 24].
3 RELATED WORK
Toanswerresearchquestionssimilartoours,severalresearchers
previously investigated what factors correlate with developer pro-
ductivity.Petersen’ssystematicmappingliteraturereviewdescribes
seven studies that quantify factors that predict software developer
productivity [ 39], factors largely drawn from the COCOMO II soft-
ware cost driver model [ 10]. For instance, in a study of 99 projects
from 37 companies, Maxwell and colleagues found that certain
toolsandprogrammingpracticescorrelatedwithprojectproduc-
tivity, as measured by the number of lines of written code per
month [33]. More broadly, a recent study explored what factors
correlate withindividualdevelopers’ self-reportedproductivityat
threecompanies[ 36].Incontrasttoourstudy,thesepriorstudies
report correlations withrelativelyweakcausalclaims.
Otherresearchershavebeenabletomakestrongercausalclaims
aboutprogrammerproductivitybyrunningcontrolledexperiments.
For instance, when Tosun and colleagues asked 24 professionals to
completeasimpleprogrammingtask,eitherusingtest-drivendevel-
opment(treatmentgroup)oriterativetest-lastdevelopment(control
group),theyfoundthattreatmentgroupparticipantsweresignif-
icantly more productive than control group participants, where
productivity was measured as the number of tests passed in a fixed
amount oftime [ 49]. Suchrandomized controlled experiments are
consideredałgoldstandardžbecausetheycanmakeverystrong
causalclaims[ 8]. The challengewithsuch studies isthat theyare
expensive to run with high ecological validity. Consequently, such
studies typically use students as participants rather than profes-
sionals(e.g.[ 13,44,46]),usesmallproblemsandprogramsrather
than more realistic ones (e.g. [ 5,35,46]), and can only vary one or
two productivity factors per experiment (e.g. [ 14,31,42]). While
the studypresentedhere cannotmakeasstrongcausalclaimsas
experiments, the present field study has higher ecological validity
thanexperimental studies.
Toaddressthesechallenges,softwareengineeringresearchers
have been using causal inference techniques in field studies, where
stronger causal claims can be made than in studies with simple
correlations. The core of such studies is analyses that leverage
time series data, rather than cross-sectional data. For instance,
Wang and colleagues use Granger’s causality test [ 20] to infer that
women’spullrequestscauseincreasesinthosewomen’sfollower
counts [51]. As another example, using the Bayesian CausalImpact
framework[ 6],Martinandcolleaguesshowthat33%ofappreleases
caused statistically significant changes to app user ratings [ 32].
Thesepapersusedfine-grainedtimeseriesdata,whichisnotpossi-
bleforthetypeofdatadescribedinthispaper,andtoourknowledge,
has not been appliedto studiesofdeveloper productivity.
Panel analysis, another causal inference technique, has been
usedbypriorsoftwareengineeringresearchers.Qiuandcolleagues
used GitHub panel data to show that łsocial capital impacts the
prolongedengagementofcontributorstoopensourcež[ 40].Islam
and colleagues used panel data to show that distributed version

inour case,the inferences are aboutdeveloper productivity.
4 PANEL ANALYSIS: METHODS
Towards answering our research question, we next describe our
data sources, dependent variables, independent variables, panel
data,andmodelingdesign.
4.1 Data Sources
The data of this study comes from two sources: Google engineers’
logs data and a company-wide survey at Google. Neither source
wasbuiltspecificallyfortheresearch wedescribehere,andsowe
considerthis opportunisticresearch.
4.1.1 Logs Data. We collected a rich data set from engineers’ logs
from internal tools, such as a distributed file system that records
developers’ edits, a build system, and a code review tool. This data
contains fine-grained histories of developers’ work, enabling us to
make accuratemeasurements ofactual workingbehavior,such as
the time developers spend actively writing code. The data helps
uscharacterizedevelopers’workpractices,suchaswhatkindsof
developmenttasks theyaredoing,how longthosetaskstake, and
how long they are waiting for builds and tests to complete. Details
onthesetools,howdataisaggregatedintometrics,measurement
validation,andethicalconsiderationsofdatacollectioncanbefound
elsewhere[ 27].WedescribetheexactmetricsweuseinSection 4.3.
4.1.2 EngSat. TheEngineeringSatisfaction(EngSat)Surveyisa
longitudinal program to: understand the needs of Google engi-
neers; evaluate the effectiveness of tools, process, and organization
improvements; and provide feedback to teams that serve Google
engineers. Every three months, the survey is sent out to one-third
of eligible engineers ś in one of five core engineering job roles,
havebeenatGoogle’sparentcompanyforatleast6months,and
below the łdirectorž level. The same engineers are re-surveyed
every three quarters, and a random sample of one-third of new
engineers is added each quarter so that all engineers are invited.
The survey questions cover a range of topics, from productivity to
tool satisfaction to team communication. Respondents are asked
todescribetheirexperienceinthe3monthperiodpriortotaking
the survey. Before beginning the survey, respondents are informed
howthe data isusedandthat participationisvoluntary.
While EngSat response rates are typically between 30% and
40%, response bias does not appear to be a significant threat. We
know this because we analyzed two questions for response bias,
one on productivity and one on overall engineering experience
satisfaction. We found that EngSat tends to have lower response
rates for technical leads and managers, those who have been at
Googleforalongerperiod,andforengineersfromtheSanFrancisco
BayArea,whereGoogleisheadquartered.Toestimatetheimpact
ofnon-responsebiasonametricderivedfromEngSatresponses,
wecompareabias-correctedversionofthemetrictoitsuncorrected

calculated by reweighting EngSat responses with the propensity
score (a similarity measure [ 21]) of responding to EngSat, which is

andcodinglanguageandtools.Wefindthataftercorrectingforthis
non-response bias using propensity score matching, the percent of
engineers who responded favorably did not change significantly
foreitherquestion.Forinstance,adjustingfornon-responsebias,
productivity decreases relatively by 0.7%, which is too small to
reach statistical significance at the 95% level. These results were
consistent acrossthe three rounds ofEngSatthat we analyzed.
4.2 DependentVariable: Productivity
Weuseself-ratedproductivityfromoursurveyasourdependent
variable. Whilesubjective and objective measuresofproductivity
each have advantages and disadvantages, we chose a subjective
measure of productivity here both because it is straightforward
tomeasureinsurveyformandbecauseitisusedbroadlyinprior
research[ 15,34,36].
TheEngSatsurveyasksthequestion: Overall,inthepastthree
months how productive have you felt at work at Google/Alphabet?
Respondentscanchoose"Notatallproductive","Slightlyproduc-
tive", "Moderately productive", "Very productive", or "Extremely
productive".Wecodedthisvariablefrom1(Notatallproductive)
to 5(Extremelyproductive).
Prior software engineering research has shown that subjec-
tive productivity correlates with objective measures of produc-
tivity [36,37] as a wayto establish convergentvalidityof question-
basedproductivitymetrics(thatis,howtheyrelatetoothermea-
sures of the same construct [ 7]), We sought to do the same by
correlating our subjective productivity measure below with sev-
eral objective measuresof productivity. Ratherthan using a linear
correlationasusedinpriorwork,wewereopentothepossibility
that relationships were non-linear, and thus we selected a random
forestas aclassifier.
First, we created a simple random forest to predict a binary ver-
sion of self-rated productivity, where we coded łExtremely produc-
tivež and łVeryproductivež as productive, and the othervalues as
notproductive.Wethenpredictedthisbinarymeasureofself-rated
productivity using six quantitative productivitymetrics measured
overathreemonthperiod.Twoofthemeasurescapturetheamount

•TotalNumber ofChangelists. Thisrepresents thenumberof

•Median Active Coding Time. Across every CL merged, the
median time an engineer spent actively writing code per

•MedianWall-ClockCodingTime. Themedianwall-clocktime
an engineer spent writing code per CL, that is, the time
elapsed between when the engineer starts writing code and
when they request the code be reviewed.
The remainingtwomeasures capturednon-productive activities,
that is, how much time an engineer spends waiting per unit of
output(achangelist):
•MedianWall-ClockReviewTime. Themedianwall-clocktime

•Median Wall-Clock Merge Time. The median wall-clock time

allymergingper CL.
We gathered the above data over 6 consecutive quarters from
2018Q1to2019Q2.Foreachquarter,welinkedanengineer’ssubjec-
tivemeasureofproductivitytotheabovefivequantitativemeasures.
Sinceengineersareinvitedtotakeoursurveyonceevery3quarters,
a single engineer may be represented at most twice in this data set.
In total, we had1958 engineer data pointsfor our model.
Afterrandomlyselecting10%ofthedataforvalidation,themodel
had 83% precision and 99% recall, suggesting a substantial relation-
shipbetweenquantitativeandqualitativeproductivitymeasures.
Lookingattheimportanceofeachquantitativemetricinclassify-
ing developersinthe model (Figure 1),we see that MedianActive
Coding Time was the most predictive quantitative feature. This
alignswithMeyerand colleagues’findingthatMicrosoftengineers
viewcoding as theirmostproductive activity[ 34].
4.3 IndependentVariables
To predict the dependent variable, we started with 42 independent
variablesśreducedto39afteramulticolinearitycheck(Section 4.6)
śavailablefromthesurveyandlogsdata.Sincesurveyrespondents
are asked to report on their experiences from the three months
prior to the survey, we collected log data for the corresponding
three month period. While many metrics could be analyzed, we
selected metrics that were relatively straightforward to collect and
thatappearedplausiblyrelatedtoindividualproductivity,basedon
consultationwithinternalsubjectmatterexpertswithinGooglethat
were experiencedwithbuilding anddeployingdeveloper metrics.
Below,wegroupindependentvariablesintosixcategories,de-
scribe each variable, and link them to prior work. We give each
variableashortname(inparentheses)tomakereferencingthem
easier in the remainder of the paper. Full survey questions and
response scalesare available inthe Appendix.
4.3.1 Code Quality & Technical Debt. The first category of poten-
tial drivers of productivity are those relating to code quality and
technicaldebt.Basedonexperience,DeMarcoandListerclaimthat
software quality, generally speaking, łis a means to higher pro-
ductivityž[ 11].Inanexperiment,Schankinandcolleaguesfound
that participants found errors 14% faster when descriptive iden-
tifier names were used [ 45]. Studying small industrial programs
1305What ImprovesDeveloperProductivityatGoogle? Code Quality ESEC/FSE ’22, November14ś18, 2022,Singapore, Singapore
written in the 1980s, Gill and Kemerer found that code complex-
ity correlates withsoftware maintenance productivity[ 17]. Based
oninterviewsandsurveyswithprofessionalsoftwaredevelopers,
Besker and colleagues found that technical debt correlates nega-
tivelywithdeveloper productivity[ 3,4].
We measured code quality and technical debt with 5 subjective
factors from our survey:
•Code Quality Satisfaction (sat. withproject code quality,sat.
withdependency code quality)
•Code Technical Debt (projecttechdebt)
•DependencyTechnical Debt (dependency techdebt)
•Technical DebtHindrance (techdebthindrance)
4.3.2 InfrastructureTools& Support. The next categoryofpoten-
tialdriversofproductivityareissuesrelatingtotoolsandinfrastruc-
ture. Prior work showed that using łthe best tools and practicesž
was the strongest correlate of individual productivity at Google,
though not a significant correlate at two other companies [ 36].
Storey and colleagues also found that Microsoft developers’ pro-
cesses andtoolscorrelatedwithindividualproductivity[ 47].
This category had6objective and12 subjective measures:
•Tools, infrastructure and service satisfaction (sat. with infra &
tools)
•Toolsand infrastructurechoice (choicesofinfra &tools)
•Toolsandinfrastructureinnovativeness (innovationofinfra
&tools)
•Toolsand infrastructureease (easeofinfra &tools)
•Tools and infrastructure frustration (frustration of infra &
tools)
•Developer stackchange (changeoftoolstack)
•Internaldocumentation support (doc. support)
•Internaldocumentation hindrance (doc. hindrance)
•Build&test cycle hindrance (build&test cyclehindrance)
•Buildlatencysatisfaction (sat. withbuildlatency)
•50thand90thpercentileofbuildduration (p50buildtime,p90

•%oflong builds per week (%oflongbuilds)
•50th and 90th percentile of test duration (p50 test time, p90
test time)
•%oflong testsper week (%oflongtests)
•Learninghindrance (learninghindrance)
•Migration hindrance (migration hindrance)
4.3.3 TeamCommunication. Thenextcategoryofdriversofpro-
ductivity are issues relating to team communication. In a survey
of knowledge workers, Hernaus and Mikulićfound that socialjob
characteristics(e.g. groupcooperation) correlatedwith contextual
jobperformance[ 23].Morespecifically,insoftwareengineering,
ChatzoglouandMacaulayinterviewedsoftwaredevelopers,finding
that most believed that communication among team members was
very important to project success [ 9]. Studying communication
networksquantitatively,KidaneandGloorfoundthatintheEclipse
project,ahigherfrequencyofcommunicationbetweendeveloper
correlatedpositivelywithperformance andcreativity[ 28].Tomeasureteamcommunicationinourstudy,weexamined9
objective measures and1subjective measure:
•50th and 90th percentile of rounds of code review (p50 code
reviewrounds, p90 code reviewrounds)
•50th and 90th percentile of total wait time of code review (p50
code reviewwaittime,p90 code reviewwaittime)
•50th and 90th percentile of code reviewers’ organizational dis-
tances from author (p50 review org distance, p90 review org
distance)
•50thand90thpercentileofcodereviewers’physicaldistances
from author (p50 review physical distance, p90 review phys-
icaldistance)
•Physical distance from direct manager (distance from man-
ager)
•Code review hindrance (slowcode review)
4.3.4 Goalsand Priorities. Prior researchsuggeststhatchanging
goals and priorities correlate with software engineering outcomes.
Surveying365softwaredevelopers,TheStandishGroupfoundthat
changing requirements was a common stated reason for project
failure [48]. Meyer and colleagues found that one of the top 5 most
commonlymentionedreasonsforaproductiveworkdaywashaving
clear goalsandrequirements [ 34].
We measure this category with1subjective measure:
•Priorityshift (priorityshift)
4.3.5 Interruptions. Meyerandcolleaguesfoundthattwoofthe
top five most commonly mentioned reasons for a productive work-
dayby379softwaredeveloperswashavingnomeetingsandfew
interruptions [ 34]. Similarly, a prior survey of Google engineers
showed that lack of interruptions and efficient meetings correlated
withpersonal productivity,as diduse of personal judgment [ 36].
We measure this category with3objective measures:
•50th and 90th percentile of total time spent on incoming meet-
ings per week (p50meeting time,p90 meeting time)
•Total time spent on any meetings per week (total meeting
time)
4.3.6 OrganizationalandProcessFactors. Finally,outsideofsoft-
wareengineering,organizationalandprocessfactorscorrelatewith
avarietyofworkoutcomes.Forexample,accordingtohealthcare
industry managers, reorganizations can result in workers’ sense of
powerlessness,inadequacy,andburnout[ 19].Althoughnotwell-
studied in software engineering, based on personal experience,
DeMarco and Lister [ 11] and Armour [ 2] point to bureaucracy and
reorganizations as leading to poor software engineering outcomes.
This category had2subjective and3objective measures:
•Process hindrance (complicatedprocesses)
•Organizationalhindrance (team& orgchange)
•Number of times when engineers’ direct manager changes but
colleaguesdonot change (reorgdirectmanagerchange)
•Number of times when both an engineer’s direct manager and
colleagues change simultaneously (non-reorg direct manager
change)
•Number of different primary teams the engineer has (primary
team change)

4.4 From Variablesto PanelData
Sincethesurveywassentouttothesamecohortofengineersevery
three quarters, we have accumulated a panel data set with two
observations in different points of time for each engineer. After
joiningeachengineer’ssurveydatawiththeirlogsdata,wehave
complete panel data for 2139 engineers.
4.5 Modeling
Using the panel data set, we applied a quasi-experiment method of
panel data analysis to analyze the relationship between engineers’
perceived overall productivity and the independent variables. In
this paper, we use a fixed-effect model to analyze panel data at the
developer level. The modelis
𝑦𝑖𝑡=𝛼𝑖+𝜆𝑡+𝛽𝐷𝑖𝑡+𝜖𝑖𝑡(1)
where
•𝑦𝑖𝑡is the dependent variable y, self-rated productivity for
developer iat time t.
•𝛼𝑖is unobserved engineer time-invariant effects, such as
education andskills.
•𝜆𝑡istheengineer-independenttimeeffect,suchascompany-
wide policychanges andseasonalities at time t.
•𝐷𝑖𝑡=[𝐷1
𝑖𝑡,𝐷2
𝑖𝑡,...,𝐷𝑛
𝑖𝑡]are observed productivity factors
for developer iat time t.
•𝛽=[𝛽1,𝛽2,...,𝛽𝑛]are the causal effects of productivity
factors𝐷𝑖𝑡at time t.
•𝜖𝑖𝑡isthe errorterm at time t.
To estimate the fixed-effect model, we differenced equation (1)
between the twoperiodsandhave
Δ𝑦𝑖𝑡=Δ𝜆𝑡+𝛽Δ𝐷𝑖𝑡+Δ𝜖𝑖𝑡(2)
whereΔ𝜆𝑡=𝛾0+𝛾1𝑇.TheΔprefixdenotesthechangefromone
time period to the next. T is a categorical variable representing
panels in different time periods, if we have more than one panel.
Notethat after differencing, 𝛼𝑖iscancelled out and Δ𝜆𝑡canbe ex-
plicitlycontrolledbytransformingittoaseriesofdummyvariables.
Therefore,factors in 𝛼𝑖and𝜆𝑡donot confound the results.
Wethenestimatedequation(2)usingFeasibleGeneralizedLeast
Squares (FGLS); we chose FGLS to overcome heteroskedasticity,
serialcorrelationbetweenresiduals,andforefficiencycomparedto
OrdinaryLeastSquareestimators.Theparametersofinterestare
the𝛽terms. The hypothesis we are testing is that 𝛽=0for all𝐷𝑖𝑡.
Exceptfor binary variablesand percentagevariables,we transform
𝐷𝑖𝑡into𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐷𝑖𝑡). The benefit of taking a natural log is to allow
ustointerpretestimatesofregressioncoefficients( 𝛽terms)asan
elasticity,whereapercentchangeinadependentvariablecanbe
interpreted as a percent change in an independent variable. This
allows for both a uniform and intuitive interpretation of the effects
acrossboth logs-basedandsurvey-baseddependent variables.
Toliberallycapturecausalrelationshipsbetweenproductivity,
we use a p-value cutoff of 0.1 to define łstatistically significantž
results. If the reader prefers a more stringent cutoff or using a false
discovery correction, we facilitate this byreportingp-values.
Analysis code was written in R by the first author using the
packages glmnet, randomForest, binom, car, and plm. All code was
peer-reviewedusing Google’sstandardcode reviewprocess[ 43].4.6 Multicollinearity

Like all empirical studies, ours is imperfect. In this section, we
describe threats to the validity of our study, broken down into
content, construct,internal, andexternal validity threats.
4.7.1 Content. Although our study examines a variety of facets of
productivity,itdoesnotexamineeverysingleaspectofproductivity
oroffactors that mayinfluence productivity.
Withrespecttoproductivityitself,wemeasureitwithasingle
surveyquestion.Ononehand,thequestionitselfiswordedbroadly
and our validation (Section 4.2) shows that it correlates with other
objectivemeasuresofproductivity.Ontheotherhand,asevidenced
bythefactthatthecorrelationwasimperfect,itislikelythatour
question did not capture some aspects of developer productivity.
As one example, our question was only focused on productivity of
an individual developer, yet productivity is often conceptualized
from ateam, group,orcompany perspective [ 16].
Likewise,our setof productivity factorsś like code qualityand
buildspeedśareincomplete,largelybecauseweusedconveniently
available and subjectively-selected metrics and because we reused
an existing long-running survey. In comparison, prior work, which
usedacustom-builtcross-sectionalsurvey,foundthattwoofthe
strongest correlates with individual productivity were job enthusi-
asmandteammates’supportfornewideas[ 36].Neitherofthesetwo
productivityfactorswereexploredinthepresentsurvey,demon-
strating that our productivityfactors are incomplete.
4.7.2 Construct. Our EngSat survey measures a variety of theoret-
icalconcepts,andthequestionscontainedinitcontainarangeof
construct validity. For instance, while we have demonstrated some
amountofconvergentvalidityofourproductivityquestion,respon-
dentstothequestionmayhaveinterpretedthewordłproductivityž
differentlyśsomemayhaveinterpretedittoreferonlytothequick
completionofworkitems,whileothersmighttakeamoreexpan-
siveviewtoincludeaspectssuchasquality.Whilewehavetriedto
limit the impact of different interpretations of EngSat questions by
pilotingvariations,gatheringinterpretivefeedback,andrefining
wording iteratively,such issuesare unavoidablethreats.
Another specific threat to construct validity is inconsistent and
ambiguous question wording. For instance, while respondents are
advisedatthebeginningofthesurveythattheyshouldreporton
experiences over the last 3 months, some questions (but not all) re-
inforcethisscopingbybeginningwithłInthelastthreemonths...ž.
Asanotherexampleofinconsistency,whilemostquestionsaskonly
about experiences (whichour models use topredict productivity),
three questions ask about the relationship between experience and
perceived productivity, such as łhow much has technical debt...

questionsaskaboutengineers’experienceswiththeprojectthey
work on, but respondents interpret for themselves what a "project"
isand,if they work onmultiple projects,whichone to report on.
4.7.3 Internal. Asweargueinthispaper,ouruseofpanelanalysis
helpsdrawstrongercausalinferencesthanthosethatcanbedrawnfrom cross-sectional data. However, the most significant caveat
to our ability to draw causal inferences is time variant effects. In
contrasttotimeinvarianteffects(e.g.,prioreducationanddemo-
graphics), time variant effects may vary over the study period. For
instance,inourrunningexample,ifArujlostamentorandRusla
gainedamentorbetweenthetwosurveys,ouranalysiscouldnot
rule out mentorship as a cause of increased productivity or code
quality. Thus, our analysis assumes that effects on individual en-
gineersaretimeinvariant.Violationsofthisassumptionthreaten
the internal validity ofour study.
Another internal threat to the validity of our study is partici-
pants who chose not to answer some or all questions in the survey.
Whileouranalysisofnon-responsebias(Section 4.1.2)showedthat
two survey questions were robust to non-response among several
dimensions like level and tenure, non-response is still a threat. For
one, respondents and non-respondents might differ systematically
onsomeunmeasuredordimension,suchashowfrequentlythey
get feedback from peers. Likewise, respondents who choose not
to answer a question will be wholly excluded from our analysis,
yetsuchparticipantsmightdiffersystematicallyfromthosewho
answeredevery question.
Anotherthreattointernalvalidityisthatweanalyzeddatafor
only two panels per engineer. More panels per engineer would
increasethe robustnessof our results.
4.7.4 External. Asthetitleofthispapersuggests,ourstudywas
conductedonlyatGoogleandgeneralizabilityofourresultsbeyond
that context is limited. Google is a large, US-headquartered, multi-
national, and software-centric company where engineers work on
largely server and mobile code, with uniform development tooling,
andinamonolithicrepository.Likewise,duringthestudyperiod
Google developers mostly worked from open offices, before the
global COVID19 pandemic when many developers shifted to re-
moteorhybridwork.Whileresultswouldvaryifthisstudywere

Paneldataanalysissuggestedthat16outofthe39metricshavea
statisticallysignificantcausalrelationshipwithperceivedoverall
productivity, as listed in Table 3. The overall adjusted R-squared
value for the model was 0.1019. In Table 1, the Effect size should
be read as a percent change in the dependent variable is associated
with that percent change in the independent variable. For instance,
for code quality, a 100% change in project code quality (from łVery
dissatisfiedžtołVerysatisfiedžtoquality)isassociatedwitha10.5%
increaseinself-reportedproductivity.Tosummarize Table 3:
•For code quality, we found that perceived productivity is
causally related to satisfaction with project code quality
but not causally related to satisfaction with code quality
in dependencies. For technical debt, we found perceived

However, because the observed changes in factors coincided

but itdoes not tellusthe direction of the causality.
So,doesbettercodequalitycauseincreasingproductivity,ordoes

aretheoreticallyplausible:ononehand,codequalitymightincrease

might increase quality code because engineers have free time to
spend onqualityimprovement.
Toverifythedirectionofthecausalrelationshipbetweenproject
code quality and productivity, we conducted another panel data
analysis using lagged panel data. In this analysis, we focus only
onthecausalrelationshipbetweencodequalityandproductivity.

Inshort,weverifiedthedirectionofthelinkagebetweenproject
code quality and productivity by checking if the change in one fac-
torisassociatedwiththechangeintheotherfactorinthefollowing

ity, we expect to see that changes in project code quality during
time T-1 are associated with changes in productivity during time T.

7 LAGGED PANEL ANALYSIS: RESULTS
Our results support hypothesis QaP but not hypothesis PaQ. We
found thata 100%increase ofsatisfactionrating with project code

isfied’)attimeT-1wasassociatedwitha10%decreaseofmedian
active coding time per CL, a 12% decrease of median wall-clock
time from creating to mailing a CL, and a 22% decrease of median
wall-clock time from submitting to deploying a CL at time T. On
theotherhand,wedidnotfindanyevidencetosupporthypothesis
PaQ; changes in satisfaction with project code quality in time T
were not associated with any of the productivity metrics in time
T-1. See Appendix for a table containing this data and descriptions
of each variable. Therefore, returning to our research question,we conclude thatchanges in satisfaction with project code quality
cause changes inperceivedoverallproductivity.
8 DISCUSSION
Our findings provide practical guidance for organizations trying
to improve individual developer productivity by providing a list of
amenablefactorsthatarecausallylinkedtoproductivity.Specifi-
cally, our panel analysis shows that these factors are: code quality,
technical debt, infrastructure tools and support, team communica-
tion,goalsandpriorities,andorganizationalchangeandprocess.
Our quadrant chart shown in Figure 2, which we originally cre-
atedforanexecutivestakeholderaudiencewithinGoogle,allows
practitioners to choose highly impactful productivity factors to act
on. Factors at the top of the chart are those with high statistical
significance (and low standard error), so practitioners can read
those as the most consistent productivity factors. Factors on the
right are the ones with the largest standardized effect size, so these
supply the łbiggest bang for the buckž. Taken together, the factors
intheupperrightquadrantaretheonesmostpromisingtoimprove
productivity at Google. For instance, giving teams time to improve
codequality,reducetechnicaldebt,andstabilizeprioritieswould
be good candidate initiatives for improving individual developer
productivity.

We found that several factors did not have a statistically signifi-
cantrelationship withperceivedproductivity,notably:
•For documentation, perceived productivity was not causally
linked to reported poor or missing documentation ( doc. hin-
drance)orthefrequencyofdocumentationmeetingneeds
(doc. support ). This is surprising, given that GitHub’s 2017
surveyof5,500developersfoundthatłincompleteorconfus-
ingdocumentationžwasthemostcommonlyencountered
probleminopensource[ 18].GitHub’sfindingsareconsis-
tentwithfindingsatMicrosoft[ 47]andatGoogleśEngSat
respondentsoftenreportłpoorormissingdocumentationž
as one of the top three hindrances to their own productiv-
ity. However, the results in this paper suggest that there
is no causal relationship between developer productivity
and documentation, despite developers’ reports that it is
importanttothem.Onewaytoexplainthisfindingisthat
documentation may not impact productivity, but it may yet
have other positive benefits, such as to łcreate inclusive
communitiesž[ 18].
•For meetings, we found that perceived productivity was
notcausallylinkedtotimespentoneitherincomingmeet-
ings(p50meetingtime ,p90meetingtime )oralltypesofmeet-
ings(totalmeetingtime ).Thisisalsosurprising,giventhat
prior research found in a survey of Microsoft engineers
that meetings were the most unproductive activity for engi-
neers[34]. Thecontradictoryresultscould be explainedby
differencesbetweenthestudies:ourpanelanalysisenables
causalreasoning(vscorrelational),moreengineerswererep-
resented in our dataset (2139 vs 379), and we used objective
meeting data from engineers’ calendars (vs. self-reports).
•For physical and organizational distances, perceived produc-
tivitywasnotcausallylinkedtophysicaldistancefromdirect
manager ( distance from manager ), or physical ( p50 review
physicaldistance,p90reviewphysicaldistance )ororganiza-
tional distances from code reviewers( p50 review org distance,
p90revieworgdistance ).ThisisincontrasttoRamasubbuand
colleagues’cross-sectionalstudy,whichfoundthatłasfirms

toryfactorsmayincludedifferencesinorganizationanda
methodology: individualproductivity versusorganizational
productivity, single company versus multiple companies,
andpanel versuscross-sectionalanalysis.
Aswementioned,athreattotheseresultsisthethreatofreverse

productivity changes or vice versa. We mitigated this threat for
code quality using lagged panel analysis, providing compelling
evidence that high code quality increases individual developers’
productivity.

Although difficult to ascribe specifically to this research and the

nallyinthesecondquarterof2019andthefirstquarterof2021:The

9 CONCLUSION
Prior researchhas madesignificant progressinimprovingourun-
derstanding of what correlates with developer productivity. In this
paper, we’ve advanced that research by leveraging time series data
to run panel analyses, enabling stronger causal inference than was
possible in prior studies. Our panel analysis suggests that code
quality, technical debt, infrastructure tools and support, team com-
munication, goals and priorities, and organizational change and
process are causally linked to developer productivity at Google.
Furthermore,ourlagged panelanalysisprovides evidencethatim-
provements in code quality cause improvements in individual pro-
ductivity. While our analysis is imperfect ś in particular, it is only
one company and uses limited measurements ś it nonetheless can
help engineering organizations make informed decisions about
improvingindividualdeveloper productivity.
