ABSTRACT
Graphical User Interface (GUI) is not merely a collection of individ-
ual and unrelated widgets, but rather partitions discrete widgets
into groups by variousvisual cues, thus forming higher-order per-
ceptualunitssuchastab,menu,cardorlist.Theabilitytoautomat-
ically segment a GUI into perceptual groups of widgets constitutes

heuristics or supervised machine learning that is dependent on
specificGUIimplementationsandruntimeinformation.Research

GUI parts, such as, clicking a navigation tab, expanding a card,
scroll the list. This would enable more efficient automatic GUI
testing [22,35]. As another example, screen readers [ 3,8] help
visually impaired users access applications by reading out content
onGUI.Recognizingperceptualgroupswouldallowscreenreaders
to navigate the GUI at higher-order perceptual units (e.g., sections)

Although humans can intuitively see perceptual groups of GUI
widgets, current computational approaches are limited in parti-
tioning a GUI into meaningful groups of widgets. Some recent
work [12,16] relies on supervised deep learning methods(e.g., im-
age captioning [ 34,51]) to generate a view hierarchy for a GUI

asetofprinciplesofgrouping,amongwhich connectedness ,simi-
larity,proximity andcontinuity are the mostessentialones [ 7,45].
Although these principles and other related UI design principles
such as CRAP [ 42] greatly influence how designers and developers
structure GUI widgets [ 48], they have never been systematically
used to automatically infer perceptual groups from GUI images.
Rather,currentapproaches[ 38,58]relyonad-hocandcase-specific
rulesandthus are hardto generalize ondiverseGUI designs.
In this work, we systematically explore the Gestalt principles of
grouping and design the first psychologically-inspired method for
visual inference of perceptual groups of GUI widgets. Our method
requiresonlyGUIpixelimagesandisindependentofGUIimple-
mentations.Ourmethodisunsupervised,thusremovingthedepen-
dence on problematic GUI runtime data. As shwon in Figure 3, our
methodenhancesthestate-of-the-artGUIwidgetdetectionmethod
(UIED [21,53]) to detect elementary GUI widgets. Following the
Gestaltprinciples,themethodfirstdetectscontainers(e.g.,card,list

principleandfurthergroupsclustersofwidgetsbytheproximity
principles. Finally, based on the widget clusters, our method cor-
rectserroneouslydetectedormissingGUIwidgetsbythecontinuity
principle(notillustratedinFigure 3,but can be seen inFigure 5).
At the right end of Figure 3, we show the grouping result by the
state-of-the-art heuristic-based method Screen Recognition [ 58].
ScreenRecognitionincorrectlypartitionsmanywidgetsintogroups,
such as the bottom navigation bar andthe four widgetsabove the
bar, thecardon theleftand thetextabove thecard. Italsofails to
detecthigher-order perceptualgroups,suchasgroupsofcards.In
contrast, our approach correctly recognizes the bottom navigation
bar and the top and middle row of cards. Although the text label
above the left card is very close to the card, our approach correctly
recognizes the text labels as separate widgets rather than as a part
of the left card. Our approach does not recognize the two cards

Clearly, the grouping results by our approach correspond more

2 GUI WIDGETDETECTION
Ourapproachisapixel-onlyapproach.ItdoesnotassumeanyGUI
metadataorGUIimplementationaboutGUIwidgets.Instead,our
approach detects text and non-text GUI widgets directly from GUI
images. To obtain the widget information from pixels, it enhances
thestate-of-the-artGUIwidgetdetectiontechniqueUIED[ 53].In
order to fit with subsequent perceptual grouping, our approach
mitigatestheincorrectmergingofGUIwidgetsinthecontainers
byUIED andsimplifies the widgetclassification ofUIED.
2.1 UIED-BasedGUI WidgetDetection
UIED comprises three steps: (1) GUI text detection, (2) non-text
GUI widget detection and (3) merging of text and non-text wid-
gets.UIEDusesanoff-the-shelfscenetextdetectorEAST[ 60]to
identify text regionsin theGUI images.EAST isdesigned for han-
dling nature scene images that differ from GUI images, such as
figure-backgroundcomplexityandlightingeffects.AlthoughEAST
outperforms traditional OCR tool Tesseract [ 47], we find the latest
OCRtooldevelopedbyGoogle[ 6]achievesthehighestaccuracy
ofGUItextrecognition(seeSection 4.1).Therefore,inouruseof
UIED,we replace EASTwiththe Google OCRtool.
Forlocatingnon-textwidgets,ourapproachadoptsthedesign
ofUIEDthatusesaseriesoftraditional,unsupervisedimagepro-
cessingalgorithmsratherthandeep-learningmodels(e.g.,Faster
RCNN[31]orYOLO[ 40]).Thisdesignremovesthedatadependence
onGUIimplementationorruntimeinformationwhileaccurately
detecting GUI widgets. UIED then merges the text and non-text
detectionresults.Thepurposeofthismergingstepisnotonlyto
integrate the identified GUI widgets but also to cross-check the
results.Becausenon-textwidgetdetectioninevitablyextractssome
text regions, UIED counts on the OCR results to remove these
false-positive non-text widgets. Specifically, this step checks the
boundingboxofallcandidatenon-textwidgetregionsandremoves
thoseintersectedwithtextregionsresultingfrom the OCR.
2.2 ImprovementandSimplification ofUIED
WefindthattheUIEDdetectionresultsoftenmisssomewidgetsina
container(e.g.card).Thereasonisthat,inordertofilteroutinvalidnon-text regions and mitigate over-segmentation that wrongly
segmentsaGUIwidgetintoseveralparts,UIEDchecksthewidgets’
boundingboxesandmergesall intersectedwidgets regionsintoa
big widget region. This operation may cause the wrong neglection
ofvalidGUIwidgetsthatareenclosedinsomecontainers.Therefore,
we equip our GUI widget detector with a container recognition
algorithm (see Section 3.2) to mitigate the issue. If a widget is
recognizedasacontainer,thenallitscontainedwidgetsarekept
andregardedas proper GUI widgetsratherthannoises.
The original UIED classifies non-text GUI widgets as specific
widgetcategories(e.g.,image,button,checkbox).Incontrast,our
GUI widget detector only distinguishes text from non-text widgets.
Although GUI involves many types of non-text widgets, there is
no need of distinguishing actual classes of non-text widgets for
perceptualgrouping. GUIwidgetclassesindicatedifferentuserin-
teractionsandGUIfunctionalities,butwidgetswithdifferentclasses
can form a perceptual group as long as they have similar visual
properties,suchassize,shape,relativepositionandalignmentwith
other widgets. Therefore, we do not distinguish different classes of
non-textwidgets.However,weneedtodistinguishnon-textwid-
getsfromtextwidgets,astheyhaveverydifferentvisualproperties
andneedto be clusteredbydifferentstrategies (see Section 3).

3.1 Gestalt Laws andApproach Overview
Ourapproachisinspiredbypsychologyandbiological-visionre-
search. Perceptual grouping is a cognitive process in which our
minds leap from comprehending all of the objects as individuals
to recognizing visual patterns through grouping visually related
elementsasawhole[ 26].Thisprocessaffectsthewaywedesign

port [4,44] to UI design templates [ 24] and GUI frameworks [ 2]

themas inagroup (e.g.acard,list,multitabormenu).
Previousstudiesrelyonad-hoc,rigidheuristicstoinferUIstruc-
turewithout asystematic theoreticalfoundation. Ourapproachis
the first attempt to tackle the perceptual grouping of GUI widgets
guided by an influential psychological theory (named Gestalt psy-
chology[ 7])that explainshow thehumanbrainperceives objects
and patterns. Gestalt psychology’s core proposition is that human
understands external stimuli aswholes rather than as the sums of
theirparts[ 46].Basedontheproposition,theGestaltistsstudied
perceptualgrouping[ 26]systematicallyandsummarizedasetof
łgestaltlawsofgroupingž[ 45].Inourwork,weadoptthefourmost
effectiveprincipleswhichgreatlyinfluenceGUIdesign[ 48]inprac-
tice as the guideline for our approach design: (1) connectedness
(2) similarity(3) proximityand(4) continuity.
We define a group of related GUI widgets as a layout block of
items.Atypicalexampleisa listoflistitems intheGUI,ora card
displaying an image and some texts. The fundamental intuition
is:if a setofwidgetshave similar visual propertiesandare placed
inalignmentwithsimilarspacebetweeneachother,theywillbe
łperceivedž as in the same layout block by our approach according
to the Gestalt principles. In detail, our approach consists of four
groupingsteps inaccordancewithfour Gestalt principles.First, it
identifiescontainersalongwiththeircontainedwidgetsthatfulfil
the connectedness law. Second, it uses an unsupervised clustering
methodDBSCAN[ 25]toclustertextornon-textGUIwidgetsbased
on their spatial and size similarities. Next, it groups proximate and
spatially aligned clusters to form a larger layout block following
the proximity law. Finally, in line with the continuity principle,
ourapproachcorrectssomemistakesofGUIwidgetdetectionby
checking the consistency ofthe groups’ compositions.
3.2 Connectedness - Container Recognition
In Gestalt psychology, the principle of uniform connectedness is
thestrongestprincipleconcernedwithrelatedness[ 41].Itimplies
that we perceive elements connected by uniform visual properties
as beingmorerelatedthanthosenotconnected. Theforms ofthe
connection can be either a line connecting several elements or a
shapeboundarythatenclosesagroupofrelatedelements.Inthe
GUI, the presentation of the connectedness is usually a box con-
tainerthatcontainsmultiplewidgetswithinit,andalltheenclosed
widgetsare perceivedasinthesamegroup. Thus, thefirststep of
our grouping approach isto recognizethe containersinaGUI.
In particular, we observe that a container is visually a (round)
rectangularwireframeenclosingseveralchildrenwidgets.Thecard
is a typical example of such containers, as shown in Figure 1(a).
Therefore,withthedetectednon-textwidgets,thealgorithmfirst
checks if a widget is of rectangle shape by counting how many
straightlinesitsboundarycomprisesandhowtheycompose.Specif-
ically, we apply the geometrical rule that a rectangle’s sides are
made of 4 straight lines perpendicular to each other. Subsequently,
ourapproachdeterminesifthewidget’sboundaryisawireframe
border by checking if it is connected with any widgets inside its
boundary.Ifawidgetsatisfiestheabovecriteria,itwillbeidentified
asacontainer,andallwidgetscontainedwithinitarepartitioned
intothe same perceptualgroup.

3.3 Similarity - WidgetClustering
The principle of similarity suggests that elements are perceptually
grouped together if they are similar to each other [ 9]. Generally,
similaritycanbeobservedinaspectsofvariousvisualcues,such
as size, color, shape or position. For example, in the second GUI of
Figure1,theimagewidgetsareofthesamesizeandalignedwith
each other in the same way (i.e., same direction and spacing), so
we visually perceive them as a group.Likewise,the text pieceson
therightoftheimagewidgetsareperceptuallysimilareventhough
theyhavedifferentfontstylesandlengthsbecausetheyhavethe
same alignmentwithneighbouringtexts.
3.3.1 Initial Widget Clustering. Our approach identifies similar
GUIwidgetsbytheirspatialandvisualpropertiesandaggregates
similarGUIwidgetsintoblocksbysimilarity-basedclustering.It
clusters texts and non-text widgets through different strategies.
Ingeneral,similarnon-textwidgetsinthesameblock(e.g.a list)
usually have similar sizes and align to one another vertically or
horizontally with the same spacing. Texts in the same block are
alwaysleft-justifiedortop-justified(assumeleft-to-righttextorien-
tation), but their sizes and shapes can vary significantly because
of different lengths of text contents. Thus, the approach clusters
thenon-textwidgetsbytheircenterpoints (𝐶𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑋,𝐶𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑌)and
areas, anditclusterstextsbytheir top-left corner (𝑇𝑜𝑝,𝐿𝑒𝑓𝑡 )
Our approach uses the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Cluster-
ing of Applications with Noise) algorithm [ 25] to implement the
clustering.Intuitively,DBSCANgroupsthepointscloselypackedto-
gether (points with many nearby neighbors), while marking points
whose distance from the nearest neighbor is greater than the maxi-
mumthresholdasoutliers.IntheGUIwidgetclusteringcontext,the
point is the GUI widget, and the distance is the difference between
thevaluesofthewidgets’attributethattheclusteringisbasedon.
Figure4illustrates the clustering process. For non-text widgets,

inFigure 4.Weonlykeeptheclusterswithatleasttwowidgetsand
discardthosewithonly one widget.
3.3.2 Cluster Conflicts Resolving. It is common that some widgets
canbeclusteredintodifferentclustersbydifferentattributes,which
causes cluster conflicts. For example, as illustrated in Figure 4,
several non-text widgets (e.g., the bottom-left image) are both in a
verticalcluster(markedinblue)andahorizontalcluster(marked
in red). The intersection of clusters illustrates the conflict. The
approach shall resolve such cluster conflicts to determine to which
groupthewidgetbelongs.Thisconflict-resolvingstepalsocomplies
withthe similarityprinciple thatsuggests the widgetsin the same
perceptualgroup should share more similar properties.
The conflict resolving step first calculates the average widget
areas of the groups to which the conflicting widget has been as-
signed. In accordance with the similarity principle, the widget is
morelikelytobeinagroupwhoseaveragewidgetareaissimilar
to the conflicting widget’sarea. In addition,anotherobservation
isthatrepetitive widgets ina grouphave similarspacingbetween
each other. So for a widget that is clustered into multiple candidate
groups, the approach checks the difference between the spacing of
thiswidgetanditsneighboringwidgetsinagroupandtheaverage
spacingbetweenotherwidgetsinthatgroup.Itkeepsthewidgetin
the group where the conflicting widget has the largest widget-area
similarity and the smallest spacing difference compared with other
widgets inthe group.Forexample,the bottom-leftimagewidget
willbeassignedtotheverticalclusterratherthanthehorizontalone
according to our conflict resolving criteria. After conflict resolving,
ourapproachproducesthefinalwidgetclusteringresultsasshown
in the right part of Figure 4. We use different colors and indices to
illustrate the resultingnon-text(nt) andtext(t) clusters.3.4 Proximity - IterativeGroupPairing
Sofar,GUIwidgetsareaggregatedintogroupsaspertheconnected-
ness and similarity principles. Some groups are close to each other
and similar in terms of the number and layout of the contained
widgets, which may furtherform a larger perceptual group even
though these groups may contain different types of widgets. For
example,intheclusteringresultofFigure 4,wecanobservethat
the clusters nt-0,t-0,t-0-1andnt-2are proximate and have the
same or similar number of widgets aligned in the same way. We
canseethisfeatureintentionallyorsubconsciouslyandperceive
them as in the same large group as a whole. Gestalt psychology
states thatwhen peoplesee anassortment ofobjects,theytend to
perceive objects that are close to each other as a group [ 9]. The
close distance, also known as proximity, of elements is so powerful
thatit canoverridewidget similarityand otherfactorsthat might
differentiateagroupofobjects[ 50].Thus,thenextstepisbasedon
widgetclusters’proximityandcompositionsimilaritytopairthe
clustersintoalarger group (i.e.,layoutblock).
If two groups 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑎and𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑏are next (proximate) to each
other (i.e., no other groups in between), and they contain the same
number of widgets and the widgets in the 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑎and the𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑏
share the same orientation (vertical or horizontal), our approach
combines 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑎and𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑏into a larger block. A widget in
𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑎anditsclosetwidgetin 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑏willbepairedandforma
subgroup of widgets. Our approach first combines the two prox-
imate groups containing the same type of widgets, and then the
groups containing different types of widgets. The formed larger
block can be iteratively combined with the proximate groups until
nomore proximate groups are available.
Sometimes there are different numbers of widgets in the two
proximate groups but the two groups may still form one larger
perceptualblock. For example,thecluster nt-2inFigure 4has one
less widget compared to nt-0,t-0andt-0-1because the bottom
widgetintherightcolumnisoccludedbythefloatactionbutton
andthusmissedbythedetector.Anothercommonreasonforthe
widget number difference is that widgets in a group may be set as
invisibleinsomesituations,andthustheydonotappearvisually.
Therefore,ifthedifferencebetweenthenumberofwidgetsinthe
two proximate groups is less than 4 (empiricallydetermined from
theground-truthgroupsinourdataset),ourapproachalsocombines
the twogroupsintoalarger block.
AsshowninthefinalgroupsinFigure 4,ourapproachidentifies
a set of perceptual groups (blocks), including the multitab at the
top and the list in the main area. Each list item is a combined
widget of some non-text and text widgets (highlighted in the same
color).Theseperceptualgroupsencodethecomprehensionofthe
GUIstructureintohigher-orderlayoutblocksthatcanbeusedin
further processing andapplications.
3.5 Continuity - DetectionError Correction
The GUI widget detector may make two types of detection errors -
missedwidgetsandmisclassifiedwidgets.Missedwidgetsmeans
thatthedetectorfailstodetectsomeGUIelementsontheGUI(e.g.,
the bottom-right icon in Figure 5(a)). Misclassified widgets refer to
the widgets that the detector reports the wrong type, for example,

the top-right small icon (i.e., a non-text widget) in the middle card
in Figure 5(b) is misclassified as a text widget due to an OCR error.
Itishardtorecognizeandcorrectthesedetectionerrorsfromthe
individual widget perspective, but applying the Gestalt continuity
principle to expose such widget detection errors by contrasting
widgets in the same perceptual groups can mitigate the issue. The
continuityprinciplestatesthatelementsarrangedinalineorcurve
areperceivedtobemorerelatedthanelementsnotinalineorcurve
[41].Thus,somedetectionerrorsarelikelytobespottedifaGUI
areaorawidgetalignswithallthewidgetsinaperceptualgroup
inalinebut isnot gatheredintothat group.
Our approach tries to identify and fix missed widgets as follows.
It first inspects the subgroups of widgets in a perceptual group and
checksifthewidgetsinthesubgroupsareconsistentintermsofthe
numberandrelativepositionofthecontainedwidgets.Ifasubgroup
contains fewer widgets than its counterparts, then the approach
locates the inconsistent regions by checking the relative positions
andareasofothersubgroups’widgets.Next,theapproachcropsthe
located UI regions and uses the widget detector upon the cropped
regionswithrelaxedparameters(i.e.doubleoftheminimumarea
threshold for valid widgets) to try to identify the missed widget, if
any. For example, the tiny icon at the bottom right in Figure 5(a)
is missed because its area is so small that the detector regards it
asanoisyregionandhencediscardsitintheinitialdetection.By
analyzingtheresultingperceptualgroupanditscomposition,our
approach finds that seven of the eight subgroups have two widgets(marked in the same color), while the subgroup at the bottom right
has only one widget. It crops the area that may contain the missed
widgetaccordingtotheaveragesizesandaveragerelativepositions
ofthetwowidgetsintheotherseven subgroups.Themissedtiny
icon can be recovered by detecting the widget with the relaxed
valid-widget minimumarea threshold inthe missingarea.
Ourapproachusestheexactmechanismthatcontraststhesub-
groups to identifythe misclassifiedwidgets, but here itfocuses on
widget type consistency. As shown in Figure 5(b), our approach

higher recall (0.823) for non-text widgets than the original UIED
(0.469),andmeanwhile,italsoimprovestheprecision(0.589over
0.431). This significant improvement is due to the more intelligent
container-awaremergingoftextandnon-textwidgetsbyouren-
hanced version. As the original UIED is container-agnostic, it erro-
neously discards many valid widgets contained in other widgets as
noise. For GUI text, the Google OCR tool used in the enhanced ver-
sion achieves muchhigher precision (0.678)thanthe EASTmodel
used in the original UIED (0.402), with a slight decrease in recall
(0.693versus0.720).Theimprovementsinbothtextandnon-text

the enhancedversionversus0.524 bythe originalUIED).

4.2.1 Datasets. Our approach simulates how humans perceive the
GUI structure and segment a GUI into blocks of widgets according
to the Gestalt principles of grouping. To validate the recognized
blocks, we build the ground-truth dataset from two sources: An-
droidappsandUIdesignprototypes.Thegroundtruthannotates
thewidgetgroupsaccordingtotheGUIlayoutandthewidgetstyles
andpropertiesas showninFigure 7.

canbeobtainedbyexaminingthelayoutclassesusedtogroupother

layoutclassesdonotalwayscorrespondtotheperceptualgroups
of GUI widgets. Therefore, we cannot use the GUI layout classes
directly as the ground truth. Instead, we first search the GUIs in
the Rico dataset of Android app GUIs [ 36] that use certain Android
layoutclassesthatmaycontainagroupofwidgets(e.g.,ListView,

work.Followingthework[ 16]forgeneratingGUIcomponenthi-
erarchy from UI image, we adopt the sequence representation of
aGUIcomponenthierarchy. Through depth-firsttraversal,aview
hierarchy can be transformed into a string of GUI widget names
andbrackets(ł[]žandł()žcorrespondingtotheblocks).Thisstring
representstheground-truthperceptualgroupsofanappGUI.As
discussedinSection 2.1,perceptualgroupingisbasedonthewid-

designers organize texts and non-text widgets (images or shape
compositions referred to as frames) into a hierarchy of groups.
Basedonthedesign’sgrouphierarchy,weoutputtheground-truth
string of perceptual groups. The perceptual groups łperceivedž by
our approach are outputinthe same format for comparison.
We compute the Levenshtein edit distance between the two
strings ofa ground-truthblockand aperceivedblock.TheLeven-
shtein edits inform us of the specific mismatches between the two
blocks, which is important to understand and analyze grouping
mistakes.Iftheeditdistancebetweentheground-truthblockand
the perceived block is less than a threshold, we regard the two
blocksasacandidatematch.Wedeterminetheoptimalmatching
between the string of ground-truth blocks and the string of the
perceived blocks by minimizing the overall edit distance among all
candidate matches. If a perceived group matches a ground-truth
group, it is a true positive (TP), otherwise a false positive (FP). If
aground-truthgroupdoesnotmatchanyperceivedgroup,itisa
false negative (FN). Based on the matching results, we compute:
(1)precision( TP/(TP+FP) )(2)recall( TP/(TP+FN) ),and(3)F1-score
((2*precision*recall)/(precision+recall) )
4.2.3 Performance on Android App GUIs. We experiment with five
edit distance thresholds (0-4). The distance 0 means the two blocks
have the perfect match, and the distance 4 means as long as the
unmatched widgetsin thetwoblocks areno morethan 4,the two
blocks can be regarded as a candidate match. As shown in Figure 8,

gests that improving GUI widget detection will positively improve
the subsequent perceptualgrouping.
As the examples in Figure 6show, our approach can not only
accuratelyprocessGUIswithclearstructures(e.g.,thefirstrow),
butitcanalsoprocessGUIswithlargenumbersofwidgetsthatare
placedinapackedway(e.g.,thesecondandthirdrows).Further-
more, our approachis fault-tolerant to GUI widget detection errors
to a certain extent, for example, the second row of detection-based
groupingforscreenshotanddesign.Themapandthepushed-aside
partial GUI result in many inaccurately detected GUI widgets in
thesetwocases.However,ourapproachstillrobustlyrecognizes
the proper perceptualgroups.
We compare our approach with the heuristic-based grouping
method (Screen Recognition) proposed in Zhang et.al. [ 58] (which
received the distinguished paper award at CHI2021). The results in
Table2shows that ScreenRecognition canhardlyhandle visually
and structurally complicated GUIs based on a few ad-hoc and rigid
heuristics. Its F1 score is only 0.092 on the detected widgets and
0.123 on the ground-truth widgets. This is because its heuristics
are designed for only some fixed grouping styles such as cards and
multi-tabs. In contrast, our approach is designed to fulfil generic
Gestaltprinciplesofgrouping.
We manually inspect the grouping results by our approach
against the ground-truth groups to identify the potential improve-
ments.Figure 9presentsfourtypicalcasesthatcausetheperceived
groups to be regarded as incorrect.For the detection-based group-
ing,themajorissueisGUIwidgetover-segmentation(awidgetis
detectedasseveralwidgets)orunder-segmentation(severalwidgets
are detected as one widget). In the first row, the detector segments
the texts on the right side of the GUI into several text and non-text
widgets. As indicated by the same color in the Grouping Result col-
umn,ourapproachstillsuccessfullypartitionsthewidgetsonthe

Whileusingtheground-truthwidgetsfromtheGUImetadata

design prototypes, our approach achieves the precision of 0.750,
therecall0.818andtheF1-score0.783.ThethirdcolumninFigure 6
shows some results of our grouping approach for the UI design
prototypes, where we see it is able to infer the widget groups well
for different styles of GUI designs. GUI widget detection is morerobust on UI design prototypes due to the more accurate GUI wid-
getdetection,whichleadstotheimprovementofthesubsequent
grouping of detected widgets. As shown in Figure 6, the widgets in
a UI design prototype is usually scattered, while the real app GUIs
are packed. Both GUI widget detection and perceptual grouping
become relativelyeasier onless packedGUIs.

time while running our approach over the dataset to get a sense of
its efficiency. Our experiments run on a machine with Windows
10 OS, Intel i7-7700HQ CPU, and 8GB memory. Our approach com-
prises two major steps: widget detection and perceptual grouping.
We improved and refactored the original UIED to boost the run
performance ofthewidgetdetection, and now it takesanaverage
of 1.1s to detect thewidgets in a GUI, which significantlyexceeds
the originalUIED that takes onaverage 9s per GUI. The grouping
process is also efficient, which takes an average of 0.6s to process a
GUI. In total, the average processing time of the entire approach
is 1.7s per GUI image. Furthermore, as our approach does not in-
volveanydeeplearningtechniques,itdoesnotrequireadvanced
computing support such as GPU.
5 RELATED WORK
Our work falls into the area of reverse-engineering the hidden
attributesofGUIsfrompixels.Therearetwolinesofcloselyrelated
work: GUI widgetdetection andGUI-to-text/code generation.
GUIwidgetdetectionisaspecialcaseofobjectdetection[ 31,40,
49]. Earlier work [ 38] uses classic computervision (CV) algorithms
(e.g.,Canny edgeand contouranalysis) todetectGUIwidgets.Re-
cently, White et al. [ 52] apply a popular object detection model
YOLOv2 [ 40] to detect GUI widgets in GUI images for random GUI
testing. Feng et al. [ 15] apply Faster RCNN [ 31] to obtain GUI wid-

different visual characteristics and detection goals from natural
sceneobjectdetection.TheydesignahybridmethodUIEDinspired
bythe figure-ground [ 1]characteristicof GUI,which achievesthe
start-of-the-art performance for GUI widgetdetection.
GUI-to-text/code generation also receives much attention. To
improve GUIaccessibility,Chenet al.[ 18]propose atransformer-
based image captioning model for producing labels for icons. To
implementGUIviewhierarchy,REMAUI[ 38]infersthreeAndroid-
specificlayouts(LinearLayout,FrameLayoutandListView)based
on hand-craft rules to group widgets. Recently, Screen Recogni-
tion[58]developssomeheuristicsforinferringtabsandbars.How-
ever,theseheuristic-basedwidgetgroupingmethodscannothandle
visually and structurally complicated GUI designs (e.g., nested per-
ceptualgroupslikeagridofcards).Alternatively,imagecaptioning
models [34,51] have been used to generate GUI view hierarchy
from GUI images [ 12,16]. Although these image-captioning based
methods get rid of hard-coded heuristics, they suffer from GUI
data availability and quality issues (as discussed in Introduction
340ESEC/FSE ’22, November14ś18, 2022,Singapore, Singapore Mulong Xie, Zhenchang Xing, SidongFeng,XiweiXu,Liming Zhu, Chunyang Chen
and illustrated in Figure 2). These methods also suffer from code
redundancy and no explicit image-code traceability issues (see Sec-
tion6.2). The perceptual groups recognized by our approach could
helpto addresstheseissues.
None of the existing GUI widget detection and GUI-to-code ap-
proaches solve the perceptual grouping problem in a systematic
way as our approach does. ReDraw [ 37] and FaceOff [ 59] solves
the layout problem by finding in the codebase the layouts con-
taining similar GUI widgets. Some other methods rely on source
code or specific layout algorithm (e.g., Android RelativeLayout) to
synthesizemodularGUIcodeorlayout[ 11,13]orinferGUIduplica-
tion [54]. All these methods are GUI implementation-oriented, and
hardtogeneralizeforotherapplicationscenariossuchasUIdesign

ment.Incontrast,ourapproachisbasedondomain-independent
Gestalt principles and is application-independent, so it can support
differentdownstream SE tasks(see Section 6).

niques[33,55,57]havebeenproposedtopredictstructureinthe
visualscene,i.e.,so-calledscenegraphs.Thesetechniquescaninfer
therelationshipsbetweenobjectsdetectedinanimageanddescribe

such relationship triplets cannot represent complex GUI widget
relations in perceptual groups. Furthermore, these techniques also
requiresufficienthigh-qualitydataformodeltraining,whichisa
challenging issuefor GUIs.
6 PERCEPTUALGROUPING APPLICATIONS
Our perceptual grouping method fills in an important gap for auto-
matic UI understanding. Perceptual groups, together withelemen-
tary widget information,wouldopenthedoorto someinnovative
applicationsinsoftware engineeringdomain.
6.1 UI Design Search
UIdesignisahighlycreativeactivity.TheproliferationofUIdesign
dataontheInternetenablesdata-drivenmethodstolearnUIdesigns
and obtain design inspirations [ 14,23,36]. However, this demands
effective UI designsearch engines.Existing methodsoften rely on
the GUI metadata, which limits their applicability as most GUI

of GUI widgets and infer elementary widget information (e.g., size,
primarycolor)tohelpwidgetsearch.Unfortunately,thissolution
doesnot applyto thewhole and complex UIs.Chen etal. [ 17]and
Rico[36]useimageauto-encodertoextractimagefeaturesthrough
self-supervised learning, which can be used to find visually similar
GUI images. However, the image auto-encoder encodes only pixel-
levelfeatures,butisunawareofGUIstructure,whichisverycritical
tomodelandunderstandGUIs.Assuch,giventheGUIintheleft

liketheoneontherightofFigure 2,becausebothGUIshaverich
graphic features and some textural features. Unfortunately, such
searchresultsaremeaningless,becausetheybearnosimilarityin
terms of GUI structure and perceptual groups of GUI widgets. Our
approach can accurately infer perceptual groups of GUI widgets
frompixels.Basedonitsperceptualgroupingresults,aUIdesign
search would become structure-aware, and finds not only visuallybutalso structurallysimilarGUIs.Forexample, astructure-aware
UIdesignsearchwouldreturnaGUIliketheonein2nd-row-1st-
column ofFigure 6for the left GUI inFigure 2.
6.2 Modular GUI-to-CodeGeneration
Existing methods for GUI-to-code generation either use hand-craft
rulesorspecificlayoutalgorithmstoinfersomespecificimplemen-
tation layout [ 13,38], or assume the availability of a codebase to
search layout implementations [ 37,59]. Image-captioning based
GUI-to-Codemethods[ 12,16,29,30]aremoreflexibleastheylearn
howtogenerateGUIviewhierarchyfromGUImetadata(ifavail-
able).However,thenatureofimagecaptioningistojustdescribe
theimagecontent,butitiscompletelyunawareofGUIstructure
during the code generation. As such, the generated GUI code is
highly redundant for repetitive GUI blocks. For example, for the
card-basedGUIdesigninFigure 1(a),itwillgenerateeightpieces
of repetitive code, one for each of the eight cards. This type of gen-
erated code is nothing like the modular GUI code developers write.
So it has little practicality. Another significant limitation of image
captioningisthatthegeneratedGUIlayoutsandwidgetshaveno
connection to the corresponding parts in the GUI image. For a GUI
withmanywidgets(e.g.,thoseinthe2ndand3rdrowsinFigure 6),
itwouldbehardtounderstandhowthegeneratedcodeimplements
theGUI.Withthesupportofourperceptualgrouping,GUI-to-code
generationcanencapsulatethewidgetgroupinginformationinto
the code generation process and produce much less redundant and
more modular, reusable GUI code (e.g., extensible card component).
6.3 UI Automation
Automating UI understanding from pixels can support many UI
automation tasks. A particular application of UI automation in
software engineering is automatic GUI testing. Most existing meth-
ods for automatic GUI testing rely on OS or debugging infrastruc-
ture [5,10,32,43]. In recent years, computer vision methods have
alsobeenusedtosupportnon-intrusiveGUItesting[ 27,28,39,52].
However,thesemethodsonlyworkattheGUIwidgetlevelthrough
eithertraditionalwidgetdetection[ 38]ordeeplearningmodelslike
Yolo [40]. Furthermore, they only support random testing, i.e., ran-
dominteractionswithsomewidgets.Somestudies[ 19,22,56]show
that GUI testing would be more effective if the testing methods
wereawareofmorelikelyinteractions.Theyproposedeeplearning
methods to predict such likely interactions. However, the learning
is a completely black box. That is, they can predict where on the
GUIsomeactionscouldbeapplied,buttheydonotknowwhatwill
be operated and why so. Our approach can inform the learning
with higher-order perceptual groups of GUI widgets so that the
model could make an explainable prediction, for example, scrolling
isappropriate becausethispartofGUIdisplaysalistofrepetitive
blocks.Itmayalsoguidethetestingmethodstointeractwiththe
blocksinaperceptualgroupinanorderlymanner,andensureall
blocks are tested without unnecessary repetitions. Such support
forUIautomationwouldalsoenhancetheeffectivenessofscreen
readers which currently heavily rely on accessibility metadata and
use mostly elementary widgetinformation.

7 CONCLUSION AND FUTUREWORK
Thispaper presentsanovel approachfor recognizingperceptual
groups of GUI widgets in GUI images. The approach is designed
around the four psychological principles of grouping - connect-
edness, similarity, proximity and continuity. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first unsupervised, automatic UI understand-
ing approach with a systematic theoretical foundation, rather than
relying on ad-hoc heuristics or modeltraining with GUI metadata.
ThroughtheevaluationofbothmobileappGUIsandUIdesignpro-
totypes, we confirm the high accuracy of our perceptual grouping
methodforvisuallyandstructurallydiverseGUIs.Ourapproach
fills the gap of visual intelligence between the current widget-level
detection and the whole-UI level GUI-to-code generation. As a
pixel-only and application-independent approach, we envision our
approachcouldenhancemanydownstreamsoftwareengineering
taskswiththevisualunderstandingofGUIstructureandpercep-
tual groups, such as structure-aware UI design search, modular
andreusableGUI-to-codegeneration,andlayout-sensitiveUIau-
tomation for GUI testing and screen reader. Although our current
approachachievesverypromisingperformance,itcanbefurther
improvedbydealingwithwidgetocclusionormodalwindow.More-
over, we will investigate semantic grouping that aims to recognize
both interaction andcontentsemantics ofperceptualgroups.
