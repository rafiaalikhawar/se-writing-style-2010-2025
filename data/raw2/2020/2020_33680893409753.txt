ABSTRACT
Software systems are designed and implemented with assumptions
about the environment. However, once the system is deployed,
the actual environment may deviate from its expected behavior,
possiblyunderminingdesiredpropertiesofthesystem.Toenable
systematic design of systems that are robust against potential envi-
ronmental deviations, we propose a rigorous notion of robustness
forsoftwaresystems.Inparticular,therobustnessofasystemisde-
fined as the largest set of deviating environmental behaviors under
whichthesystemiscapableofguaranteeingadesiredproperty.We
describeanewsetofdesignanalysisproblemsbasedonournotion
of robustness, and a technique for automatically computing robust-
ness of a system given its behavior description. We demonstrate
potential applications of our robustness notion on two case studies
involving network protocols andsafety-critical interfaces.

may deviate from its expected behavior, either deliberately or erro-
neously due to a change in the operating conditions or a fault in
one of its parts. For instance, a user interacting with a computer
interface may inadvertently perform a sequence of actions in an
incorrect order; a network may experience a disruption and fail
todeliveramessageintime;oranattackermayevolveovertime
and obtain a wider range of exploits to compromise the system.
In these cases, the system may no longer be able to satisfy those
requirementsthat reliedon the original assumptions.
In well-established engineering disciplines such as aerospace,
civil,andmanufacturing,deviationsoftheenvironmentfromthe
norm are routinely and explicitly analyzed, and systems are de-
signed to be robustagainstthesepotentialdeviations [ 35]. In soft-
ware engineering, however, a standard notion of robustness seems
tobemissing,althoughasimilarconcepthasbeenstudiedincer-
tain domains. For example, in distributed systems and networks,
thenotionoffaulttolerancehasbeenlongstudied(e.g.,[ 18,30]),
butdoesnotgeneralizetoothertypesofsoftwaresystemswhere
environmental deviations are not limited to network failures or
delays.Incontrolengineering,asystemissaidtoberobustifsmall
deviations on an input result only in small deviations on an out-
put[43].Thisnotionofrobustness,however,isintendedforsystems
whose behaviors are modeled using continuous dynamics, and not
particularly suitablefordiscretebehaviors observedin software.
In this paper, we propose an approach for designing robust sys-
temsbased ona mathematically rigorous notionofrobustnessfor
software. In particular, we say that a system is robustwith respect
to apropertyand a particular set of environmental deviations if the
systemcontinuestosatisfythepropertyeveniftheenvironment
exhibits those deviations. Furthermore, we define the robustness of
asoftwaresystemasthesetofalldeviationsunderwhichasystem
continuestosatisfythatproperty.Basedonthesedefinitions,we
propose an analysis technique for automatically computing the
robustness of a systemgiven itsbehavioral description.
We argue that robustness itself is a type of software quality that
canberigorouslyanalyzedand designedfor.Thegoalofatypical
verification method is to check the following: Given system 𝑀, en-
vironment 𝐸, andproperty 𝑃, does the system satisfythe property
under this environment (i.e., 𝑀∥𝐸|=𝑃)? Our notion of robustness
enablesformulationofnewtypesofanalysesbeyondthis.Forin-
stance,wecouldaskwhetherasystemisrobustagainstaparticular
setofenvironmentaldeviations;giventwoalternativesystemde-
signs (both satisfying 𝑃), we could rigorously compare them by
generatingdeviationsagainstwhichonedesignisrobustbutthe
other isnot, and; givenmultiplesystemproperties(some ofthem
more critical than others), we could compare the environmental
deviationsunderwhich the systemcanguaranteethem.

Weenvisionthatournotionofrobustnesscanbeusedtosupport
design activities across various domains. In this paper, we demon-
strate the application of our approach in two different domains:
(1) human-machine interactions, where we adopt the well-studied
models of human errors from the industrial engineering and hu-
manfactorsresearch[ 7,38]andshowhowourmethodcanbeused
to rigorously evaluate the robustness of safety-critical interfaces
against such errors, and (2) computer networks, where our method
is used to rigorously compare the robustness of network protocols
againstdifferent types of failures in theunderlyingnetwork.

2 MOTIVATING EXAMPLE
This section illustrates how our proposed notion of robustness
may be used to support a new type of design analysis and aid a
systematic development of systems that are robust against failures
orchanges in theenvironment.
(1)Analysis under thenormativeenvironment. As a motivat-
ing example, consider the design of a radiation therapy system
similar to the well-known Therac-25 machine [ 32]. State machines
in Figure 1describe three components in the system, including the
treatmentinterface (𝑀𝐼),whichallowstheoperatortocontrolthe
device by performing interface actions (e.g., Xfor setting the beam
modetoX-ray),the beamsetter (𝑀𝐵),whichdeterminesthecurrent
modeofradiationtherapy(electronbeamandX-ray,whichdelivers
roughly 100 times higher level of current than the former), and
spreader(𝑀𝑆),whichisputinplaceduringtheX-raymodeinorder
to attenuate the effect of the high-power X-ray beam and limit
possibleoverdose.Theoverallbehaviorofthetherapysystem,as
modeledhere,iscapturedbythecompositionofthestatemachines,
𝑀=(𝑀𝐼∥𝑀𝐵∥𝑀𝑆).
The radiation therapy system is associated with a number of
safetyrequirements,oneofwhichstatesthatthespreadercanbe
removed only when the beam is delivered in the electron mode.
This requirement may formally be stated as the following property
in linear-temporallogic (LTL)[ 36]:
G(BeamDelivered ∧OutOfPlace ⇒EbeamMode )
whereBeamDelivered isapropositionthatholdswhen 𝑀𝐼enters
thestatewiththesamename(andsimilarlyforotherpropositions).
During a normal treatment process, a therapist is expected to
perform the following tasks: Select the correct therapy mode for
thecurrentpatientbypressingeither XorE,confirmthetreatment
databypressing Enterandthenfinallyinitiatethebeamdeliverytothe patient by pressing B. This normative behavior of the operator
ismodeledasstate machine 𝐸in Figure 1.
Supposethedesignerofthemachinewishestocheckwhether
the therapy system satisfies its safety requirements, assuming that
an operatorcarriesoutthe tasksas expected.Moregenerally,this
canbeformulatedasthefollowingcommon typeof analysis task:
Doesthesystem,undertheenvironmentthatbehaves
asexpected,satisfy a desiredproperty?
To performthis task,one mayapplyaverificationtechniquesuch
as model checking [ 14] to check whether the composition of the
machineandtheenvironmentsatisfiesadesiredproperty(however,
otheranalysistechniquesmaybejustapplicableaslongastheycan
be used to check 𝑀∥𝐸|=𝑃). Performing this analysis confirms that
the system indeed satisfies the safety property that the spreader is
alwaysin-place duringthe X-raymode.
(2)Analysisofundesirableenvironmentaldeviations. Incom-
plexsystems,theenvironmentmaynotalwaysbehaveasexpected,
andpossiblyundermineassumptionsthatthesystemreliesonto
fulfill its requirements. For instance, in interactive systems, human
operators are far from perfect, and inadvertently make mistakes
fromtimetotimewhileperformingatask(e.g.,performasequence
of actions in a wrong order) [ 38]. In the context of a safety-critical
systemsuchasmedicaldevices,someoftheseoperatorerrors,if
permittedby theinterface, mayresult in a safety violation.
To discover these potential environmental deviations, the de-
signer decidesto perform the followinganalysis task:
What are possible ways in which the environment
maydeviatefromitsexpectedbehaviorandcausea
violation of theproperty?
Given the therapy system models ( 𝑀and𝐸) and property 𝑃, the
designercanuseanexistinganalysistool(e.g.,LTSA[ 33])tocheck
whether𝑀|=𝑃.Theanalyzermayreturnacounterexampletrace
that demonstrates how the operator could deviate from its norma-
tivebehavior(ascapturedby 𝐸)andcausea violation of 𝑃.
Suppose that one such trace contains the following sequence of
operatoractions: ⟨X,Up,E,Enter,B⟩.Thistracedepictsascenario
in which the operator accidentally selects the X-ray mode, corrects
themistakebypressingupandselectingtheelectronbeammode,
and then carrying on the rest of the treatment as intended (by con-
firmingthemode and firing thebeam).This sequence of operator
actions, however, may lead to a violation of the safety property
𝑃in the following way: When the operator presses B, the beam
setter may still be in the process of mode switch (i.e., state Switch-
ToBeam),causingthebeamtobedeliveredintheX-raymodewhile
the spreader is out of place. This scenario corresponds to one type
of failure that caused fatal overdoses in the Therac-25 system [ 32].
(3)Robustness analysis. Havingdiscoveredhowtheoperator’s
mistakecouldleadtoasafetyviolation,thedesignermodifiesthe
treatmentinterfacetoimproveitsrobustnessagainstthepossible
error. In this redesign, shown in Figure 1(e), the operator can press
Bto fire the beam only after the mode switch has been carried out
by the beam setter. As the next step, the designer wishes to ensure
that the system, as re-designed, is robust against the operator’s
mistake(i.e,itcontinuestosatisfythesafetypropertyevenunder
themisbehavingoperator).

The designer couldcheck 𝑀′|=𝑃where𝑀′isthe redesign, if
noerrorsreturned,itmeansthat 𝑀′isrobustagainstthemistake
and also𝑀′can work under any environment. However, it’s not
alwaysthecase.Morelikely,theanalyzermayreturnanothertrace
representing a new mistake, and it does not necessarily mean that
thesystemisrobustagainsttheoldone.
Instead,thedesignercanuseourtooltoperformthefollowing
robustness analysis task:
What are possible environmental deviations under
which the new design satisfies the property but the
olddesigndoes not?
Given the original system model 𝑀, modified system model 𝑀′,
normativeenvironment 𝐸,andproperty 𝑃,ouranalysisreturnsa
set of traces (expressed over environmental actions), each trace
describes a scenario where system 𝑀′satisfies the property but 𝑀
does not. For example, one of the traces is the sequence of oper-
ator actions discussed above: ⟨X,Up,E,Enter,B⟩, confirming that
the redesign has correctly addressed the risk of a possible safety
violation dueto this particular typeof mistake by theoperator.
The analysis steps (2) and (3) may be repeated to identify poten-
tialsafetyviolationsduetoothertypesofoperatormistakesand
furtherimprovetherobustness of thesystem.
3 ROBUSTNESS NOTION
This section describes the underlying formalism used to model
systems and environments (namely, labelled transition systems).
Wethenformallydefinethenotionofrobustnessandintroducea
new set of analysis problems that leverage this notion to reason
about therobustness of systems.
3.1 Preliminaries
In this work, we use labelled transition systems to model the be-
haviors of machines andenvironment.
3.1.1 Labelled Transition System. Alabelled transition system 𝑇is
a tuple⟨𝑆,𝛼𝑇,𝑅,𝑠 0⟩where𝑆is a set of states, 𝛼𝑇is a set of actions
called the alphabet of𝑇,𝑅⊆𝑆×𝛼𝑇∪ {𝜏} ×𝑆defines the state
transitions(where 𝜏isadesignatedactionthatisunobservableto
the system’s environment), and 𝑠0∈𝑆is the initial state. An LTS isnon-deterministic if∃(𝑠,𝑎,𝑠′),(𝑠,𝑎,𝑠′′) ∈𝑅:𝑠′≠𝑠′′;otherwise,it
isdeterministic .
A trace𝜎∈𝛼𝑇∗of an LTS 𝑇is a sequence of observable actions
from the initial state. Then, the behavior of 𝑇is the set of all the
traces generatedby 𝑇, denoted 𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝑇).
3.1.2 Operators. ForanLTS 𝑇=⟨𝑆,𝛼𝑇,𝑅,𝑠 0⟩,theprojection opera-
tor↾isusedtoexposeonlysomesubsetofthealphabetof 𝑇.Given
𝑇↾𝐴=⟨𝑆,𝛼𝑇∩𝐴,𝑅′,𝑠0⟩whereforany (𝑠,𝑎,𝑠′) ∈𝑅,if𝑎∉𝐴,then
(𝑠,𝜏,𝑠′) ∈𝑅′, i.e.,𝑎will behiddenby 𝜏;otherwise, (𝑠,𝑎,𝑠′) ∈𝑅′.
The↾operator can also be applied to traces. We use 𝜎↾𝐴to
denotethetracethat resultsfromremovingalltheoccurrencesof
actions𝑎∉𝐴from𝜎.
Theparallel composition ||is a commutative and associative
operator which combines two LTSs by synchronizing their com-
mon actions and interleaving the remaining actions. Let 𝑇1=
⟨𝑆1,𝛼𝑇1,𝑅1,𝑠1
0⟩and𝑇2=⟨𝑆2,𝛼𝑇2,𝑅2,𝑠2
0⟩,𝑇1||𝑇2is an LTS 𝑇=
⟨𝑆,𝛼𝑇,𝑅,𝑠 0⟩where𝑆=𝑆1×𝑆2,𝛼𝑇=𝛼𝑇1∪𝛼𝑇2,𝑠0=(𝑠1
0,𝑠2
0),
and𝑅isdefinedas:Forany (𝑠1,𝑎,𝑠1′) ∈𝑅1and𝑎∉𝛼𝑇2,wehave
((𝑠1,𝑠2),𝑎,(𝑠1′,𝑠2)) ∈𝑅; for any (𝑠2,𝑎,𝑠2′) ∈𝑅2and𝑎∉𝛼𝑇1,
we have ((𝑠1,𝑠2),𝑎,(𝑠1,𝑠2′)) ∈𝑅; and for (𝑠1,𝑎,𝑠1′) ∈𝑅1and
(𝑠2,𝑎,𝑠2′) ∈𝑅2, wehave ((𝑠1,𝑠2),𝑎,(𝑠1′,𝑠2′)) ∈𝑅.
3.1.3 Properties. In this work, we consider a class of properties
calledsafetyproperties [29].Inparticular,asafetyproperty 𝑃can
berepresentedasadeterministicLTSthatcontainsno 𝜏transitions.
It defines the acceptable behaviors of a system 𝑇over𝛼𝑃, and
we say that an LTS 𝑇satisfies𝑃(denoted 𝑇|=𝑃) if and only if
𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝑇↾𝛼𝑃) ⊆𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝑃).
We check whether an LTS 𝑇satisfies a safety property 𝑃=
⟨𝑆,𝛼𝑃,𝑅,𝑠 0⟩by automatically deriving an errorLTS𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑟=⟨𝑆∪
{𝜋},𝛼𝑃,𝑅𝑒𝑟𝑟,𝑠0⟩where𝜋denotes the error state, and 𝑅𝑒𝑟𝑟=𝑅∪
{(𝑠,𝑎,𝜋)|𝑎∈𝛼𝑃∧/nex⟩sts𝑠′∈𝑆:(𝑠,𝑎,𝑠′) ∈𝑅}. With this 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑟LTS, we
test whether the error state 𝜋is reachable in 𝑇||𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑟. If𝜋is not
reachable, then wecanconclude that 𝑇|=𝑃.
3.2 Robustness Definition
Let𝑀be the LTS of a machine, 𝐸the LTS of the environment, and
𝛼𝐸𝑀=𝛼𝑀∩𝛼𝐸the common actions between the machine and
the environment. Then, we say 𝑀↾𝛼𝐸𝑀represents the set of all
environmental behaviors that are permitted by machine 𝑀.

4 ANALYSIS PROBLEMS

Problem 4.1 (Robustness analysis) .Given machine 𝑀, environ-
ment𝐸, andproperty 𝑃, compute Δ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃).
Given a method for computing the robustness of a machine
(describedinSection 5),wecanalsoperformthefollowinganalyses:
Problem 4.2 (Design comparison) .Given machines 𝑀1and𝑀2,
environment 𝐸, and property 𝑃such that 𝛼𝑀1∩𝛼𝐸=𝛼𝑀2∩𝛼𝐸,
compute set 𝑋=Δ(𝑀2,𝐸,𝑃) −Δ(𝑀1,𝐸,𝑃).
This analysis allows us to compare a pair of machines (repre-
sentingalternativedesignsofasystem)ontheirrobustnessagainst
thegivenenvironmentandproperty. 𝑀2,forexample,maybeanevolution of 𝑀1; the result of the analysis would describe precisely
the environmental deviations under which 𝑀2is more robust than
𝑀1.Notethat 𝑀1and𝑀2may overlap,notnecessarily subsume,in
termsof their robustness.
Anothertypeofanalysiscanbeusedtoreasonabouthowthe
robustness of a machine changes depending on the property that it
attemptsto establish:
Problem4.3 (Property comparison) .Given machines 𝑀, environ-
ment𝐸, and properties 𝑃1and𝑃2, compute set 𝑋=Δ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃2) −
Δ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃1).
For instance, suppose that 𝑃1says that “the radiation therapy
systemshouldalwaysdeliverthecorrectamountofdosetoeach
patient”, while 𝑃2states that “the system never overdoses patients
bydeliveringX-raywhilethespreaderisoutofplace”(similarto
property𝑃from Section 2). The result of this analysis could tell us,
for example, that the system is capable of guaranteeing 𝑃2(weaker
and arguably more critical of the two) even under certain operator
errors,while 𝑃1maybeviolatedundersimilar deviations.
In general, since improving robustness might introduce addi-
tionalcomplexityintothesystem,itmaybeacost-effectivestrategy
to design the system to be robust for most critical of the system
requirements [ 27]; our analysis could be used to support this ap-
proach to design.
5 ROBUSTNESS COMPUTATION
Thissectiondescribesamethodforautomaticallycomputingthe
robustnessofthemachinewithrespecttoagivenenvironmentand
a desiredproperty (Problem 4.1in Section 4).
5.1 Overview
Figure3shows the overall process of our approach to compute
the robustness of a machine 𝑀with respect to environment 𝐸and
property 𝑃. The input of our tool is the LTS of 𝑀,𝐸, and𝑃. We
firstgeneratethe weakestassumption of𝑀(Section5.2)tocompute
Δ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃). SinceΔmay be infinite, we then generate a succinct
representationofit.Wecomputethe representative modelofΔ(Sec-
tion5.3.1), group the traces into equivalence classes, and generate
afinitesetof representative traces(Section 5.3.2).Finally,wetake
anexternal deviation modelasinputtogenerateexplanationsfor
those representativetraces (Section 5.4).The final outputisaset of
pairs of a representativetraceanditsexplanation.
5.2 Weakest Assumption
Inassume-guaranteestyleofreasoning[ 28],amachineisconsid-
ered capable of establishing a property under some assumption
about the behavior of the environment. In our modeling approach,
an assumption is represented as some subset of all permitted envi-
ronmentalbehaviors;thelargestsuchsubsetiscalledthe weakest
assumption (thesecondlargestcircle in Figure 2). Moreformally:
Definition 5.1. Theweakestassumption 𝑊𝑀,𝐸,𝑃ofamachine 𝑀
with respect to environment 𝐸and property 𝑃is an LTS which
defines the largest subset of the permitted environment behaviors

Figure 3: Overview of the process for robustness computation. The input is the LTS of machine 𝑀, environment 𝐸, and prop-
erty𝑃. Section 5.2describes weakest assumption generation for computing Δ. Section 5.3describes generating robustness

of𝑀which satisfy property 𝑃, i.e.,
𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝑊𝑀,𝐸,𝑃) ⊆𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝑀↾𝛼𝐸𝑀) ∧𝑀||𝑊𝑀,𝐸,𝑃|=𝑃∧
∀𝐸′:𝑀||𝐸′|=𝑃↔𝐸′|=𝑊𝑀,𝐸,𝑃
If stated otherwise, we willsimply write 𝑊to mean𝑊𝑀,𝐸,𝑃for
therest of thepaper.
Then,therobustnessofamachineisequivalenttoitsweakest
assumption minusthebehaviorsoftheoriginalenvironment.More
formally,wecancomputetherobustnessofmachine 𝑀withrespect
toenvironment 𝐸andproperty 𝑃byconstructingthefollowingset:
Δ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃)={𝜎∈𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝑊) |𝜎∉𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝐸↾𝛼𝐸𝑀)}(1)
Weusetheapproach byGiannakopoulou et al.[ 20] to generate
the weakest assumption of a system to satisfy a certain safety
property. We briefly describe the approach: Given the system LTS
𝑀, theenvironmentLTS 𝐸, andthesafety property 𝑃,
(1)Compose system 𝑀with the errorLTS of property 𝑃(as
defined in Section 3.1.3) and project its alphabet to the com-
mon actions between 𝑀and𝐸, i.e., let𝛼𝐸𝑀=𝛼𝑀∩𝛼𝐸, we
compute (𝑀||𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑟)↾𝛼𝐸𝑀.
(2)Performbackwardpropagationoftheerrorstateover 𝜏tran-
sitions in the LTS obtained from Step 1. We prune all states
that are backward reachable from the error state via one or
more𝜏steps. The rationale is that if the system is in a state
whichcanentertheerrorstatewithsomeinternalactions,
then no environmentcanprevent theproperty violation.
(3)Determinize the LTS obtained from step 2 by applying 𝜏
eliminationandsubsetconstruction[ 25].
(4)Remove the error state and all of its incoming transitions to
obtain the LTS that corresponds to the weakest assumption.
5.3 Representation ofRobustness
In general, the set of environmental traces that represent robust-
ness in Equation ( 1) may be infinite. Since simply enumerating
this set may not be an effective way to present this information
to the system designer, we propose a succinct, finiterepresenta-
tion of the robustness. The key idea behind our approach is that
manyofthetracesin Δ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃)captureasimilartypeofdeviation
(e.g., a human operator erroneously skipping an action) and can be
groupedintothesameequivalenceclasswithasingle representativetracethat describes the deviation. Based on this idea, we describe a
methodforautomaticallyconverting Δintoafinitenumberofsuch
equivalence classes(andthus,a finite set of representativetraces).
5.3.1 RepresentativeModelofRobustness. RecallfromEquation( 1)
thatΔcontainstracesthatareintheweakestassumption 𝑊butnot
in the original normative environment 𝐸. To construct an LTS that
represents Δ,wetakeadvantageofthemethodtochecksafetyprop-
erties (described at the end of Section 3.1.3). In particular, we treat
theoriginalenvironment 𝐸projectedover 𝛼𝐸𝑀asasafetyproperty,
andcomputetracesin 𝑊thatleadtoaviolationofthisproperty;
any suchtracerepresentsa prefix of the traces in Δ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃).

Figure 4: LTS’s for a simple example illustrating the con-

Toillustrateourapproach,considerasimpleexampleinFigure 4,
where𝑊is the weakest assumption generated from some machine
𝑀and𝐸istheoriginalenvironment.Tocomputetherepresentation
ofΔ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃), we first test whether 𝑊|=(𝐸↾𝛼𝐸𝑀), which is
equivalenttotestingwhethertheerrorstateisreachablein 𝑊||(𝐸↾
𝛼𝐸𝑀)𝑒𝑟𝑟, as shown in Figure 4(c). We say 𝑊||(𝐸↾𝛼𝐸𝑀)𝑒𝑟𝑟is the
representative model ofΔ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃), and letΠ(𝑊,𝐸)be the set of all
theerrortraces in it.Then,
Δ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃)={𝜎∈𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝑊) |∃𝜎′∈Π(𝑊,𝐸):𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖𝑥(𝜎′,𝜎)}(2)
where𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖𝑥(𝜎1,𝜎2)means𝜎1is the prefix of 𝜎2. Thus, a trace in
Π(𝑊,𝐸)canrepresentasetoftracesin Δ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃)thatsharethis
prefix.Forourexample,trace ⟨𝑎,𝑐⟩inΠ(𝑊,𝐸)canrepresent,e.g.,
⟨𝑎,𝑐,𝑎,𝑏,... ⟩and⟨𝑎,𝑐,𝑎,𝑐,... ⟩inΔ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃).
5.3.2 RepresentativeTracesofRobustness. Nevertheless, Π(𝑊,𝐸)
mayalsobeinfinitedue to possible cycles.Forexample,in Figure
4(c),⟨𝑎,𝑏,𝑏,...,𝑎 ⟩wouldresultininfinitenumberoferrortraces.
Therefore, wefurtherdivide the traces intoequivalence classes:
5ESEC/FSE’20, November 8–13,2020, Virtual Event, USA Changjian Zhang, DavidGarlan,andEunsukKang
Let𝑇𝑊,𝐸=⟨𝑆𝑊,𝐸,𝛼𝐸𝑀,𝑅𝑊,𝐸,𝑠0⟩be the composition 𝑊∥(𝐸↾
𝛼𝐸𝑀)𝑒𝑟𝑟. Then,
Π(𝑊,𝐸)=/uniondisplay.1
𝑠∈𝑆𝑊,𝐸
𝑎∈𝛼𝐸𝑀Π𝑠,𝑎(𝑊,𝐸)where(𝑠,𝑎,𝜋) ∈𝑅𝑊,𝐸
i.e.,Π𝑠,𝑎(𝑊,𝐸)denotes a subset of traces in Π(𝑊,𝐸)that all end
withtransition (𝑠,𝑎,𝜋). Then, wehave
Δ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃)={𝜎∈𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝑊) |∃Π𝑠,𝑎(𝑊,𝐸),∃𝜎′∈Π𝑠,𝑎(𝑊,𝐸):
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖𝑥(𝜎′,𝜎)}(3)
We say that Π𝑠,𝑎(𝑊,𝐸)is anequivalence class ofΠ(𝑊,𝐸). In
our example, we have two equivalence classes: Π1,𝑐(𝑊, 𝐸)and
Π2,𝑎(𝑊,𝐸). Traces like ⟨𝑎,𝑐⟩and⟨𝑎,𝑏,𝑐,𝑎,𝑐 ⟩all belong to class
Π1,𝑐(𝑊,𝐸); and traces like ⟨𝑎,𝑏,𝑎⟩and⟨𝑎,𝑏,𝑏,𝑏,𝑎 ⟩all belong to
classΠ2,𝑎(𝑊,𝐸).
Therationaleisthat: 𝑠isthelaststatebyfollowingthenormative
behaviorsoftheoriginalenvironment,and 𝑎isthefirstdeviated
action. Thus, Π𝑠,𝑎(𝑊,𝐸)describes a class of traces that deviate
fromtheoriginalenvironmentfromthesamenormativestate 𝑠and
by thesameaction 𝑎.
Since𝑆𝑊,𝐸and𝛼𝐸𝑀are finite, so we have a finite number of
equivalence classes. We can simply generate them by enumerating
all the transitions leading to the error state. Then, we can pick
one of the traces in each equivalence class to represent Δ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃).
Because we may not beinterested in howthe environment reaches
the last normative state, here we simply choose the shortest one.
Finally, wedefine:
Definition5.2. Therepresentation ofΔ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃),denotedby Δ𝑟𝑒𝑝(
𝑀,𝐸,𝑃), is a finite set of traces such that each trace in it is the
shortesttraceof one of theequivalence classesof Π(𝑊𝑀,𝐸,𝑃,𝐸).
Therefore, for our conceptual example, Δ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃)can be repre-
sentedby: Π1,𝑐(𝑊,𝐸):⟨𝑎,𝑐⟩, andΠ2,𝑎(𝑊,𝐸):⟨𝑎,𝑏,𝑎⟩.
5.4 Explanation ofRepresentativeTraces
By definition, a representative trace in Δ𝑟𝑒𝑝(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃)contains only
actionsfrom 𝛼𝐸𝑀.Whilethistracedescribeshowtheenvironment
deviates from its expected behavior as observed by the machine,
itdoesnotcapturehowtheinternalbehavioroftheenvironment
couldhavecausedthisdeviation.Toprovidesuchan explanation for
an environmental deviation, we propose a method for augmenting
therepresentative traces withadditional domain-specificinforma-
tion(called faultyevents )abouttheunderlyingrootcausebehind
the deviation. In this approach, the normative model is augmented
with additional transitions on these faulty events (which are in-
ternal to the environment) and an automated method is used to
extract a minimal explanation for aparticularrepresentativetrace.
5.4.1 ExplanationsfromaDeviationModel. Inordertobuildexpla-
nations for representative traces, our tool takes a deviation model
as input, which contains normative and deviated behaviors, and
maps eachrepresentativetraceto a tracein thedeviation model.

5.4.2 The Minimal Explanation. In general, there could be infinite
numberofexplanationsforarepresentativetrace.However,similar
to software testing where we are often interested in the smallest
test cases against certain errors, here we are also only interested in
the explanation of 𝜎which contains the minimal number of faults.

Tocomputetheminimalexplanationfor 𝜎∈Δ𝑟𝑒𝑝(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃),let

only traces in it. Besides, wemakethe last action in 𝜎leadto𝜋to

Line 1-3 define an empty queue to store the remaining search
states and an empty set to store the visited states, and add the
initial state to the queue. The algorithm loops until the queue is
empty (Line 4). If the current visiting state is 𝜋, then it returns the
current trace as the explanation (Line7-8); otherwise, it adds the
nextstatestothequeue.Specifically,ifthecurrenttracedoesnot
match the prefix of 𝜎, i.e.,⟨𝑎0,...,𝑎𝑛−1⟩, then it only adds states
with a non-faulty transition (Line 12-13). Since BFS returns on the
first result, it is guaranteed to find the minimal explanation. For

4.2, wehave
𝑋=Δ(𝑀2,𝐸,𝑃) −Δ(𝑀1,𝐸,𝑃)
={𝜎∈𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝑊𝑀2) |𝜎∉𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝐸↾𝛼𝐸𝑀) ∧𝜎∉𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝑊𝑀1)}
By assuming 𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝐸↾𝛼𝐸𝑀) ⊆𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝑊𝑀1), we can simplify the
equationto:
𝑋=Δ(𝑀2,𝐸,𝑃) −Δ(𝑀1,𝐸,𝑃)={𝜎∈𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝑊𝑀2) |𝜎∉𝑏𝑒ℎ(𝑊𝑀1)}
Then, we can use the same method described in Section 5.3to

7 CASESTUDIES
This section reports on our experience applying our proposed
method to evaluate the robustness of software designs. In par-
ticular, our goal was to answer the following research questions:
(1) Does our proposed notion of robustness capture the types of
environmentaldeviationsthatoccurinpractice?(2)Isournotion
ofrobustnessapplicableacrossmultipledomains?Toanswer(2),
we demonstrate the application of our method to two different
types of systems: namely, network protocols and safety-critical
interfaces.For(1),weshowthattherobustnesscomputedbyour
method indeed corresponds to environmental deviations that have
been studiedin therespectivedomains.
7.1 Implementation
We created our robustness analyzer on top of LTSA [ 33,34], a
modeling tool that supports automated reachability-based anal-
ysis of labelled transition systems. In our tool, the LTS’s corre-
sponding to the input system, environment, and property are spec-
ified using FSP, the input modeling language of LTSA. We im-
plementthefunctionsincludingweakestassumptiongeneration,
representation generation, and explanation generation in a Kotlin
program (a JVM-based language). In particular, we take advan-
tageofthebuilt-intoolsupportofLTSAforcomposition,projec-
tion, and property checking over LTS. Our evaluation was done
on a Windows machine with 3.6GHz CPU and 32GB memory.
The source code of the implementation can be found on GitHub,
https://github.com/SteveZhangBit/LTSA-Robust.
7.2 NetworkProtocolDesign
This section describes a case study on rigorously evaluating the
robustness of network protocoldesigns. In particular, we focuson
two protocols:Anaiveprotocolthatassumesaperfectly reliable
communication channel, and the Alternate Bit Protocol (ABP) [ 42],
whichisspecificallydesignedtoguaranteeintegrityofmessages
overapotentiallyunreliablecommunicationchannel.Bycomputing
andcomparingtherobustnessofthetwo,weformallyshowthat
the ABP is indeed more robust than the naive protocol against
possiblefailuresinthechannel.Asfarasweknow,ourmethodis

7.2.2 ComputingRobustnessandExplanations. Wedefinedprop-

property P = (input -> output -> P).
This property ensures that the sender sends a new message only
afteritreceivesthereceiver’sacknowledgementthatthepreviously
sent messagewassuccessfullydelivered.
Weusedourtooltocomputetherobustnessofthetwoprotocols,
i.e.,Δ(𝑀𝑁,𝐸,𝑃)andΔ(𝑀𝐴𝐵𝑃,𝐸,𝑃).Specifically, 𝐸contains9states
and24transitions, 𝑀𝑁contains20statesand67transitions,and
our tool spent 130ms to generate Δ𝑟𝑒𝑝(𝑀𝑁,𝐸,𝑃)and build their
explanations. Δ𝑟𝑒𝑝(𝑀𝑁,𝐸,𝑃)contains4 tracescorrespondingto4

7.3 Radiation TherapySystem
The second case study focuses on the radiation therapy system
introduced in Section 2. Specifically, we compare the robustness
of the two designs (i.e., the original design and the redesign in-
volving an additional check to ensurethecompletion of themode
switch before beam delivery) and show that the redesign is in-
deed more robust against potential human errors. In particular, to
model normative and erroneous human behavior, we adopt the En-
hancedOperatorFunctionModel(EOFM)[ 8],aformalnotationfor
modelingtasksperformedoverhuman-machineinterfaces.Human
behavior modelinghasbeen studiedbyresearchersin humanfac-
torsandcognitivescience[ 24,38],andwereusetheirresultsinthis
casestudytodemonstratethatourapproachcanbecombinedwith
existingbehaviormodels in fieldsother thannetwork protocols.
7.3.1 EOFM. The Enhanced Operator Function Model (EOFM) [ 8]
is a formal description language for human task analysis , a well-
establishedsub-fieldofhumanfactorsthatfocusesonthedesign
ofhumanoperatortasksandrelatedfactors(e.g.,training,working
conditions, and error prevention) [ 2]. An EOFM describes the task
tobeperformedbyanoperatoroveramachineinterfaceasahierar-
chicalsetof activities.Eachactivityincludesasetof conditions that
describe(1)when theactivitycanbeundertaken( pre-conditions )
and(2)whenitisconsideredcomplete( completionconditions ).Each

into atomic interface actions. Decomposition operators are used
to specify the temporal relationships between the sub-activities or
actions.TheEOFMlanguageisbasedXML,anditalsosupportsa

Figure8shows a fragment of the EOFM model of the operator’s

directed arrows are decomposition operators. The triangle
in yellow defines the pre-conditions of an activity, and the
triangle inred defines thecompletion conditions.
7.3.2 Models. The LTS’s used for this case study (shown in Fig-
ure1) were adopted from a prior work on formal safety analysis of
radiationtherapysystemunderpotentialhumanerrors[ 10],where
the system is modeled as a finite state machine and the human
operatortaskisspecifiedusinganEOFM.Adoptingtheirsystem
model into our LTS was straightforward. To translate the EOFM to
a corresponding LTS, we implemented an automatic EOFM-to-LTS
translator using a technique proposed in [ 11]; due to limited space,
weomit thedetails about ourtranslation process.
7.3.3 DeviationModel. Togenerateexplanationsfor Δthatinvolve
human errors, we adopted a method for automatically augmenting
a model of a normative operator task (specified in EOFM) with
additionalbehaviorsthatcorrespondtohumanerrors[ 9].Inpar-
ticular, this approach leverages a catalog of human errors called
genotypes [38]. For example, one type of genotype errors named
commission describeserrorswheretheoperatoraccidentallyper-
forms an activity under a wrong condition.Other genotype errors
include omission (skippinganactivity)andrepetition.

tains 19 states and 40 transitions, 𝑀𝑅contains 19 states and 42
transitions. Our tool spent 958ms to compute the representation of
𝑋, which contains 3 representative traces (i.e., implying that 𝑀𝑅
ismorerobustthan 𝑀againstthreetypesofoperatordeviations).
One of the traces represents the error that was discussed in Sec-
tion2:⟨X,Up,E,Enter,B⟩. This shows that the redesign is indeed
robustagainstthe operator error involvingthe switchfromX-ray
to EBeam. Moreover, weused the deviationmodel to generate the

7.3.5 Comparing Robustness Under Two Properties. Recall that
property 𝑃statesthatthesystemshouldnotfireX-raywhenthe
spreader is out of place. It may also be desirable to ensure that
the system does not fire electron beam when the spreader is in
place (for example, resulting in under-dose, which, while not as
life-threatening as overdose, is still considered a critical error.) Let
𝑃′be a property stating that the system must prevent both over-
dose as well as under-dose by ensuring the right mode of beam
depending on the configuration of the spreader. Intuitively, 𝑃′is a
stronger property than 𝑃.
Tocomparetherobustnessofthesystemagainstthesetwoprop-
erties,wecomputed 𝑋=Δ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃)−Δ(𝑀,𝐸,𝑃′)byusingEquation

8 RELATEDWORK
Most of the prior works on robustness within the software engi-
neering community have focused on testing[39]. Techniques such
asfuzztesting(e.g.,[ 21]),model-basedtesting(particularlythose
that use a fault model [ 4,17]) and chaos testing [ 3] are designed to
evaluatetherobustnessofsystemsagainstunexpectedinputsoren-
vironmentalfailures.However,theprimarygoalofthesetechniques

teristic of the software. In addition, we believe that our robustness
metriccanpotentiallybeusedtocomplementandfurthersystem-
atizerobustnesstesting;forinstance,tracesin Δcouldbeusedto
guide the generation of test cases that are designed to evaluate the
systemagainstspecific types of environmental deviations.Various formal definitions of robustness for discrete systems
have been investigated [ 5,22,23,40]. One common characteris-
tics of these prior definitions is that they are all quantitative in
nature. For instance, Bloem et al. propose a notion of robustness
thatrelatesthenumberofincorrectenvironmentinputsandsystem
outputs(e.g.,theratioofincorrectoutputsoverinputsshouldbe
small)[5].Tabuadaetal.proposeadifferentnotionofrobustness
that assigns coststo certain input and output traces (e.g., a high
costmaybeassignedtoaninputtracethatdeviatessignificantly
from the expected behavior) and stipulates that an input with a
small cost should only result in an output with a proportionally
smallcost[ 40].Henzingeretal.adoptthenotionof Lipschitzcon-
tinuityfromthecontroltheorytodiscretetransitionsystemsand
use thedistancebetween a pair of expected and actual input traces
to quantifytheamount of environmental deviations[ 22,23].
In comparison, our notion of robustness is qualitative in that
itcapturesthe(possiblyinfinite)setofenvironmentaldeviations
under which the system guarantees a desired property. These two
types of metrics are complementary in nature and have their own
potential uses. While a quantitative metric may directly enable
ordering of design alternatives, our robustness contains additional
information about the environmental behaviors (e.g., specific types
of deviations)that canbeusedto improvethe systemrobustness.
Tabuada and Neider propose an extension of linear temporal
logiccalled robustlineartemporallogic (rLTL),whichallowsspec-
ifications stipulating that a “small” violation of the environment
assumption must cause only a “small” violation of the guarantee
bythesystem[ 41].Inparticular,theyuseamulti-valuedsemantics
tocapturedifferentlevelsofpropertysatisfactionbytheenviron-
ment (e.g., given an expected property of form G𝜑, being able to
satisfyonlyaweakerproperty F(G𝜑)wouldbeconsidereda“small”
violation)[ 40].Althoughthefocusofourpaperisoncomputingro-
bustnessratherthanspecifyingit,rLTLcouldpotentiallybeusedto
characterize certain types of deviations that are temporal in nature.
Our notion of robustness can be regarded as one way of charac-
terizinguncertaintyabouttheenvironmentunderwhichthesystem
is capable guaranteeing a certain property. Researchers have devel-
oped various notations and analysis techniques for specifying and
reasoning about uncertainty [ 12,16,26,31]. For example, modal
transition systems (MTS) allow one to express uncertainty about
behaviorbyassigninga modality totransitions(e.g.,atransition
that can possibly but not necessarily occur is assigned modality
may) [31]. More recently, partial models have been developed as a
generalmodelingframeworkforspecifyingandreasoningabout
uncertainty on structural or behavioral aspects of a system [ 16].
Although the approach in this paper uses a purely trace-based en-
coding of robustness, these existing notations could potentially be
usedto providea morehigh-level representationof robustness.
In safety engineeringand risk management, operating envelope
(or sometimes safety envelope ) has been used to refer to the bound-
aryofenvironmentalconditionsunderwhichthesystemiscapable
ofmaintainingsafety[ 37].Thisconcepthasbeenadoptedinanum-
berofdomainssuchasaviation,robotics,andmanufacturing,but
asfarasweknow,hasnotbeenrigorouslydefinedinthecontext
of software. Our notion of robustness can be considered as one
possible definition of the operating envelope for software systems.

providedomainexpertswithinsightsaboutpreviouslyunknown
types of deviations (e.g., ABP being robust against an injection of a
dubiousacknowledgement, asdescribedat theend of Section 7.2).10 LIMITATIONS ANDFUTURE WORK
Properties. One limitation of the proposed approach is that our
currentnotionofrobustnessisspecificallydesignedfor safetyprop-
erties. As a next step, to enable reasoning about livenessproper-
ties [1], we plan to investigate an extended notion of robustness
wheretheenvironmentdeviatesfromitsexpectationnotonlyby
performing additional behaviors, but also by failingto perform
expected behaviors (thus possibly resulting in a liveness violation).
Scalability. Thescalabilityofourtoolhighlydependsontheweak-
estassumptiongenerationalgorithm;thegenerationoftherepre-
sentativetracesandexplanationsinvolvesonlyLTScomposition
and BFS search. As part of future work, we plan to improve our
toolbyleveragingtechniquesforefficientgenerationofweakestas-
sumptions(e.g.,thosethatuseL*learning[ 15]oracounterexample-
guidedmethod[ 6]).
Classifying deviations. Another limitation is that our current
methodofdefiningequivalenceclassesfor Δmaysometimesresult
inaclassificationthatistoofine-grained.Forexample,fortheABP
protocol, our tool generated 107 different classes of environmental
deviations (see Section 7.2). Intuitively, traces ⟨𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑[0],𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑[0]⟩
and⟨...,𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑[1],𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑[1]⟩refer to the same type of fault (i.e., mes-
sagelossduringsending)andcouldbegroupedintothesameclass.
In future work, we plan to explore different strategies for gen-
eratingrepresentativetraces,leveragingabstraction-basedmeth-
ods to produce higher-level representations of deviations (e.g.,
⟨...,𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑[𝑥],𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑[𝑥]⟩forsome event parameter 𝑥).
Redesigningfor robustness. One potential future direction is to
develop an approach for systematically redesigning a system to
improveitsrobustness:Givenmachine 𝑀andsomeenvironmental
deviations 𝛿underwhichthesystemfailstosatisfyproperty 𝑃,how
doweredesignthesystemtoberobustagainstsuchdeviations(i.e.,
𝛿⊆Δ(𝑀′,𝐸,𝑃)forredesignedmachine 𝑀′)?Inparticular,weplan
