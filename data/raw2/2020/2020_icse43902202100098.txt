Abstract —Open Source Software (OSS) has changed drasti-
cally over the last decade, with OSS projects now producing
a large ecosystem of popular products, involving industry par-
ticipation, and providing professional career opportunities. But
our ﬁeld’s understanding of what motivates people to contribute
to OSS is still fundamentally grounded in studies from the
early 2000s. With the changed landscape of OSS, it is very
likely that motivations to join OSS have also evolved. Through
a survey of 242 OSS contributors, we investigate shifts in
motivation from three perspectives: (1) the impact of the new
OSS landscape, (2) the impact of individuals’ personal growth
as they become part of OSS communities, and (3) the impact
of differences in individuals’ demographics. Our results show
that some motivations related to social aspects and reputation
increased in frequency and that some intrinsic and internalized
motivations, such as learning and intellectual stimulation, are
still highly relevant. We also found that contributing to OSS
often transforms extrinsic motivations to intrinsic, and that while
experienced contributors often shift toward altruism, novices
often shift toward career, fun, kinship, and learning. OSS projects
can leverage our results to revisit current strategies to attract and
retain contributors, and researchers and tool builders can better
support the design of new studies and tools to engage and support
OSS development.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Much has changed since the early days of Open Source Soft-
ware (OSS) [1], from the type of products it creates, to who
participates (e.g., individuals, industry consortia, companies),
to how it operates (e.g., industry funded projects, foundations,
social coding platforms). OSS today enjoys a place of distinc-
tion in producing key technologies and providing learning and
career opportunities. With such drastic changes to the status
of OSS, along with the clearer path to personal economic gain
that it now affords, it is likely that what motivates people to
join OSS has evolved since the early days.
Our current understanding of what motivates individuals to
contribute to OSS, however, remains largely rooted in research
from the 2000s, when OSS was still in its infancy [2, 3]. This
dated understanding of motivation can make our community
and research efforts to attract, sustain, and improve diversity
in OSS projects ineffectual. Therefore, it is time we revisit the
fundamental question of what drives people to contribute to
OSS today, giving us a two-part research question:RQ1a: What motivates contributors to OSS today?
RQ1b: How has motivation to contribute shifted as OSS has
matured?
Besides understanding what motivates individuals now, so
we can better support them, we also aim to identify the ways
in which people’s motivations have shifted in response to the
changing landscape, so that OSS communities can rethink their
strategies to attract and retain contributors.
Shifts in motivation occur not only because of changes to the
OSS landscape, but might also reﬂect the journey an individual
makes and their growth since ﬁrst joining [4]. Currently, we
lack an understanding of the differences in motivation for the
early joiners compared to those who are well-entrenched in
OSS. To support both the attraction of new members and the
retention of existing contributors, we need to understand how
the motivation changes after the members join OSS. This leads
us to our next research question:
RQ2: How does motivation to contribute to OSS shift as OSS
contributors gain tenure?
What motivates people and shifts their motivation as they
gain experience in OSS may also depend on their individual
characteristics—gender, degree of experience, primary type
of contribution (code, non-code), and so on. For example,
research has shown women enjoy other types of contributions
(such as documentation or community management) over code
hacking [5]. Research has also shown that coders and non-
coders follow different career pathways [6]. Therefore, know-
ing what motivates people with different individual character-
istics can help us in better supporting a diverse community.
This brings us to our ﬁnal (two-part) research question:
RQ3a: How does motivation to contribute differ for diverse
characteristics?
RQ3b: How do shifts in motivation differ for diverse charac-
teristics?
To answer our research questions, we conducted an online
survey, revisiting the questions used to measure motivation in
three seminal papers: Hars and Ou [3], Lakhani and Wolf [2],
and Ghosh et al. [7]. The responses from 242 OSS contributors
indicate that indeed motivation has shifted as OSS has matured
and that individuals’ motivations evolve as they contribute
to OSS. As V on Krogh et al. [8] famously reported “it is10462021 IEEE/ACM 43rd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)
1558-1225/21/$31.00 ©2021 IEEE
DOI 10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00098
not the immediate and isolated outcome that matters (the
carrot), but how the individual subjectively holds outcomes
and actions to be consistent over time (the journey toward the
end of the rainbow).” Understanding what motivates people
should include not only the immediate carrots, but also the
larger quest of an individual as they continue to grow and
reach for the pot of gold at the end of their journey. A
deeper understanding of motivation and satisfaction can help
OSS projects in identifying strategies to lower contributor
turnover and improve productivity, as identiﬁed by literature
on motivation in software engineering [9, 10, 11, 12]. We hope
that our insights on the shifting state of motivation help our
research community create more nuanced approaches to attract
and support a diverse set of contributors to OSS.
II. R ELATED WORK
Motivation has been a frequently studied topic in software
engineering—a systematic literature review found 92 papers
on this topic published until 2006 [9]. In 2010, this literature
review was updated to add 53 additional papers [10]. The
literature shows that proper management of motivation and
satisfaction helps software organizations achieve higher levels
of productivity, avoid turnover, budget overﬂows, and delivery
delays [9, 10, 11]. Sharp et al. [12] provide a comprehensive
overview of the motivation models used in software engineer-
ing and propose a new model by leveraging previous results
from the literature. More recently, Sach et al. [13] analyzed
data from interviews with 13 professional software engineers
and suggested that there has been a trend toward more socially-
oriented motivators in software engineering. Other works, such
as Franc ¸a et al. [14], found a variety of factors that inﬂuence
work motivation and job performance in the software industry.
However, motivation in software industry settings may
not necessarily apply to OSS [15]. OSS contributors have
a high degree of autonomy, intrinsic motivation, and self-
determination [15].
Motivation to contribute to OSS was extensively studied in
the early 2000s. Many researchers were intrigued that high-
quality OSS was developed volunteerly by qualiﬁed, young,
motivated individuals [16]. Hars and Ou [3], Ghosh et al.
[7], and Lakhani and Wolf [2] conducted broad web-based
surveys to collect motivations of OSS contributors in a two-
year period from 2000-2002. Other surveys from the early
2000s focused on speciﬁc communities such as Linux [17]
and Apache [18, 15]. Since these initial surveys, which are
still considered state-of-the-art, researchers conducted stud-
ies focused on speciﬁc communities [19, 20, 21]. Other
researchers focused on the motivation of speciﬁc contributor
proﬁles, such as newcomers [22], one-time code contributors
[23], quasi-contributors [24], and students [25]. Researchers
also investigated the relation between motivation and other
constructs, like retention [26], task effort [27], intention to
contribute [28], and participation level [29]. Speciﬁc types of
motivations were also investigated [30, 31].
V on Krogh et al. [8] surveyed the literature to aggregate
the studies about motivation in OSS published until 2009.They identiﬁed ten motivation categories, grouped as intrin-
sic, internalized-extrinsic, and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation
moves the person to act for the fun or challenge entailed
rather than in response to external pressures or rewards [32]. In
contrast, extrinsic motivations are based on outside incentives
when people change their actions due to an external interven-
tion [33]. Developers can also internalize extrinsic motivators
in a way that they are perceived as self-regulating behavior
rather than external impositions [34, 15]. These internalized
extrinsic motivations include reputation, reciprocity, learning,
and own-use.
Essentially, the broad research about motivation was con-
ducted before the professionalization of open-source devel-
opment, the increasing involvement of corporations, and the
rise of social coding platforms. Much of the work focused
on SourceForge—GitHub was launched in 2008 and became
the dominant open-source hosting site around 2012 [35].
Therefore, it is time to revisit, replicate, and extend previous
research on motivation to contribute to OSS. Furthermore,
investigating the shift of motivation, which is core in our study,
was not the focus of any previous work.
III. R ESEARCH METHOD
To answer our research questions, we administered an online
survey to OSS contributors. In the following subsections, we
describe our approach and instrumentation.
A. Selection of previous surveys
To select prior surveys to help design our study, we
searched for broad surveys with a high number of citations
on Google Scholar, and selected the surveys conducted by
Lakhani and Wolf [2] (2028 citations) and Hars and Ou [3]
(1696 citations)—the search was conducted in May 2020.
We also included the survey conducted by Ghosh et al. [7],
as it was performed during the same period as the others
but collected a signiﬁcantly higher number of respondents
(2784; compared to 684 and 81, respectively). We searched
for complementary information that was not available in the
manuscripts, such as full instruments, data sets, and technical
reports with more details about the studies. Additionally, we
wrote to the previous surveys’ authors asking for additional
information; however, we did not receive an answer.
B. Identiﬁcation of similar questions
As we wanted to compare our results to the previous surveys
but did not want to ask the participants redundant questions,
the next step of our method was identifying similar questions.
We used negotiated agreement [36] to group questions (or
categories in the case of [3]) that could be considered similar.
For example, we grouped “Peer Recognition” (Hars), “En-
hance reputation in F/OSS community” (Lakhani), and “Get a
reputation in OS/FS community” (Ghosh). Three researchers
experienced in qualitative methods and OSS performed the ini-
tial grouping of the questions. They leveraged the description
provided in the original papers and supplementary materials
to disambiguate the meaning of the motivation factors and
1047questions. They kept meeting and discussing until reaching an
agreement. After that, four other researchers (three academic
and one practitioner) validated the grouping. We ended up with
20 questions extracted from the previous surveys.
C. Deﬁnition of motivation factors
After identifying similar questions, we decided to group
them into higher-level constructs to narrow down the anal-
ysis. To the best of our knowledge, the literature review
conducted by V on Krogh et al. [8] is the most comprehensive
investigation of motivation in OSS, since they aggregated
motivation factors found in 40 primary studies published until
2009. Therefore, we employed this work as our theoretical
framework to guide our analysis. In it, the authors grouped the
motivation factors in ten main categories, namely, Ideology,
Altruism, Kinship, Fun, Reputation, Reciprocity, Learning,
Own-Use, Career, and Pay. To map the questions to the
categories, we followed the same process described in the
previous step. When grouping the items, we noticed that the
items did not completely cover the Fun category. To cover this
gap, we added one question to represent this category to our
set: “I have fun writing programs.” Therefore, our motivation
questionnaire ended up with 21 items, listed in Table III.
After the informed consent, we asked two open questions
about motivation to contribute to OSS. The goal was to
collect spontaneous answers before presenting participants
with the list of motivation factors. To understand the shift in
motivation (RQ2), we asked participants why they ﬁrst began
and then continued contributing: (i) “What motivated you
to start contributing to Free/Open Source Software (F/OSS)
projects?” and (ii) “Why do you continue contributing to
F/OSS projects?” As V on Krogh et al. [8]’s literature review
considered only papers published until 2009, these open ques-
tions also helped us to evaluate to what extent the categories
proposed by V on Krogh et al. [8] cover current OSS contrib-
utors’ motivations to contribute.
1) Likert-scale questions: On a new page, we presented the
21 items from the previous step to identify the contributors’
motivations. We presented each item as an option to com-
plement the sentence “I contribute to F/OSS because...” The
items followed a 5-point Likert-scale (from “Strongly agree” to
“Strongly disagree” with a neutral option) and “I’m not sure.”
The list of items was randomized for each respondent to avoid
ordering bias. The exact question wording is provided in our
supplementary material.1We also added an attention check
item (“This is a veriﬁcation question, please answer Strongly
Agree.”) and a question to collect other potential motivations
not covered by the items (“Are there any other reasons for
contributing to F/OSS that we haven’t covered above?”).
2) Demographics: The last part of the survey comprised
demographic questions: project(s) they contribute to the most;
time since the ﬁrst contribution; initial and current ﬁnancial
relationship to OSS (paid/unpaid); initial and current type of
contributions; main occupation; gender identity; country of
origin and residence; and age.
1https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4453904All questions were optional to increase the response rate,
by making respondents more comfortable [37]. Moreover, to
encourage participation, we offered the participants a chance
to enter a rafﬂe for US$100. To enter the rafﬂe case, they
needed to provide an email address at the end of the survey.
After it was proofread by all researchers and tested in
multiple browsers and devices, we invited seven participants to
pilot the survey so we could collect feedback and measure the
time to answer. No modiﬁcation of the survey was necessary,
and we discarded these initial answers.
D. Recruitment
Similar to previous surveys, we opted for a broad distri-
bution of our survey. We avoided scraping email addresses
from software repositories because this practice has been
condemned by OSS communities [38] and can violate the
terms of service of the platforms and some regional data
protection laws. Instead, we focused on increasing the number
of responses and the sample’s diversity by employing several
strategies. First, we formed an international and diverse team
of researchers, who are originally from South America (4),
Europe (3), and Asia (1) and were working, at the time of
this study, in North America (5), Europe (1), South America
(1), and Australia (1). Seven researchers work in academia
with extensive experience with OSS, and one researcher is
a practitioner working in an OSS company. The researchers
sent direct messages to their contacts and posted ads on social
network websites.
Second, we advertised the survey on social media sites,
namely, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, LinkedIn, and Hackernews.
To reach a broader audience, we paid to promote our posts on
Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit. These sites are largely used by
our target population [39, 40, 41]. When the site allowed, we
also shared our posts to groups related to OSS development.
Finally, we asked our personal contacts to share our posts and
distribute our message (for example, on Twitter, our posts were
retweeted more than 200 times).
The survey was available between June 4 and July 24,
2020. We received 247 non-blank answers and, after ﬁltering
the data (as detailed in the next subsection), we ended up
with 242 valid responses. The link posted on Twitter was the
origin of almost half (46%) of our answers. The link that we
sent to our contacts (which they probably forwarded to their
colleagues as we requested) was the origin of 19% of the
answers. Links posted on OSS-related discussion lists (14%)
and Reddit (10%) were also a common origin of our responses.
E. Filtering
We ﬁltered our data to consider only valid responses. We
dropped answers that failed the attention question (4 cases) and
checked for answers with the same choice for all Likert scale
questions (0 removed). We then analyzed the time to complete
the survey to remove lower outliers (0 removed). We manually
inspected the open text questions, looking for senseless and
inappropriate answers (1 removed). Then, we ﬁltered our
data looking for potential duplicate participation, even though
1048the survey platform (Qualtrics) has mechanisms to prevent
multiples responses from the same participant. We started
looking for identical and similar emails (0 removed). Finally,
since this study’s target population comprises OSS project
contributors, we also inspected the answers to the question
about years of experience in OSS to ﬁlter answers from
participants with no experience (0 removed). After applying
all the ﬁlters, we ended up with 242 valid responses.
F . Data analysis
1) Likert-scale questions: We used the Likert-scale items to
compare our results to the previous surveys (RQ1). We ranked
the questions based on the number of respondents who agreed
to each motivation (checking “Agree” or “Strongly Agree”).
We then compared each previous papers’ ranking with a
corresponding ranking of our answers, built by excluding the
items that did not match those from the previous study. We
detail this analysis in Section V-A.
2) Open questions: To address RQ2 and RQ3, we analyzed
the answers to the open questions about motivation to start and
to continue contributing. We categorized the answers based on
a card sorting approach [42]. We used the categories from
V on Krogh et al. [8] (see Section III-C) as a seed to the
classiﬁcation. We discarded four responses that left blank the
answers about their “motivation to start” and “motivation to
keep contributing.” However, we kept two cases in which
respondents provided motivations only for one of them (the
motivation to start in both cases).
The whole process was conducted using continuous com-
parison [43] and discussion until reaching consensus. To
include an outside view, we invited a researcher who had not
participated in the method’s initial steps to pair with one of the
previous researchers. These two researchers jointly analyzed
two sets of 20 answers to establish common ground, discussing
the applied codes. Then, each researcher analyzed the remain-
ing answers independently and discussed the disagreements
until reaching consensus. Finally, a third researcher inspected
the classiﬁcation. Table I presents representative examples for
each category.
During this process, we decided to include two new cate-
gories that did not ﬁt well in V on Krogh et al. [8]’s classiﬁca-
tion: “GSoC (Google Summer of Code)” and“Coursework. ”
The literature about joining OSS via GSoC and course assign-
ments suggests that there are multiple motivations associated
with these reasons to participate [25, 44, 45].
3) Segment analysis: To analyze how the reported moti-
vation differ according to individual characteristics, we seg-
mented our sample based on experience in OSS (experienced:
fourth quartile, 15 years of experience vs. novices: ﬁrst
quartile, 3 years of experience), age (older: median,
35 years old vs. younger: <median, 35 years old), and role
(coder: ‘code developer’ or ‘code reviewer’ as one of the top-3
activities vs. non-coder: other activities).
G. Replication package
A comprehensive replication package including our
anonymized dataset, instruments, and scripts is stored in theZenodo2open data archive.
IV. P ARTICIPANT DEMOGRAPHICS
Our survey received 242 valid answers. In the following, we
report the demographics of the respondents. No questions were
mandatory, so not all categories sum to 242. The demographics
are presented in Table II.
We received answers from residents of ﬁve different con-
tinents with a broad age distribution. The majority are men
(82%) and coders (81%) matching previously reported distri-
butions of OSS contributors [46, 47].
The population is also diverse in terms of the projects to
which they contribute. The respondents reported contributing,
for example, to the Linux kernel, KDE, Debian, Kubernetes,
LibreOfﬁce, Mozilla, PHP, Laravel, Drupal, Debian, Tensor-
Flow, Apache projects, Firefox, Homebrew, Arduino, Eclipse,
Joomla, Django, WordPress, JavaScript libraries, Python li-
braries, and R packages. The projects are diverse in pro-
gramming languages, age, community size, organization, and
governance model.
Regarding the ﬁnancial relationship with OSS, most respon-
dents reported being unpaid, and only 26% reported that they
receive at least some money to work with OSS. On average,
the respondents spend 10 hours per week (min=<1 hour,
median=5, max=60) and have 9 years of experience with OSS
(min=1 year, median=8, max=30).
V. R ESULTS
A. RQ1a: What motivates contributors to OSS today?
Figure 1 shows the answers to the Likert-scale items about
what motivates OSS contributors, grouped as per V on Krogh
et al. [8]’s categories.
Figure 1 shows agreement among participants that intrinsic
motivations, especially, Fun, Altruism, and Kinship, are key
motivations—on average 91%, 85%, and 80% of the respon-
dents agree (or strongly agree) that they contribute to OSS due
to these motivations. This is reﬂected in P164’s excitement
of contributing to OSS: “Discovered Linux and open source
in general when I was a student in the 90s. Sending a patch
across the ocean just seemed very exciting” and P30’s altruistic
vision: “To spread knowledge, which I think that contributes
to make a society better ”.
Internalized-extrinsic motivations—Learning and Reci-
procity—are also important factors. An impressive 93% of
respondents (Figure 1(G)) agreed that they contribute because
OSS allows them to learn and improve their skills, as P75
explained: “I continued contributing to OSS projects because
it was a good source for learning new things.”
Extrinsic factors like Career and Pay, paint a contrasting
picture. While 67% participants agree that OSS presents
opportunity for professional growth (with only 11% disagree-
ment, Figure1(I)), only 28% mention payment as a motivation
(61% and 53% disagreeing with Q20 and Q21, respectively,
Figure 1(J)).

Altruism “[...] to support other FOSS contributors” (P25); “To spread knowledge” (P30); “to make the world better” (P2)
Fun “Because I enjoy coding” (P69); “hobbyism” (P49); “Because it’s fun” (P148).
Kinship“I liked the idea of collaborating with strangers on a project” (P47) ; “The community around the software library is very inclusive”
(P171)
Reputation “to improve my reputation” (P21); “I saw F/OSS as a way to gain recognition” (P90); “recognition” (P76)
Reciprocity“I beneﬁt from it. It seemed right to to give back. ” (P48); “I use the open source software, it’s also great to contribute” (P67); “I
publish, and use, F/OSS projects daily, so that’s just my duty [to give back]. ” (P77)
Learning“A good source for learning new things” (P75); “learn from experienced developers from industry” (P149); “Learn new things from
different people” (P182)
Own-use“To help to improve software I used” (P109); “I wanted to solve problems that existed for me as a user” (P132); “I end up tweaking the
projects that I contribute for my own purposes” (P149)
Career “Create a good public portfolio which can be good in hiring” (P75); “I can put it on my CV” (P240); “building a curriculum” (P215)
Pay “Because I get paid to continue to contribute” (P132); “Motivated by employer” (P195); “I received a stipend to begin” (P137)
GSoC “I found the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program and began contributing” (P45); “A summer internship (GSoC)” (P27)
Coursework “In a college course . . . students were encouraged to make contributions” (P230); ”a university class about F/OSS” (P150)
Finally, some of the original motivations for contributing to
OSS—Ideology &Own-Use—show mixed responses. Some
aspects of ideology, such as opposing large companies and
proprietary software, were not as popular as other motivations,
which could be a result of large companies’ recent embrace
of OSS. On the other hand, the philosophy that source code
should be open still remains strong (80%, Figure 1(A)). As
P140 said “I believe in the free software philosophy.”
Own-Use, is a mixed bag. “Scratch your own itch” was a keyrallying call in the early days of OSS and is still a motivating
factor for some, as P140 said: “I contribute for my own
purposes.” However, the sentiment has changed. The two own-
use questions with the biggest difference in opinions are Q18
and Q16 in Figure 1(H). Q18 relates to people seeking help
from the community to realize their idea. While about 32%
ﬁnd this to be the case, a larger majority 61% show people
joining existing communities. Interestingly, about 63% ﬁnd
proprietary software to be limited (Q16), at least in providing

with OSS we can ﬁx our own bugs.”
Motivations to Contribute: Intrinsic and internalized
motivations explain what drives most of the contributors
today. On the extrinsic end, Career is relevant to many
contributors, contrary to Paywhich only explains why less
than one-third of the respondents contribute to OSS.
B. RQ1b: How has motivation to contribute shifted as OSS
has matured?
To analyze the shifts in motivation in relation to previous
surveys, we do not directly compare the percentages since each
survey measured or aggregated the data in slightly different
ways. For example, Lakhani and Wolf [2] report the percentage
of individuals based on their top three motivations, whereas
Hars and Ou [3] report the percentages of the individuals who
ranked high or very high on each motivation subcategories. To
provide a basis for comparison, we pairwise compare relative
rankings considering exclusively those questions that appear
in both surveys, generating one relative ranking of our results
for each comparison (Table Table III). For each previous study,
we compare the ranking extracted from the original paper to
a relative ranking of our results, which excludes the questions
not present in the previous study being compared.
Results show social aspects have gained considerable im-
portance. Deeply enjoying helping others (Q6) was ranked inthe7thposition in Hars et al.’s survey and 2ndin our relative
ranking. Kinship (Q9) ascended in the ranking from the 6th
to3rdplace when we compare to Hars et al., and from 7th
to3rdcompared to Lakhani et al.’s results. These questions
were not asked in Ghosh et al.’s survey.
There was also a shift in the relative importance of Reputa-
tion(Q11). This motivation was ranked 10th(last) in Lakhani
et al. and 11th(second to the last) in Ghosh et al., and moved
up to the ﬁrst half of our relative rankings: 5thand 6th,
respectively. However, the same trend does not hold when
comparing to Hars et al.
There was a change in the opposite direction for the
motivations related to “scratch one’s own itch” (Own-Use).
The question related to needing the software was ranked 4th
in Hars et al. and 7thin our relative ranking. In relation to
Lakhani et al., needing the software to work was ranked 3rd
and for non-work purposes was ranked 4th; in our relative
ranking these items dropped to 7thand9th, respectively.
Several motivations are consistently top-ranked in all sur-
veys. Learning (Q13) was ranked ﬁrst in our survey, Hars
et al.’s, and Ghosh et al.’s rankings—whereas it was ranked
2ndin Lakhani et al’s. Intellectual stimulation (Q8) (2ndin
our overall ranking), sharing knowledge and skills (Q4) (3rd
in our overall ranking), participating in the OSS scene (Q10)
(5thin our overall ranking), and belief that source code should
be open (Q1) (5thin our overall ranking) were also top ranked
in previous surveys.
Alternatively, we can observe that ﬁnancial reward (being
paid to contribute and selling products and services) was
bottom-ranked for all surveys.
Shifting motivations through time: Some motivations to
contribute to OSS have stood the test of time: learning, fun,
knowledge sharing, and a belief that source code should be
open—all core tenets of OSS. Others have seen a marked
difference. Social aspects (e.g., altruism, kinship, and rep-
utation) have gone up in the ranking, whereas participating
in OSS to “scratch one’s own itch” has dropped.
C. RQ2: How does motivation to contribute to OSS shift as
OSS contributors gain tenure?
To analyze the shift in motivation from the perspective of the
contributors, we asked two open-ended questions about what
motivated them to start contributing and why they continued
to contribute. We qualitatively analyzed the answers using
V on Krogh et al. [8]’s categories as seeds, following the
procedures described in Section III-F2.
Figure 2 shows how the motivations of our respondents
shifted and Table IV shows how often each motivation was
cited as a reason to start and to continue contributing. Fun
was mentioned by more participants (18.9%) as a reason to
continue than to start (9.2%). The frequency of mentions to
Altruism also increased, from 18.0% to 26.7%. Reputation,
Kinship, and Reciprocity also had noticeable increases. Finally,
we noticed that Paywas a more common reason to continue
than to join, shifting from 12.4% to 16.6%.

*Our ranking is recalculated for each comparison considering only the questions that are common to both surveys. We highlight the cells in which the motivation changed from
one half to the other with a minimum difference of three positions.
On the opposite side, Own-Use experienced the largest
drop (decreasing from 29.0% to 21.7%). Ideology also lost
positions, decreasing from 13% to 9%. Summer of code
programs andCoursework also were more common reasons
to start than to continue contributing.
In terms of individual migrations, the contributors who
joined motivated by Own-Use commonly migrated to intrin-
sic and internalized extrinsic motivations—Altruism (20.3%),
Learning (20.3%), Fun (18.8%), and Reciprocity (15.6%).
Similarly, 43% of those who started because of Pay(extrinsic)
migrated to internalized motivations, and 61% of those who
started because of Career (extrinsic) migrated to intrinsic or
internalized motivations. The same happened for Summer of
Code Programs and Coursework. Finally, those who started
in OSS because of Ideology migrated to Reciprocity (20%),
Altruism (16.7%), and Pay(16.7%). The full list of migration
ﬂows is available in the supplementary material.
Shifting motivations in self-journeys: Contributing to
OSS often transforms extrinsic motivations to intrinsic
ones. Whereas ideology, own-use or education-related pro-
grams can be an impetus to join OSS, individuals con-
tinue for intrinsic reasons (fun, altruism, reputation, and
kinship).
D. RQ3a: How does motivation to contribute differ for diverse
characteristics?
Table V presents the odds ratio for different subgroups
of respondents reporting each motivation factor as a rea-
son to continue contributing to OSS (survey open question).
Experienced developers have higher odds to report Altruism
(5.6x), Pay(5.2x), and Ideology (4.6x) than novices. On the
other hand, novices have greater odds to report Career (10x),
Learning (5.5x), and Fun (2.5x).
Fig. 2. Motivation migration ﬂow. The size of the boxes on the left represents
the number of contributors with the motivation to start, and on the right to
continue, contributing to OSS. The width of the connections is proportional
to the number of contributors who shifted from one motivation to the other.
The odds that contributors who are 35 years or older report
PayandAltruism are 4.1x and 2.1x higher than for younger
contributors. Respondents younger than 35 have higher odds
to report Learning (3.3x) as a reason to contribute.
The odds of Fun motivating coders were 4x higher than
non-coders. Still, non-coders have higher odds of mentioning
Ideology (2.5x) as a motivator, probably because of the type
of activity (e.g., “advocates and evangelists”).

Note: Odds ratio greater than 1 means that the ﬁrst segment has greater chances of

motivations were coded from the survey open questions.
Individual characteristics affect motivations: Social and
philosophical factors (such as Ideology and Altruism) as
well as Payare reported more often by experienced devel-
opers, whereas professional factors (e.g., Career ),Learn-
ing, and Fun are more common among novices.
E. RQ3b: How do shifts in motivation to contribute differ for
diverse characteristics?
To understand how shifts in motivation relate to individual
characteristics, we segmented the data from Table IV (reasons
for starting to contribute and reasons for continuing to con-
tribute as reported in the survey open questions). Table VI
shows the result of this segment analysis.
There was a considerable increase (120%) in Altruism for
experienced respondents (15 years of experience in OSS),
and a steady number (if not a slight decrease) for novices
(3 years of experience). The low number of novices whostarted because of Altruism is also noticeable. The same trends
are observed when analyzing the respondents’ age.
Paywas also a common reason to continue for experienced
respondents. On the other hand, just a few young respondents
joined OSS because of Career, but many of them shifted
towards this motivation—the number doubled when analyzing
Career as a reason to continue. Fun also retains more young
and novice contributors than older and experienced ones.
We also segmented the data according to the contributors’
role. More coders shifted their motivations than non-coders.
The only case where we observed a higher increase for non-
coders (88%) was for Altruism. An interesting ﬁnding here is
that none of the non-coders mentioned Career as a reason to
join OSS, but two continued because of this motivation. On
the other hand, the decreases in Ideology andOwn-Use were
more common for coders.
Finally, we analyzed the differences by continents. Overall,
the shift in motivation was similar for North Americans, South
Americans, and Europeans (we did not analyze the other
continents due to their low number of responses). We found
more noticeable differences for the shifts to intrinsic motives:
Altruism, Fun, and Reciprocity, which were bigger for North
Americans (54%, 400%, 100%) than for Europeans (22%,
110%, 21%) and South Americans (25%, 200%, 25%).
Shifting motivations in demographics: Shifts in motiva-
tion as individuals continue to contribute are similar across
demographics. One notable difference is in experience; ex-
perienced contributors continue because of PayorAltruism;
but novices pursue for Career.
VI. D ISCUSSION
We used V on Krogh et al. [8]’s work as our theoretical
framework to analyze our data. V on Krogh et al. [8] reviewed
the literature published until 2009 (40 primary studies). While
analyzing the responses to our open questions (more than 200
answers per question), the ten categories proposed in their
work were adequate for coding the reported motivations. The
few exceptions were Google Summer of Code and Course-
work, with a few mentions each. Summer of code programs
intend to attract contributors to OSS, and joining such pro-
grams involves several motivations, such as money, reputation,
learning, and intellectual stimulation [44, 45]. Contribution to
OSS has also been investigated as a way to foster learning
and attract new contributors [48, 45]. Next, we discuss some
of the key ﬁndings in our survey results.
Scratching one’s own itch is not as big. We observed
a relative decrease of Own-Use, both when comparing to
prior surveys and analyzing the contributors’ shifts, regardless
of their individual characteristic. Those who joined OSS for
Own-Use-related reasons often shifted to Altruism, Learning,
Fun, and Reciprocity, i.e., intrinsic/internalized motivations.
Therefore, we could observe that intrinsic motivations have
gained importance as OSS matured.
Learning is still a strong motivator. Learning continues
to be a top motivator—it was top-ranked in ours and in prior

*In each cell, the number on the left represents the number of responses mentioning the motivation as a reason to start while the number on the right, as a reason to continue.
We excluded from the table the GSoC andCoursework categories due to the limited number of respondents. We also excluded the continents and genders for which we had few
responses. We highlight in blue /red those cases in which we observed an increase/decrease of at least 25% when comparing the second number (motivation to continue) in
relation to the ﬁrst (motivation to start) and at least 3 individuals.
surveys. In fact, it was ranked as the second most mentioned
motivation to join and the ﬁrst to continue. This shift towards
learning was observed for all individual characteristics except
for experienced contributors. It is reasonable to expect that
highly-experienced contributors ( 15 years) are core mem-
bers who beneﬁt less in terms of learning, but continue to
contribute because they are paid or can help others.
Payment and money are still not pervasive. We expected
ﬁnancial reward to be a common motivation considering
the increased involvement of industry [49]. However, it was
bottom-ranked in our results. Nevertheless, as one could
expect, the shift to this motivation was more common for
experienced contributors.
There is a shift from extrinsic motivations to intrinsic
ones. Our results align with self-determination theory [50],
which helps to understand the dominant role intrinsic moti-
vation plays. Schmidt et al. [51] argue that individuals have
a natural tendency to strive for a balance of externally-
rewarded labor and intrinsically-rewarding leisure. Research
shows that after an initial extrinsically motivated and chal-
lenging endeavor, motivation may shift towards a reward-
ing and intrinsically motivated task [52]. Franc ¸a et al. [14]
show that motivation and job characteristics (e.g., pay and
recognition) directly inﬂuence happiness and job satisfaction,
which affects the intention to stay. According to these authors,
although work motivation and job satisfaction are distinct, they
are closely connected via a feedback loop, through a self-
regulation process [53]. Our results reﬂect this movement, with
OSS contributors shifting their motivation towards intrinsic or
internalized factors.
Experienced members’ motivations shifted towards al-
truism and social interaction. Our results are also in line with
Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (SST), which proposes
that with age, the relative importance of goals shifts as a
function of future time perspective [54, 55]. According to
this theory, younger adults focus more on future-oriented and
horizon-expanding goals, like acquiring knowledge, whereasolder adults focus more on present-oriented and emotionally
meaningful goals such as maintaining high quality social
bonds [56]. Indeed, our older and experienced respondents
often shifted their motivation to Altruism-related motives. On
the other hand, younger adults and novices gravitate towards
self-related motivations.
Therefore, improving social aspects of the tools and projects
can help retain developers as they age and become more
experienced. Indeed, our study found that social aspects, such
as helping others and working in teams, gained considerable
relative importance compared to surveys from the early 2000s.
Our results are also consistent with the ﬁndings from Sach
et al. [13], who reported ‘people’ as a common motivator.
The emergence3of social coding platforms [57] may explain
this shift. These platforms offer a variety of social features
and helped change the culture of OSS from a hacker-oriented
group to a collaborative community, with lower barriers to
entry and better support for newcomers [58, 59].
Novices want to promote their career with OSS. Our
results also show that young and novice contributors often
shift their motivation towards Reputation and other career-
related motivations. This may relate to the new landscape of
OSS [49, 1], in which companies are key players. Moreover,
novices may use their OSS contribution history as a portfolio,
and potential employers are increasingly referring to online
contributions when making hiring decisions [60].
A. Implications and Future Work
To OSS Projects and Tool Builders: Experienced con-
tributors often shift their motivation towards Altruism, valuing
present-oriented and emotionally meaningful goals, such as
maintaining high-quality social bonds. OSS projects willing
to retain these experienced contributors, who tend to be core
members or maintainers, could invest in strategies and tools
showing how their work beneﬁts the community and society,
such as who uses the developed features.
3https://octoverse.github.com/
1054In response to the increased rank of “I deeply enjoy helping
others” (Q6 in Table III), GitHub and other platforms could
offer social features to pair those needing help with those
willing to help, highlight when a contributor helped someone,
and make it easier to show appreciation to others (similar
to stars given to projects). Projects and tool builders should
also continue to facilitate collaboration and awareness [61], in
response to the increased relevance of “I like to work with
this (these) development team(s)” (Q9 in Table III).
To attract and retain novices, who might become the future
workforce, projects could invest in promoting Career, Fun,
Kinship, and Learning, which are particularly relevant for
novices and young contributors (see RQ3a/b). Mentors can
leverage these motivation factors to design or adapt speciﬁc
strategies [62, 63]. Tools like Visual Resume [64] can help
novices promote their career by building their portfolios based
on their contributions. Non-coders also play important roles
in OSS communities [6] and their motivation also shifted
towards Career after joining. Their contributions should also
be recognized in these enhanced portfolios. Current developer
proﬁle aggregators based on OSS data still focus on program-
ming alone, e.g., conceptualizing skills in terms of a list of
programming languages [65]. Adding non-coder contributions
to such aggregators would be an important step towards
recognizing a more diverse set of contributions.
Although diversity positively impacts OSS projects, most of
the contemporary OSS projects lack diversity [66]. It is impor-
tant for OSS projects to understand and support contributors
with different motivations.
OSS communities may also invest in extrinsic motivation
initiatives to attract contributors. This will pay off, since
we observed that contributors will often progressively shift
toward intrinsic motivations. In that sense, Coursework and
summers of code programs can be interesting doorways for
OSS; therefore, communities should put effort into welcoming
students and applying to programs like GSoC.
To Educators: Employers increasingly refer to online con-
tributions when making hiring decisions. OSS offers great
potential to train the next generation of professionals [64].
Young and novice contributors often shift towards profession-
ally important motivations, such as Reputation and Career.
Educators should offer coursework related to contributing to
OSS and discuss contribution to OSS as part of software
engineering training.
To Researchers: Motivation shifts have been poorly inves-
tigated in the OSS literature. Previous research has shown that
motivation affects behavior, task effort, retention, and partici-
pation level. Further research is necessary to understand how
the motivation shifts that we identiﬁed impact these constructs
as well as disengagement and career trajectories. Researchers
can replicate our study and further explore our data, which
has been made available in our replication package. Finally,
future studies can investigate the reasons behind the shifts and
trends we observed.B. Threats to Validity
Sampling bias. In our case, random sampling is not viable,
since there is no single list of all OSS contributors. We com-
bined multiple strategies to reach a broad and diverse sample,
as explained in Section III-D. As described in Section IV, we
achieved a diverse population in terms of countries, projects,
contribution roles, etc. Although the distribution of countries
resembles the distribution of OSS contributions, there is a
risk of a country bias. In terms of countries, USA (58) was
dominant in North America (70), while Germany (23), UK
(19), and Spain (18) are the most represented in Europe (100).
We also have a small low number of women and non-binary
respondents, which mirrors our population’s characteristic
lack of diversity [66]. Furthermore, we acknowledge that our
sample may be biased in unknown ways, and our results are
only valid for our respondents.
Sample size. We answered RQ3 by segmenting the dataset
to analyze motivations and their shifts. In doing so, the dataset
gets divided into smaller groups which could pose a challenge
for statistical analysis. However, the group sizes we have (at
least 15 responses per group) are sufﬁcient for the conservative
Fisher’s Exact Test [67], the underlying signiﬁcance test used
in the odds ratio analysis (RQ3a). In the descriptive analysis
(RQ3b), we highlight only the most expressive shifts (those
changing at least 25%).
Response biases. As in any survey method, our work can
have recall bias—respondents answer only what they recall
and not necessarily what was most important to them in the
past. Recency and salience can also affect the respondents’
answers. We aimed to reduce priming respondents with spe-
ciﬁc motivation factors by ﬁrst presenting them with open
questions, which allowed us to collect spontaneous answers.
Survivability bias. We focused our study on current OSS
contributors. The motivations of those who tried but aban-
doned contributing may differ.
Self-selection bias. Participants decided whether they
wanted to participate in the survey, and this may have inﬂu-
enced our results. Although most international OSS projects
adopt English as their primary language, the language of the
instrument may have inﬂuenced the willingness to participate
of non-native speakers. Future studies might translate our
survey and investigate regional differences.
Inappropriate participation. As described in Section III-E,
we employed several ﬁltering and inspecting strategies to
reduce the possibility of redundant participation and fake data;
however, it is not possible to claim that our data is completely
free of this threat.
Construct validity. To enhance construct validity, we based
our survey on previous instruments. However, these instru-
ments were not formally validated and may inadequately mea-
sure a given motivation. To mitigate this threat, we employed
pilot studies to test and collect feedback about our instrument.
Subjectivity. We employed qualitative procedures to clas-
sify the answers to the open questions and map questions from
the previous surveys. These procedures are subject to subjec-
tivity/interpretation bias. To mitigate this threat, we employed
1055multiple researchers with diverse backgrounds, constant com-
parison, and negotiated agreement. All the researchers have
extensive experience both in qualitative methods and OSS.
VII. C ONCLUSION
The “sands of motivations” shift over time and differ across
demographics. To answer our research questions, we employed
one of the most comprehensive surveys about motivation in
OSS, encompassing questions from three seminal studies.
Results show that social aspects, such as helping others,
teamwork, and reputation have gained importance, while some
intrinsic or internalized motivations are still prevalent, such as
Learning, Fun, and Altruism. Interestingly, OSS contributors
often join because of extrinsic factors, but continue because
of intrinsic factors.
OSS projects can leverage our results to devise and review
strategies to support each person to achieve their goals, result-
ing in more people engaging in OSS communities. Our results
also shed light on the association between demographics and
motivations, which, as fostering diversity is highly relevant to
OSS communities, is important to consider in further research.
