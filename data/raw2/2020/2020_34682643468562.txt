1 INTRODUCTION
More than ever, online communication platforms, such as Gitter,
Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangout, and Freenode, play a
fundamental role in team communications and collaboration. As
one type of synchronous textual communication among a commu-
nity of developers, live chat allows developers to receive real-time
responses from others, replacing asynchronous communication
like emails in some cases [ 40,58,59]. This is especially true for
open source projects that are contributed by globally distributed
developers, aswellasfor manycompaniesallowing developers to
workfromhomeduetotheCOVID-19pandemic.Conversations
from online communication platforms contain rich information for
studying developer behaviors. Figure 1exemplifies a slice of live
chatlogfromthe Deeplearning4j Gittercommunity.Eachutterance
consists of a timestamp, developer ID, and a textual message. In

Despite that a few empirical studies started to advocate the use-
fulnessoftheconversationsforunderstandingdeveloperbehaviors
[40,59,67], little focuses on how and what the developers commu-
nicate in live chat. The most related research is reported by Shihab
etal.[58]onInternetRelayChattoanalyzecontent,participants,
and styles of communications. However, their subjects are IRC
meeting logs, which are different in many aspects from developer
livechatconversations.AnotherthreadofrelatedworkbyParra

withthepurposeofhighlightingthatlivedevelopercommunica-

In this paper, we conduct a first comprehensive empirical study
ondevelopers’livechatonGitter,investigatingfourcharacteristics:
whentheyinteract(communicationprofile),whatcommunitystruc-
tureslooklike(communitystructure),whichtopicsarediscussed
(discussiontopic),andhowtheyinteract(interactionpattern).To
that end, we first collect a large scale of developer daily chat from
eight popular communities. Then we manually disentangle 749
dialogs, and select the best disentanglement model from four state-
of-the-artmodelsaccordingtotheirevaluationresultsonthe749

The main results include: (1) Developers are more likely to chat on

2 BACKGROUND
This section describes relatedkey concepts andtechnologies.
2.1 The GitterPlatform
Many OSS communities utilize Gitter [ 31] or Slack [ 32] as their
live communication means. In particular, Gitter is currently the
mostpopularonlinecommunicationplatform[ 37]sinceitprovides
open access to public chat rooms and free access to historical data
[49]. Considering the popular, open, and free access nature, we
conduct this study based on Gitter2. Communities in Gitter usu-
allyhavemultiplechattingrooms:onegeneralroomandseveral
specific-topic rooms. Typically, the general room contains most of
the participants. In this study, we only focus on the general rooms.
In total, there are 2,171 communities in Gitter that can be publicly
accessed.Thetotalnumberofparticipantsofthe2,171communities
is733,535 as ofNov.20, 2020.
Three main concepts about Gitter live chat log are concerned
in the scope of this study, including chat log, utterance, and dia-
log. In Gitter, developer conversations in one chatting room are
recorded in a chat log. As illustrated in Figure 1, a typical live chat
logcontainsasequentialsetofutterancesinchronologicalorder.
Eachutterance consists of a timestamp, developer id, and a textual
message initiating a question or responding to an earlier message.
Achatlogtypicallycontainsalargenumberofutterances,andat
any given time, multiple consecutive utterances might be possibly
respondingtodifferentthreadsofdialogdiscussions.Theinterleav-
ing nature of utterances leads to entangled dialogs, as illustrated
with the two colors in Figure 1. The two colors are used to high-
light utterances belonging to two different dialogs, where the links
between twoutterancesindicatethe responding relationship.
2.2 Challenges in Chat Analysis
Different from many other sources of software development re-
lated communication, the information on online communication
platforms are shared in an unstructured, informal, and interleaved
manner.Thus,analyzinglivechatisquitechallengingduetothe
following barriers. (1) Entangled dialogs . Utterances in chat logs
form stream information, with dialogs often entangling such as
asingleconversationisinterleavedwithotherdialogs,asshown

understand community characteristics of live chat networks, we
performsocialnetworkanalysisonlive-chatutterances,inwhich
each developer is treated as a node, with edges defined as a pair of
developers co-occurringinone ormore dialogs.

thesecommunities.GitterprovidesRESTAPI[ 28]togetdataabout
chatting rooms and post utterances. In this study, we use the REST
APItoacquirethechatutterancesoftheeightselectedcommunities,
and the retrieved dataset contains all utterances as of ł2020-11-20ž.
Detailed statistics are shown in Table 1, where P refers to the num-
ber of participants, Drefers to the number of dialogs,and U refers
tothenumberofutterances.Thetotalnumberofparticipantsfor
the eight communities is 95,416, accounting for 13% of the total
population in Gitter. Thus, we consider that the eight communities
are representative ofthe Gitter platform.
Prepossessingthetextualutterances. Wefirstnormalizenon-
ASCIIcharacterslikeemojistostandardASCIIstrings.Somelow-
frequency tokens contribute little to the analysis of live chat, such
as URL, email address, code, HTML tags, and version numbers.
Wereplacethemwithspecifictokens <URL>,<EMAIL>,<HTML>,
<CODE>, and <ID> . We utilize Spacy [ 2] to tokenize sentences into
termsandperformlemmatizationandlowercasingontermswith
Spacy to alleviatethe influenceofwordmorphology.
Manuallabelingofdialogdisentanglement. Weemploya3-
stepmanualprocesstogenerateasampledialogdatasetforfurther
analysis. First, we randomly sample 100 utterances from each com-
munity’s live chat log, with the intention to trace corresponding
dialogsassociated with each ofthe100 utterances. This stepleads
toatotalof 800utterancesfromtheentire1,402,894 utterances of
the eight communities. Next, using each utterance as a seed, we
identify its preceding and successive utterances iteratively so that
wecangrouprelatedutterancesintothesamedialogascompleteas
possible.Specifically,for eachutterance,we determine its context
byexaminingtheconsecutivechatsinthechatlog,andmanually
linkittorelatedutterancesbelongingtothesamedialog.Then,the
nextstep is cleaning. Specifically,we excludedunreadabledialogs:
(1) dialogs that are written in non-English languages; (2) dialogs
that contain too much code or stack traces; (3) Low-quality dialogs
suchasdialogswithmanytyposandgrammaticalerrors;and(4)
Dialogsthatinvolvechannelrobots.Afterthesesteps,weinclude
additionalsixthousandutteranceswhichareassociatedwiththe
initial 800 utterances. This leads to a total of 7,226 utterances, man-
uallydisentangledinto749dialogs,assummarizedinTable1.Note
that, removing bot-involved dialogs haslittleimpact onourresults.
First, the bot-involved dialogs are relatively small in volume. In
our study, only one of the eight projects utilizes bots, and more
specifically, only nine out of 800 sampled dialogs are excluded due
to bot involvement. Second, we observed that the bot-generated
utterances are rather trivial, such as greeting information, links to
generalguidelines, andstatusupdates.
To ensure the correctness of the disentanglement results, a la-
belingteamwasputtogether,consistingofoneseniorresearcher
and sixPh.D. students.Allof them are fluent in English,and have
done either intensive research work with software development or
havebeenactivelycontributingtoopen-sourceprojects.Thesenior
researchertrainedthesixPh.D.candidatesonhowtodisentangle
dialogsandprovidedconsultationduringtheprocess.Thedisen-
tanglement results from the Ph.D. candidates were reviewed by
others. We only accepted and included dialogs to our dataset when
the dialogs received full agreement. When a dialog received differ-
entdisentanglementresults,wehostedadiscussionwithallteammembers to decide through voting. The average Cohen’s Kappa
aboutdialogdisentanglement is0.81.
Automated DialogDisentanglement. To analyze the dialogs
onalargescale,weexperimentwiththefourstate-of-artDDap-
proaches, as introduced in Section 2.2 ( i.e.BiLSTM model, Bert
model,E2Emodel,andFFmodel).Specifically,weusethemanual
disentanglement sample data from the previous step as ground
truth data,compare andselect the bestDD modelfor the purpose
offurtheranalysisinthisstudy.Thecomparisonresultsfromour
experimentsshowthatthe FFapproach significantlyoutperforms
the others on disentangling developer live chat by achieving the
highestscoresonallthemetrics.TheaveragescoresofNMI,Shen-F,
F1,andARIare0.74,0.81,0.47,and0.57respectively3.Finally,we
use the best FF model to disentangle all the 1,402,894 utterances in
chatlogs.In total, we obtain 173,278 dialogs.
3.3 Empirical Analysis Design
3.3.1 Analysis for RQ1 (Communication Profile). As good commu-
nicationhabitssuggestmoreproductivedevelopmentpractices,we
intendtorevealthetemporalcommunicationprofilesofdevelop-
ers, including when the developers are active and how long the
respondent replies to the dialog initiator. First, we collect all the
utterancetimeoftheentirepopulation,andanalyzethepeakhours
andpeakdays.Then we calculatethe response time lag:
𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒_𝑙𝑎𝑔=𝑇𝑟−𝑇𝑖 (1)
where𝑇𝑖isthetimethattheinitiatorlaunchedthedialog,and 𝑇𝑟is
thetimethefirstrespondentreplied.Weautomaticallycalculatethe
utterancetimes andresponse time lagsfor allthe 173,278 dialogs.
3.3.2 AnalysisforRQ2(CommunityStructure). Weaimtovisual-
izethesocialnetworksofdevelopersinlivechat,andsummarize
the common structures. Social network analysis (SNA) describes
relationships among social entities, as well as the structures and
implicationsoftheirconnections[ 65].Forstudyingrelationships
amongdevelopersinoneOSScommunity,wegeneratethesocial
networks according to the following definition:
𝐺={𝑉,𝐸}
𝑉={𝑑1,𝑑2,...,𝑑𝑛}
𝐸={<𝑑𝑗,𝑑𝑘>}(2)
where𝑑𝑖isadeveloperinthechattingroom, 𝑑𝑗isonedialoginitia-
tor, and𝑑𝑘is a respondent to 𝑑𝑗. Specifically, for eachdisentangled
dialog, we first identify its initiator and all the respondents. The
initiator is the developer who launches the dialog, and the respon-
dents are other developers who participate in the dialog. Then we
adda link between the initiator and each respondent.(Note that,
RQ2 focuses on exploring responding behaviors, i.e., the interac-
tionbetweeninitiatorsandrespondents,thusthelinks/edgesare
definedonlybetweenthesetworoles.Additionally,wewillexplore
the interaction relationship among initiators and all responders in

open-source community. We build the social networks based on all
the 173,278 dialogsbyusing the automaticgraph tool,Gephi[ 6].
To understand the topology of the eight social networks, we
report the following SNA measures that have been widely used by
previousstudies[ 45,55].Notethat,weexcludeddeveloperswho
never receivedreplies (AKA.Haircut)whencalculatingSNAmea-
suresfollowingpreviouswork[ 11,62].(1)Degree[20]measures

coefficient [66] is a measure of the degree to which developers in
agraph tendto clustertogether.
3.3.3 AnalysisforRQ3(DiscussionTopic). Ourgoalisidentifying
discussiontopicsindevelopers’live chat.Chatterjee et al.[15]ob-
servedthatlivechatsprovidesimilarinformationascanbefoundin
Q&A posts on Stack Overflow. To effectively identify and organize
dialog topics, we extend Beyer et.al’s category of question cate-
gories on Stack Overflow [ 9]. We choose Beyer et.al’s category for
two reasons. First, since developers use both Question and Answer
forums(suchasStackOverflow)andlivechattoresolvedevelop-
mentissues,weconsiderthecategoriesofStackOverflowquestions
are partially applicable to the dialog topics in live chat. Second,
Beyeret.al’s category harmonizes five taxonomies presented in
previous studies [ 3,8,10,51,64] that are already validated and
suitable to the posts ofdevelopers’ questions.
Nonetheless,thepredefinedcategoryisnotmeanttobecompre-
hensive,thus,weemploya hybridcardsort process[22]tomanually
determine the topics of dialogs. In a hybrid card sort , the sorting
beginswiththepredefinedBeyer et.al’scategoryandparticipants
couldcreatetheirownaswell.Thenewly-createdtopicisinstantly
updated into the topic set and can be used by other participants
then.Theparticipantsarethesameteamthatmanuallydisentangle
dialogs, andthe labeling processissimilartomanual dialogdisen-
tanglement as introduced in Section 3.2. Specifically, the sorting
process is conducted in one round, with a concluding discussion
session to resolve the disagreement in labels based on majority
voting.The averageCohen’sKappa aboutdialogtopics is0.86.
3.3.4 Analysis for RQ4 (Interactive Pattern). Live-chat conversa-
tions generally servethe purposesof solution explorationanddis-
cussion stimulation. To uncover underlying patterns that shape
and/ordirectmoreproductiveconversations,wefirstadoptade-
veloper intent codebook [ 50] and manually label the interaction
links that appeared in each dialog. Thedeveloper intent codebook

NF NegativeFeedback Developerprovides negativefeedbackforuseless solutions
GG Greetings/Gratitude Greetingsorexpressing gratitudeis built fromprevious workon userintent ininformation-seeking
conversations [ 50], as summarizedinTable 2.
Then, we employ an open card sort [52] process to assign an
interactivepatterntoadialogbasedonthesequenceofdevelopers’
intents. In an open sort, the sorting begins with no predefined
patterns and participants develop their own patterns. The two
participantsindividuallyassignedpatternstothesamedialogs.The
sortingprocess is conductedinmultiple rounds. In the firstround,
all participantslabeldialogsofone community,with an intensive
discussion session to achieve conceptual coherence about patterns.
A shared pool of patterns is utilized and carefully maintained, and
eachparticipantcouldselectexistingpatternsfromand/oraddnew
patternnamesintothesharedpool.Thenwedivideintotwoteams
to label the remaining dialogs. Each dialog will receive two pattern
labels, and we resolve disagreement based on majority voting. The
averageCohen’sKappa aboutinteractive patterns is0.82.
After identifying underlying interaction patterns, we further
exploretheirstatisticalcharacteristicsinaspectsofdistributionand
duration.We calculatethe durationof adialogas follows:
𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 =𝑇𝑒−𝑇𝑖 (3)
where𝑇𝑒isthetimethatthedialogended,and 𝑇𝑖isthetimethat
the initiator launched the dialog. This metric can reflect the life
cycleofone dialog.
Notethat,tokeeptheworkloadofmanuallylabelingeachdialog
manageable,weanswerRQ3andRQ4bymanuallyanalyzingthe
749 sampled dialogs. We believe that although we could only man-
uallyanalyzeasmallpercentageofthedisentangleddialogs,this
datasetsupportsourmethodologyasbeingusefulfordiscovering
valuable findings.
4 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

4.2 RQ2: Community Structure
ToanswerRQ2,wefirstexaminethestructuralpropertiesofthede-
velopersocialnetworksacrosstheeightcommunities,andthentry
todrawsomecommonobservationsbasedonthesesocialnetworks.
Properties of social networks. Table3shows the social net-
workpropertiesoftheeightcommunities.Init.%,Resp.%,andBoth%
denotethepercentageofdevelopersservingtheroleofdialogini-
tiators, respondents, and both. Intuitively, we consider that respon-
dentssharetheirknowledgewithothers,whileinitiatorsreceive
knowledge from others. We can see that, the four communities
(Appium, Docker, Gitter, and Ethereum) have a higher percent-
age (75.04%-81.70%) of dialog initiators and a lower percentage
(18.30%-24.96%)ofrespondents/both.Thehighpercentageofdialog
initiators may relate to the applicable nature of the open-source
projects,e.g.,Ethereumisoneofthemostwidelyusedopen-source
blockchain systems, thus there are a large number of users acquir-
ingtechnicalsupportfromlivechat.Theotherfourcommunities
(Angular, DL4J, Nodejs, andTypescript) have ahigher percentage
(29.94%-48.62%)ofrespondents/both.Apossibleexplanationisthat
thesefourprojectsaremorewidelyusedfordevelopmentpurposes,
e.g., Angular is a platform for building mobile and desktop web
applications, therefore, such communities appear to be knowledge-
sharingandcollaborative.
Categorizingdevelopersocialnetworks. Figure4showsthe
socialnetworkvisualizationsoftheeightcommunitiesgenerated
by Gephi. Each node represents one developer, and the edge de-
notes the dialog relationship between two developers. We color
thevertexoftheinitiatorwithblue,thevertexoftherespondent
withwhite,andthevertexofbothroleswithorange.Inaddition,
the node’s size indicates its corresponding degree. Based on the
observationoncommunitystructures,wecategorizetheeightcom-
munitiesintothreegroups,consistingof:(1) Polaris network is
atypeofhighlycentralizednetworkwherethecommunityisor-
ganized around its single focal point; (2) Constellation network
is a type of moderately centralized network where the communityisorganizedarounditsmultiplefocalpoints;and(3) Galaxy net-
workis a type of decentralized network where all individuals in
thecommunityhavesimilarrelationships.InFigure 4,thefourcom-
munities on the top ( i.e., Angular, DL4J, NodeJS, and Typescript)
belong to the Constellation network, i.e., moderately centralized
network. Three communities ( i.e., Appium, Docker, and Gitter) be-
long to the Polaris network, i.e., a highly centralized network. The
remainingEthereumcommunitybelongstotheGalaxynetwork,
i.e., decentralized network. Previous studies have shown that a
highlycentralizednetworkmayreflectanunevendistributionof
knowledge across the community, where knowledge is mostly con-
centratedatthefocalpoints[ 38,44].Therefore,thethreePolaris
communities (Appium, Docker, and Gitter) may have a higher risk
of single-point failure, if the focal developer is inactive, whereas
the Galaxy network (Ethereum) has the lowest risk, followed by
theConstellationnetwork(Angular,DL4J,NodeJS,andTypescript).
In Table3, we can also see that the Constellation networks and
Polaris networks have higher scores in terms of average degree
(1.96-9.15),betweenness(0.000273-0.001342),andcloseness(0.31-
0.43).ThephenomenaindicatethatthefocalpointsinConstellation
networksandPolarisnetworksmakethecommunitiesmorecon-
nected.Astudyonemail-connectedsocialnetworks[ 11]showsthat
the mean betweenness of developers is 0.0114, which on average is
higher thanlive chatcommunities.Nodeswithhighbetweenness
mayhaveconsiderableinfluencewithinanetworkinallowingin-
formation to pass from one part of the network to the other. Lower
betweenness indicates that developers in the live chat may have
lessinfluencethandevelopersinemailinspreadinginformation.
However,theaveragein-degree and out-degreeof networksbuilt
onemailsaresignificantlylower,with0.00794and0.00666forde-
velopers. While developers in live chat have more concentration
and higher density, along with the closeness centrality values, indi-
cating a moreclosely connected communitythan that fromemail.
DevelopersinConstellationcommunitieshavehigherclustering
coefficient scores (0.14-0.60), indicating that developers in Constel-
lationcommunitiesaremoredenselyconnected, i.e.,thedevelopers

Answering RQ2: By visualizing the social networks of eight
studiedcommunities,weidentifythreesocialnetworkstructures
for developers’ live chat. Half of the communities (4/8) are Constel-
lation networks. A minority of the communities (3/8) are Polaris
networks. Only one community belongs to the Galaxy network. In

5 DISCUSSION
In thiswork, we takeafirst look atdevelopers’ live chaton Gitter
in terms of communication profile, community structure, discus-
sion topic, and interaction pattern. Our work paves the way for
other researchers to be able to utilize the same methods in other
softwarecommunities.Additionally,ascommunicationisalarge
partofsuccessfulsoftwaredevelopment,andGitterisoneofthe
main platforms for communication of GitHub users, it is important
to explore how software engineers use Gitter and their pain points
ofusingit.AimingatpromotingefficientandeffectiveOSScom-
munications,we discuss themain implicationsof our findingsfor
OSS developers, communities,platform vendors,andresearchers.
5.1 Individual Developers
Basedonourfindings,wepresentthefollowingimplicationsforin-
dividualOSSdevelopersto attractattentionsandreceiveresponses
effectivelyandefficiently.
(1) Provide example code or data when seeking solution
help (RQ3, RQ4). In Figure 5, we reported that, there are nearly
1/3 dialogs are problem-oriented. In the live chat, it is important to
provideexample codeinproblem-orienteddialogs,tomakeother
developers quickly understand and avoid missing key information.
This finding is also in line with the evidence provided by previous
studies [12,14] on Stack Overflow. Here is an example of showing
<D1> Hey there, anyone has an idea on this issue: Have quotes
showing up in the UI. I tried to remove it by replacing it
in the .ts file...I’m not sure what else to try.
<D2> I’m having trouble understanding what’s going on. Can
you toss your example in a plunker?
the importance of using examples in the live chat. The correspond-
ingdialogconfirmstheClarifyingQuestionPattern(P3)withmulti-
pleback-and-forthinteractionsforclarifyingquestions.Ifexamples
areprovidedatthebeginning,theprocessofissue-resolvingwould
be expedited. Particularly, the Angular community givesgreat im-
portance to example demonstration. Developers are encouraged to
create examples via a demonstration platform,named Plunker [ 1].
(2) Be aware of low-active hours (RQ1) . Our results show
thatdevelopersaremoreactiveduringsometimeslicesinlivechat.
Figure3(a)demonstrates the most active time slices are UTC 9-
10, 13-14, and 18-21, corresponding to Central European/American
daytimeorAsianighttime.Noticeably,moredeveloperlivechatting
happensonWednesdaysandThursdaysthanonotherweekdays
(UTC),whichpossiblycorrespondstocommunication,coordination,andpreparationforintegration/releasedeadlinesonFridays.This
observation alsoconfirmsthełcommerciallyviablealternativež of
the OSS projects reported in recent studies [ 23,29,68]. One of
the common findings is thatthe traditional notion of OSS projects
that are driven by voluntary developers is now outdated. OSS has
becomeacommerciallyviablealternative,andsomeOSSprojects
have become critical building blocks for organizationsworldwide.
For example, Docker is widely used by software companies around
the world5, including Adobe, AT&T, PayPal, etc. Therefore, instead
ofchatting onweekends, developerslikely discusstheirproblems
inthe live chatonworkdays.
While low-active time slices (UTC 1-6) mostly correspond to
CentralEuropean/AmericannighttimeorAsiadaytime.Incases
wheredevelopersfindissuesandneedsupportduringlow-active
hours,wesuggestseveraloptions.First,itisrecommendedtosimul-
taneously post questions to other alternative platforms, e.g., issues
and emails. Second, they better follow up in live-chat if not receiv-
ing timely responses to their questions posted during low-active
hours. Finally, employ some automated reminder bot, for example,
to reviewthe listofquestionspostedduringlow-active hours.
(3) Avoid asking amid ongoing discussions (RQ4). When
identifying the unanswered monologues patterns from dialogs, we
notethat30%ofthemarelaunchedinthemiddleofongoingactive
andintenseconversationsonadifferenttopic.Insuchcases,new
questionsareeasilyfloodedbytheutterancesoftheongoingdiscus-
sions. Therefore,to increasethe opportunityof gettingresponses,
developerscouldposttheirquestionsaftertheongoingdiscussions.
Incasethatanurgentmatteremerges,wesuggestthattheplatform
vendors provide special accommodations to flag such urgency and
redirect the team’sattentionto it,such as multi-threadedconversa-
tion(e.g.,inSlack)orahighlighttagforurgentquestionsandlet
otherssupervise the usage of an urgent tag to avoid abuse.
5.2 OSSCommunities
weprovidethefollowingrecommendationsforOSSmanagersto
improve the managementandcoordination of the communities.
(1) Mitigate the risk of single-point failure (RQ2). As re-
portedinRQ2,thethreePolariscommunities(Appium,Docker,and
Gitter) may have a higher risk of single-point failure, if the focal
developer left or became inactive. It is noticeable that there are
some second focal points smaller than those most focal ones in the
three Polaris networks, and this may suggest practical strategies in
ordertomitigatetheriskofsingle-pointfailure.Forexample,the
Polariscommunitiesmaydesignandemployappropriateincentives
or policies to second focal developers, for improving the resilience
ofthe live chatcommunities.
(2)ImproveOSSdocumentationfornewcomers(RQ1,RQ4) .
It is reported that some newcomers complained that it is hard to

5.3 Platform Vendors
This section discusses several desired features for facilitating more
productive conversations. Specifically, these are organized from
communication platform vendors’ perspective, in support of more
intelligentandproductivechattingoptions,leveragingonmining
andknowledge sharingofintensive historicalconversations.
(1) Highlight and organize conversation topics (RQ3). As
suggestedbythepreviousstudy, multi-dimensionalseparation of
concerns [ 47] is a powerful concept supporting collaborative de-
velopment by breaking a large discussion down into many smaller
units.Ithighlightsthattheonlinecommunicationplatformvendors
could providesupportfora setofpredefinedpanelsthatfocus on
certain topics. In the results of RQ3, we provide a taxonomy of
discussion topics in live chat.The online communication platform
vendors could refer to this taxonomy to create topic panels. For
example, API-usage panel, Error panel, Background-info panel, etc.
Thesemultiplepanelscouldbringthefollowingbenefitstocommu-
nity members: (i) quickly understanding and retrieving the intents
ofthedialoginitiators;(ii)reducinginterferenceandfocusingmore
on topics of interest; and (iii) identifying important information
reportedbythe developers.
(2) Annotate important questions (RQ3). When investigat-
ingdialogtopics,wenotethatcertaintypesofdialogssuggestinfor-
mationforfuturesoftwareevolution.Forexample,thereare3.6%
dialogs discussing new features, and 8.28% discussing unwanted
behaviors. These dialogs are valuable for product teams to plan
futurereleases.Inthemeanwhile,othertypesofdialogsindicate
unrevealeddefectsofexistingsystems.Forexample,11.62%dialogs
discusserrors,4.81%discussingsomethingthatdoesnotwork,3.87%
discussingreliabilityissues,and1.74%discussingperformanceis-
sues. Properly annotating those dialogs with łFeature Requestž,
łEnhancementž, andłBugsžwould helptopreserve valuable infor-
mation, and contributeto productivity and quality improvement of
thesoftware. As an example, techniquesfor mining live chat have
been exploredfor identifying feature requests from chatlogs[ 57].
5.4 Researchers
Research in the SE area could dedicate to promote efficient and
effective OSS communicationinthe following directions.
(1)Automaticallyrecommendsimilarquestions(RQ4). Ex-
isting online communication platforms only record the massive
historychatmessages,butdonotconsideradeeperutilizationof
thosehistoricaldata.Actually,wenotethatdeveloperspostsimilar
questions in live chat sometimes. In DL4J, one initiator posted a
question,andhegotareplylikethis:łSomeoneelseaskedavery
similarquestionawhileago.žHowever,itisnoteasyfortheinitiator
toaccuratelyretrievethesimilarquestionoutfromthemassivehis-
torymessages.Inaddition,somequestionsthatgotunansweredare
largely dueto many similar questions beingpreviously answered.
Therefore, we consider that, it will save developers’ effort if re-
searcherscoulddevelopapproachesthatautomaticallyrecommend
similar questionsandthe corresponding discussions.(2) Automatically assign appropriate respondents (RQ4).
By analyzingthe dialogsbelonging toexploring solution patterns
(P1), we note that respondents who are not quite familiar with the
technologies related to the posted questions might give ineffective
solutions.Althoughsuchdiscussionscouldmakedevelopersunder-
stand the problem better, the multiple fail-and-try interactions still
prolong theprocess of issue-resolving.Therefore,to makeconver-
sations more productive, it is expected to develop approaches that
couldrecommendorassignappropriaterespondentsaccordingto
theirhistoricalanswers.
(3) Automatically push valuable information to project
repositories(RQ3). Valuableinformationsuchasfeaturerequests
or issue reports, either manually annotated by developers or au-
tomatically detected by tools, needs to be well-documented and
well-traced in the scope of project repositories. Typically, code
repositoriessuchasGithuborGitlabprovidethefunctionalityofis-
suetracking.Itwouldbemoreefficientifresearcherscouldprovide
aconvenientwaytodirectlypushorintegratethevaluableinforma-
tionintothecoderepository.Inaddition,thefollowinglinguistic
patterns might be helpful to automatically classify dialog topics.
Itisobservedthatquestionsfromthe APIusage categoryinclude
phrasessuchas:łhowtodosth?ž,łhowcanIdosth?ž,łcananyone
helpmewithsth?ž,łisthereanywaytosth?ž,orłIwant/needto
do sthž. For example, łHow to bundle my Angular 2 app into a
‘bundle.js’file?žandłCananyonehelpmewithPWAusingangular
2ž. Questions from the Errorcategory are likely to be łI get/receive
thiserrorž,łAnyonehadanerrorlikethisž,łDoesanyoneknowa
solutionforsthž,ordirectlypostingthespecificexceptionnames.
For example, łI receive a NotFound errorž and łAnyone had an
error like this before when trying to load a route?ž Questions from
theBackgroundinfo categoryarelikelytobełwhat/why/when...ž,łI
would like to know sthž, or łis there sth for...ž. For example, łWhen
Appium will support Xcode 8.2?ž and łAre there any limitations
for automating the iOSapp madewithSwift 3?ž.
(4) Analyze effects of social chatting (RQ3). As reported in
RQ3, 10.95% of dialogs are non-domain related (N-DR) topics such
as general development or social chatting. A recent study [ 46] em-
phasizesanimportantroleofsocialinteractions,suchasthesimple
phrase łHow was your weekend?ž, to show peer support for de-
velopers working at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future
work may explore more patterns and effects of social chatting, e.g.,
pre/post-pandemiccomparison.

6 RELATED WORK
Ourworkisrelatedtopreviousstudiesthatfocusedonsynchronous
andasynchronous communicationinthe OSS community.
SynchronousCommunicationinOSScommunity. Recently,
moreandmoreworkhasrealizedthatlivechatviamoderncom-
munication platforms plays an increasingly important role in team
communication. Lin et al.[40] conducted an exploratory study
on understanding the role of Slack in supporting software engi-
neering by surveying 104 developers. Their research revealed that
developersuseSlackforpersonal,team-wide,andcommunity-wide
purposes, and developers use bots for team and task management
intheirdailylives.Theyhighlightedthatlivechatplaysanincreas-
ingly significant role in software development, replacing email
in some cases. Shihab et al.[58,59] analyzed the usage of devel-
oper IRC meeting channels of two large open-source projects from
several dimensions: meeting content, meeting participants, their
contribution, and meeting styles. Their results showed that IRC
meetings are gaining popularity among open source developers,
and highlighted the wealth of information that can be obtained
from developer chat messages. Yu et al.[67] analyzed the usage of
twocommunicationmechanismsinglobalsoftwaredevelopment
projects, which are synchronous (IRC) and asynchronous (mailing
list).Theirresultsshowedthatdevelopersactivelyusebothcommu-
nicationmechanismsinacomplementaryway.Tosumup,existing
empiricalanalysisoflivechatmainlyfocusedontheusagepurpose
[40],theusageoflivemeetings[ 58,59],andcomparisonwithdif-
ferentcommunicationmechanismsandknowledge-shareplatforms
[67]. There is a lack of in-depth analysis of the community proper-
tiesandthedetaileddiscussioncontents.Ourstudybridgesthatgap
with a large-scale analysis of communication profiles, community
structures, dialogtopics, andinteraction patterns inlive chat.
Asynchronous Communication in OSS community. Prior
studieshaveempiricallyanalyzedasynchronouscommunicationin
theOSScommunity, including mailing-list, issuediscussions, and
Stack Overflow. Bird et al.[11] mined email social network on the
ApacheHTTPserverproject.Theyreportedthattheemailsocial
networkisatypicalelectroniccommunity:afewmembersaccount
for the bulk of the messages sent, and the bulk of the replies. DiSorboet al.[60] proposed a taxonomy of intentions to classify sen-
tencesindevelopermailinglistsintosixcategories:featurerequest,
opinion asking, problem discovery, solution proposal, information
seeking, and information giving. Although the taxonomy has been
shown to be effective in analyzing development emails and user
feedback from app reviews [ 48], Huang et al.[36] found that it
cannot be generalized to discussions in issue tracking systems, and
they addressed the deficiencies of Di Sorbo et al.’s taxonomy by
proposingaconvolutionneuralnetworkbasedapproach.Arya etal.
[4]identified16informationtypes,suchasnewissuesandrequests,
solutionusage, etc.,throughquantitativecontentanalysisof15issue
discussion threads in Github. They also provided a supervised clas-
sificationsolution by using RandomForest with 14conversational
features toclassifysentences.Allamanis and Sutton[ 3] presented
atopicmodelinganalysisthatcombinesquestionconcepts,types,
and code from Stack Overflow to associate programming concepts
and identifiers with particular types of questions, such as, łhow
to performencodingž.Similarly,Rosenand Shihab[ 51] employed
Latent Dirichlet Allocation-based topic modelsto help us summa-
rizethemobile-relatedquestionsfromStackOverflow.Ourwork
differs from existing research in that we focus on synchronous
communicationwhichposesdifferentchallengesaslivechatlogs
are informal, unstructured,noisy,andinterleaved.
7 CONCLUSION AND FUTUREWORK
In this paper, we have presented the firstlarge-scale study to gain
an empirical understanding of OSS developers’ live chat. Based on
173,278 dialogs taken from eight popular communities on Gitter,
we explore the temporal communication profiles of developers, the
socialnetworksandtheirpropertiestowardsthecommunity,the
taxonomy of discussion topics, and the interaction patterns in live
chat. Our study reveals a number of interesting findings. Moreover,
we provide recommendations for both OSS developers and com-
munities, highlight advanced features for online communication
platformvendors,andprovokeinsightfulfutureresearchquestions
for OSS researchers. In the future, we plan to investigate how well
can we automatically classify the dialogs into different topics, as
well as attempt to construct knowledge bases according to already
answered questions and their corresponding solutions from live
chat.Wehopethatthefindingsandinsightsthatwehaveuncovered
will pave the way for other researches, help drive a more in-depth
understandingofOSSdevelopmentcollaboration,andpromotea
betterutilizationandminingofknowledgeembeddedinthemas-
sive chathistory.To facilitatereplications orother typesof future
work, we provide the utterance data and disentangled dialogs used
inthis study online: https://github.com/LiveChat2021/LiveChat .
