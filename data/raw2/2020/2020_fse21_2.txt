ABSTRACT
Serverless computing is an emerging paradigm for cloud computing,
gaining traction in a wide range of applications such as video pro-
cessing and machine learning. This new paradigm allows developers
to focus on the development of the logic of serverless computing
based applications (abbreviated as serverless-based applications ) in
the granularity of function, thereby freeing developers from te-
dious and error-prone infrastructure management. Meanwhile, it
also introduces new challenges on the design, implementation, and
deployment of serverless-based applications, and current serverless
computing platforms are far away from satisfactory. However, to
the best of our knowledge, these challenges have not been well
studied. To ll this knowledge gap, this paper presents the rst com-
prehensive study on understanding the challenges in developing
serverless-based applications from the developers’ perspective. We
mine and analyze 22,731 relevant questions from Stack Overow
(a popular Q&A website for developers), and show the increasing
popularity trend and the high diculty level of serverless com-
puting for developers. Through manual inspection of 619 sampled
questions, we construct a taxonomy of challenges that developers

1 INTRODUCTION
Serverless computing is an emerging paradigm for cloud comput-
ing, gaining traction in a wide range of domains including video
processing [ 79,90], scientic computing [ 91,104], machine learn-
ing [ 83,89], big data processing [ 108], Internet of things [ 97], etc.
It has been estimated that the market of serverless computing is
expected to grow from USD 1.88 billion in 2016 to USD 7.72 billion
by 2021 [ 64]. Moreover, it is predicted that 50% of global enterprises
will employ serverless computing by 2025 [63].ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece Jinfeng Wen, Zhenpeng Chen, Yi Liu, Yiling Lou, Yun Ma, Gang Huang, Xin Jin, and Xuanzhe Liu
The increasing popularity of serverless computing can be attrib-
uted to its benign characteristics. Specically, it allows developers
to focus on the application logic, where functions are composed
and packaged as the format of services (i.e., Function-as-a-Service
(FaaS ) [77,92,96,105,106]), thereby freeing developers from tedious
and error-prone infrastructure management like load-balancing,
auto-scaling, fault tolerance, operational monitoring, etc. Moreover,
it reduces the cost as developers pay for only the actual function
executions. What is more, serverless computing also brings great
benets for cloud providers as it allows them to better utilize re-
sources [ 92]. Therefore, major cloud providers have rolled out their
serverless platforms, such as AWS Lambda [ 61], Microsoft Azure
Functions [ 62], and Google Cloud Functions [ 65]. There are also
increasing open-source implementations available for serverless
computing like OpenWhisk [70] and OpenFaaS [69].
Given the popularity of serverless computing, there is a lot
of room that can be explored by researchers and developers. Re-
searchers have conducted a series of studies [ 96,103,107,110]
to compare the features, architectures, and performance proper-
ties, among dierent serverless platforms, in order to understand
their dierences and derive guidelines for choosing the most suit-
able platform for a given application scenario. Furthermore, since
current serverless platforms have several shortcomings such as
high startup time and limited communication bandwidth, recent
work [ 77,90,99] has proposed new architectures and solutions to al-
leviate or eliminate them. Developers have also paid attention to the
development of serverless computing based applications (in short
ofserverless-based applications ). The specic programming chal-
lenges that developers encounter when developing serverless-based
applications, e.g., the design, implementation, and deployment of
serverless-based applications, congurations of related resources
and environments, networking, etc., are frequently asked on devel-
opers’ Q&A forums [ 1–7]. However, to the best of our knowledge,
these challenges have not been well studied.
To bridge the knowledge gap, we perform the rst comprehen-
sive study to identify challenges in developing serverless-based
applications from the developers’ perspectives. Such a study is
timely and valuable since it can aid developers in avoiding common
pitfalls and make researchers and cloud providers better positioned
to help developers develop serverless-based applications in a more
targeted way. To this end, we mine and analyze the relevant ques-
tions from a variety of developers on Stack Overow (SO), which
is a popular Q&A forum for developers to seek advice from peers
when they have programming issues [ 87]. Specically, we collect
22,731 SO questions related to serverless computing to answer the
following three research questions.
RQ1 (Popularity trend): What is the popularity trend of server-
less computing among developers? Via quantitative analysis, we nd
that serverless computing is gaining increasing attention on Stack
Overow, demonstrating its rising popularity and the timeliness
and the urgency of our study.
RQ2 (Diculty level): How dicult is serverless computing for
developers? To answer this question, we explore the diculty of
developers answering questions related to serverless computing.
Results show that these questions are more dicult to answer than
those related to other challenging topics in software engineering,which motivates us to further identify the specic challenges behind
serverless computing.
RQ3 (Taxonomy of challenges): What specic challenges do
developers encounter when developing serverless-based applications?
To identify the challenges, we randomly sample 619 relevant SO
questions for manual examination. For each question, we qualita-
tively extract the challenge behind it. Finally, we construct a taxon-
omy consisting of 36 categories, linked to challenges in developing
serverless-based applications. It indicates that developers face a
wide spectrum of challenges in serverless computing, covering con-
ceptual questions, version control, programming language support,
database connection, resource conguration, security, etc. Based
on the taxonomy, we summarize a series of ndings and actionable
implications for developers, researchers, and cloud providers.
In addition, we oer the scripts and the dataset used in this
study1as an additional contribution to the research community for
other researchers to replicate and build upon.
2 BACKGROUND
Cloud computing has become a widely adopted paradigm for the
delivery of computing services via the Internet. It has various forms,
including Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS), Platform as a Service
(PaaS ), Software as a Service ( SaaS ), etc. They are built on top of
each other and form a “cloud computing stack”, on which each
layer gradually relieves the tedious and error-prone infrastructure
management, e.g., load balancing and auto-scaling. Serverless com-
puting currently is the ultimate paradigm of cloud computing. In
this paradigm, it introduces opportunities for software development.
Specically, developers can focus on their own application logic
and save cost without the need for cloud computing expertise. The
function becomes the basic unit in serverless computing. Develop-
ers write only the function with a specic event trigger (e.g., adding
a le into the cloud storage), package and upload their code, and
specify the required environment (e.g., language runtime, memory).
Serverless platforms provide sandboxing environments (virtual
machines or containers) to host functions, and automatically deal
with scalability, fault tolerance, and other runtime issues. Dierent
from traditional cloud computing, where developers often need to
continuously manage and run servers and pay for them, such a
programming paradigm abstracts away most operational tasks and
simplies the application development on the cloud. Meanwhile,
its storage and computation scale separately, and are provisioned
and priced independently.
However, this new programming paradigm changes the way
of traditional software development and may introduce new chal-
lenges for developers. First, inherent limits of serverless computing
prevent the migration from serverful applications [ 83,88,92]. For
example, serverless computing lacks an ecient communication
channel among functions, and has restricted resources (e.g., short
execution time, conned memory size). Second, existing server-
less platforms lack a unied programming framework and rich
support tools, making it more dicult to develop serverless-based
applications [ 92,94]. For example, due to the lack of support tools,
debugging and testing serverless-based applications are more chal-
lenging than serverful applications for developers. Last but not least,
1https://github.com/WenJinfeng/FSE21-Dataset_ScriptAn Empirical Study on Challenges of Application Development in Serverless Computing ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece
developers have to follow the programming model of serverless
computing, with special attention to the design, implementation
and deployment of serverless-based applications, congurations
of resources and environments, processing of events, etc. [ 88,94].
These challenges may aect the developers’ practice, thereby re-
ducing their enthusiasm for application development on the cloud.
Thus, it is essential to understand the challenges in developing
serverless-based applications, which can improve the development
eciency of developers, give actionable implications to researchers,
and boost the usefulness of serverless platforms.
We briey introduce the development process of serverless-based
applications. Generally, to help developers develop better, server-
less platforms provide local development tools, e.g., Command-Line
Interfaces (CLIs), Software Development Kits (SDKs), etc. More-
over, some third-party tools like Serverless Framework [72],Local
Stack [67] also emerge to allow developers to build and deploy their
applications. Leveraging these development tools, the development
process can be divided into ve stages as shown in Figure 1.
New ApplicationsLegacy ApplicationsApplication DeploymentApplication DesignEnvironmentConfigurationLow-Code DevelopmentApplication ImplementationNon-Functional Properties
Figure 1: The development process of serverless-based appli-
cations.
Developers can have two cases for application development, i.e.,
(i) they develop new serverless-based applications from scratch,
and (ii) they migrate legacy applications to serverless platforms
to simplify the development or improve performance. For the rst
case, developers care about how to design the application func-
tionality. For the second case, developers mainly take into account
the migration design issues of existing legacy applications. They
are called Application Design . After application design, develop-
ers congure the environment related to serverless computing to
develop functions (called Environment Conguration ). What is
more, if functions require additional resources like compute and
storage, developers also need to congure these resources and the
corresponding permissions for functions leveraging the cloud con-
sole or a specic template. This conguration way can be viewed as
Low-Code Development [68], which is performed through graph-
ical user interfaces or conguration operation instead of traditional
hand-coded programming. After accomplishing the required con-
gurations, developers can focus on the code implementation of
applications (called Application Implementation ). Developers
conrm the correctness of applications, then deploy applications
to run on serverless platforms through the packaging way (called
Application Deployment ). Except for the above ve stages, de-
velopers also need to consider Non-Functional Properties , e.g.,
performance, security and version control. These properties can be
involved in one or more of the development stages. For instance,
performance or security is considered in the low-code developmentand application implementation. Thus, non-functional properties
are vital for the development of serverless-based applications.
3 METHODOLOGY
To understand the challenges that developers encounter when de-
veloping serverless-based applications, we follow previous stud-
ies [76,78,80,95,100,109,111] to collect and analyze the relevant
questions posted on SO, where developers often seek technical as-
sistance on unsolvable issues. In Figure 2, we show an overview of
the methodology of our study.
Step1: DownloadSO datasetStep 2: Extractrelevant questionsStep 3: Determinepopularity trend (RQ1)Step 4: Determine difficulty level(RQ2)Step 5: Constructtaxonomyof challenges (RQ3)
Figure 2: An overview of the methodology.
Step 1: Download SO dataset .To collect questions related to
serverless computing, we rst download the entire SO dataset 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑙
from the ocial Stack Exchange Data Dump [ 73] on December 9,
2020. The SO dataset includes 20,511,138 SO questions from July 31,
2008, to December 8, 2020. For each question, the metadata includes
its identier, creation date, body, title, answers, one to ve tags
that represent its topics, etc. In addition, the developer who posts
a question can mark an answer as an accepted answer to indicate
that it works for the question.
Step 2: Extract relevant questions .To collect serverless comput-
ing related questions from 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑙, we follow previous work [ 80,84,95]
to rst construct a set of tags related to serverless computing and
then extract questions tagged with at least one of these tags. The
detailed procedures are as follows.
First, we use 𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑖=f“serverless”, “faas” gas our initial tag set,
since this study focuses on serverless computing (also known as
“FaaS ” [77, 92, 96, 105, 106]).
Second, we extend the initial tag set by extracting all the tags of
questions whose tags match at least one tag in 𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑖(denote these
questions as 𝑆𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑), and rene the extended tag set (denoted as
𝑇𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑) by keeping tags that are signicantly relevant to serverless
computing and excluding others. Specically, we follow previous
work [ 80,109] to use two heuristics 𝜇and𝑣to measure the signi-
cance and relevance of a tag 𝑡in𝑇𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑.
¹𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒º𝜇=#𝑜𝑓 𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑆 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑
#𝑜𝑓 𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑆 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑(1)
¹𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒º𝑣=#𝑜𝑓 𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑆 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑
#𝑜𝑓 𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑆 𝑎𝑙𝑙(2)
A tag𝑡is signicantly relevant to serverless computing if its 𝜇
and𝑣are higher than the specic thresholds. To avoid omitting
relevant tags, we employ the lowest thresholds used by previous
studies [ 80,95], and only the tags whose 𝜇is higher than 0.005 and
whose𝑣is higher than 0.05 are kept in 𝑇𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑.ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece Jinfeng Wen, Zhenpeng Chen, Yi Liu, Yiling Lou, Yun Ma, Gang Huang, Xin Jin, and Xuanzhe Liu
Finally, the rst two authors jointly examine each candidate tag
in𝑇𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑 to lter out tags that are not related to serverless comput-
ing. As a result, the nal tag set 𝑇𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 consists of 13 tags, includ-
ing “serverless”, “faas”, “serverless-framework”, “aws-serverless”,
“openwhisk”, “aws-lambda”, “aws-sam”, “aws-sam-cli”, “serverless-
architecture”, “serverless-oine”, “vercel”, “serverless-plugins” and
“localstack”. We extract 22,731 questions tagged with at least one of
the 13 tags as the relevant questions (denoted as 𝑆𝑟𝑒𝑙).
Step 3: Determine popularity trend (RQ1) .To analyze the popu-
larity trend of the topic of serverless computing, we follow previous
work [ 76,78,80,81,84,100,109,111] to calculate the number of
questions and users related to serverless computing per year. Since
the concept of serverless computing has attracted widespread atten-
tion through AWS Lambda from 2015 [ 92], the metrics are calculated
based on𝑆𝑟𝑒𝑙for each of the past six years, i.e., from 2015 to 2020.
Section 4 answers RQ1.
Step 4: Determine diculty level (RQ2) .To measure the di-
culty level of answering questions related to serverless computing,
we follow previous work [ 75,76,78,80,84,100,109,111] to adopt
two metrics, including the percentage of questions with no accepted
answer (“ %no acc. ”) and the median response time needed to re-
ceive an accepted answer (“ resp time ”). We calculate the two metrics
based on𝑆𝑟𝑒𝑙. In addition, we calculate the average diculty level
of SO questions (i.e., %no acc. andresp time for𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑙) as the baseline.
For the rst metric, we use the proportion test [ 98] to examine the
statistical signicance of comparison. Proportion test is used for
testing the null hypothesis that the proportions in several groups
are the same [ 71], and thus appropriate for the comparison in %no
acc.[84]. For the second metric, we calculate the median value of
response time to receive an accepted answer for both serverless-
related questions (i.e., 𝑆𝑟𝑒𝑙) and SO questions (i.e., 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑙). Specically,
for each question, we extract the creation timestamps of this ques-
tion and the corresponding accepted answer to calculate the time
span between them as the response time. Section 5 answers RQ2.
Step 5: Construct taxonomy of challenges (RQ3) .To analyze
specic challenges that developers encounter and construct the
taxonomy of challenges, we follow previous studies [ 85,95] to use
questions that have an accepted answer, ensuring that we consider
only questions with a conrmed solution. As a result, 8,751 ques-
tions in𝑆𝑟𝑒𝑙are kept. Due to the large sample size, manually labeling
all questions is time-consuming and infeasible. Following previous
work [ 74], we randomly select a statistically signicant sample en-
suring a 99% condence level 5% from 8,751 questions. As a result,
619 questions constitute the taxonomy dataset of our study, and
this dataset size is larger than the one in existing work [ 82,85,112]
that needs also manual analysis. Next, we illustrate the process of
constructing the taxonomy of challenges.
First, we randomly sample 70% of 619 questions to construct the
initial taxonomy of challenges. We adopt an open coding proce-
dure [ 102] to analyze the sampled questions, in order to inductively
create categories and subcategories of our taxonomy in a bottom-
up way. The rst two authors, both of whom have two years of
cloud/serverless computing experience, jointly participate in the
taxonomy construction. They read the sampled questions over and
over again, in order to be acquainted with them. In this process,
all the elements of each question, including the title, body, codesnippets, comments, and even URLs contained in questioners and
answerers, are taken into account for careful inspection.
The detailed procedure of open coding is as follows. Questions
not related to serverless computing are labeled as False positives ,
and thus not included in our taxonomy. Regarding the remaining
questions, the authors give short phrases to represent the challenges
that developers encounter. Specically, some questions are raised
without any attempts, and they are mainly in the form of “how”, e.g.,
“How to use request module in node.js lambda ” [8]. For such questions,
the authors often can clearly understand the challenges from the
question description. Additionally, some questions describe the
faults or unexpected results that developers are trying development
practices. For such questions, the authors identify their causes as
the challenges. For instance, when the developer posts an error
message about the implementation of asynchronous functions [ 5],
the authors nd that the error is caused due to mixing asynchronous
statements through checking the question descriptions, comments,
and answers. Thus, the authors consider assigning asynchronous
processing to be the challenge behind this question.
Second, the authors continue to group similar short phrases
into categories and establish a hierarchical taxonomy of challenges.
Regarding the grouping process, the authors iterate repeatedly be-
tween categories and questions. If questions are related to multiple
categories, they are assigned to all related categories. In addition, if
the authors have conicts in labeling questions, a third arbitrator
is introduced to discuss and resolve these conicts. Particularly,
the third arbitrator has seven years of cloud computing experi-
ences. Through such a rigorous procedure, all questions come to
an agreement and the nal label results (i.e., the initial taxonomy)
are conrmed by all the participants.
Finally, we perform reliability analysis and extended construc-
tion of the taxonomy of challenges. Based on the initial taxonomy,
the remaining 30% questions are independently labeled by the rst
two authors to conduct reliability analysis. Each question is marked
with False positives or the leaf categories of our taxonomy. Ques-
tions that cannot be classied into the current taxonomy are placed
to a new category named Pending . We use Cohen’s Kappa ( 𝜅) [86] to
calculate the inter-rater agreement during the independent labeling.
The value of the inter-rater agreement is 0.836, which indicates
an almost perfect agreement [ 93] and reliable labeling procedure.
Existing conicts are then discussed and resolved by the rst two
authors and the third arbitrator. In addition, questions in Pending
category are also identied with the help of the third arbitrator,
and some new categories are added to our taxonomy. As a result,
ve new leaf categories are added and all questions in Pending can
be assigned into our taxonomy.
To sum up, for the 619 sampled questions, 4 questions are marked
asFalse positives and 17 questions are assigned into two categories.
As a result, 632 samples are contained in the nal taxonomy. Sec-
tion 6 answers RQ3.
4 RQ1: POPULARITY TREND
Figure 3 represents the popularity trend of serverless computing
in terms of the number of questions and users on SO. We nd
that this topic has been gaining increasing attention since 2015,
demonstrating the timeliness and urgency of this study.An Empirical Study on Challenges of Application Development in Serverless Computing ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece

For the topic of serverless computing, questions and users in-
crease in a steady trend as shown in Figure 3. Since Amazon rst
rolled out AWS Lambda in November 20142, the concept of server-
less computing has drawn widespread attention. We observe that
both the number of questions and users related to serverless com-
puting in 2016 increased by more than 340% compared to those of
2015. In addition, we calculate the annual growth rate of the SO
dataset as the baseline. We nd that the growth rate of SO ques-
tions and users from 2015 to 2020 ranges from 6% to 22%, while the
growth rate of questions and users related to serverless computing
ranges from 47% to 380%.
Finding 1 : The topic of serverless computing is gaining increas-
ing attention from developers, demonstrating the timeliness
and urgency of this study.
5 RQ2: DIFFICULTY LEVEL
Table 1 shows metrics %no acc. andresp time of serverless-related
questions and all SO questions. The values of %no acc. of serverless-
related questions and all SO questions are 61.5% and 48.3%, respec-
tively. The signicance of this dierence is ensured by the result
of the proportion test ( 𝜒2=1577, df = 1,𝑝-value 2.2e-16), indi-
cating that questions related to serverless computing have a larger
percentage of questions with no accepted answer. In addition, the
values of resp time of serverless-related questions and all SO ques-
tions are 190 and 35 minutes, respectively. It implies that questions
related to serverless computing need longer time to receive an
accepted answer.
Based on the table, we can nd that it is more challenging to
answer questions related to serverless computing than other SE
topics. In particular, 61.5% of questions related to serverless comput-
ing have no accepted answers, which is remarkably more frequent
than other SE topics, such as Web development (i.e., 48.0% [ 78]),
2https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-releases.htmlconcurrency (i.e., 43.8% [ 76]), and mobile (i.e., 55.0% [ 100]). In ad-
dition, it often takes non-trival time to respond questions related
to serverless computing (i.e., 190 min), which is substantially more
time-consuming than other SE topics, such as Web development
(i.e., 19 min [ 78]), concurrency(i.e., 42 min [ 76]), mobile (i.e., 55
min [ 100]). Since answers are often edited on SO, to make our
results more reliable, we also calculate the response time as the
time span between the creation time of a question and the last
editing time of its accepted answer. The obtained result is 242 min,
which is longer than our previous result (190 min). In summary,
answering questions related to serverless computing needs longer
time. Long answering time could sometimes be caused by lacking
experts [ 78]. However, the response time to receive an accepted
answer is still a well-adopted metric for diculty, since lacking
experts indicates that a large proportion of developers have not
yet mastered serverless-related development skills, making these
questions dicult to answer. Overall, our results demonstrate the
necessity of identifying the challenges behind questions related to
serverless computing.
Finding 2 : Questions related to serverless computing are more
challenging to answer than the average level of all SO questions
and other topics related to software development tasks, e.g.,
Web development, concurrency, and mobile.
6 RQ3: TAXONOMY OF CHALLENGES
Figure 4 illustrates the hierarchical taxonomy of challenges in de-
veloping serverless-based applications. Nodes are in descending
grey-level along with their depth in the hierarchy (e.g., leaf nodes
are in white). Each leaf node represents a leaf category and its non-
white parent node that consists of multiple categories is an inner
category . For example, Performance (G.6) is an inner category that
can be further divided into four leaf categories: Execution Latency
(G.6.1) ,Resource Utilization (G.6.2) ,Cold Startup (G.6.3) , and Through-
put (G.6.4) . The percentage for samples related to each category
is in the parentheses. In total, our taxonomy consists of 11 inner
categories and 36 leaf categories. We observe that when develop-
ing serverless-based applications, developers encounter problems
in a broad spectrum of aspects, which indicates the diversity of
challenges related to serverless computing. We next describe and
exemplify each category by groups, and report our ndings and
implications for developers, researchers, and cloud providers.
Finding 3 : The challenges that developers encounter have a
broad spectrum of 36 leaf categories ranging from Conceptual
Questions toVersion Control ,Programming Language Support
toDatabase Connection andResource Conguration toSecurity .
6.1 General Questions (A)
General questions represent the challenges involving no specic
implementation details, which are often proposed by developers
when they are looking for primary knowledge related to serverless
computing. Our results show that 7.9% of challenges belong to
general questions. We then discuss several categories in detail as
follows.ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece Jinfeng Wen, Zhenpeng Chen, Yi Liu, Yiling Lou, Yun Ma, Gang Huang, Xin Jin, and Xuanzhe Liu

Figure 4: Taxonomy of challenges in developing serverless-based applications.
Conceptional Questions (A.1) This category represents ques-
tions about basic concepts or background knowledge of serverless
computing, such as how AWS Lambda works [ 1] and the dierence
between functions in idle state and not [ 9]. Answerers mainly han-
dle these questions by providing documentation-like information or
translate the jargon-heavy documentation into case-specic guid-
ance phrased in a developer-friendly way. In our taxonomy, 5.5% of
the total challenges appear in conceptional questions. It illustrates
that developers are eager to gain a comprehensive understanding
of concepts related to serverless computing.
Platform/Tool Support (A.2) Developers wonder whether a
certain serverless platform or development tool can satisfy their
specic requirements. Specically, for serverless platforms, devel-
opers may have concerns about hard restrictions (e.g., memory [ 10])
or task types (e.g., machine learning [ 11]). For development tools
likeServerless Framework [72], developers often ask whether certain
features, e.g., user authentication [12], are integrated with them.
Cloud Service Comparison (A.3) Developers may have chal-
lenges in understanding and choosing cloud services with similar
functionality. For example, it is often confusing for developers to
choose an appropriate database service in their functions, since
there are often various database services, such as Amazon Dy-
namoDB [58] and RDS [59].
Finding 4 : 7.9% of the total challenges occur before actual prac-
tices and are classied in General Questions . Among the three
categories, Conceptual Questions is the largest one, accounting
for 70.0% of challenges in General Questions .Discussion and implication: Our results show that developers
encounter frequent challenges related to the basic concepts be-
fore actual practices. We further analyze the conceptual questions
and nd that there are mainly three aspects of understanding, i.e.,
underlying working mechanism, proprietary terms, and platform-
specic restrictions. Developers need to spend non-negligible time
on learning the required knowledge, especially proprietary terms
and platform-specic restrictions, and think more about the work-
ing mechanism of serverless platforms. Questions of the underlying
working mechanism are asked frequently in the way of how it works .
Thus, cloud providers can supplement more organized documents
to help developers search them and alleviate concerns.
With the popularity of machine learning and deep learning,
more and more applications need to deal with data-intensive and
computation-intensive tasks. However, due to inherent restrictions
of serverless platforms (e.g., memory, storage, package size, and
execution time), both data-processing applications with a large data-
base and machine-learning applications with large libraries like
TensorFlow cannot be handled normally. Thus, developers have
to indirectly implement such serverless-based applications with
other strategies that may increase the development complexity.
Specically, to avoid transmitting a large volume of data through
the network, developers need to use other storage services to save
query results [ 10]. They also need to pay attention to keep an e-
cient database connection to avoid exceeding the execution time
limit. In addition, machine-learning applications may run for a long
time with high memory demands, whose cost will skyrocket. The
answerer suggests “ you will be better o with something like EC2 and
ECS” [11]. Thus, such computation-intensive applications may be
more suitable to use the “traditional” IaaS paradigms such as virtualAn Empirical Study on Challenges of Application Development in Serverless Computing ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece
machines or containers compared to serverless computing. More-
over, existing serverless platforms do not support GPU well, which
can prevent fast-growing deep-learning tasks. If developers hope to
enjoy advantages in simplifying the application development, cloud
providers need to lift some restrictions of serverless platforms to
support various workloads. Currently, serverless-based applications
are most commonly used for running short-lived, transient, and
even emergent tasks with low data volume and hardware capacity.
6.2 Application Design (B)
The challenges of application design account for 16.3% of the to-
tal challenges. On the one hand, developers need to develop a
serverless-based application from scratch, so they ask questions
about specic functionality design in a serverless way. On the other
hand, developers may have legacy applications, and want to migrate
them to serverless platforms, in order to simplify the development,
improve performance, and save cost. Thus, migration-related ques-
tions are issued. In addition, it is inevitable to ask questions about
programming language support in this stage. Detailed leaf cate-
gories are illustrated as follows.
Functionality Design (B.1) This category covers design-related
challenges for implementing specic functionalities during the de-
velopment of a new serverless-based application. They are often
described with the key words “best approach”, such as “ What is the
best approach for generating thumbnails [...]? ” [2]. Answerers handle
these questions by providing specic design steps or alternative
options.
Application Migration (B.2) This category describes challenges
in migrating from legacy applications to serverless-based applica-
tions. Developers wonder whether or how legacy applications can
be migrated and run on serverless platforms, e.g., “ Is it possible to
run Beautiful Soup [...] on AWS Lambda? ” [13] and “ How can run
Rails web app in AWS Lambda server ” [14]. In addition, developers
may need to migrate existing serverless-based applications due
to the platform update or development tools update, so they may
ask how to migrate integrated resources and services in Serverless
Framework from version 0.5 to 1.0 in a safe manner [15].
Programming Language Support (B.3) This category covers
challenges about the programming language support. They are
often considered in the situation of constructing functions with
dierent programming languages, e.g., “ AWS lambda with both
python and java language support ” [16]. Developers also prefer
to develop functions with the daily used language, e.g., creating
Openwhisk actions with Swift [17].
Finding 5 : The third-largest category in proportion (i.e., 16.3%)
covers the challenges appearing in the Application Design stage.
The majority (67.0%) of these challenges are thrown with Func-
tionality Design .
Discussion and implication: In the application design stage, de-
velopers frequently ask Functionality Design -related questions. It
shows that developers look forward to obtaining the guidance of
best practices or examples for their requirements. Cloud providers
should provide more practical function templates and detailed in-
structions to help developers construct their functions more easily
and quickly. We further observe that the most questions (about 90%)discuss the functionality design integrating other services that are
provided by the same cloud providers. This is a common pattern for
developing serverless-based applications, since integrating such ser-
vices can simplify the development of serverless-based applications
and improve their performance. However, it can be challenging for
developers to design functions with such a large number of cloud
services. Thus, both researchers and cloud providers can summarize
a standard design specication to help developers better construct
their functions with cloud services. For example, if cloud providers
can maintain a function store, it may be convenient for develop-
ers to reuse existing functions to construct their serverless-based
applications. In addition, it can further make the serverless-based
application development more compositional in nature.
With the popularity of serverless computing, the trend of migrat-
ing legacy applications to serverless platforms may also increase.
Thus, the design issues arising from application migration need to
be solved urgently. Both researchers and cloud providers can pay
more attention to the migration approach of legacy applications to
guide developers in practice. For example, researchers can identify
and refactor specic APIs with dynamic and static analysis. Cloud
providers can further support more mostly-used frameworks (e.g.,
Web frameworks like Spring ) so that developers directly run their
legacy applications on serverless platforms.
With serverless computing, it is easier for developers to develop
their applications with dierent languages (as known as hybrid
programming). In a collaborative team, dierent developers can
construct their functions with their own familiar languages, and
dierent functions will be hosted in a dedicated instance and com-
municate with each other. However, not all languages are well
supported. Cloud providers can further support more languages
and optimize their run-time performance. Every coin has two sides.
It is notable that hybrid programming can also increase the complex-
ity of the serverless-based application development, especially for
testing and debugging, which should be addressed by researchers
with more advanced code analysis techniques.
6.3 Environment Conguration (C)
Developers install and congure local environments for further
development. 5.9% of the total challenges are related to the envi-
ronment conguration, and detailed leaf categories are explained
as follows.
Tool Installation (C.1) This category represents challenges in
installing development tools (e.g., AWS CLIs, Azure CLIs, and Server-
less Framework ) for serverless-based applications. When developers
fail to install Serverless Framework , they may ask the question like
“Unable to install serverless framework on macosx ” [18]. Based on our
observations from all answers and comments, we nd that most
installation problems are caused by incorrectly conguring system
variables and missing specic dependencies.
Tool Usage (C.2) This category represents challenges in using
related development tools. They often happen when the command
parameters are used incorrectly. For example, developers fail to
update the value of EventSourceArn of a Lambda function with an
update command, which is caused by the incorrectly congured
parameter “ EventSourceArn ” in the update command [19].ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece Jinfeng Wen, Zhenpeng Chen, Yi Liu, Yiling Lou, Yun Ma, Gang Huang, Xin Jin, and Xuanzhe Liu
Version Compatibility (C.3) This category refers to challenges
in dealing with certain versions of tools. Specically, we nd that
commands may not run correctly due to the inherent bugs in cer-
tain versions [ 20] or the incorrect usage of package versions [ 3].
For example, developers ask that the command “project” is not
found for Serverless Framework [3]. After checking answers, the
solution is to use the 0.5.x version of Serverless Framework instead
of the 1.x version, because the 1.x version implements the “services”
command to to replace the “project” command. Therefore, ensuring
version compatibility is a prerequisite that cannot be ignored in the
environment conguration.
Finding 6 : The challenges of development environment cong-
uration (5.9%) include tool installation and usage, and version
compatibility. Version Compatibility is dominating, accounting
for 40.5% of the challenges in Environment Conguration .
Discussion and implication: In the environment conguration
stage, how to install the appropriate version is the main concern for
developers. Based on our observations, developers may use incor-
rect versions of tools, and endure inherent bugs of certain versions.
The rapid evolution of development tools is making it challeng-
ing for developers to install the appropriate version, not only in
the serverless-based application development, but also in many
other software tasks, e.g., deep learning deployment [ 84] and soft-
ware build [ 95]. Therefore, it is necessary for researchers to deliver
more consistency detection techniques for version compatibility
checking.
6.4 Low-Code Development (D)
The signicant feature of serverless computing is to represent infras-
tructure as code [ 66] that simplies the management (i.e., creation
and modication) of resources. Developers use the cloud console or
a denition le written in JSON or YAML format to integrate with
needed resources, which is known as low-code development [68].
This category covers challenges about low-code development and
accounts for 19.6% of the total challenges. Detailed leaf categories
are illustrated as follows.
Provider/Function Conguration (D.1) This category refers
to challenges about congurations of cloud providers or functions.
They often occur during the event and permission congurations.
For the event conguration, the event source can be Amazon API
Gateway [ 57], with which functions can be invoked once receiving
an HTTPS request. In our study, we nd that developers encounter
request-related problems like “ dening the request mapping template
in serverless.yml ” [21]. Additionally, the event source may come
from other services (e.g., storage service like Amazon S3 [ 60]),
which will be triggered when an object is added to a bucket on S3 [ 4].
Compared to developing a monolithic application, developers often
need to specify the permissions of a function, such as the permission
of accessing the network, the permission to access other services. If
not correctly congured, the function will fail to access the target
service due to access denied [ 22]. In addition, there are also some
conguration challenges, such as choosing the appropriate region
of cloud providers [ 23], specifying the function timeout [ 24], etc.
Interestingly, we also nd that even a small mistake in the denition
le, e.g., wrong indentation [ 25] and typos of specic terms [ 26],can result in catastrophic consequences. However, there are few
eective tools to deal with such urgent problems.
Resource Conguration (D.2) This category represents chal-
lenges about the conguration of integrated resources in the serverless-
based application. Developers congure specications (e.g., data-
base name, table information, etc.) when integrating other cloud
services (e.g., Amazon DynamoDB) [ 27]. Other functions can also be
referenced as resources to compose a complicated serverless-based
application [28].
Custom Conguration (D.3) In addition to the above congu-
rations, developers may have personalized requirements, i.e., cus-
tom conguration. For example, developers try to specify a new
response template with HTTP status to a redirect web page [ 29].
However, they nd “ I can do it manually with AWS lambda user in-
terface but I need to do it with serverless framework version v1. ”. It also
reects the challenges in writing the conguration le compared
to the convenient user interface provided by cloud providers.
Finding 7 : The challenges on Low-Code Development account
for the second-largest percentage (i.e., 19.6%) of the total chal-
lenges. Provider/Function Conguration is the top category, ac-
counting for 56.5% of the challenges in Low-Code Development .
Discussion and implication: Low-code development is a feature
of developing serverless-based applications, eectively simplifying
the integration of cloud services and management of functions.
However, the related challenges even account for 19.6%, which is
the second-largest category in proportion. Answerers mainly solve
these problems by providing code snippets of specic congura-
tions or modifying existing errors. It shows that developers lack a
comprehensive conguration specication to guide them, and they
are in urgent need of the supported tools. For cloud providers, they
can provide more instructions and examples, especially the event
and permission settings, to satisfy various conguration require-
ments. For framework developers, they can abstract the underlying
dierences of dierent serverless platforms, and provide a unied
standard so that developers do not need to spend much time on
browsing tedious documentations. For researchers, they can sum-
marize the common issues of low-code developments, and extend
existing code analysis tools and validation tools to help developers
better nd the bugs and mistakes of congurations.
6.5 Application Implementation (E)
Developers focus on the application logic without management
underlying infrastructure in serverless computing. Any application
code written by developers can be executed on serverless platforms.
In our taxonomy, the challenges asked by developers most fre-
quently are application implementation accounting for 35.4% of the
total challenges. There are 3 inner categories (i.e., E.2,E.4andE.6)
and 11 leaf categories. Detailed categories are explained as follows.
Functionality Implementation (E.1) This category refers to
challenges in the implementation of specic functionalities. We nd
that there are two types in this category, including both serverless-
unrelated and serverless-related functionality implementations. For
example, developers make a mistake in reading a CSV le [ 30], and
it is a serverless-unrelated functionality implementation problem.An Empirical Study on Challenges of Application Development in Serverless Computing ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece
Another example is a serverless-related functionality implementa-
tion like “ updating AWS S3 object metadata through boto3 ” [31].
Package Integration (E.2) This category represents challenges
encountered in using third-party libraries in functions. Specically,
when developers prepare to use the method of a certain library, they
must import its package beforehand but may encounter import-
related challenges ( E.2.1). They are mainly in the import of external
libraries [ 32], which is generally solved through modifying the
package path. After importing required packages, especially when
using database services, developers need to establish a connection
in advance [ 33], and challenges on conguring and connecting such
services ( E.2.2 ) occur. Besides, developers may be incorrect to use
methods of third-party libraries( E.2.3 ).
Asynchronous Processing (E.3) This category covers chal-
lenges in dealing with asynchronous activities in a function. Due to
the event-driven nature of serverless computing, functions written
byJavaScript often apply asynchronous callbacks with async ,await ,
andpromise . However, many developers fail to correctly use these
features to construct their functions [34].
Data Processing (E.4) This category covers questions about
data processing. Converting raw data into the required format( E.4.1)
is an important factor so that functions can successfully resolve
data from triggered events [ 35]. Meanwhile, formatting the result
(E.4.2 ) is critical so that users can obtain the correct response [ 36].
There are also some incorrect data processing problems caused by
syntax errors ( E.4.3 ) [37].
Debugging and Testing (E.5) This category represents chal-
lenges on debugging and testing of functions. Most questions are
about debugging and they are often described in the format of “ how
to debug ” [38].
Function Invocation (E.6) Developers can incorporate multi-
ple functions in a single serverless-based application, and these
functions can be invoked internally. This category represents chal-
lenges in invoking functions with dierent invocation methods
and parameters. Most functions are congured to be triggered by
Amazon API Gateway, so most challenges are related to supporting
various HTTP methods ( E.6.1), e.g., “ POST ” and “ GET” [39]. Other
challenges are to transmit data parameters to functions ( E.6.2 ), e.g.,
JSON-format payload [40] or binary data [41].
Finding 8 : Most (i.e. 35.4%) of the challenges occur in the Ap-
plication Implementation stage, covering a wide spectrum of
11 leaf categories. Package Integration andFunctionality Imple-
mentation are the top two categories, accounting for 30.8% and
21.4% of challenges in this stage, respectively.
Discussion and implication: Our results show that package in-
tegration is the most common problem in the application imple-
mentation stage. Especially, developers have to pay more attention
to keeping the connection of database service in order to conform
to the timeout limit of functions. Such problems may even not
throw any exceptions [ 42], which are dicult to detect and de-
bug for developers. For cloud providers, they can further improve
their log/monitoring services (e.g., Amazon CloudWatch ) to pro-
vide detailed logs and descriptions of error information, which can
help developers better locate their bad code. For researchers, they
can extend the existing analysis and diagnosis technologies withconsideration of characteristics of serverless-based applications.
Meanwhile, the unied programming model also needs to be stud-
ied to simplify developers’ development issues on multiple dierent
serverless platforms.
We also nd that another big bottleneck is functionality imple-
mentation. In this category, the rst two authors manually check
these posts and nd that serverless-unrelated and serverless-related
functionality implementations account for 33.3% and 66.7%, re-
spectively. It illustrates that the serverless computing paradigm
increases the programming diculty of developers, although reduc-
ing most operational tasks. On the one hand, cloud providers can
further simplify the programming model for serverless-based appli-
cations. On the other hand, cloud providers can also provide mature
development and debugging tools to assist developers’ development.
The challenge of debugging and testing tools is also found in the cat-
egory ( E.5) of our taxonomy. Traditional tools are not fully suitable
for serverless-based applications, and new approaches are needed.
Additionally, developers should avoid common pitfalls obtained
from asynchronous processing and data processing, e.g., use of
asynchronous statements, data parsing of the event, and format
setting of the response, etc.
6.6 Application Deployment (F)
After implementing serverless-based applications, developers can
deploy their applications to serverless platforms. Developers can
package their functions and dependent libraries into a single bundle,
and upload them to serverless platforms. Therefore, this category
is deployment-related problems, accounting for 4.4% of the total
challenges. Detailed leaf categories are explained as follows.
Procedure (F.1) This category describes questions about the
procedure of a specic deployment, such as whether it is possible
to deploy the same package to dierent cloud providers [43].
Packaging (F.2) This category represents challenges in packag-
ing all code and dependent libraries of a serverless-based applica-
tion. Developers often fail to package all related les in the correct
format [ 44], and may also encounter the problem of exceeding the
package size limit.
Deployment Tool Usage (F.3) This category refers to chal-
lenges in correctly using commands of deployment tools. For in-
stance, the command “ sls resources deploy ” used by developers is
incorrect [ 45], and instead the command “ sls deploy ” should be
used.
Finding 9 :Application Deployment is the development stage
where developers ask the least questions. It accounts for 4.4%
of the total challenges, and contains Procedure ,Packaging , and
Deployment Tool Usage categories.
Discussion and implication: We further analyze Procedure and
Deployment Tool Usage categories and nd that developers have
diverse deployment requirements, e.g., deploying with a specic
version, deploying with an environment variable, or deploying the
same package to multiple cloud providers, etc. For cloud providers,
they can think about how to facilitate various deployment require-
ments. For example, cloud providers provide a custom deployment
template to ll in the necessary and optional information (e.g., ver-
sion and environment variable), and then apply the deployment toolESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece Jinfeng Wen, Zhenpeng Chen, Yi Liu, Yiling Lou, Yun Ma, Gang Huang, Xin Jin, and Xuanzhe Liu
to complete the deployment tasks with this template. In addition,
for the size limit of the deployment package, researchers can work
on more analysis techniques to identify and remove unused code or
les to reduce the package size of the serverless-based application.
6.7 Non-Functional Properties (G)
Developers may consider some non-functional properties in the
development of serverless-based applications. 10.4% of the total
challenges are about non-functional properties. Specic categories
are introduced as follows.
Networking (G.1) A function might integrate with external ser-
vices (internal or publically hosted Web services, cloud services,
databases, etc.) via the network. Thus, challenges related to net-
working occur, and they are mainly in Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
conguration. Some services can only be accessed by a function
under the same VPC. For instance, Lambda functions connect to
the Amazon RDS (i.e., a relational database) instances through the
public Internet, but it fails due to a wrong VPC conguration [7].
Monitoring (G.2) This category represents questions about
monitoring for serverless-based applications, e.g., whether all func-
tions are completed normally [46].
Version Control (G.3) This category is mainly involved with
the version management of serverless-based applications. Devel-
opers may be looking forward to an update or rollback version
for applications [ 47]. Thus, serverless-based applications require
version management like traditional applications using Git.
Cost (G.4) This category covers challenges about the billing
model of serverless computing. Although serverless computing
charges in a pay-as-you-go manner, there are still some concerns for
developers. It is more dicult to predict the cost of a function, such
as calculating the cost of the main function for a nested application
when multiple functions are orchestrated in the main function [ 48].
Concurrency (G.5) This category represents questions about
dealing with concurrent requests. They are often limited by the
inherent concurrency strategy of dierent serverless platforms,
such as concurrency number [49] and execution time [50].
Performance (G.6) This category represents questions about
application performance. First, for execution latency ( G.6.1 ), devel-
opers try to present a certain strategy to speed up the execution
latency of functions. For example, developers can speed up the date
loading and save the network bandwidth by compressing data [ 51].
Second, for resource utilization ( G.6.2 ), developers nd competi-
tion between resources, such as I/O and CPU [ 52]. Third, for cold
startup ( G.6.3 ), when an invocation occurs for a function for the
rst time, this invocation is experiencing a cold startup and creating
a function container. This container remains active and available
for subsequent invocations for at least a few minutes before it is
terminated. Developers often invoke a function periodically to re-
duce cold startup, i.e., “keeping warm” [ 53]. Finally, for throughput
(G.6.4 ), developers look for ways to improve throughput, e.g., the
read capacity of a database [54].
Security (G.7) Serverless computing hides infrastructure man-
agement from developers, but such opacity may increase concerns
on security. They are mainly in the endpoint protection of func-
tions [ 55] and data protection between functions [ 56]. Answerersmainly solve such questions by applying authentication and en-
cryption on the endpoint and communication.
Finding 10 : 10.4% of the total challenges are in Non-Functional
Properties covering 10 leaf categories. Networking and Per-
formance (53.0% in total) are the top two categories in Non-
Functional Properties .
Discussion and implication: Our results show that two biggest
challenges are networking and performance in non-functional prop-
erties. Specically, networking-related challenges are VPC settings.
Developers can strengthen the networking knowledge, especially
the VPC conguration process. For performance-related challenges,
developers expect to improve performance from dierent perspec-
tives, i.e., execution latency, resource utilization, cold startup, and
throughput. Particularly, the performance of serverless platforms
is a broad topic in academia. For example, some measurement
work [ 96,107,110] evaluated the performance of dierent server-
less platforms from the execution latency of functions, resource
utilization, throughput, etc. Moreover, some studies [ 77,99,103]
minimized cold startup to improve execution eciency through
system optimization or sandboxing design. By comparison, we nd
that academia and industry have similar focuses in terms of per-
formance. In this situation, researchers can consider improving
performance from the perspective of the developer practice, e.g.,
using data compression to reduce network overhead [ 51]. In addi-
tion, we nd that developers ask fewer questions about Performance
(2.4%) than Application Implication (35.4%). This observation coin-
cides with the observation of other work [ 76], i.e., developers ask
more about the correctness of their programs than performance.
Under the serverless computing paradigm, the version control
and billing model still face new challenges, e.g., the version update
and rollback of a project (or development environment or cong-
uration), and cost prediction for function retry. Thus, to promote
the use of serverless computing, researchers can design version
control tools that conform to this new programming paradigm, and
cloud providers try to provide a more user-friendly billing model
to reduce the cost of non-real function execution.
7 THREATS TO VALIDITY
In this section, we discuss threats to the validity of our study.
Selection bias of data source. Similar to previous research [ 76,
78,80,95,100,109,111], our work uses SO as the only data source
to study the challenges that developers encounter, which may over-
look useful insights from other data sources. Thus, we plan to
expand our analysis to other data sources in future work, further
verifying our ndings. Nevertheless, because SO data contains posts
from both novices and experts [ 112], we believe that our ndings
and implications are still valid.
Construction of tag set. We use a set of tags to extract SO ques-
tions related to serverless computing. However, since the chosen
thresholds for signicance and relevance metrics may omit some
tags related to serverless computing, we cannot guarantee the tag
set is complete. To mitigate this threat, we adopt the lowest thresh-
olds used in previous work [ 80,95] to include as many relevant
tags as possible. Furthermore, we rene the tag set through further
manual inspection to ensure the precision.An Empirical Study on Challenges of Application Development in Serverless Computing ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece
Subjectivity of researchers. In this study, we adopt manual
analysis to construct the taxonomy of challenges. The manual anal-
ysis may pose threats to the validity of our taxonomy. In order
to minimize this threat, the rst two authors and an experienced
arbitrator discuss and reach an agreement for conicts. Meanwhile,
we calculate the inter-rater agreement as 0.836, which is relatively
high and indicates the reliability of our labeling procedure.
Saturation of taxonomy. When classifying the remaining 30%
of questions, we discover ve new categories that are added to
the nal taxonomy. It may raise the uncertainty about the level
of completeness of our taxonomy. However, the number of newly-
added categories in this study is smaller than that in previous
work [ 84], and these categories contain few questions (no more
than ve). Thus, our taxonomy is relatively complete. Meanwhile,
the taxonomy is carefully checked by the third arbitrator with seven
years of cloud computing experience.
8 RELATED WORK
In this section, we summarize related work of serverless computing
as well as empirical studies on challenges that developers encounter
in the widely used techniques.
Studies on serverless computing. Serverless computing is a
new trending paradigm of cloud computing, and lots of related
studies have been proposed. First, some work [ 96,103,107,110]
has evaluated dierent serverless platforms from various aspects.
For example, Wang et al. [107] conducted a measurement study to
characterize the architectures, performance, and resource eciency
for commercial serverless platforms. Mohanty et al. [96] compared
the features and performance of open-source implementations of
serverless computing. Second, some work [ 88,94] has analyzed the
characteristic of serverless-based applications to guide the design of
approaches related to serverless computing. Furthermore, some lit-
erature reviews have been conducted to understand the gap related
to serverless computing in academia and industry [ 101,105]. Dif-
ferent from the previous work of serverless computing, our study
focuses on the specic challenges that developers encounter in
developing serverless-based applications.
Studies on developers’ challenges. Many studies have inves-
tigated the software developers’ perspectives by mining Q&A web-
sites. Particularly, several empirical studies have leveraged SO data
on dierent domains such as machine learning [ 78], deep learning
deployment [ 84], mobile [ 100], security [ 109], big data [ 80], con-
currency [ 76], etc. Specically, Alshangiti et al. [78] conducted an
empirical study of machine learning-related posts on SO to under-
stand the challenges that developers face in developing machine
learning applications. Chen et al. [84] presented a comprehensive
study to explore what specic challenges developers face when
deploying DL software. Ahmed et al. [76] understood the concur-
rent programming problem that developers often encounter when
writing concurrent code. In similar, Bagherzadeh et al. [80] investi-
gated interests and diculties of big data developers by analyzing
SO posts, while Rosen et al. [100] examined what mobile develop-
ers ask about. Considering the increasing popularity of serverless
computing, in this work, we make the rst attempt to investigate
challenges that developers related to serverless computing may
encounter.9 CONCLUSION
Through analyzing SO questions related to serverless computing,
we have found that the topic of serverless computing is gaining
increasing attention among software engineers. Furthermore, we
have demonstrated that questions related to serverless computing
are more dicult to answer than other challenging topics in SE,
e.g., Web development, concurrency, mobile, which motivates us
to identify the specic challenges behind them. We have manually
inspected 619 sampled questions related to serverless computing
and constructed a comprehensive taxonomy, including 11 inner
categories and 36 leaf categories, representing challenges that de-
velopers encounter in developing serverless-based applications.
In addition, our study also provide a series of practical ndings
and actionable implications for developers, researchers, and cloud
providers, intending to highlight good practices and interesting
research avenues in adopting the serverless computing paradigm.
