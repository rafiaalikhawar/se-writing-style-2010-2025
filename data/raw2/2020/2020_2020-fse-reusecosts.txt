ABSTRACT
Softwarereuselowersdevelopmentcostsandimprovesthequal-
ityofsoftwaresystems.Twostrategiesarecommon:clone&own
(copyingandadaptingasystem)andplatform-orientedreuse(build-
ingaconfigurableplatform).Theformerisreadilyavailable,flexible,
and initially cheap, butdoesnot scale with the frequency of reuse,
imposing high maintenance costs. The latter scales, but imposes
high upfront investments for building the platform, and reduces
flexibility. As such, each strategy has distinctive advantages and
disadvantages, imposingdifferent development activitiesand soft-
ware architectures. Deciding for one strategy is a core decision
with long-term impact on an organization’s software development.
Unfortunately,thestrategies’costsarenotwell-understoodÐnot
surprisingly,giventhelackofsystematicallyelicitedempiricaldata,
whichisdifficulttocollect.Wepresentanempiricalstudyofthede-
velopmentactivities,costs,costfactors,andbenefitsassociatedwith

qualitative data that we triangulated from 26 interviews at a large
organization anda systematicliterature review covering 57 publi-
cations. Our study both confirms and refutes common hypotheses
on software reuse. For instance, we confirm that developing for
platform-oriented reuseis more expensive,butsimultaneouslyre-
ducesreusecosts;andthatplatform-orientationresultsinhigher
code quality compared to clone&own. Surprisingly, refuting com-
mon hypotheses, we find that change propagation can be more

startwithclone&own,which iswell-supportedbyversion-control
systems, such as Git (branching and merging), and by software-
hostingplatforms,suchasGitHub(forkingandpullrequests)[ 39,

maintenance easily becomes a challenge, for instance, when devel-
opersneedtopropagatechanges,bugfixes,orfeatures.Developers

Intheplatform-oriented strategy,developersimplementasin-
glecodebasefromwhichtheycanderiveindividualvariants,typ-
icallyusingmethodsandtoolsknownfromsoftwareproduct-line
engineering (SPLE)[ 1,24,29,104]. A platform employs variabil-
ity mechanismsÐtechniques to implement variation points (e.g.,
preprocessors, components, or runtime parameters), typically con-
trolled by features. The features abstractly represent the variability
and are typically organized ina feature model[ 29,56,87]; a tree-
like structure of features and their constraints. Using, for instance,
configurator tools or dedicated build systems, developers derive
individual variants (i.e., reuse software) by enabling or disabling

features. This strategy is usually advocated for systems with many
variants, including highly configurable systems, such as the Linux
kernel, which boasts over 15,000 configuration options today, al-
lowing it to run on a range of hardware environments, from small
embedded devices to large super-computer clusters. Unfortunately,
adopting a platform requires large initial investments into archi-
tectingandcreatingtheplatform,adoptingSPLEmethodsandtools
(e.g.,variabilitymechanisms,featuremodels,configurators),aswell
as training and (re-)organizing development teams, before bene-
fits can be achieved,such as substantiallyreduced time-to-market
through the automated derivation of new variants as well as re-
ducedmaintenanceefforts[ 60,66,67,95,104].Incaseofmigrating
fromclone&own,anorganizationneedstore-engineersoftware

structure,anddevelopmentprocess[ 79].
Over the last decades, numerous studies focused on software
reuse[4,5,11,16,19ś25,33ś37,42,50,66,72,81ś84,97,101,103,
104], many of which also describe the migration from clone&own
towards a software platform as the most common way to adopt
platformsinpractice[ 9,31,65].Suchstudiesindicatethatthemain-
tenance burden of clone&own becomes the main problem lead-
ing organizations to adopt a platform strategy. Still, to the best
of our knowledge, most studies discuss the advantages and dis-
advantages of either strategy based on personal experiences and
educated guesses. The fundamental question remains: Whatcosts
areassociatedwitheitherreusestrategy,andunderwhatcir-
cumstancesiswhichstrategypreferable? Answeringthisques-
tion based on empirical data provides a means for organizations to
reason more reliably on several practical decisionsÐfor instance,
whethertoadoptaplatformforaneworexistingsetofvariants.
Ourlong-termgoalistoestablishqualitativecriteria,measurement
techniques, and decision models to support the decision making of
organizationsdevelopingmanyvariantsofasoftwaresystem,as
well as to enhance theirconfidence intheirdecisions.
Wepresentastudyoftheactivities(e.g.,bugfixing),costs(i.e.,
money or developers’ efforts spent[ 102]), cost factors (i.e., project
propertiesimpactingcosts),andbenefits(i.e.,savings)thatareas-
sociatedwiththedevelopmentprocessofnewvariantsusingeither
strategyÐclone&own and platform-oriented reuse. Specifically,
we conducted (1) an interview study with 28 practitioners from
a large organization (i.e., Axis) that employs both strategies, and
(2) a systematic literature review (SLR)[ 58,59]. The SLR comple-
ments our interview data with an analysis of the insights and data
providedincasestudiesandexperiencereports.Bytriangulating
from both sources, we provide consolidated quantitative data, dis-
tributions (e.g., costs in per cent), and qualitative arguments on
developmentcosts,costfactors,andbenefits.Wecombinedthetwo
sourcestoaddresstheproblemthatcostsinsoftwareengineering
arehardtoquantifyandassigntospecificactivities[ 43,53,55,102].
In fact, few studies report quantitative data, and often only on a
subset ofthe relevant costs.Since expertestimationsare a widely
used, reliable estimation method[ 13,43,52,85], perform compa-
rable to or better than other cost estimation methods (e.g., cost
models)[ 52,54,85], and can be improved based on analogies to
historical data[ 13,53,54], our two sources provide a reasonablebasis for eliciting data. Based on that data, we also discuss the evi-
dencewefindforconfirmingorrefutingcommonhypothesesabout
software reuse.Our study is ofthe rare breed thataddresses this
problembyprovidingevidencebasedonempiricaldatareported

novel insights on processes and costs, as well as a synthesis of
existingstudiestoconfirmorrefutecommonhypotheses.Bothof
these aspects are novel and important, seeing that Axis spent a
significantamountoftimeandeffortsupportingourstudy.More-
over, other companies (e.g., Grundfos) initiated discussions with us
regardingthisstudy,providedpositivefeedbackindicatingthatthe
dataisreasonable,andhave usedourresultstoanalyzetheirown
processes, adding evidence regarding the importanceof our study.
In summary,we contribute:
•Empiricaldataonthecostsandcostfactorsassociatedwiththe
activities ofclone&ownandplatform-orientedsoftware reuse.
•A discussion of evidence we find for confirming or refuting com-
mon hypotheses onsoftware reuse.
•A replication package with our interview guide and the data we

that ends with the delivery of the specified variant. A development
process comprises a number of activities, such as scoping the vari-
ant or bug fixing, performed by the organization’s developers . Each
activity involves costs, for which we consider monetary spendings
as wellas developers’ effort (e.g.,person hours)[ 102]. Finally, cost
factors (a.k.a., cost drivers) represent any project property that im-
pactsthe costsofimplementing the variant.Thesefactors maybe

2.2 Research Objectives
We addressthree researchobjectives (RO) inour study:
RO1Identifytheprocessanditsrespectiveactivitiesthatpractitioners
employto reusesoftwarefornew variants.
During our collaborations with industrial practitioners[ 8,10,
70,87], we experienced that the idea of using either pure
clone&ownorafull-fledgedplatformrarelyapplies.These
experiencesmotivatedthisobjectiveofidentifyingthepro-
cesses andactivities ofsoftware reuse inpractice.
RO2Identifythecostsassociated withtheactivities.
Based onour data,weaimed to identifytheimpactofeither
reuse strategy on the costs of the activities identified. This
information can help to decide for a reuse strategy and to
determineactivities that are more challenging to perform.
RO3Analyzethecost factorsthat impact eitherreusestrategy.
Finally, we aimed to understand the cost factors impacting
the reuse strategies, which helps to identify those that are
importanttoconsiderforcostestimationsandcanpotentially
be altered(e.g.,involvingmore developers) to reduce costs.
So, we analyze cost factors also based on economical benefits
(i.e.,reducedcosts)that we identified.
Next, we describe how we elicited data to address these objectives.
2.3 Collecting Data with Interviews
We conducted interviews with practitioners to collect data regard-
ing our research objectives. In Table 1, we summarize our inter-
views,whose identifiers (column ID) we use as references.
Interviewees. Our interview study relied on a close collaboration
withasystemarchitectandaproductmanager(i.e.,interviewsI 8
andI9)atAxisCommunicationsAB whohaveanoverviewofthe

Axis develops network equipment, including network cameras,
print servers, camera servers, scanner servers, and storage servers.
Together with our contacts, we sampled 26 intervieweesÐwho we

architects) to obtain a broad perspective on their reuse practices.
The majorityof ourinterviewees is involvedinthe development of
the organization’s large portfolio of network cameras. Ourinter-
vieweesreported between three to over 20years of experiences in
one or both reuse strategiesÐconsidering solely their current posi-
tion,whileseveralreportedtoalsohaveexperiencesfromprevious
organizations.Weusuallyinterviewedoneintervieweeatatime,
but twice we involved two interviewees in one interview (i.e., I 7,
I12), and regularly discussed our objectives with both of our two
main contact persons (i.e.,I 8,I9) at Axis at the same time.
Interview Design. We structured our 26 interviews into three
different phases: exploration, process definition, and cost assess-
ment. During the first two phases, we conducted unstructured and
semi-structured interviews without fixed guidelines, but instead
had open discussions, taking notes in parallel. For the third phase,
we used our insights to construct a guide for semi-structured in-
terviews. During this phase, we recorded all but one interview
(personalpreferenceoftheinterviewee)andtranscribedthemlater.
Inaddition,wetooknotesduringeachinterview.Forallinterviews,
we allowed our interviewees to look up actual dataif they needed
or wanted to, enriching their knowledge with some concrete num-
bers, for instance, on variant sizes, development histories, or team
compositions.However,inmostcasesourintervieweesreliedon
theirknowledge andexperience.

We started withseven exploratory interviews that took around
half an hour each. Duringthis initial phase,we were interestedin
understandingthegeneralstrategiesandpoliciesof reuseat Axis.
With our two main contacts, we scoped the remaining two phases
of our interview study, also considering previous works and our
experiences from collaboratingwithotherorganizations.
Intheprocessdefinition phase,weconductedfivesemi-structured
interviews.Ourgoalwastorefineourpreviousinsightstoconstruct
the reuseprocesses that are employed at Axis, and to identify cost
factors. Finally, we agreed on a consolidated reuse process (i.e.,
integrating clone&own and platform-oriented reuse) and a set
of 10 activities together with our contacts, which is why these
interviewstook farlonger thanthe intendedone hour.
In the last phase, we aimed to quantitatively and qualitatively
assess the costs and cost factors associated with the activities we
identified.Weconstructedasemi-structuredinterviewguide,which
weusedfor14interviews.Ineachinterview,weaskedourintervie-
wees to assess the costs of developing a new variant based on their
experiences,andtodistributethesecostsamongtheactivitieswe
identified.Moreover,weaskedthemtoassessthecostfactorswe
collectedonaseven-pointLikertscale,consideringwhatimpactad-
justing them would have on costs (i.e., strongly reduces to strongly
increases). To this end, we were concerned with any of the two
reuse strategies the interviewee worked with, and asked especially
those who had experiences with both strategies to explain their
perceiveddifferences between both.
ResultingData. In the exploration and process definition phases,
we obtained qualitative data (i.e., natural language descriptions) of
thereuseprocessesemployedattheorganizationandtherelated
cost factors (cf. Section 3.1 ). During the cost assessment phase, we
also obtained quantitative data, namely a dataset for each inter-
vieweeandtheiremployedreusestrategiesÐcomprising,foreach
reuse strategy employed, estimates (in percent) of the cost distribu-
tion among the 10 activities (cf. Section 3.2 ), assessments (Likert
scale) of the cost factors’ impact (cf. Section 3.3 ), or both. We could
not obtain alldata we askedfor:
•Oneinterviewee(I 23)joinedrunningprojectsand,therefore,was
not confident inestimating the costsofactivities.
•One interviewee (I 24) was not confident in assessing the costs of
thefirsttwoactivities(SVandDRin Table3),sowemissthese

•Twointerviewees(I 25,I26)couldnotprovidequantitativedata,
as they are not involved in variant development, but platform
maintenanceÐfor whichthey reportedhighly valuable insights.
Overall, we received eight and seven quantitative datasets for
clone&ownandplatform-orientedreuse,respectively.Considering
costfactors,weobtainedonemoredatasetforeachstrategy(due
to I23). We miss three more values, as interviewees did not feel
confidenttoassesstheimpactofacostfactor(i.e.,teamsizeonce

DataExtraction. Foreachpublication,weextractedbibliographic
data, namely the authors, title, publication venue, and publication
year. We extracted further data that was relevant for addressing
our research objectives (cf. Table 2): the reuse strategies employed,
the research method, the organizations and/or subjects (e.g., for
interviews), mentioned cost factors, qualitative insights, and quan-
titative data. More precisely, we identified concrete statements
regarding the costs, benefits, and problems of either reuse strategy,
as well as quantified data that was backed up by experiences or
measurements. We collected the data in a semi-structured docu-
ment (provided in our dataset1) and used identifiers to trace the
data back to its source. To analyze our data, we used an open-card
sorting-like method[ 110] to connect findings on the same reuse
strategyandcostfactors byidentifying synonyms.
Resulting Data. We identified the sample of 57 publications we
show inTable2. As expected, few publications (10)are concerned
withthecostsorbenefitsofclone&own[ 48,73].Inparticular,only

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Inthissection,weanalyzeanddiscusstheresultsforeachofour
researchobjectivesindividually.Withinthediscussion,wehighlight
how our data relates to common hypotheses and assumptions (e.g.,
byKnauberetal .[60])onclone&ownandplatform-orientedreuse.
We denote refutationsas /thumbs_down_alt, confirmations as /thumbs_up_alt,and inconclusive
insightsas /hand_left.
Notethatweusemedianvaluesfromoureliciteddata(interviews
andSLR)toprovideintuitiveexamplesforthecostsandsavingsthat
have been reported for both reuse strategies. However, these have
to be considered with care, since actual costs depend heavily on an
organization’sandproject’sproperties.Wecanseethisparticularly
in the large ranges our data spans. However, as our data aligns
overall, we consider these examples to provide a good intuition
regarding what can be achievedwitheitherreuse strategy.
3.1RO1:DevelopmentProcess
Wecategorizedtheactivities(cf. Table3)ourintervieweesreported
in the process-definition phase to design and refine the process
we show in Figure 2. This abstracted process represents the gen-
eral development process for new variants at Axis, integrating
clone&ownandplatform-orientedreuse.
Results. Amajordifference tothereuse processesassumed inre-
search is that neither pure clone&own nor pure platform-oriented
reuseisemployed,butvariationsofbothtovaryingextents.Usu-
ally, Axis scopes features according to new customer requirements
and derives a variant (or even the full platform) that is similar
to these requirements to separate it from the platform, which is
maintainedandupdatedinparallel.Ontheseparatedvariant,the
responsible developers implement the customer requests until the
variant can be released. At that point, the developers and platform
engineers have to make a decision: On the one hand, they can
keep the variant outside of the platform, which would result in
whattheyrefertoasa long-livingclone (i.e.,clone&own)thatmay
neverbereintegratedintotheplatform,duetoitsdivergence.On
the other hand, and what is mostly done at Axis, the developersTable 3:Activities we elicited duringour interviews.

can immediately integrate the changes of the variant back into
the platform to incorporate new features, wherefore the variant
wasonlya short-livingclone (i.e.,platform-orientedreuse).So,the
majordifferencebetweenclone&ownandplatform-orientedreuse
at Axis is that the maintenance of long-living clones is done by the
development team, while short-living clones are maintained by the
platformmaintainers. Despite the variations intheirdevelopment
process, both reuse strategies essentially comprise the 10 activities
weshowin Table3.Weusetheidentifierstorefertotheseactivities
throughout the remaining paper.
Discussion. The process we identified is similar to what we ex-
perienced[ 68,70,71] and what researchers recently reported for
other organizations[ 31,105] and open-source communities[ 99].
However,researchersusuallystillconsiderthetworeusestrategies
ascompletelyseparated:developerscaneitherapplyclone&own
ora platform /thumbs_down_alt. In contrast, our analysis and such recent publica-
tions indicate that a combination of different strategies is regularly
used in practice. So, it is problematic to apply findings that are
reported,forexample,onmigratingfromclone&owntowardsa
full-fledged software product line, to industry. This finding sup-
portstheargumentthatorganizationswithasetofsimilarvariants
(should) strive towards a platformto some extent(e.g.,they may
employ clone&own, but support it with automated change propa-
gation[90]ormanagementframeworks[ 94]).
Asaresult,thequestionmaynotbewhethertoadoptclone&own
or a platform, but for what variant should which strategy be em-
ployed?Forinstance,atAxis,short-livingclonesarerapidlyinte-
grated, and thus represent platform-based reuse. They are quite
oftenseparatedandre-integratedbeforemajorchangesontheplat-
formhappen.Axisusuallyusesshort-livingclonestoimplement
well-defined features for established variants. In contrast, some
long-living clones are re-integrated only after years or potentially
not at all. During our interviews, we found that clone&own is
mostly used to advance independently to new markets or test com-
pletely new features. However, a problem of this strategy is that
new features or variants may be highly valuable and shall be re-
integratedintotheplatform,whichbecomesfarmoreexpensive,
dueto the longperiodofco-evolution /thumbs_up_alt.
We identified a process (cf. Figure 2) for variant development that
integrates clone&own and platform-oriented reuse, comprising
10 activities (cf. Table 3). While both strategies are employed in
parallel, theycanbedifferentiated for individualvariants.RO1:DevelopmentProcess and Activities

3.2RO2:CostsofActivities
Next, we describe the costs that are associated with clone&own
andplatform-orientedreuse.Ouranalysisforthisresearchobjec-
tive builds on qualitative insights and relative, quantitative data,
for three reasons: First, it is problematic to identify precise data on
software costs, which we mitigated by using qualitative insights.
Second,absolutenumbersarenotrepresentative,astheymaybe
completelyoutoforderfordifferentorganizations(e.g.,startups
versuslargeorganizations).Toimproveourquantification,wecom-
bined the results of our interviews (cf. Figure 3) with those from
our SLR (cf. Figure 4). Finally, we avoidrepetitions and can clarify
connections anddiscrepanciesbetween the results.
Results. We asked our interviewees during the cost-assessment
phase to elicit on the distribution of costs among the development
activities for a concrete short-living and/or long-living clone based
on their experiences. In Figure 3, we display the resulting distribu-
tions.Asnotallintervieweesendedupwithasumof100%(min
68%, max 133%, avg 99.6%), we normalized their responses to con-
siderthetotalcoststhatwentintodevelopingavariant.Toavoid

stated the integration as additional costs after delivering a variant,
andwe askedthemto exclude this activityfrom theirassessment.

showthetotalcostsavingsthathavebeenreportedforplatform-

(comparing to clone&own) and general values (comparing to stan-
dalone systems). However, we found that the reported costs and
benefitsdid not differ muchfor thesetwo scenarios,which is why
this summarizationdoes not threaten our analysis.
Discussion. We structure the following discussion according to
activities that are related (e.g., to set up development). To this end,
werefertotheabbreviationswedefinein Table3andtheonesin
the previous paragraph.
SV, DR, FEV. One interviewee stated on selecting a variant (FEV)
for developmentfrom their platform:
łThat’ssomethingthatyouunderstandwayinthebeginningwhen
yougettherequirement[s]fortheproject.Youunderstandnow,
it’saderivative ofthis one,whichwillbe very obvious [...]ž
As we can see in Figure 3, this statement aligns to all activities
relatingtosettingupvariantdevelopment: Thecosts fordefining
requirements(DR)andfindingacorrespondingvariant(FEV)are
lower and more narrow compared to clone&own, while the initial
scoping(SV)issimilarforboth /thumbs_up_alt.Thismatcheswithqualitative
findingsfromourSLR,suggestingthatplatformscanactuallyim-
prove developers’ knowledge about variations[ 16,24,27,34], that
suchknowledgeiselementaryforclone&own[ 6,30,32,34],and
that particularly scoping and selecting an existing variant poses
problems inclone&own[ 31,34].
DF, PI, IF, FD, VD. Clone&own can considerably reduce the
costsfordevelopingvariants[ 7,47,57,106]/thumbs_up_alt.Forinstance,Henry
and Faller[ 44] report a cost reduction of 35%. However, in line
withcommonhypotheses,mostdatafromourSLRindicatesthat
platform-oriented reuse reduces these costs even further[ 7,11,17,
18,23ś25,27,92,97,98,103]/thumbs_up_alt. InFigure 4, we can see that the
438ESEC/FSE ’20, November8ś13,2020,VirtualEvent, USA Jacob KrügerandThorstenBerger
nine studies reporting quantitative data suggest median savings of
around 67%for developingaplatform variant(VD).
Despite the benefits for developing new variants, we could also
confirmthatdeveloping features forreuse (FD)istypicallymore
expensive than implementing them for single use[ 11,78,103,103]
/thumbs_up_alt. Five studies indicate a median increase of roughly 20%. We can
confirm this trend based on our interviews: In Figure 3, we can
see that the design (DF) and the implementation (IF) of features
are consideredtobe more expensive forplatform-orientedreuseÐ
especiallywithdrasticoutlierstowardshighcosts.Thissupports
the argument that platforms will only pay off if features are reused
severaltimes.Arguably,wecanbestsummarizethisinsightwith
an interview quote on designing features for platform-oriented
reuse,highlightingtheneedtodesignfeaturesinalignmentwith
the platform architecture:
łForshort-livingclones,wehavetodesign[...]ittobeabletobe
used by others. A long-lived clone, with that, we can ignore that.ž
Wefoundfivestudiessuggestingthatorganizationscandevelop
a larger number of features more efficiently with a platform, but
they do not provide costs for single features[ 12,33,45,101]/thumbs_up_alt.
Forinstance,Fogdaletal.[ 35]reportthatDanfoss coulddevelop
over 2,500 features a year instead of under 300 before adopting
a platform. The origin of this benefit is unclear, but considering
that feature development is more expensive, it should be caused by
othercostfactors (e.g.,higher quality,more reuse,staffing).
BF, PBF, QA. The research community usually arguesthat propa-
gatingbugfixes(PBF)betweenvariantsisoneofthemajordraw-
backsofclone&own[ 31,34,72].Indeed,moststudiesreportthat
bug fixing is a challenging aspect of clone&own[ 12,30,35,45,72,
76,76], particularly as variants co-evolve, which is why fixes must
notonly bepropagated,butalsoadaptedtothe newvariant /thumbs_up_alt.In
contrast,platformsarechallengingtotestintheirentirety[ 7,14,97],
but are arguedto not require changepropagation[ 33,101].
Interestingly,ourdatacontradictsthisassumption:Wecansee
inFigure 3that our interviewees consider bug fixing (BF) more
expensiveinclone&own,butthepropagationseemsmoreprob-
lematicforaplatform /thumbs_down_alt.Oneofourintervieweesexplainedthis
situation as follows:
łPropagatebugfixes,ofcourse,islongerfortheshort-livingclones
because we would actually have to do it. For long-living clones,
we don’tdoitat all.ž
Thisindicatesthatbugpropagationmaybeanimportantissue,but
itrequiresare-evaluationbytheresearchcommunity.Inparticular,
itseemsnecessarytoconsiderthatchangepropagationbetween
clones may not be intended, and thus poses no problemÐwhile
changepropagationinplatformssuffersfromfeaturedependencies
(cf.Section 3.3 ). Still, our SLR (median: -60%) and interview results
confirm that a platform can drastically reduce the costs for quality
assuring (QA) software /thumbs_up_alt.

Integration. Considering the integration (or migration) of cloned
variantsintoaplatform,wereceivedeightcostestimationsfromour
interviewees (four for either strategy), which align to the results of
ourSLR.Notsurprisingly,developersrequireconsiderablylesstime
to fully re-integrate a short-living clone into a platform compared
tointegratingalong-livingclone /thumbs_up_alt.Inparticular,thecostsheavily
depend on the co-evolution of a separated variant compared to the
platform,whichwealsoidentifiedasamajorprobleminourSLR[ 12,
30,32,45,57,72], and the extent of the variant’s delta compared
totheplatform.Again,wecanbestsummarizetheproblemsand
costs of re-integrating variants with an interview quote, clearly
highlightingthepreferenceoftheintervieweetowardsplatform-
orientedreuse:
łI think a lot of time is wasted on the long-living clones, because,

thing else, and then suddenly, your branch is just not working

Thisstatementalsodescribescausesforthecostsofintegratinglong-
livingclones,suchasunderstandingtheco-evolution,updatingold
features, as well as fixing outdateddependencies andbugs.
Our findings support the argument that the success of reuse de-
pends heavily on platform-orientation[ 80,93], with our SLR indi-
cating overall mediansavingsof52%.Thedatashows:
•Settingup developmentis cheaper withaplatform.
•Developingfeaturesforaplatformismoreexpensive(+20%),but
will pay off due to decreased variant-development costs (-67%),
outperforming clone&own (-35%).
•A platform increases the quality of the derived software, reduc-
ing thecostsforqualityassurance (-60%).
•Longer co-evolution between variants (and the platform) in-
creases integrationcosts.
•Surprisingly, change propagation is more costly for a platform.
•Coordination costsare similar for both strategies.RO2:Costs of Activities
3.3RO3:CostFactors andBenefits
Finally,weinvestigatedthecostfactorsimpactingbothreusestrate-
gies,andtheirrelations.Again,wecombinedtheresultsfromour
SLR (cf.Figure 4) withthosefrom our interviews.
Results. InFigure 5, we show the responses on the Likert-scale
ratings for cost factors that we elicited during our interviews. A
positive rating indicates that an increase of the factor (e.g., more
reuse for a new variant) is considered to have a positive impact on
thecostsforanewvariant(i.e.,reducescosts).Incontrast,negative
ratings (e.g., a larger delta for the new variant) indicate that our
interviewees experienced thatan increase of thatfactorincreases
costs. We display the assessment separately for clone&own and
439AnEmpirical Analysis of the Costs of Clone-andPlatform-OrientedSoftware Reuse ESEC/FSE ’20, November8ś13,2020,VirtualEvent, USA
platform-oriented reuse. For an easier comparison, we show the
averagevaluesofboth strategies inthe middleofeachcostfactor.
Discussion. Reuse & Delta. The first two cost factors we analyzed
in our interviews are the amount of reusable code and the delta of
newlyrequiredcodeforavariant.Forbothstrategies,morereuse
reducescosts,while a largerdeltaincreasescosts /thumbs_up_alt. Interestingly,
theimpactofreuseissimilarforbothstrategies,withoneparticular
outlierfor clone&ownindicating anegative impact:
łBasically,forusitwouldbemoreofanefforttoremovethings,
stuff we don’tneedcomparedto justhavingitthere.ž
Change propagation and scalability issues have been well inves-
tigated for clone&own, in contrast to this problem of removing
unwanted features. Finally, it is interesting that a larger delta is
consideredtohavelessimpactonplatform-orientedreuse,which
somewhat contradicts our findings that developing new features is
more expensive onaplatform (cf. Section 3.2 )/hand_left.
Developers & Staffing. A factor that we identified in our SLR and
interviewsisthenumberofdevelopersinvolvedindevelopment.
InFigure 4, we can see that ten publications report a decrease in
the staff (S) needed to develop a new variant from a platform with
a median reduction of 75%[ 4,22,24,28,34,35,63,76,77,91]. This
supportstheestablishedhypothesisthatthesamenumberofdevel-
opers can develop a larger number of variants when using a (main-
tained)platforminsteadofclone&own /thumbs_up_alt.Attheorganization,we
experiencedasituation similar to anotherreport[ 61]:
łWe had fewer products and fewer developers in the company,
theplatformwasinahorriblestate,soyou[couldn’t]reallyuse
ittorelease.[It]gotmorestable,butalsotheproductsthatwere
using theplatform increased exponentially. Insteadof having10
productsonalousyplatform,youhaveahundredproductsona
goodplatform.ž
In both cases, the organization’s potential for growth was large
enough to require more staff to address additional customer de-
mands. Still, for developing a specific variant, our interviewees
generally considerhaving more developers(cf. Figure 5) as benefi-
cial. The outliers represent cases in which teams get too large and
coordination becomes an issue.
Knowledge. The knowledge software developers have about a
systemisessentialfortheirperformance.Fordevelopingasetof
variants, additional challenges arise, as the developers have to also
comprehendvariabilitymechanisms(platforms)orwhatvariants
exist (clone&own). Missing knowledge seems to be a primary
problem of clone&own and may motivate switching towards a
platform. After such a migration, developers must only remember
a smaller, structured code base, which may explain this benefit.
Still,knowledgeisalsokeytoestablishing a platformandmissing
knowledge is a major problem raised in two publications[ 7,98].
Ourintervieweesalsohighlyvalueknowledgeasthefactorwith
the most impact for both reuse strategies (cf. Figure 5). For this
reason, they alsoapply specific policies:
ł[We are] growing, so we try to have teams with experienced
people togetherwithnewpeople.ž
Overall,ourresultsshowthatknowledgeisaprimaryfactorthat
heavily impacts the costs of software reuse. Unfortunately, we
are not aware of a hypothesis or research that is concerned with

Teams & Hand Overs. Related to the previous cost factors, our
interviewees indicated that coordination is heavily impacted by
clearlydefining the size androles of teams as well as the required
handovers between them:
łI think that the more people you have, it becomes a lot of coordi-
nation, and also responsibilities [are] not as clear. If you are three
people,it’shardto hide.ž
InFigure 5, we can see that the number of teams with defined
responsibilitiesisconsideredtohaveasimilarpositiveimpacton
costs for both reuse strategies. However, the necessary hand overs
between teams (e.g., moving a variant from development to quality
assurance)isperceivedasslightlynegative.So,thereseemtobeno
largerdifferencesbetweenbothreusestrategiesforcoordinating
inandbetween teams, aligningto our previous insights /hand_left.
Bugs&Quality. Softwarereuseisconsideredtoimprovethequal-
ityofsoftware,andthusreducethenumberofbugs.Forclone&own,
we found three publications that support this argument[ 6,36,106]
andthreethatarguethatqualityisaproblem[ 12,45,48]/hand_left.Still,
forplatform-orientedreuse,numerouspublicationsarguedthatit
improves the quality compared to other reuse strategies[ 24,30,33,
38,51,61,76ś78,92,97,98,101,103,104], including clone&own
/thumbs_up_alt. Surprisingly, while the quality of a platform is known to be
importantforsuccessfulreuse,weidentifiedonlyonepaperthat
statedthis as acostlychallenge for platform-orientedreuse[ 61].
We can support both insights with our interview data. For in-
stance,oneofourintervieweesstatedthattheorganizationpushed
strongly against clone&own to avoid quality and compatibility
issuesoriginatingfrom long-living clones:
łI guess we tried to kill them off because it is a hassle to maintain.
[...]Ifit’snottestedeveryday,ifit’snotdailyrebuiltandchecked,
[...] something is rotting in the code, it’s not being compatible
anymore withthe platform.ž

Wecanfurtherunderpinthiswithourresultsfor RO2,indicating
thatqualityassuranceislesscostlywithplatform-orientedreuse.
Despite these benefits, several interviewees also stated that the
pathtowardsthisimprovementwaschallenging.Theplatformwas
initially of low quality and, therefore, not trusted. As our intervie-
wees’ assessment (cf. Figure 5) indicates, they consider the quality
ofthereusedsystemasoneofthecostfactorswithmostimpact,
anditiseven more importantfor platform-orientedreuse /thumbs_up_alt.
The improved quality of a platform is used as an argument that
fewer bugs must be fixed, further reducing costs. Indeed, as we
canseein Figure4,severalstudiesreportthatconsiderablyfewer
bugs (median: -70%) are identified in platforms[ 4,22ś24,35,78,
89,92]/thumbs_up_alt.Forclone&own,wealsofoundtwostudiessuggesting
that this strategy can reduce bugs by 35%[ 44] to 66.7%[ 89]/thumbs_up_alt.
Our interviewees assessed that a change in the number of bugs
would have roughly the same effect on development costs for both
strategies, as we can see in Figure 5.
Modularity/Dependencies. Onebenefitthatwealreadymentioned
istheindependenceofclone&own[ 30ś32,101,106].Thisindepen-
dence allows developers to test variants, implement innovative
featuresorreplyfastertocustomerrequests.Forexample,theor-
ganization employsclone&own especially to innovate:
łIf it’s a new business, we don’t want it [in the platform] because
we don’twant to maintain it.ž
Thisisregularlyconsideredtobethemainreasontostillemploy
clone&own. In contrast, two publications report that platforms
allow to move easier to new markets[ 24,61], which is quite sur-
prising.Kolbetal.[ 61]statethatonlytheplatformallowedthemto
develop highly complex variants that emerged to new markets. We
receivedanidenticalresponsefromoneofourinterviewees:
łI would not be able to have such a complex product if I would
not be ableto reuse.ž
This opposes common hypotheses in research, and we need to
better understand what enables organizations to adapt to new and
changing marketsfaster /thumbs_down_alt: independence orareliable platform?
Theindependence ofclone&ownisalsoconsidered tofreede-
velopers ofdependencies, but the resultsof our SLR are quite con-
tradictinginthisregard /hand_left.Forinstance,Bowen[ 16]arguesthat

•The number of developers developing a variant is a challenging
factor to assess correctly for both reuse strategies, but platforms

•Independent of thereuse strategy, knowledge about thesystem
is anessential cost factor.

4 THREATS TO VALIDITY
We now discuss threats to the construct, internal, external, and
conclusion validity,following establishedguidelines[ 58,108].
ConstructValidity. We conducted26 interviews with practition-
erswhodidnotusetheterminologythathasbeenestablishedin
research.Tomitigatethisthreat,weusedourexploratoryinterviews
tounderstandthetermsandpracticesestablishedatAxis.Together
withourtwocontacts,whoarefamiliarwiththeresearchterminol-
ogy,we clarified and unified terms. We usedthe terms established
intheorganizationtoconductourinterviews.Moreover,atleast
oneoftheauthorswaspresentduringallinterviewstoallowthein-
tervieweestoaskaboutanyunclearconstructs,andeachinterview
startedwithanintroductionintothepurposeandtermsofthestudy.
Weextracteddatafrom57publicationsthatuseddifferentter-
minology, based on the research focus, domain, and authors. To
tacklethisissue, wecarefully readeachpublicationandextracted
keywordstocategorizethemintooneofthetworeusestrategies,
and to assign our data to the correct costs and cost factors. We
aimed tomitigateanythreatof wronglyassigningpublications or
databyusinganopen-cardsorting-likemethodtounifysynonyms.
Finally,wealignedthisterminologytotheoneweestablishedfor
the organizationto triangulate the data from both sources.
Internal Validity. It is challenging to precisely assign costs to
specific activities and cost factors in software engineering, due
to,forinstance,thetanglingofactivities(e.g.,bugfixingandbug
propagation) or cost factors (e.g., developers’ knowledge and team
441AnEmpirical Analysis of the Costs of Clone-andPlatform-OrientedSoftware Reuse ESEC/FSE ’20, November8ś13,2020,VirtualEvent, USA
composition).Moreover,thecostsofdevelopingandparticularly
reusing software are hard to assign to a specific system, as just
copyingsoftwarehasclosetozerocosts,whilethecostsofdevel-
opingfeaturesmaybedistributedamongallvariantsusingit.So,
costs in software engineering are far more challenging to quantify
than in manufacturing, where costs can usually be assigned to a
specificproduct.Forthosereasons,andbecausemostorganizations
donottracktheircostsonadetailedlevel(e.g.,assigningcoststo
complete projects), quantified data is hard to obtain. We addressed
this problem by adopting our research method, triangulating from
interviewswithexperiencedsoftware developers andan SLR.
To ensure that we could derive valid results, we used qualitative
andquantitativedatafromtwodifferentsources.Weconductedthe
SLRparticularlytoavoidthreatsthatmaybecausedbyconducting
interviewsonlyatone organization.So,weaimedtoimprovethe
internal validity of our results by incorporating the experiences
of skilled engineers with established research findings. Also, we
aimed to improve the completeness of our SLR, verifying our sam-
ple against related work. We discussed regularly with our contacts
to verify that our data and results were sensible. Finally, we dis-
cussed our findings with three practitioners from another large
organization (i.e., Grundfos) that employs platform-oriented reuse
to perform a sanity check based on their experiences. Nonetheless,
apotentialthreattotheinternalvalidityremainsthatwemayhave
misinterpretedorcollectedfalse data that biases our results.
External Validity. An interview study at a single organization
is limited in its external validity. Still, many software platforms
exhibitsimilarcharacteristics,whethertheyoriginatefromopen-
source projects or industry[ 46]. Also, many industrial organiza-
tions employsimilarreusepractices considering clone&ownand
platform-oriented reuse[ 10,31]. So, while we cannot fully over-
comethisthreat,ourresultsarestillimportantfororganizationsto
understandthe costsoftheirreuse strategies.
WealsoconductedourSLRtoimprovetheexternalvalidityof
our study, mitigating the limitations of conducting interviews at
a single organization. The SLR includes publicationsfrom various
domains, levels of maturity, programming languages, countries,
and over 100 organizations. So, we argue that the results of our
SLRimprovetheexternalvalidityofourstudy.Aswefoundsimilar
results regarding reuse practices, costs, and cost factors in our
interviews,we arguethat theseare alsoreliable.
Conclusion Validity. We employed interviews and an SLR to
mitigatemanyoftheaforementionedthreats,andarguethatthis
methodology was appropriate to obtain reliable insights regard-
ing thecostsof software reuse. For this reason,wearguethat our
findings result in an extensive body of knowledge that provides
anintuitionandguidancefororganizationsaimingtoestablisha
platform, and researchers to focus their research efforts. Due to
confidentially reasons, we cannot provide all of our data, for exam-
ple, on the interview results and the transcripts. Still, we described
ourmethodologyindetailandprovideadatasetwithallartifacts
that allowotherresearchersto replicate our study.
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we reported the combined results of an interview
study conductedat a large organizationand an SLR.We describedthedevelopmentprocessandcostsassociatedwiththetwomain
reuse strategies for developing variants: clone&own and platform-
orientation.Ouranalysisisthefirsttoprovidesystematicallyelicited
andsubstantialempiricaldataonthesereusestrategies.Asaresult,
wefound18piecesofevidencethatconfirmcommonhypotheses
on software reuse. The results suggest that platform-orientation
ispreferableoverclone&own,reducingoverallcosts,improving
quality, and allowing for more variants. Still, we also identified
seven inconclusive pieces of evidence, and three pieces of evidence
that refuteestablishedhypotheses onsoftware reuse:
•Platform-orientationandclone&own arenot strictly separated
practices,whichisoften assumedinthe literature.
•Bugpropagationisusuallyconsideredtobethemainproblemof
clone&own,butourfindingsindicatethatitcanbeevenmore
challenging andexpensive for aplatform.
•Clone&own is usually argued to facilitate innovation compared
toaplatform,butourfindingssuggestthatplatformscanactually
be essentialto successfully advanceintoinnovative markets.
Overall,besidesprovidingthefirstsubstantial,evidence-basedbody-
of-knowledge on costs of the two reuse strategies, we obtained
important insights that are relevant for practitioners to consider in
their decisions, and for researchers to scope their work. For future
research,weareespeciallyinterestedindetailedinvestigationsof
