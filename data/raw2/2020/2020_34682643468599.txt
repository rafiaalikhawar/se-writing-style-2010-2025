ABSTRACT
Software developers are turning to vlogs (video blogs) to share
what a day is like to walk in their shoes. Through these vlogs
developers share a rich perspective of their technical work as well
their personal lives. However, does the type of activities portrayed
in vlogs differ from activities developers in the industry perform?
Would developers at a software company prefer to show activities
to different extents if they were asked to share about their day
through vlogs? To answer these questions, we analyzed 130 vlogs
by software developers on YouTube and conducted a survey with
335 software developers at a large software company. We found that
although vlogs present traditional development activities such as
coding and code peripheral activities (11%), they also prominently
feature wellness and lifestyle related activities (47.3%) that have
not been reflected in previous software engineering literature. We
also found that developers at the software company were inclined
to share more non-coding tasks (e.g., personal projects, time spent
with family and friends, and health) when asked to create a mock-up
vlog to promote diversity. These findings demonstrate a shift in our
understanding of how software developers are spending their time
and find valuable to share publicly. We discuss how vlogs provide
a more complete perspective of software development work and
serve as a valuable source of data for empirical research.

Software development is a lucrative and popular career option,
and incites curiosity even in the general public unfamiliar with
programming. Some developers have created vlogs (video blogs) to
showcase their entire day including coding sessions, team meetings
and even life after work-hours. These vlogs present challenges
they face when working on a project as well as the victories of
new achievements on personal side projects. Likewise, outside of
technical work, vlogs by software developers provide a personal
glimpse into various careers in software development industry.
The transparency that these vlogs provide a broader perspective of
what it means to be a developer—one helpful in inspiring the next
generation of developers.
Although these vlogs are helpful in painting a picture for a wider
general audience, how are they similar to what developers in indus-
try would want as their online image? Do developers in industry
engage in activities that are different from how it is currently por-
trayed in vlogs? In this work, we use vlogs to understand what
activities developers find valuable and want others to know about
their professional and personal life. Vlogs provide a richer medium
than text-based blogs where creators are limited by the format of
content they can share. Vlogs allow creators tell a story of their life
via video and audio that reflect their personalities [ 10]. This creates
gives the audience the feel of physically shadowing the developer
without having to do so. Additionally, the succinct nature of vlogs
encourages vloggers to be selective in what content they will be
sharing—often times optimizing for what they think will be the
most valuable content to show publicly. Understanding the online
image of developers can help gain a better understanding of what
software developers find valuable to share as part of their image,
and how the general public perceives software developers.
A popular format of developer vlogs are “A day in the life of a
developer” videos. These vlogs mirror a developer’s entire day—
from waking up, the food they eat, going to work, what they do at
work (like coding, testing, meetings, co-working in teams), breaks,
and what they do outside of work (working out, going to movies,
spending time with kids and families, or playing games). Each vlog
has its own story and emphasize some of these activities.1

To identify how developers would present their day, we con-
ducted a mixed-methods study with two populations of software
developers: 1) those who vlog and 2) those from a large software
company (Section 3). First, we analyzed vlogs from 130 “ day in the
life of a software developer ” videos on YouTube. Then we qualita-
tively analyzed these activities in these videos and the percentage
of time spent in each activity. To understand how this distribution
of time spent in videos differs between the two populations of de-
velopers, we designed and conducted survey at a large software
company. We received responses from 335 developers. In this sur-
vey we included questions about the time spent in specific activities,
frequency of what they would show in a pretend vlog, and activity
usage on social media platforms.
The results of our study demonstrate a fuller perspective of the
life of a software developer (Section 4). We find that in addition to
coding and peripheral coding tasks like debugging, software vlog-
gers spend a significant amount of time spent on non-work related
elements of life such as lifestyle, spending time with loved ones, and
dedicating time to health. In contrast, large software company de-
velopers (LSC developers) overall reported that they would present
less time showcasing these activities and reported that would dedi-
cate more time problem solving tasks and coding-related work. We
also find that the percentage of how much of the non-code related
activities varied based on the motivation for creating the mock-up
vlog. For example, LSC developers who were presented with the
motivation of supporting diversity found it valuable to show more
content on personal projects, interactions with family and friends,
personal brand, and health. From these findings, we discuss (Sec-
tion 5) how we can operationalize this new understanding of how
developers spend their time and provide implications for how vlogs
can be used as a dataset for understanding a range of developer
perspectives, and various insights that developers, managers, and
the SE community can gain from them.
2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS
To understand a broader perspective of how software developers,
work we designed a study guided by three research questions:
RQ1 How do software vloggers present their daily routine
in vlogs? Similar to a study of shadowing developers, vlogs
by developers on YouTube provide a rich source of data on
how developers present their daily routines. But vlogs allow
developers to control their own narrative and online avatar,
thus giving a peek into their ideal life. Through this research
question, we wanted to understand how developers portray
their image through the different activities shown in their
vlogs that characterizes their day and, in essence, themselves.
Through qualitative analysis of 130 vlogs from developers,
we categorize daily activities and respective screen-time
representing the activities.
RQ2 How do industry developers self report their time spent
in similar activities? Next, we wanted to understand how
much time developers spend in reality across these activities
through a survey of 335 developers in a large company. We
further investigate the differences in the real time spent and
the screen-time dedicated for activities and it’s implications
on software developer companies.RQ3 What would industry developers find valuable to be
presented about their daily life? Finally, to learn about
the differences and diversity in what developers find valu-
able to portray their identify, we ask the developers from the
company about how they would make vlogs. Through this
analysis, we identify the impact of diversity and motivation
on what aspect developers find valuable.
3 METHODOLOGY
To answer the research questions, we conducted a mixed-methods
study of analyzing data of software developers online (Section 3.1)
and data from a survey among developers who work at a large
software development company (Section 3.2). All study materials
can be found in supplemental materials [44].
3.1 Gathering Public Developer Presentation
Through Vlogs
To gather, how developers portray themselves publicly, we collected
and analyzed vlog (video blog) data from YouTube, which is a
popular online video-sharing platform. We focused on videos that
are specifically about the day in the life of software engineers. For
the analysis, we identified 130 vlogs with a total length of 1,070
minutes and over 35 million views.
3.1.1 Data Collection. We searched YouTube to identify an initial
set of 163 vlogs using a stratified sampling method to represent
countries/regions with a strong developer presence. We identified
the initial set of videos through YouTube search using a combination
of keywords with ‘developer life’, ‘day in life’, ‘day in life + software
engineer’ . Resulting videos represented developers from North &
South America and Europe. To extend the representation to Asia,
we conducted a focused search by adding South Korea, Japan, and
India to our keywords. The resulting search also captured developer
vlogs from other Asian countries like Singapore, Bangladesh, and
China. We further identified 8 more videos through snowballing
from (1) YouTube recommendations that revealed vlogs that were
not part of the initial sample, and (2) other vloggers mentioned in
our sample of vlogs.
Our final sample consisted of 130 videos after excluding 33 videos
from initial analysis (6 videos not in English, 14 videos captured
more than once, 7 videos not by real developers as per the de-
scription in their channel, and 6 videos were different kinds like
a recorded conference talk. Throughout the rest of the papers we
reference these vlogs as V1-V130.
3.1.2 Data Preprocessing. To analyze the breadth of the videos,
we manually identified and compiled standard YouTube metadata
from each videos including the date of upload, length of the video,
location, subscriber count, view count, likes and dislikes count, and
the number of comments. All 130 videos were uploaded within the
last 4 years (January, 2016 - May, 2020); and are from 113 distinct
developers. 103 videos were uploaded by men, 24 videos by women
(1 featuring a couple, and 2 other videos we couldn’t determine the
gender). We should note the genders reported are in fact perceptible
gender and are only determined to report the breadth of vloggers
in our sample. These vlogs come from 21 countries across the four
continents of North and South America, Europe, and Asia. The
405Reel Life vs. Real Life: How Software Developers Share Their Daily Life through Vlogs ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece
countries with the most videos were USA, UK, Canada, India, and
South Korea. The average length of the videos is 8.23 minutes,
which is comparable to the typical length of YouTube videos [18].
To determine the reach of the vlogs, we analyzed the metadata
associated with viewer engagement. Information within these vlogs
reach a large audience. On average, each vlog had 270,800 views
(min. = 83, max. = 7.131 million). Combined, these vlogs had 35
million views. It is difficult to report demographics of the viewers
since YouTube does not publicly provide any statistics about the
viewers.
3.1.3 Data Analysis. To answer how software vloggers present
their daily routine in vlogs ( RQ1 ), the first author transcribed the
videos and assigned descriptive codes (labels/short phrases) [ 40]
to the various topics covered by vloggers as well as the activities
they show as part of their everyday life. In the transcripts, for each
activity the start and end times in the video were recorded as well.
We refer to the time an activity is shown in a video as vlog time .
Note that the vlog time is different from the actual time a devel-
oper spends on activity throughout their day (see the discussion in
Section 5). The first author recorded a total of 1135 activity codes
across the videos. All three authors then collaboratively reorga-
nized these codes and performed selective coding [ 40] by grouping
related topics into stand-alone thematic concepts. The authors met
multiple times over the next few weeks merging, splitting, and
reorganizing the topics to identify the themes that describe “what
is a developer’s life about” as expressed in the vlogs.
To analyse the different motivation(s) behind each vlog, the
authors identified three motivations based on the prominent mes-
sage of the vlog. First, developers in 29 videos were motivated
to build and expand their own personal network and ventures
which included promoting themselves or their companies[V14],
the products they built, and other projects they engaged in like
podcasts, talk shows etc. Second, in 30 vlogs, developers wanted to
promote gender, race and ethnic diversity in software engineering
and other computing fields by encouraging and associating with
movements and events like #womenintech, “chick-tech”, “Black-
GirlsCode” [V78]. And finally, in 94 vlogs, developers were moti-
vated to create awareness about software engineering as a career
choice by discussing how to pursue careers in computing, what
expectations should people have about lifestyle and work, and the
comforts and adjustments of pursuing a career in computing [V18].
3.2 Software Company Developer Survey
To gather a perspective from a traditional experience of software
developers, we designed and distributed a survey within a large
software company. We conducted a survey with 335 developers at a
large software company (LSC) to understand the common activities
they engage in throughout the day. Developers who post vlogs
are more diverse in terms of job roles and types compared to the
population of developers that researchers typically study. Through
the survey, we compare our understanding of how developers spend
time on different activities at work and beyond with our current
knowledge of the various developer activity studies. We will refer
to the developers at this large software company from our survey
asLSC developers throughout this paper.3.2.1 Survey Design. The survey focused on the online presence
of software developers. Several questions were centered around
a list of 14 activities that developers do during a day in their life.
The list of 14 activities was curated from the ten categories of
activities that were identified in the vlogs (discussed in Section 4.1).
From the ten categories, we enumerated 14 different activities in
the survey by splitting big categories such as “Health, Workout,
Lifestyle” into separate activities, and we combined a few activities
to better align and facilitate comparisons with activities that have
also been identified in research related to developer workdays.
The survey consisted of three parts. The first part consisted of
demographic questions, including questions about general social
media usage. The second part asked developers how much time do
they spend doing each activity, and then how much time they think
“other developers” spend doing each of those activities2Finally, the
third part asked developers that if they were to shoot a video of
their daily life for a vlog, which of activities would they show the
same, less, or more than their usual day.
Question: “Typically, in any day of your life, how much time do
you spend doing these activities?” We asked developers to estimate
the the time spent in the 14 different activities on a “typical day”.
For each of these activities, developers could choose one of the
following time intervals: None, <15mins, 15−29mins, 30mins
−1hour, between 1−2hours, 2−4hours, and >4hours.
Question: “You and your team are working on a video about "A
day in the life of a software engineer". Through the video, you want
to (build and expand your personal brand | create awareness about
software engineering as a career choice | promote diversity in software
engineering). Compared to how frequently these activities occur in
your life, how would you show these activities in the video?”
This question about a “ mock-up vlog ” draws from study design
techniques in participatory design research [ 22]. We included the
question to collect bespoke, anticipatory experiences of what de-
velopers would be interested in sharing in their vlog. Asking about
the content they would show and the relative duration provides us
with an understanding of what developers find valuable and feel
comfortable showcasing about the developer life publicly.
Developers were randomly assigned one of the three motivations
to shoot the video: personal brand (112 developers), creating aware-
ness (117) and promoting diversity (106). These three motivations
were identified from the analysis of the 130 YouTube videos as the
main reasons behind why developers post their “day in the life”
vlogs.
3.2.2 Survey Distribution. The developers were identified from a
multinational company’s internal address book contacts through
their job roles. The survey was distributed through a personalized
email invitation which included a link to the anonymous survey.
After completion of the survey, respondents could enter a sweep-
stakes to win one of four USD $100 gift cards. The survey was sent
to 1,500 people, of which 335 people responded (response rate of
22.3%, comparable to other surveys in software engineering [42]).
The demographics of the respondents were as follows. Age. 15%
were 18-24 years, 28% were 25-29 years, 20% were 30-34 years, and
2The analysis comparing the how much time developer think they spend on an ac-
tivity and how much they think colleagues spend is included in the supplemental
material [44].
406ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece Souti Chattopadhyay, Thomas Zimmermann, Denae Ford
28% were 35 - 44 years, and 9% were 45 years or older. Gender. 6%
identified as a woman, 79% as a man, and 1% as non-binary / gender
diverse, and 4% preferred not to answer. Social media usage. Of the
respondents, 68% had previously watched YouTube videos related to
“developers” or “software development”. The social media platforms
used the most were LinkedIn (81% of respondents), YouTube (79%),
Facebook (61%), Instagram (47%), and Twitter (42%). Developers
used the social media platforms mainly to browse through others’
posts (74%), stay updated about colleagues and people they know
(66%), and to network with others (51%). They also used social
media to share technical skills and career advice (24%) and build
personal brands (14%).
3.2.3 Data Analysis. To answer RQ2 andRQ3 , we report and
compare descriptive statistics in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. To compare
how different motivations change the activities that developers
would show more prominently in vlogs, we performed Fisher Exact
Value tests for each activity and motivation.
3.2.4 Key Terminology. To answer our research questions, we com-
pare software developer experiences from vlogs and at a large soft-
ware company. Below we provide the descriptions for key terms
used for the comparisons in this paper:
•Vlog refers to the 130 YouTube videos (RQ1).
•Vlog time refers to the time an activity is shown in a video
in the analysis of the YouTube videos (RQ1).
•Reported time refers to the time LSC developers spend on an
activity based on self-reported data from the survey (RQ2).
•mock-up vlog refers to the videos that LSC developers “cre-
ated” as part of the participatory design question in the
survey (RQ3).
4 RESULTS
We answer three research questions by expanding data analysis
described in Sections 3.1.3 and 3.2.3.
4.1 How do software vloggers present their
daily routine in vlogs? (RQ1)
To better understand how developers present themselves online,
we analyze existing self-presentations in the form of vlogs. From
our qualitative analysis process outlined in Section 3.1.3, we found
10 prominent activity categories as presented in Table 1. Next we
describe the 10 categories.
Code sessions (63 videos, 11.1% vlog time): As antici-
pated, developers present themselves doing code and periph-
eral coding tasks as part of their work in the vlogs. There are various
strategies to show coding, mostly this features as a timelapse of the
coding session with their screens blurred. Once developers identify
the task they will work on [described in managing work], they need
to familiarize themselves with the relevant artifacts and code. They
either learn the concepts upfront like “authentication”[V36], or
they learn as they work on the task which includes implementing,
testing [V14, V71], debugging [V27], running and building as well
as releasing and deploying code to provide new features or fix bugs
[V33, V123]. They also show activities such as reading conceptsTable 1: The activity categories from the analysis pf the 130
vlogs. The activities of each category used in the survey are
indicated in→blue text.

407Reel Life vs. Real Life: How Software Developers Share Their Daily Life through Vlogs ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece
related to a task [V3, V127], designing and sketching out the solu-
tion [V52], searching solutions on Stack Overflow or GitHub [V17,
V78], and working with repositories [V44].
When not directly implementing, developers review code which
“basically is a commit that somebody submitted and they are sent
for review in our team just to figure out if there are any mistakes
and errors that happen in the code. ” [V8]. Code reviews feature
frequently in the videos. Sometimes, code reviews are high priority
tasks [V27]. Videos also showed reviewing pull requests from other
teams [V27], interns [V18], and junior members of the team. As a
senior software engineer put it, “ this is how I spends 60% of my time ”
[V104].
Unspecified work (54 videos, 8.6% vlog time): Develop-
ers in 54 videos did not specify what work they did within
their office due to company policies or just privacy preference. Dur-
ing these times, the camera was usually left on and it captured a
timelapse footage of the developer at their desk/office, typically
showing the developers’ face or scenery outside the window.
Administrative Tasks (19 videos, 2.0% vlog time): Con-
trary to belief, coding makes only a part of the activities. A
developer reports “ in terms of time I spend actually in the editor,
I don’t think it’s that much. Maybe a couple hours per day ” [V77].
Vlogs show developers spend time interviewing potential employ-
ees. For example, a tech lead of the company was “ interviewing
[today] for an on-site interview for general tech. I’m not film this.
That’s obviously not appropriate ” [V5]. After the interviews, he goes
on to give an update that he had “ debriefs for two different interview
candidates, discuss feedback with the other interviewers so that took
up an hour of my afternoon. ” [V116] shows how developers need to
prepare for interviews they have to conduct, in his case it was the
next day.
Developers also meet often with interns and discuss their assign-
ment and progress [V13, V49]. Administrative tasks become part of
developer job, as you grow you also start to manage some people and
mentor some people and look after small to mid-size teams. Every
engineer inevitably is gonna do a little bit of management [V97].
Once developers switch over to management roles, they spend
time creating and assigning tasks, meeting with designers and ar-
chitects to finalize designs, writing specification requirements for
products [V107], and other documentation like manuals outlin-
ing administrative tasks that describe policies and procedures that
affect day-to-day operations of the team [V111].
Vlog also show administrative tasks like freelance developers
need to manage their own clients and projects, and do additional
administrative work like recording and reporting their own time
[V44], sending out invoices for their work [V9], and reporting status
of their work [V44].
Managing work/Planning the day (34 videos, 3.2% vlog
time): These snippets contain developers organizing their
workday on paper journals [V99] or application like OmniFocus
[V30] to make plan the day and make ToDo list, scheduling time
for certain activities and estimating time [V66]. Developers who
worked freelance used this time to manage clients, and developers
at a company dealt with JIRA [ 12] or other project management
software. Usually developers start their day with these activities.
However, few of them organize their next day before going to sleep[V2], while some use this time to reflect on their previous day [V36].
Developers show different techniques and applications (like Notion
[3]) they use to plan a productive day.
Meetings (65 videos, 8.4% vlog time): Meetings were a
highly featured work-specific activity. There were three
types of meetings were included: status meetings, kick-off meet-
ings, and impromptu meetings. The most common of the three
were status report meetings which include daily scrum-style stand-
ups or individual check ins with a manager [V27]. These meetings
provided an opportunity for developers to ask for help: “ Having a
stand up in the morning definitely helps with that because it gives
you a chance to say ’hey I’m struggling a little bit this one can I
get some help? and people are more than happy to jump in ” [V31].
Project kick-off meetings provide the opportunity for new project
team members “ to learn exactly who else is on the team . . . to not
plan work but how we want to work, what kind of meetings we want,
how we want to track our work and that kind of thing ” [V62]. Videos
also showcased team meetings later in the project life cycle where
developers collectively planned project sprints at the beginning of a
project or conducted retrospective meetings at the end of a project.
Other types of meetings included unscheduled meetings prompted
by a colleague stopping by their desk to clarify a task, or a sudden
huddle of co-workers around a developer’s code on the screen. This
broad variety of meetings showcased the breadth of communication
that took place within a team.
Collaboration (50 videos, 4.30% vlog time): The collabo-
rative nature of software development was also frequently
showcased in a software developer’s day. Collaboration in the vlogs
went beyond working with others on their immediate team, but
also included working with designers, architects, marketing as well
as other developers from different products. Videos included col-
leagues from different roles collaborating at the whiteboard where
developer spent a considerable amount of time in “ cross team col-
laboration and engagement because as a team [we] are not exactly
as an island. So whatever the solution we are building and designing
should be seamless with other systems ” [V39].
Likewise, collaborations also occurred asynchronously through
emails and communication tools like Slack [ 50]. Most vlogs showed
developers beginning their workday by “ looking at emails for both
work and quickly for other tech stuff ”[V4]. For developers in com-
panies with teams in different countries “ a lot of emails come in
from Seattle or Japan or other places of the world and they’re com-
ing overnight. So every day every morning I get through a long list
of things that happened, new announcements, new information, all
the system alerts, the information about the metrics ”[V8]. Similarly,
software developers who were freelancers found themselves col-
laborating with other developers in share co-working spaces. In
essence, regardless of affiliation to a large tech company or being a
independent freelancer, developers working remotely emphasized
the importance of communication. Feeling connected with their
peers and clients or other stakeholders is valuable for developers
to ensure meaningful progress.
Learning (12 videos, 2.0% vlog time): Videos also featured
developers talking about the different approaches how they
learn new technical concepts and refresh themselves on old ones.
For example, videos included learning new programming languages
408ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece Souti Chattopadhyay, Thomas Zimmermann, Denae Ford
like JavaScript [V112] or Redux [V130] [ 4] and getting familiar
with new machine learning paradigms. Developers described their
undergoing various training exercises that last up to 3 hours once
or twice a week, and can be in the form of assignments or hands-on
workshops or refresher training at the end of the workday [V11],
[V81], [V121]. This requirement of continuous learning was also
especially important for freelancers. As V20 explains in freelance
development “ you switch code bases quite often and there’s always
a ramp up time when you’re learning a new code base trying to
identify the issues that you have been hired to solve. ” Likewise, self-
taught programmers referenced using only coding platforms such
as CodeAcademy [ 1] and Udemy [ 7] as alternatives to a traditional
Compute Science degree from a university. Developers in videos
also described how non-traditional course help facilitate their career
transition from being a creative writer or music producer to a being
a software developer.
Hobbies and Side Projects (35 videos, 5.10% vlog time):
Developers and engineers talk about various creative hob-
bies they engage in after work hours. After-work activities include
social activities like participating in beauty pageants and network-
ing with various PR managers[V6], volunteering at local events
organized by Youth At Risk programs [V79]. Others take the time
to work a second job like teaching at a computer science institute in
Philippines [V40]. Some other developers enjoying creative hobbies
like baking for a self-run patisserie [V25], “as a photographer and
a videographer" editing and taking photos and videos for events
like engagement photo shoot [V16].
Developers who upload content on YouTube have to spend addi-
tional time editing videos, recording and editing voice overs, and
uploading videos on YouTube. Some developers who vlog also have
large number of followers on other social media platforms like
Instagram [ 2] and they invest in creating graphic design flyers and
editing images about programming, software development, web
development etc.
Developers also code in alternate platforms as a creative en-
deavor in free time like making applications using SwiftUI [ 6] [V25],
[V127], or creating games on Unity Engine [ 8] [V33], [V47] and
releasing them on App Stores and gaming platforms like Steam [ 5].
Some developers take their passion projects a notch higher and
turn them into start-ups [V128, V49] and spend after work hours
collaboration, planning, and coding.
Social Activities: (37 videos, 8.1% vlog time): Outside
work and hobbies, developers spend their time with fam-
ily and friends and discuss the importance of weaving in social time
to prevent burnout. Some developers maintain a strict schedule of
work and make sure to take free hours between 6-9 in the evening
and “do whatever [I] want, watch TV, play games in the evening,
whereas other developers show the ability to have a flexible sched-
ule and balance work-intensive days when they leave work late at
night and shorter work days for special plans like anniversaries
[V98] or trips. Vlogs show developers spending time with friends
through various sports (like golfing, basketball, and martial arts)
and video games [V2, V77, V107, V109, V119], going out to restau-
rants and bars [V12] and movies [V107], playing trivia [V72], video
games with friends and family or spending time with kids after
their babysitter leaves [V20].
Health, Workout, and Lifestyle: (100 videos, 47.3% vlog
time): A large portion of the vlogs show various lifestyle re-
lated activities like workouts [V29, V91, healthy food recipes
and eating habits. Food is an essential part of lifestyle and health,
and 89 vlogs included various unique cuisines, food they can afford
and enjoy at home and lunch spreads and buffet at work [V5, V117,
V125].
Developers emphasize on weaving in some from of exercise,
from lightweight exercises like stretching [V20] or a walk [V122],
to indoor training [V74] and intensive workouts at the gym [V107,
V118]. Some others train and practice areobics or various sports as
a form active workouts like boxing [V9], basketball [V13] or going
on a long run [V53].
Developers talk about physical health concerns they have and are
commonly discussed among their co-workers like chronic back pain
[V88], and also discuss various measures to take care of these health
issues like using a wearable posture corrector [V112], frequently
switching between sitting and standing using stand-up desks [V93],
using Pomodoro techniques to take stretching breaks [V80]. Mental
health concerns also features in the vlogs. “ Sitting long hours in front
of the desks causes tension headaches, stress ” [V34] especially with
“schedules that look like dumpster fires ” [V72]. Developers discuss
different small but effective self-care habits they use to counter
the stress like “hydrating in the morning before workout” [V47],
meditation [V36], taking protein shakes and supplements [V119],
taking time off and going on trips [V18, V30].
Beyond these, vlogs also portray the kind of lifestyle developers
lead including the types of apartments and cars they can afford [V18,
V105, V72], the gadgets and equipment they use [V20, V45] or their
work space setup at home, and the physical work environments
(like the campus and office facilities, conference rooms, cafes &
lounges, and kitchen [V23, V57, V74]. While some vlogs show the
luxurious lifestyles of living in a penthouse, traveling and driving
expensive cars, other vlogs focus on the “regularity” of the lifestyle
which includes home made meals [V111] or doing daily house
chores [V99].
Summary: About half of the vlog-time is dedicates to show
activities developers perform throughout the day, most promi-
nently coding and peripheral coding tasks like debugging, meet-
ings, and administrative tasks.
Apart from work, a large portion of a developer’s day is pre-
sented as time spent on lifestyle, health and workout (47.3%
of the vlog durations) and doing social activities (8.1% of the
vlog durations). Developers also presented themselves doing
creative work quite often (5.1% of the vlog times).
Our distribution of mean time spent varies from existing lit-
erature as it also captures the time spent beyond work through
activities like health and socio-personal life. This look beyond just
work time puts a different perspective on “who is a developer”— or
at least how they work.

4.2 How do industry developers self report
their time spent in similar activities? (RQ2)
Figure 1 presents the distribution of time spent in the 14 activities as
reported by survey respondents. The x-axis reflects the percentage
of respondents across time intervals and the y-axis reflects the 14
activities. The diverging stacked bar chart splits time spent into
how survey respondents spent less than an hour in an activity (left
side of plot) or more than an hour on an activity (right side of plot).
Next, we highlight the activities with the most and least time spent
as well as additional findings from this analysis.
Most Time Spent. Among all activities, industry developers spent
the most time on activities directly related to work - coding (69%),
coding related work (debugging, testing etc.) (80%), and problem
solving (51%).
Least Time Spent. Industry developers spent the least amount of
time (less than an hour) networking (97%), organizing their work
day (94%), and performing administrative tasks (91%).
Outside of Coding. We found an interesting distributions. When
it came to life outside of work. For instance, for how much time
respondents reported spending with friends and family we found
an even split: 50% reported spending less than an hour and the
remaining 50% spending more than 1 hour. Likewise, for personal
projects (21%), lifestyle (24%), breaks (18%), and maintaining health
(17%) we found that very few developers were able to devote more
than hour to these activities.
Enhanced Collaboration. We also find that developers often spent
time in collaborative activities like 51% developers spending more
than an hour a day in meetings and 41% on messaging. We should
note that as the survey was conducted in the peak of the COVID-19

pandemic this could influence their collaboration style. Developers
were mostly working from home, which might affect the time spent
in video call meetings and messages they exchanged.
Summary: Developers from our survey largely spend their
time working on technical aspects (coding or peripheral coding
tasks) of their work. However, when not working on code, their
time is spent in meetings and staying connected, or mentoring
co-workers.
With little time left in the day, less than 20% developers spend
time on their physical or mental health, taking breaks, or to
plan out their day.
4.3 What would industry developers find
valuable to be presented about their daily
life? (RQ3)
To understand what developers find valuable to share as part of
their “day in life" identity, in the survey we asked LSC developers
to make mock-up vlogs (refer to section 3.2 for specific question).
Figure 2 shows a distribution of what activities the developers
would dedicate ‘more’ or ‘less’ vlog-time in their mock-up vlogs
compared to their reported-time.
Most developers (94%) find value in showing their problem-
solving process through mock-up vlogs similar or more than their
reported time. 88% developers also think its valuable to showing
mentoring activities in their mock-up vlogs.
Since core technical activities (coding and code peripheral) takes
up most of their reported time, developers want to capture them

in mock-up vlogs (refer to Figure 1). 87% and 84% developer (re-
spectively) want to dedicate similar or more vlog-time showing
parts of their daily life spent in coding-related activities and cod-
ing. Additionally, 65% developers want to capture their time spent
on personal projects. Other than technical activities, 64% develop-
ers want their mock-up vlogs to feature time spent in messaging
co-workers and staying connected at work, networking(59%), and
meetings at work (58%). They also want to emphasize the breaks
they take in between work (57% developers).
Outside work, 62% developers find it worthwhile to include
health related activities in their mock-up vlogs, and 59% developers
want to capture their daily social interactions.
However, the activities developers want to capture more (or sim-
ilar) in their mock-up vlogs are different from the activities they
reported spending more time on (see Figure 1). This can stem from
the motivations behind the vlogs. To understand how motivation
can affect the value of presenting an activity though vlogs, we ran-
domly assigned a motivation scenario to the survey question “If
you were to make a vlog ...". 112 developers were asked to pro-
mote personal network and value, 106 developers were to promote
diversity in computing, and 117 developers to promote awareness
of computing careers through their mock-up vlogs.
To understand how motivations affect what activities developers
find valuable, we calculated the percentage of developers who chose
to dedicate “more” screen-time compared to their real-time spent
per activity. Since we already know the real-time developers spend
on these activities, looking at distribution of developers wanting to
capture “more" captures the relative value developers unconsciously
assign when presenting themselves through vlogs.
Table 2 presents the percentage distribution of developers. De-
velopers find more activities valuable when they want to make a
vlog to promote diversity, and similar activities as valuable whenmaking vlog to promote awareness about computing careers or
promoting their personal ventures.
When motivated to promote personal value and network. >30%
of developers want to show coding, peripheral coding related and
problem solving activities through the mock-up vlogs; most devel-
opers ( 43%) want to dedicate more vlog-time for problem solving
compared to their reported time. Mock-up vlogs will have higher
dedicated time for mentoring and personal projects as 41%and 23%
developers want to show these activities more compared to their
daily life.
When motivated to promote diversity in computing. Developers
find a lot of activities valuable when motivated to promote diversity.
Mentoring is an important activity to show in these mock-up vlogs
with the 56% developers interested in including it, followed by
problem solving (50% developers). Other than activities at work,
developers also find creative personal projects (personal project
(30%) and Networking ( 26%)), social life (friends and family ( 27%)),
and health related activities ( 22%) important activities to include in
the mock-up vlog.
When motivated to promote awareness about computing careers.
Most developers want to capture problem solving (46%), coding
peripheral (36%), and coding (35%) activities to in mock-up vlogs.
33% developers want dedicating more vlog-time on mentoring,
and 21% developers want to show health related activities more
compared to their reported-time.
Summary: When asked about making a vlog, most developers
find coding, coding related activities, showing problem solv-
ing, and engaging in mentoring activities valuable and want to
dedicate more screen-time for these activities in the vlogs.
However, motivation behind making the vlogs affects what other
activities are deemed valuable; when promoting personal brand
and growth developers want to capture their time working
on personal projects in the vlogs, when promoting diversity
developers find it valuable to show socio-personal sides of their
life, and when promoting awareness about computing careers
developers want to feature their time spent in maintaining a
healthy life.
5 DISCUSSION
Our findings have brought together two perspectives of software
developers. From RQ1 , we presented an expanded understanding
of the types of activities developers to in a day. Likewise, from RQ2
andRQ3 we found that similar activities would be of interest in
presenting to other developers (who do not vlog) albeit at different
frequencies. In this remainder of this section, we interpret our
findings from our research questions to help build a more complete
understanding developers identity.
In answering our research questions we found that LSC develop-
ers wanted to their vlogs to paint a not so perfect picture of what
they do in practice. Next, we discuss interesting differences in how
they reported spending their time in contrast with what developers
wanted to display publicly in their mock-up vlog. Table 3 compares
the findings from Section 4.2 with Section 4.3.
411Reel Life vs. Real Life: How Software Developers Share Their Daily Life through Vlogs ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece
5.1 Picture (Not So) Perfect: Contrasting
Reported Time vs. Mock-Up Vlog Time
Presenting activities that take significant time. LSC developers
wanted their mock-up vlogs to capture the activities they also
spend the most time on— coding, peripheral coding activities, and
problem solving . Between 59% and 80% of developers reported they
spend an hour or more in these activities and between 84% and
94% of developers wanted to include them in the mock-up vlogs.
Developers also wanted to capture how they communicate and stay
connected with their colleagues: 41% developers spend an hour or
more in emails and different messaging services and 64% developers
want their mock-up vlog to appropriately include that activity.
Presenting more than in real life. LSC developers want their mock-
up vlog to show some activities more frequently even though they
reported spending less time on these activities. While less than
25% developers reported spending an hour on a typical day men-
toring others, 88% developers want their mock-up vlog to feature
mentoring with 42% of them want to dedicate more time in the
vlog showing mentoring in proportion to their actual time spent.
We found a comparable difference with respect to wellness activ-
ities. About 80% developers reported spending less than an hour
onhealth activities, lifestyle, and creative personal projects outside
of work. Yet many respondents aspired for their mock-up vlog to
present these activities to showcase a healthy lifestyle.
Presenting less than in real life. We found that activities which
LSC developers wanted to disclose less on their mock-up vlog than
they do in their life. One of these activities is attending meetings :
51% developers spent more than an hour a day doing meetings, yet
42% developers want their mock-up vlog to show comparatively less.
Meetings are unavoidable at work, “and some days [developers]
spend the whole day in meeting rooms” [V38]. In any setting, in-
person or virtual, a day full of meetings can cause fatigue (recently
zoom fatigue). Meetings are a necessary evil, that developers did
not want to define as a major part of their job as a developer. Simi-
larly, developers reported spending more social time with friends
and family than what they would portray in their mock-up vlog.
This may be due to privacy concerns impacting how much LSC
developers are comfortable to share about the people around them.
Differences by mock-up vlog motivation. The prescribed moti-
vations to vlog impacted what developers wanted their mock-up
vlog to show. To encourage diversity , developers wanted their mock-
up vlog to capture the technical and social aspects of a work day.
Respondents crafted a day that incorporates family time, ample
breaks, shares collaboration through meetings, building a network,
and empowering others through mentoring. This large variety of
activities (showing >20% in Figure 1) indicates that in order to share
diversity of the development experience, they should share a vari-
ety of activities. When the motivation was to encourage awareness
about computing careers, developers wanted their mock-up vlog to
spend less time on personal projects compared to other motivations.
One reason could be that developers want to transparently let their
audience know they will have less time to devote to their computing
hobbies and inherently more time that will be spent elsewhere.Table 3: Contrasting time spent with mock-up vlogs. The
“High” column has activities where at least 40% of survey re-
spondents reported that they spend one hour or more. The
“More” row has the top half of activities ranked based on
how frequently respondents wanted to show them in the
mock-up vlogs.

Many of the differences we find across reported time and mock-
up vlog time may be based on what developers anticipate their day
should be in comparison to what it in fact entails. Further research
could investigate if these differences persist in other developer “day
planning” studies.
5.2 Vlogs for Future Developer Studies
Through our study, we found that vlogs can be used as a dataset
for understanding developer experiences with several advantages.
We outline a few opportunities below.
Vlogs can be used as a data source to understand self pre-
sentation , which typically takes on two forms: self-constructive or
audience-pleasing [ 13]. Aself-constructive vlog emphasizes aspects
that developers themselves find valuable, and captures activities
that developers enjoy and learn from, and identify with. The vlogs
created for audience-pleasing aspects tend to serve the audience [ 29]
through information that the audience will find useful. One instance
of this is when the audience consists of other developers looking
for a career or location change as well as students contemplating
a career in computing [ 20]. Developers sharing vlogs along these
lines will share what they think is be most valuable to know when
one is going on the job market (self-constructive) and hidden se-
crets to success on the job market that the audience may not know
(audience-pleasing). These two forms make vlogs a prosperous
source of readily available data from developers around the world,
and can be used to understand how the information that developers
share through vlogs affect developer communities? How can vlogs
be used to increase diversity in computing? When triangulated
with other sources, research can also draw valuable insights from
vlogs like (3) how have workplace practices and types of activities
evolved over the years? Eventually, vlogs evolve into an alternative
form of documentation with the ability to directly link to source
code.
Vlogs can be used as a time capsule for understanding de-
veloper activities over time. Vlogs and other types of videos can
capture trends in tech companies, trends in programming languages,
and even developers fashion choices (e.g., life before developers
412ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece Souti Chattopadhyay, Thomas Zimmermann, Denae Ford
wore hoodies) to study them over time periods. One example of a
time period that can be studied is the difference between collabo-
ration challenges developer faced during the COVID-19 pandemic
compared to challenges the pandemic—a unique time period where
many software developers were working remotely. Using vlogs as a
time capsule provides the opportunity for studies to even compare
developers at the inception of video sharing [49] to the present.
Vlogs can be used to study the diversity of software devel-
opers. When studying diversity, small groups of developers (e.g.,
Trans*, Black, visually-impaired, etc.) may be over-sampled for em-
pirical studies due to the small size of their population, leading
to study fatigue. Vlogs can be the first dataset researchers use for
an analysis of these group’s behavior and expertise before asking
the same group of developers to take another survey, thus reduc-
ing survey fatigue. Likewise, if there are not already vlogs for this
group, researchers could design a study for developers in this study
to share details about multiple parts of their experience to use as
a reference for many studies to come. Another example of vlogs
being a resource to reach out to demographics of developers we
traditionally don’t have access to such as developers across ge-
ographic regions (e.g., a researcher in the Netherlands studying
developers in Japan). The breadth of vlogs provides a snapshot at
the intersections between technical and socio-cultural experiences
around the world.
Future researchers should be mindful of the opportunities (and
challenges) that this type of developer populations present with
respect to their studies. We acknowledge that vlogs are not a substi-
tute for conducting other types of empirical studies of developers,
however, we hope researchers refer to them as an alternative for
conducting empirical studies.
6 LIMITATIONS
We used a mixed method study approach based on vlogs on YouTube
and a survey in a large software company. Findings from qualitative
research are difficult quantify, so we triangulate our insights from
the vlog analysis with a survey of 335 developers. As with any
empirical study, there are limitations to this work.
For the vlog data , the videos may not be an accurate depiction of
an actual workday. For example, to stand out developers may vlog
stories that are unique and interesting, add elements like humor
and suspetnse, and adhere to current trends like work-life balance
and work from home. Vlogs may also be affected by monetization
of he videos on YouTube. Despite these potential limitations, vlogs
provide a unique form of observational data into a developer’s
natural environment. Compared to observations and field studies,
vlogs can be studied at a much lower cost, and provide access to
participants beyond physical boundaries and outside work hours.
Additionally, it requires a level of comfort to be in-front of cam-
era and capture certain parts of their day. In part, the goal of this
research, specifically 4.2, was to identify if there is an overlap in
activities between those who the SE community refers to as an “av-
erage” developer (an LSC developer) versus developers that identify
themselves beyond that (in this case software vloggers). Vlogs are a
unique dataset that captures this diversity. Through this and futurestudies, we aim to understand how SE researchers and the commu-
nity can broaden their perspective of who software developers are
and what they do.
The activity categories identified through negotiated agreement
across three researchers are aggregated from “A day in the life of
a developer” vlogs on YouTube. These activities depend on many
factors such as the job roles, location, and developers’ individual
experiences. Despite having a very diverse population of developers,
our reported findings may not generalize to other types of videos
by developers on other types of videos on YouTube like tutorials or
other platforms like TikTok.
The survey may have been influenced by self-selection bias [ 15].
When sharing preferences about what activities to capture in mock-
up vlog, individual developers may have different priorities and
feel more strongly about the value of certain activities than the
average population of developers. Furthermore, the survey was
conducted in a large software company and may not generalize to
other companies or open source. What developers at LSC report
they do are limited by response biases to some extent, influenced
by the desire to present socially acceptable information. These
are limitations of surveys in general. To reduce primacy bias we
randomized items when possible. To reduce social desirability bias,
all survey responses were anonymous and unlinked in order to give
respondents confidence to answer freely–or to not answer at all
(no questions were required). To facilitate replication of this work,
we provide supplemental material .
7 RELATED WORK
YouTube and work. The concepts of self-presentation and iden-
tity on YouTube have been studied for several types of workers, for
example dentists [ 32], nurses [ 30], or Uber drivers [ 16]. YouTube
videos have also been investigated in the context of learning, for
example for student nurses [ 19]. In general, online videos have
been helpful for learning new technical content. For example, tech-
nical content being available as interactive lessons through MOOCs
have been helpful with teaching technical content in large course
settings [ 17,27]. In the context of work, funny videos have been
found to have a positive influence on work-related well-being [ 28].
A common self-presentation technique on YouTube and other social
media is micro-celebrity [37] in which “people view themselves as
a public persona to be consumed by others, use strategic intimacy
to appeal to followers, and regard their audience as fans” [36].
Developers on social media. The landscape of software engineer-
ing has been changed dramatically by social media [ 14,45,46].
Past empirical studies have focused on the use of various social
media for software development, for example, social coding on
GitHub [ 21]; asking questions on social Q&A sites such as Stack-
Overflow [ 47]; staying current [ 41]; following OSS projects [ 24,41],
and creating social movements [ 34] with Twitter; discussing secu-
rity threats on Reddit [ 33]; programming mentorship communities
on Twitch.tv [ 23], and sharing documentation and knowledge on
YouTube [ 35]. Many developers publish video tutorials about soft-
ware development on YouTube. Research has recently started to
extract relevant fragments [ 39] and source code [ 31,48] from tuto-
rial videos to support software developers.
413Reel Life vs. Real Life: How Software Developers Share Their Daily Life through Vlogs ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece
How developer spend their time. Several studies have investigated
developers’ workdays, daily activities, and work processes to gain
insights about software development. Several studies relied on
telemetry data that automatically records developers’ interactions
with a computer. For example, Aman et al. [ 9] investigated 6,300
hours of work time from over 100 professional C# developers in
Visual Studio to identify how much is spend on activities such as
code editing and execution or navigation. Astromskis et al. [ 11]
analyzed 1,000 hours of activities of six developers within an IDE
with respect to development activities, online help, and task switch-
ing. A limitation of telemetry-based studies is that they cannot
capture time away from the computer. Several studies relied on
self-reported data, typically collected through surveys or online
diaries. For example, Ford et al. [ 25] identified various personas
and working styles of developers based on self-reported time spent
on knowledge worker activities in a survey. Meyer et al. [ 38] char-
acterized productive workdays of developers based of self-reported
time spent in a survey. Conceptually the day-in-the-life vlogs are a
different form of diary. While existing studies bring out important
aspects of workdays, our study of vlogs reveals “who developers
are” beyond just nine-to-five at work. Our study captures unique
aspects such as hobbies and side project, social activities, health,
workout, and lifestyle of developers.
Gray literature. Unlike published, formal literature in academic
journals and conferences papers, gray literature is considered to
be blog posts, videos, and white papers. Special literature review
techniques have emerged that include gray literature [ 26]. Often
these reviews are based on industrial literature like for example
this review on the pains and gains of micro-services [ 43]. The day-
in-the-life vlogs analyzed in this paper can be considered as a form
of gray literature, which to the best of our knowledge has not yet
been studied in software engineering.
8 CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK
Our study presents an empirical analysis of what developers who
vlog share about their professional and personal life to the world,
and what developers who don’t vlog anticipate sharing about their
full-life experience publicly. We find that both groups of developers
provide insights into true experiences despite differences in how
much technical depth (e.g., coding, problem solving, etc.) and social
depth (e.g., lifestyle, family time, mental health, etc.) they present.
Together, they present a richer and more complete description of
‘what software developers do’ in a day. We envision future research
in this area deepening our understanding of developer identity pre-
sentation and how vlogs can be a vehicle for personal self reflection
and naive realism.
