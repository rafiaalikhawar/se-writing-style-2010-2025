ABSTRACT
To solve programming issues, developers commonly search on
Stack Overflow to seek potential solutions. However, there is a
gap between the knowledge developers are interested in and the
knowledge they are able to retrieve using search engines. To help de-
velopers efficiently retrieve relevant knowledge on Stack Overflow,
prior studies proposed several techniques to reformulate queries
and generate summarized answers. However, few studies performed
a large-scale analysis using real-world search logs. In this paper,
we characterize how developers search on Stack Overflow using
such logs. By doing so, we identify the challenges developers face
when searching on Stack Overflow and seek opportunities for the
platform and researchers to help developers efficiently retrieve
knowledge.
To characterize search activities on Stack Overflow, we use search
log data based on requests to Stack Overflow’s web servers. We
find that the most common search activity is reformulating the
immediately preceding queries. Related work looked into query
reformulations when using generic search engines and found 13
types of query reformulation strategies. Compared to their results,
we observe that 71.78% of the reformulations can be fitted into those
reformulation strategies. In terms of how queries are structured,
17.41% of the search sessions only search for fragments of source
code artifacts (e.g., class and method names) without specifying
the names of programming languages, libraries, or frameworks.
Based on our findings, we provide actionable suggestions for Stack
Overflow moderators and outline directions for future research.
For example, we encourage Stack Overflow to set up a database
that includes the relations between all computer programming
terminologies shared on Stack Overflow, e.g., method name, data
structure name, design pattern, and IDE name. By doing so, Stack
Overflow could improve the performance of search engines by
considering related programming terminologies at different levels
of granularity.

1 INTRODUCTION
Stack Overflow is a popular and active knowledge base that hosts
questions and answers related to programming technologies [ 6–
8]. When developers seek solutions to programming issues, Stack
Overflow encourages them to “search and research” before posting
questions [ 1]. Developers commonly search on Stack Overflow
[52] to leverage existing knowledge. For example, if developers
could find the same problems and corresponding answers as the
programming issue they are experiencing, they do not need to
wait for a response to their questions. Moreover, the knowledge
related to the same programming issue would not be scattered
across threads [9].
However, there is a gap between the information need of de-
velopers and the results retrieved by search engines. Although
developers may have a specific information need in mind, they
might not understand how to express their needs clearly in a natu-
ral language query. Developers may need to search multiple times
on Stack Overflow to find the information that they need. To help
developers efficiently retrieve knowledge on Stack Overflow, prior
studies proposed techniques to reformulate queries [ 18,54] and
generate summarized answers [ 53]. However, few studies have per-
formed a large-scale analysis using search logs to characterize how
developers search on Stack Overflow. By doing so, we could identify
the challenges developers faced when searching on Stack Overflow
and seek opportunities for Stack Overflow and researchers to help
developers efficiently retrieve knowledge.
To characterize how developers search on Stack Overflow, we
used search log data collected from requests to Stack Overflow’s
web servers. Stack Overflow shared the search log data with usESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece Jiakun Liu, Sebastian Baltes, Christoph Treude, David Lo, Yun Zhang, and Xin Xia
under an NDA agreement. This shared data records the requests to
Stack Overflow’s web servers from December 1, 2017, to November
31, 2018. We extract the search sessions that are complete linear
navigation sequences with at least one search request. In complete
linear navigation sequences, the referrer web page of one request
is the target web page of the previous request. We do not consider
sequences that have more than one successor to a predecessor, or
sequences with gaps, because such sequences do not contain a clear
order of reformulation events. To describe how developers search on
Stack Overflow, we consider the page visited before a certain
search event was triggered on Stack Overflow. For example,
searching while having a certain post open and searching from
the result page of a previous search request are different search
activities because they have different preceding pages. Overall,
we considered 14,126,647 search activities on Stack Overflow in
4,981,786 search sessions. We structure our study by answering the
following research questions:
(1)What are the search activities on Stack Overflow?
The most common search activity is reformulating the immediately
preceding query. When developers search from a post, the time
interval between the request to the post and the request related to
a new search is the largest compared to other activities.
(2)What are the differences between searching on Stack Over-
flow and general search in terms of query reformulation?
71.78% of the reformulations on Stack Overflow can be assigned
to the reformulation strategies identified for general search as re-
ported by Huang and Efthimiadis [ 28]. For the reformulations that
cannot be assigned to the strategies identified in general search,
only 26.69% of them have domain-specific characteristics, e.g., sub-
stituting a name of a function defined for a programming language
with another name of a function with similar functionality.
(3)What is the nature of queries on Stack Overflow?
17.41% of the search sessions only search for fragments of source
code artifacts (e.g., class and method names) without specifying
the names of programming languages, libraries, and frameworks.
Developers use queries with different semantic tags for different
types of search intentions. They most frequently search for manip-
ulating data type or function of a certain programming languages
and their corresponding technologies, e.g., library and framework.
Based on our findings, we provide actionable suggestions for
Stack Overflow moderators and researchers. For example, we sug-
gest that researchers could propose specific optimization approaches
for the reformulations that have domain-specific characteristics. We
encourage Stack Overflow to set up a database similar to WordNet
that includes the relations between all programming terminologies
shared on Stack Overflow, e.g., method name, data structure name,
and design pattern name. By doing so, Stack Overflow could return
more relevant search results by considering programming termi-
nologies that are related in terms of their technical aspects, and
developers would not need to reformulate their queries by trying
programming terminologies at different levels of granularity, e.g.,
replacing a method name with a class name or library name.
2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Analyzing search logs
Search engine logs (i.e., search logs) record the HTTP requests
to search engine web servers [ 19]. They contain information onhow users refine their queries as well as how users click on sug-
gested results. There are many works that use search engine logs
to characterize the search behavior and queries.
To model the user behaviors when searching, prior studies ex-
tracted click data from search logs [ 15,20,31,35]. For example,
Radlinski et al. used the time to first click on the search result page
to reflect the quality of the result presentation [ 41]. Kim et al. con-
sidered the server-side click dwell time as a sum of the actual click
dwell time and the time to formulate the next query [31].
To better understand the search intentions, prior studies extract
queries from search logs. Various classifications and taxonomies
have been proposed to understand users’ search queries from dif-
ferent viewpoints, including intent taxonomy, topic taxonomy, and
performance taxonomy [ 16,34,44,52]. For example, the KDD Cup
2005 provides a formal two-level taxonomy, with 67-second level
nodes and 800,000 Internet user search queries [ 34]. Broder et al.
proposed the first and most popular taxonomy of query intent (i.e.,
user goal) on the Web [ 16]. They identified three classes of queries:
informational, navigational, and transactional.
Different from the documents with well-formed sentences that
can be used for Information Retrieval (IR), the keyword-based
queries are usually short and lack sentence structures. Part-Of-
Speech (POS) tags and linguistic structures carry meaningful infor-
mation to match queries and documents. Manshadi et al. investi-
gated how to assign a label from a set of pre-defined semantic labels
(specific to the domain) to every word in the query [ 36]. Hearst et
al. identified a set of lexico-syntactic patterns (i.e., structures of part
of the sentence) to recognize hyponyms from free-form text [ 26].
This approach helps ground various studies on extracting semantic
phrases (drug entities from the online medical form [ 23], product
features from reviews [40], etc.).
Considering that web documents and user queries are created
by different sets of users, they may use different vocabularies and
distinct language styles. There exists a “lexical gap” between web
documents and user queries. Users have to reformulate queries to
find related information in search engines. To better understand
how users reformulate their queries, taxonomies of query refor-
mulation have been developed for different types of search. Anick
classified a random sample of 100 reformulations by hand into
eleven categories [ 13]. Teevan et al. constructed a taxonomy by
looking through query logs, and implemented algorithms to detect
a subset of the reformulation strategies [ 49]. Whittle et al. modeled
some reformulation strategies using a graphical network [ 51]. Guo
et al. constructed a small taxonomy and used a conditional random
field model to predict query refinements [17].
Different from these studies, to the best of our knowledge, this is
the first large-scale study of search activities on a domain-specific
large Q&A website. We characterize different search activities on
Stack Overflow, identify the reformulation strategies adopted by
developers when searching, and investigate the contents of queries.
2.2 Analyzing search activities in software
engineering
Prior studies characterize how developers search for programming-
related knowledge during the development process. Singer et al.
used a combination of surveys, interviews, observations, and col-
lecting tool usage statistics to characterize the search activitiesCharacterizing Search Activities on Stack Overflow ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece
during the development process [ 45]. They found that software
developers spend most of their time searching for information as
well as reading documentation and source code. Xia et al. collected
search queries from 60 developers and surveyed 235 software en-
gineers from 21 countries across five continents to characterize
what developers frequently searched for [ 52]. They observed that
searching for explanations for unknown terminologies is the most
frequent search task that developers perform. Peterson et al. con-
ducted an eye-tracking study on how developers seek information
on Stack Overflow [ 39]. They found that developers look at the text
more often than the title in posts. Code snippets were the second
most looked at element. Different from prior studies, our work uses
the search logs of the popular question and answering platform to
perform a large-scale analysis of the search activities.
Bajracharya and Lopes analyzed the usage log of a code search
engine (i.e., Koders) [ 14]. They observed that users who find code
search engines usable already know with high level of specificity
what to look for. Sadowski et al. used a combination of survey and
log-analysis methodologies to characterize how developers search
for code on Google [ 43]. They observed that programmers are
looking for code with which they are somewhat familiar. Different
from prior studies, our work analyzes the search logs in the popular
question and answering platform (i.e., Stack Overflow).
Besides, a number of studies focused on answer-seeking on Stack
Overflow. For example, Zhang et al. proposed an interactive query
refinement approach for question retrieval to help users recognize
and clarify technical details missed in queries [ 54]. Nie et al. pro-
posed a code search approach by expanding queries with important
keywords extracted from relevant SO question and answer pairs
[38]. Xu et al. proposed an approach named AnswerBot to gen-
erate a summarized answer for a query by extracting important
sentences from the answers of similar questions [ 53]. However, it
is still unclear what are the similarities and differences between
the query reformulation processes in searching on Stack Overflow
and general search. Kaibo et al. proposed an automated software-
specific query reformulation approach based on deep learning [ 18].
They performed a formative study on the users’ activity logs from
Stack Overflow. Different from prior studies, our work compares
the query reformulation process in Stack Overflow with that in
general search. We identify the types of reformulations that are
distinct in Stack Overflow.
3 STUDY SETUP
Our raw dataset contains all internal requests processed by Stack
Overflow’s web servers, including the timestamps and other meta-
data such as the referrer, target URL, and anonymized user identifier.
Internal means that requests of users coming from external websites
were excluded, yielding 747,421,780 requests in total, ranging from
December 1, 2017, to November 31, 2018. The anonymized user
identifiers were created for logged-in users, users tracked via cook-
ies, or generated for sessions based on available information such
IP addresses. We had no information on how users were identified,
we just had access to the randomly generated identifiers.
To filter out search logs from the raw dataset, we extracted
search sessions ascomplete linear navigation sequences with
at least one search request . In complete linear navigation se-
quences, the referrer web page of one request is the target web pageof the previous request. We excluded sequences having more than
one potential successor for a certain target event, i.e. non-linear
sequences, and sequences with gaps, i.e. incomplete sequences.
For example, a user may trigger multiple search requests from
different browser tabs with the same Stack Overflow page open,
while being tracked as described above. In that case, we cannot
linearly order the user’s navigation events. Further, since we only
had access to interal requests, i.e. requests with a referrer from
stackoverflow.com , a sequence may contain gaps if a user navi-
gated to external websites and later came back to Stack Overflow.
We excluded such sequences, because users might have triggered
other search requests with general search engines during the gaps,
giving us an incomplete view of the search activity. Hence, we
focused on complete linear sequences with a total order over the
navigation events.
To extract such complete linear navigation sequences, we first
grouped all requests based on user identifiers and ordered them
chronologically. We distinguished different sessions if the time inter-
val between consecutive requests was more than six minutes apart,
following Sadowski et al.’s approach [ 18]. As a result, 747,421,780
web server requests were grouped into 98,495,404 navigation se-
quences. Secondly, we excluded 74,613,186 (75.75%) non-linear se-
quences and incomplete sequences. Thirdly, we utilized heuris-
tics based on the timestamps and request targets to filter out bot
traffic. This ended up with 18,269,793 (18.55%) linear non-bot se-
quences. We further removed page refresh events. This ended up
with 16,164,506 sequences (88.48% of the linear non-bot sequences).
Of those sequences, 4,981,786 (30.8%) had at least one search event.
All those steps were developed in an iterative process, involving
qualitative analysis of samples of sequences to detect problematic
instances (non-linear sequences, bot traffic, page refreshes, etc.).1
For the sessions with more than one search request, we consider
the later queries to be reformulations of the earlier ones rather
than queries requesting new information. Section 5.2 discusses the
threats to validity related to the time interval.
In the dataset, each request was assigned to certain event
types , determined based on the requested resource. For example,
the event type Search is related to triggering a search using Stack
Overflow’s search box. The event type Post is related to requesting
a certain post, i.e. question or answer, e.g. by clicking on a link in
the search result list. The event type Home is related to requesting
the home page of Stack Overflow. We use the artificial event type
Begin to describe the beginning of a search session and the artificial
event type Endto describe the end of a search session. Note that
developers could search from any search result page, post page,
or the home page of Stack Overflow using the search box in the
header of the web page. Developers could visit the home page by
clicking the Stack Overflow icon in the header of the web page from
the search result page or the post page. Developers also could visit
a post from the search result page or the home page. To describe
how developers search on Stack Overflow, we consider the page
from which search events were triggered when we refer to
search activity on Stack Overflow (i.e., we focus on consec-
utive pairs of events). For example, searching from a post and
searching from a search result page are different search activities

because they have different preceding events. As a result, we obtain
search log data with 14,126,647 search activities (i.e., consecutive
pairs of events) in 4,981,786 search sessions.
4 RESULTS
4.1 RQ 1: What are the search activities on
Stack Overflow?
Motivation: Prior studies identified that developers commonly
search during their development process [ 45,52]. However, few
studies performed a large-scale analysis to characterize how de-
velopers search on Stack Overflow. Here, we would like to charac-
terize the search activities (i.e., consecutive pairs of events) using
the search log data. More specifically, we would like to understand
which web pages are frequently requested by developers when
browsing a certain web page, the beginning and the end of search
sessions, and the time interval between the requests related to the
consecutive pairs of events in different search activities. By doing
so, we could identify opportunities and challenges for researchers
and Stack Overflow to help developers search on Stack Overflow.
Approach: To calculate the occurrences of different search activi-
ties on Stack Overflow, we count the number of different types of
consecutive pairs of events.
Then, we investigate whether the occurrence of certain search
activity is related to the occurrence of another search activity.
More specifically, we would like to mine the patterns of the co-
occurrences of different types of consecutive pairs of events. We
use the Apriori algorithm to analyze the association rules between
different search activities (i.e, consecutive pairs of events) [ 11,12].
We measure the performance of rules with the support and confi-
dence metrics. Support expresses the ratio in which the rule can be
found in the data set. Confidence expresses the ratio in which the
rule is correct.
Then we calculate the time interval between the request to the
preceding page and the request to the target page for each search
activity. We compare the differences between different types of
search activity in terms of the time interval of the corresponding
requests.
Results: The most common search activity is reformulating
the immediately preceding query (i.e., Search→Search) . We
identify 336 types of search activity (i.e., consecutive pairs of events).
The top 9 types of search activities account for 86.07% of the search
activities on Stack Overflow. We refer to the top 9 types of search
activities as the dominant search activities. Table 1 presents the
dominant search activity types on Stack Overflow. 17.20% of the
search activities are from a search result page to another search
result page. Following that, visiting a post from search result
page (i.e., Search→Post) is the second most common search
activity . 13.86% of the search activities are from a search result page
to a post. This indicates that developers need to frequently identify
whether the post excerpts in the search result list are related to
their search intentions.
Next, we would like to discuss the beginning of search sessions.
Figure 1 depicts the dominant types of search activity on Stack
Overflow.2Table 2 shows the rules of the top 10 most frequently

search activity types.

ers browse different types of preceding pages.
co-occurring search activity types related to the beginning and the
end of the search sessions (i.e., the beginning of the search session
is in left-hand side, or the end of the search session is in right-
hand side). We focus on the rules with support >0.129 because
the proportion of the search sessions with the 9-th most common
search activity (i.e., Begin →Search in Table 1) is 12.9%. Table 2
shows that searching from the posts (i.e., Post→Search) is frequently
co-occurring with the beginning of the search session. One possible
reason is that developers cannot obtain desired knowledge from
the web pages included in the search result list in external search
engines. Developers continue their search tasks using the search
engine provided by Stack Overflow.
Next, we would like to discuss the end of search sessions. Ta-
ble 2 shows that visiting a post from the search result page is fre-
quently co-occurring with the end of the search session. 62.73%
(i.e., 3,125,053) of search sessions end up in posts. At the end
of the search session, developers may find posts related to their
search intentions. They click the posts and finish the search task.
However, developers may not find interesting posts related to their
search intentions. Table 2 shows that reformulating the immedi-
ately preceding query is frequently co-occurring with the end of the
search session. They give up reformulating queries and do not end
the search session in posts. For the sessions that do not end up
in posts, only 0.01% of them request the QuestionAsk page,
i.e., propose questions on Stack Overflow. This shows that de-
velopers commonly do not ask questions when they cannot find
the knowledge related to their programming problems.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of the time interval between
the request to the preceding page and the request to the target
page in dominant types of search activity. To check whether the
differences in the time interval are statistically significant between
different types of search activity, we perform the Kruskal-Wallis
H-test [ 32]. The Kruskal-Wallis H test is a non-parametric test for
comparing whether two or more independent samples originate
from the same distribution. The null hypothesis is that there is no
difference in the time interval between different types of search
activity. As a result, the differences in the time interval between
different types of search activity are significant (p-value <0.05). One
possible reason is that developers need different amounts of time in
different types of search activity. To identify which types of search
activity are associated with a larger time interval, we perform a
Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction to determine which groupsCharacterizing Search Activities on Stack Overflow ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece

differ from each other [ 22]. Dunn’s test can be used for the post-hoc
analysis for the specific sample pairs. Bonferroni correction is used
to counteract the problem of multiple comparisons [ 10]. We also
calculate Cliff’s delta to measure the effect size [ 21]. Cliff’s delta is
a non-parametric effect size measure that can evaluate the amount
of difference between two groups. Romano et al. define an absolute
delta of less than 0.147, between 0.147 and 0.33, between 0.33 and
0.474 and above 0.474 as “Negligible”, “Small”, “Medium”, “Large”
effect size, respectively [ 42]. Table 3 shows the p-values and Cliff’s
deltas.Table 3: P-values and Cliff’s delta of the differences between
different types of search activity in terms of time interval.
Search→Post Post→Search Home→Search
Search→Search + small - large - small
Search→Post - large - medium
Post→Search + medium
The time interval between requests when developers visit a post
from the search result page (i.e., Search→Post), is the smallest com-
pared with other search activities, followed by when developers
reformulate the immediately preceding query (i.e., Search→Search).
One possible reason is that developers spend little time in under-
standing the difference and similarities between the post excerpts
presented in the search result list page and their search intention.
When developers search from a post (i.e., Post→Search),
the time interval between requests is the largest. One possible
reason is that it takes the most time for developers to come up with
the next query after browsing the posts on Stack Overflow. We
suggest that researchers could design a tool for developers to label
the sentences in posts that are the most similar to and the most
different from their search intention to better reformulate queries.
When developers search from the home page (i.e., Home
→Search), the time interval between requests is the second
largest. One possible reason is that it takes a long time for develop-
ers to write the initial query on Stack Overflow. Developers may not
be aware of how to write the initial query to express their search
intention. This motivates us to analyze how developers express
their search intention into queries in Section 4.3.
The most common search activity is reformulating the imme-
diately preceding query. For the sessions that do not end up
in posts, only 0.01% of them ask questions on Stack Overflow.
When developers search from a post, the time interval between
requests is the largest. This is followed by searching from the
home page.
4.2 RQ 2: What are the differences between
searching on Stack Overflow and general
search in terms of query reformulation?
Motivation: Prior studies have developed tools to help developers
reformulate their queries on Stack Overflow [ 38,54]. However,
they did not compare searching on Stack Overflow with general
search in terms of the query reformulation process. By doing so,ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece Jiakun Liu, Sebastian Baltes, Christoph Treude, David Lo, Yun Zhang, and Xin Xia
researchers could propose specific optimization approaches for the
types of reformulations that are distinct on Stack Overflow.
Approach: To identify the reformulation strategies in the search
activities in the field of software engineering, we follow Huang and
Efthimiadis’s work [ 28]. In Huang and Efthimiadis’s work, they
learned from the search logs of general search engines and created
the taxonomy of reformulation strategies. We use the taxonomy
of Huang and Efthimiadis’s work as a starting point because they
summarized the reformulation strategies identified in prior studies
[25,30,33,49,51]. The taxonomy provided by Huang and Efthimi-
adis is still popular in the field of query reformulation [ 27,46–48].
Besides, Huang and Efthimiadis proposed a heuristic algorithm to
determine the taxonomy reformulation strategies [ 4]. We use the
heuristic algorithm proposed by Huang and Efthimiadis to deter-
mine the taxonomy of reformulation strategies [ 28]. As a result, out
of 4,048,518 reformulations on Stack Overflow, 2,905,998 of them
can be fitted into the reformulation strategies that are identified
in Huang and Efthimiadis’s work (i.e., determined reformulations).
1,142,520 of the reformulations cannot be fitted into the taxon-
omy of reformulation strategies using the heuristic algorithm (i.e.,
undetermined reformulations).
Huang and Efthimiadis characterized the reformulations that
cannot be fitted into the taxonomy of reformulation strategies us-
ing the heuristic algorithm [ 28]. Huang and Efthimiadis observed
there are three general types of undetermined reformulations, i.e.,
rephrasing semantically with sophisticated semantic associations,
reformulations with more than one reformulation strategy, and clas-
sifier rule limitations (e.g., spelling correction with three or more
character edits, word substitutions with words absent from the
WordNet database, URL stripping with second-level domains which
are not stripped, and abbreviations not being a substring prefix).
Note that adding words and removing words together were not con-
sidered a multi-reformulation since any query can be transformed
into any other query. Following their work, we randomly sampled a
statistically representative sample of 386 undetermined reformula-
tions, using a 95% confidence level with a 4.99% confidence interval.
Then we manually performed an open coding process to identify the
strategies of undetermined reformulations. This process involves 3
phases and is performed by two authors (A1 and A5) of this paper:
Phase I : We randomly selected 50 undetermined reformulations
from the sampled 386 undetermined reformulations. The first two
authors used the coding schema provided by Huang and Efthimi-
adis’s work to categorize the selected 50 undetermined reformula-
tions collaboratively [ 28]. During this phase, the coding schema of
the types of undetermined reformulations on Stack Overflow was
revised and refined. We performed the refinement because: (1) A
large number of undetermined reformulations are related to adding
or removing bug information. (2) A large number of undetermined
reformulations are related to replacing programming terminologies.
(3) There are undetermined reformulations related to translating
queries from one natural language to English. (4) There are unde-
termined reformulations where the search intentions are expressed
in different queries. For example, [apache-spark] evaluation is re-
formulated to [apache-spark] ml at first. Then [apache-spark] ml is
reformulated to [apache-spark] ml evaluation . We have to read all
queries in a session to identify developers’ search intentions.
Phase II : The first two authors applied the resulting coding schemaof Phase I to categorize the remaining 334 undetermined reformula-
tions independently. They were instructed to take notes regarding
the deficiency and ambiguity of the coding schema for categorizing
certain undetermined reformulations. The inter-rater agreement
(Cohen’s kappa) of this stage is 0.69, indicating that the agreement
level is substantial [50].
Phase III : The first two authors discussed the coding results ob-
tained in Phase 2 to resolve the disagreements. We also invited
another Ph.D. student, who is not an author of the paper, to discuss
the disagreements. For example, for the undetermined reformula-
tion [geoserver] timestamp →[geoserver] csw , A1 considered this
reformulation as searching for different topics because cswis not
related to timestamp in Wikipedia.3A5 considered this reformu-
lation as technical entity substitution because CSW is a service
related to time in geoserver.4We finally considered this reformu-
lation as a technical entity substitution. We did not identify new
categories in Stage 3. At the end of Stage 3, we obtained the fi-
nal coding schema and the final coding results of the sampled 386
undetermined reformulations.
Results: 71.78% of the reformulations can be fitted into the
reformulation strategies identified in general search , e.g., users
search for non-technical information in Bing or Google. Table 4
shows the categories of reformulation strategies using the algo-
rithms proposed for general search. Table 5 shows the categories of
reformulation strategies for the undetermined reformulations. Prior
studies propose domain-specific tools to help developers to search
on Stack Overflow [ 18]. However, they did not characterize the
similarities and differences between the general search and search-
ing for programming knowledge on Stack Overflow. Table 5 shows
that 67.88% of the undetermined reformulations can be observed in
Huang and Efthimiadis’s work [ 28]. We suggest researchers could
focus on the reformulations that cannot be detected in general
search engines.
4.2.1 Strategies of determined reformulations Developers specialize
the search intention the most during query reformulations.
More specifically, we observe that 22.99% of the query reformula-
tions are related to adding words to previous queries. Prior studies
have identified that developers commonly specialize their search
intention by adding words to the first queries [ 29]. This shows that
for the search sessions with query reformulations, developers com-
monly search with queries with limited information at the begin-
ning. Developers add more details related to their search intention
during the reformulation process. Following that, performing an-
other search with advanced search mechanism is the second
most common reformulation strategy . We observe 17% of the
reformulations with the same queries but different parameters in
the query string of the URL, e.g., tab=relevance , and tab=newest .
For example, developers can order the search results by time or
relevance [2, 5].
Generalizing search intention is the third most common
reformulation strategy. More specifically, we observe that 15.81%
of the query reformulations are related to removing words from
previous queries. Similarly, prior studies have identified that de-
velopers commonly generalize their search intention by removing

words from the first queries [ 29]. One possible reason is that the
queries have too much information. The Stack Overflow search
engine has poor performance for complex queries, as developers
have to hide part of their search intention with more general ter-
minology. The last query in a search session may not be the query
with the most search intention. This motivates us to read all queries
in a session to understand the search intention.
4.2.2 Strategies of undetermined reformulations Here, we would like
to discuss the reformulations that cannot be fitted into the strategies
identified in general search. We observe that 26.69% of the unde-
termined reformulations are related to the domain-specific
characteristics. More specifically, 18.91% of the undetermined re-
formulations are related to the programming terminologies in pre-
vious queries being replaced by other programming terminologies.
4.15% and 3.63% undetermined reformulations are related to the
developers directly introducing or removing a bug trace. Similar to
the semantic relations in the WordNet database, technical relations
can be similar functions (i.e., the functions that can achieve the
same task), inheritance, and generalization, etc [ 55]. For example, a
query Promise.all is reformulated to async/await , where Promise.all
can be used to await multiple requests to finish with async/await
syntax. We suggest researchers could set up a technical relation
database similar to WordNet. The nodes in the database can be
programming terminologies at different levels of granularity. The
relations in the database can record similar functions, control flow,
or data flow.71.78% of the reformulations can be fitted into the reformula-
tion strategies identified in general search. The most common
reformulation strategies are specializing the search intention,
using advanced search mechanisms, and generalizing the search
intention. For the reformulations that cannot be fitted into the
strategies identified in the general search, 26.69% of them are
related to the domain-specific characteristics.
4.3 RQ 3: What is the nature of queries on
Stack Overflow?
Motivation: Prior studies identified the tasks that are commonly
searched during the development process across different platforms
[52]. However, the intention when searching on Stack Overflow
and how developers express their search intentions is still unclear.
More specifically, we would like to characterize the query contents,
the search intentions, and the relations between them. By doing
so, we could provide suggestions for Stack Overflow in improving
the performance of the search engine. Stack Overflow also could
propose guidelines to help developers better express their search
intention into queries.
Approach: To characterize the query contents, we randomly sam-
pled a statistically representative sample of 1,086 search sessions,
using a 95% confidence level with a 3% confidence interval. Then
we manually performed an open coding process to identify the
semantic tags of the phrases in queries. This process involves 3
phases and is performed by the first three authors (A1, A5, and A6)
of this paper:
Phase I : A1 first developed a draft coding schema of the categories

tion of the search sessions that have corresponding semantic tags among the sampled 1086 search sessions.

selected from the sampled 1,086 sessions. To identify the semantic
tags of the phrase in queries, we first performed the query segmen-
tation task, i.e., dividing each query into valid meaningful minimal
segments. Following prior studies, we define a query 𝑞as a se-
quence ( 𝑤1, ... ,𝑤𝑘) of𝑘keywords [ 24]. A valid query segmentation
determines for each pair 𝑤𝑖, 𝑤𝑖+1of consecutive keywords in 𝑞
whether there should be a segment break between 𝑤𝑖and𝑤𝑖+1.
Hence, there are 2𝑘−1possible segment breaks for a 𝑘-keyword
query and 𝑘(𝑘+1)/2potential segments. Note that Stack Overflow
covers a wide range of knowledge across technologies. Then A1
searched all query segments in general search engines, e.g., Google
and Bing. By doing so, A1 could identify the semantic meanings of
the phrases in queries. Note that the semantic tags can be hierar-
chically organized. We obtain the semantic hierarchy of divided
query segments when we search them in general search engines.
For example, the technology name ,angular is aplatform for build-
ing web applications. Platform is the most fundamental semantic
hierarchy for the terminology angular . For the divided query seg-
ments, we identify their semantic tags at the most fundamental
semantic hierarchy level. Then A5 and A6 used the draft coding
schema to categorize the semantic tags of the phrases in queriesof 100 sessions collaboratively. During this phase, the draft coding
schema of the semantic tags of the phrases in queries of the 100
sessions was revised and refined. At the end of Stage 1, we obtained
74 categories of semantic tags.
Phase II : A1 and A5 applied the resulting coding schema of Phase I
to categorize the remaining 986 sessions independently. They were
instructed to take notes regarding the deficiency and ambiguity of
the coding schema for categorizing certain sessions. The inter-rater
agreement (Cohen’s kappa) for identifying the semantic tags task of
this stage is 0.82, indicating that the agreement level is substantial
[50].
Phase III : A1, A5, and A6 discussed the coding results obtained
in Phase 2 to resolve the disagreements. At the end of Stage 3, we
obtained the final coding schema and the final coding results of the
sampled 1,086 sessions.
Then we perform a qualitative study to understand the search
intentions of the queries in search sessions on Stack Overflow
using the above samples. More specifically, we manually performed
an open coding process to identify the categories of the search
intentions on Stack Overflow. This process involves 3 phases and
is performed by the three authors (A1, A5, and A6) of this paper:Characterizing Search Activities on Stack Overflow ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece
Phase I : A1 first developed a draft coding schema of the categories
of search intentions using 100 sessions selected from the sampled
1,086 sessions.5To identify the goals of the search sessions, A1
replicated all requests to Stack Overflow by reading all queries and
visited all pages in each search session. Then A5 and A6 used the
draft coding schema to categorize the goals of the search tasks of
100 sessions collaboratively. During this phase, the draft coding
schema of the goals of the search tasks of the 100 sessions was
revised and refined. At the end of Stage 1, we obtained 9 categories
of search intentions.
Phase II : A1 and A5 applied the resulting coding schema of Phase I
to categorize the remaining 986 sessions independently. They were
instructed to take notes regarding the deficiency and ambiguity of
the coding schema for categorizing certain sessions. The inter-rater
agreement (Cohen’s kappa) for identifying search intention of this
stage is 0.69, indicating that the agreement level is substantial [ 50].
Phase III : A1, A5, and A6 discussed the coding results obtained in
Phase 2 to resolve the disagreements. Disagreements between the
three authors are resolved by voting. For example, for the session
with one query difference between session time and current time ,
A1 considered that the goal of the session is related to identifying
the difference between the terminology session time and current
time in an Oracle database.6A5 considered the goal of the session
as to calculate the time interval between session time andcurrent
time. We finally considered that the goal of the session is related to
calculating the time interval because the developer visited a post
related to using time interval to keep track of online users.7At
the end of Stage 3, we obtained the final coding schema and the
final coding results of the sampled 1,086 sessions. Table 7 shows
the categories of the search intentions.
After identifying the semantic tags in queries and the categories
of the search intentions, we iteratively move along the semantic
hierarchy to merge lower semantic tags into a higher semantic
tag. However, some of the merges can change the categories of
the search intentions. For example, queries with the semantic tag
development tool are related to the use of development tool . Queries
with the semantic tag technology name are related to several search
intentions, e.g., technology combination, function call, excluding
use of development tool . We cannot merge the semantic tag tech-
nology name with development tool . We abandon the merge if the
merge can change the categories of the search intentions. By doing
so, we generalize semantic tags into 9 more abstract semantic tags.8
Results:
4.3.1 Semantic tags In terms of the distribution of the number of
semantic tags per query, we observe that 32.4% of the sampled
queries only have one semantic tag. 31.0% of the sampled queries
have two semantic tags. 22.2% of the sampled queries have three
semantic tags. Table 6 shows the semantic tags that are identified
in Stack Overflow queries at the concept level . We observe that
semantic tags related to programming terminologies are the
most common in Stack Overflow queries. More specifically,
5Note that the 100 sampled sessions in phase I in the queries categorization process
and the 100 sampled sessions in phase I in the search intentions categorization process
are randomly sampled. They are not designed to be the same or different.

7https://stackoverflow.com/q/7226145/
8The detailed full coding schemas of semantic tags can be obtained in
https://zenodo.org/record/4730525.61.98% of the sampled search sessions search with programming
language names or technology names that are related to their search
intentions in at least one query.
However, we observed that 17.41% of the sampled search sessions
only search data type ,method ,error information , and code, without
specifying the programming languages and their corresponding
technologies, e.g., library and framework. It is difficult to identify
related programming languages and their corresponding technolo-
gies if the Stack Overflow search engine indexes its content using
keyword matching. We suggest that Stack Overflow also should
take the relationship between programming terminologies in terms
of their technical aspect into consideration in its search engine.
For example, if the original query only has the function name of a
certain library, Stack Overflow could identify the library name and
append the library name to queries.
23.44% of the search sessions have at least one query with
additional conditions , i.e., they have adjectives that describe ad-
ditional conditions. For example, a developer issues the query sql
multiple view on Stack Overflow. They need to create multiple
views in SQL. After searching on general search engines, they may
identify that the official documentation of SQL server only has
knowledge related to creating a view in SQL.9They turn to Stack
Overflow to seek solutions for the programming problem with ad-
ditional conditions. We suggest the documentation teams could
provide the official solutions to the tasks with additional conditions
by supplementing additional information to the documentation.
4.3.2 Search intention Table 7 shows the search intention of the
sampled search sessions. During our labeling process described in
the Approach part, we could identify that developers use queries
with different semantic tags for different types of search in-
tention. Stack Overflow could provide guidelines for developers
to express different types of intention into queries with different
semantic tags.
We observe that developers search the most for manipu-
lating a data type and function of a certain programming
language or technology, e.g., library and framework . More
specifically, 19.33% of the sampled search sessions are related to
manipulating a data type in a specific programming language or
technology, e.g., instantiating a data type or finding an instance
with specific characteristics. 18.30% of the sampled search sessions
are related to function calls, e.g., calling a specific method or com-
mand. One possible reason is that examples presented in official
documentation cannot help with the development task. Develop-
ers have to search on Stack Overflow for the examples related to
manipulating a specific programming technology and the usage
examples of methods. We suggest the official documentation could
include a section on frequently asked questions.
Searching for how to complete a certain task is second
most common searched on Stack Overflow . More specifically,
18.30% of the sampled sessions are related to concrete development
tasks. Developers search for how to develop a detailed task given
a programming technology. 10.05% of the sampled sessions are
related to searching for a road map of a task even without a specific
programming technology. They may not know the programming
technologies related to the implementation of the task.

common in sampled search sessions.
5 DISCUSSION
5.1 Implications
5.1.1 Actionable Suggestions for Researchers In Section 4.2, we ob-
serve that 71.78% of the reformulations can be fitted into the refor-
mulation strategies identified in general search. 67.88% of the un-
determined reformulations can be observed in Huang and Efthimi-
adis’s work. This indicates that developers commonly use the same
reformulation strategies in Stack Overflow as in general search.
Prior studies have developed tools for query reformulation on
Stack Overflow [ 18,54]. However, they did not compare the query
reformulation process between general search and searching for
programming-related knowledge on Stack Overflow. Our research
finds the unique features of query reformulation on Stack Overflow.
We suggest that future work related to query reformulation on
Stack Overflow can propose specific optimization approaches for
the types of reformulations that do not appear in general search.
5.1.2 Actionable Suggestions for Stack Overflow In Section 4.1, we
observe that for the sessions that do not end up in posts, only 0.01%
of them propose questions on Stack Overflow. This indicates that
developers commonly do not ask questions when they cannot findthe knowledge related to their programming problems on Stack
Overflow. This would result in a lack of related knowledge on Stack
Overflow. We suggest that Stack Overflow could survey why users
do not ask questions after they cannot find the knowledge related
to their search intentions. By determining the root cause, Stack
Overflow could propose corresponding solutions.
In Section 4.1, we identify that when developers search from a
post, the time interval between requests is the largest. One possible
reason is that it takes the most time for developers to identify the
similarities and differences between their search intention and the
visited posts. They need time to write the next query. We suggest
Stack Overflow could enable developers to label which content in
the posts is related to their search intention, and which content
in the posts is irrelevant to developers’ search intention. By do-
ing so, Stack Overflow could propose a tool to help developers to
automatically reformulate queries from the visited posts.
In Section 4.3, we observe that 17.41% of the search sessions only
search fragments of source code artifacts (e.g., class and method
names) without specifying the names of programming languages
and technologies. However, programming languages and technolo-
gies are covered by the Stack Overflow tag system, while the frag-
ments of source code artifacts are not. It is difficult to identify related
programming languages and the corresponding technologies if the
Stack Overflow search engine indexes its content using keyword
matching. Moreover, in Section 4.2, we observe that for the reformu-
lations that cannot be mapped to the strategies identified in generalCharacterizing Search Activities on Stack Overflow ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece
search, 26.69% of them are related to the domain-specific charac-
teristics, e.g., replacing a programming terminology with another
programming terminology that are related in terms of technical
aspects. This indicates that Stack Overflow could not identify the
relations between programming terminologies. Developers have
to include possible related programming terminologies in their
queries. We suggest researchers could set up a database similar to
WordNet. The database should include the technical relations (e.g.,
is-arelation [ 37],has-a relation) between all programming termi-
nologies, e.g., class name, data structure, and algorithm name, that
are shared on Stack Overflow. This database can represent a more
fine-grained programming ecosystem from high-level language and
library names down to names of related source code artifacts. By do-
ing so, Stack Overflow could improve the performance of its search
engine by considering the terminologies that are related in terms of
their technical aspects. Developers do not need to reformulate their
queries by trying programming terminologies at different levels
of granularity, e.g., replacing a method name with a class name or
library name.
In Section 4.1, we identify that when developers search from
the home page, the time interval between requests is the second-
largest compared with other search activities. In Section 4.3, we
observe that developers use queries with different semantic tags
for different types of search intention. Although Stack Overflow
provides guidelines for developers to ask and answer questions, it
does not provide guidelines for developers on how to search [ 1,3].
We suggest Stack Overflow could propose guidelines for developers
when they search on Stack Overflow, e.g., how to express their
search intention into queries.
5.2 Threats to validity
Threats to internal validity concern the factors that could have
influenced our results. We heavily depend on manual processes as
described in Section 4.2 and Section 4.3. Like any human activity,
our manual labeling process is subject to personal bias. To reduce
personal bias in the manual labeling process, each sample was
labeled by two of the authors, and discrepancies were discussed
until a consensus was reached. We also showed that the level of
inter-rater agreement of the qualitative studies is high (i.e., the
values of Cohen’s kappa ranged between 0.69 to 0.82).
We distinguish different sessions if the time interval between
consecutive requests was more than six minutes. However, develop-
ers could search for different search tasks in six minutes. In Section
4.2, we observe that 22.54% of the undetermined reformulations are
related to the fact that the second query searches for new topics
compared with the previous queries. This indicates that 6.21% of
search sessions might contain more than one task. Determining
whether queries relate to the same search sessions with a time
interval of over 6 minutes brings additional threats to our work.
Threats to external validity concern the generalization of our
findings. Our study is conducted to investigate the search activities
on Stack Overflow. That said, our findings may not be generalized
to the search activities in the search engines in other programming-
related Q&A websites and general search engines. Stack Overflow
covers a wide range of programming-related technologies. Other
programming-related Q&A websites, e.g., Google Product Forums10
10https://productforums.google.com/forum/and Microsoft Community11, only share the knowledge that is re-
lated to a specific technology. The queries in other programming-
related Q&A websites may not need to explain the related tech-
nologies. Moreover, the search engines of programming-related
Q&A websites (including Stack Overflow) only index the knowl-
edge hosted within the websites. In contrast, general search engines
could index the knowledge across the Internet. This indicates that
when using the search engines provided by programming related
Q&A websites, developers could only search for the knowledge
related to the development tasks. However, users could search in
general search engines for a wide range of knowledge, e.g., from the
use of a certain technique to planning for a trip. Some of the search
activities are exclusive to the general search engines, e.g., from the
search result list page to the image search engine. We believe our
observations can provide insights for the search activities that are
common in other search engines and Stack Overflow when search-
ing for programming-related knowledge. Besides, we follow the
standard methodologies in the field. We believe this methodology
can be generalized to other software engineering platforms (e.g.,
GitHub) if the search engine logs contain related data (e.g., queries,
visited webpages, and timestamps).
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we perform a large-scale analysis to characterize how
developers search on Stack Overflow. Based on the HTTP requests
to Stack Overflow’s web servers from December 1, 2017, to No-
vember 31, 2018, we observe that reformulating the immediately
preceding query is the most frequent search activity on Stack Over-
flow. To better understand the gap between the knowledge of users
and the knowledge available through search engines, we character-
ize query reformulations and query content. We observe that 71.78%
of the reformulations can be fitted into reformulation strategies
previously identified by Huang and Efthimiadis for general search
activities [ 28]. The most common reformulation strategies are spe-
cializing the search intention, using advanced search mechanisms,
and generalizing the search intention. 23.44% of the search sessions
have at least one query with adjectives that describe additional
conditions. Developers use queries with different semantic tags for
different types of search intention. In the future, we plan to propose
specific optimization approaches for the reformulation types that
do not appear in general search, e.g., replacing a programming ter-
minology with another programming terminology that are related
in terms of technical aspects.
