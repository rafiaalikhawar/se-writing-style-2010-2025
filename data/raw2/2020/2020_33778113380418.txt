ABSTRACT
Traceability is a fundamental component of the modern software
development process that helps to ensure properly functioning,
secure programs. Due to the high cost of manually establishing
trace links, researchers have developed automated approaches that
draw relationships between pairs of textual software artifacts using
similarity measures. However, the effectiveness of such techniques
are often limited as they only utilize a single measure of artifact
similarity and cannot simultaneously model (implicit and explicit)
relationships across groups of diverse development artifacts.
In this paper, we illustrate how these limitations can be over-
come through the use of a tailored probabilistic model. To this end,
we design and implement a Hierarchi Cal PrObabilistic Model for
Softwar E Traceability (Comet) that is able to infer candidate trace
links. Comet is capable of modeling relationships between artifacts
by combining the complementary observational prowess of mul-
tiple measures of textual similarity. Additionally, our model can
holistically incorporate information from a diverse set of sources,
including developer feedback and transitive (often implicit) rela-
tionships among groups of software artifacts, to improve inference
accuracy. We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of
Comet that illustrates an improvement over a set of optimally
configured baselines of≈14% in the best case and ≈5% across all
subjects in terms of average precision. The comparative effective-
ness of Comet in practice, where optimal configuration is typically
not possible, is likely to be higher. Finally, we illustrate Comet’s
potential for practical applicability in a survey with developers
from Cisco Systems who used a prototype Comet Jenkins plugin.

1 INTRODUCTION & MOTIVATION
The importance of traceability in modern software systems cannot
be overstated. Traceability links that connect “high-level" artifacts
such as requirements and use cases to “low-level” artifacts writ-
ten in code help to facilitate crucial components of the software
development and maintenance cycle. For instance, linking require-
ments to code provides visibility into a system by enumerating
what has been implemented, whereas linking requirements to test
cases helps to provide an indication that the software is functioning
as expected. Additionally, the establishment of trace links aids in
facilitating a broad set of developer activities including code com-
prehension, change impact analysis, and compliance validation [ 14].
In certain software domains, such as those involving safety crit-
ical systems, traceability is necessarily mandated by regulatory
bodies in order to properly demonstrate the safe functioning of
a system [ 13,36,44,52]. Furthermore, traceability is increasingly
used to help ensure the security of a given system [ 46]. For example,
our industrial partners at Cisco Systems, Inc. require that security-
critical requirements are verified by a dedicated group of analysts
to avoid software threats and ensure best practices.
Unfortunately, despite its importance, software traceability is, by
its nature, an inherently difficult and error prone task [ 15,36,37].
This difficulty primarily stems from the need to bridge a logical
abstraction gap that exists between different software artifacts, such
as requirements written in natural language and code written in
“lower-level” programming languages. Given the effort required
to establish and evolve effective trace links, it is often too costly
to manually establish them outside of regulated domains, and in
practice the quality of mandated links are often questionable [16].

The inherent difficulty in establishing trace links has lead to
research on automated techniques for modeling, establishing, and
evolving trace links that primarily rely upon information retrieval
(IR) [ 5,7,19–21,25,30,32,35,37,39–41] and machine learning
(ML) [ 7,22,27,38,53] techniques which retrieve or predict trace
links based upon textual similarity metrics. However, in large part,
current automated approaches for traceability often trade precision
for completeness and vice versa, making them difficult to adopt
in practice. We observe three major shortcomings of current auto-
mated techniques that contribute to their limited effectiveness:
1) Limited Measures of Artifact Similarity: Existing techniques
for trace link recovery tend to use a single textual similarity metric
to draw relationships between artifacts. This is problematic for
several reasons. Perhaps most importantly, it is often difficult or
impossible to determine how well a technique that uses a given simi-
larity measure will function on artifacts from a new project without
any pre-existing trace links. This so-called “cold-start” problem is
due to the fact that existing IR/ML techniques for measuring textual
similarity often need to be calibrated on a subset of "ground-truth"
artifact pairs with pre-existing links. This makes performance of
these techniques difficult to predict when applied to new datasets.
Furthermore, in practice industrial projects often lack pre-existing
trace links, as confirmed by our partners at Cisco. Thus, while
certain techniques have been shown to perform well on research
benchmarks, the efficacy of a similarity measure is often tightly cou-
pled to the underlying semantics of software artifact text [ 9,26,34],
and to the configuration of the corresponding IR/ML technique [ 48].
Using only a single textual similarity metric also needlessly re-
stricts the predictive power of a traceability technique. Past work
has illustrated the orthogonality of different similarity measures [ 48],
suggesting that combining several different measures could lead
to more accurate and robust techniques that function consistently
well when applied to new projects without pre-existing links.
2) Inability to Effectively Capture Developer Feedback: The
rapid pace of modern agile development practices often results in
crucial knowledge about a software system being siloed within
the expertise of individual developers. Thus, one unstructured de-
velopment artifact that has gone underutilized by past techniques
isdeveloper feedback. When an automated traceability model is
uncertain about particular trace link pairs, developers can provide
critical feedback to help improve trace link inference.
3) Limited View of Interactions Between Artifacts Existing
automated traceability approaches are typically tailored to establish
relationships between pairs of specific types of artifacts (e.g., user
stories and class files). However, information pertaining to the
relationship of one type of artifact pair may be contained within
other related artifacts. For example, if a piece of source code is linked
to a given requirement through textual similarities, and this source
code is also intrinsically linked to test code via method calls, then it
is likely the requirement is also linked to the test code. However, in
this situation, it may be difficult for a textual similarity metric to link
the requirements and test code, due to limited test documentation,
for example. Thus, in this way, established relationships between
certain artifacts may influence the probability of other artifact
relationships. In this paper we refer to these phenomena as transitive
links. Existing techniques generally cannot model such interactions
between artifacts.The limitations discussed above stem from both technical and
practical limitations of existing traceability techniques, and sur-
faced during our development of an automated traceability ap-
proach in close collaboration with Cisco Systems. In this paper we
introduce a novel technique that overcomes these limitations by
constructing a Hierarchical Bayesian Network for inferring a set
of candidate trace links. The model that underlies our approach is
capable of deriving the probability that a trace link exists between
two given artifacts by combining information from multiple mea-
sures of textual similarity, while simultaneously modeling transitive
relationships and accounting for developer expertise. We imple-
mented our approach, called Comet (Hierarchi Cal PrObabilistic
Model for Softwar E Traceability), in both an extensible Python
library and as a plugin for the popular Jenkins CI/CD system. In
an extensive set of empirical experiments we illustrate that Comet
is able to outperform the median precision of optimally configured
baseline techniques by ≈5% across subjects and ≈14% in the best
case. Given that optimal configuration is typically not possible in
practice, this illustrates that given a project with no pre-existing
trace links, Comet is likely to perform significantly better than
most existing IR/ML techniques. Additionally, we show Comet’s
potential for integration into the workflows of development teams
at Cisco. In summary, this paper’s contributions are as follows:
•The derivation of a Hierarchical Bayesian Network (HBN)
for inferring a candidate set of trace links;
•An implementation of this model, called Comet, as both an
extensible Python library and a Jenkins plugin that has been
deployed for testing with our industrial partners at Cisco;
•An extensive evaluation of Comet on both open source
projects and two industrial datasets from one industrial soft-
ware project, including feedback from professional develop-
ers at a major telecommunication software company;
•An open source, commercial-grade traceability benchmark,
developed in coordination with our industrial partner, for
the benefit of the research community;
•An online appendix, including our open source implementa-
tion of Comet and evaluation data for reproducibility [2].
2 RELATED WORK
We focus our discussion of related work on prior techniques that
have, in limited contexts, (i) considered novel or hybird textual
similarity measures, (ii) modeled the effects of multiple types of
artifacts, or (iii) incorporated developer expertise. We then conclude
with a statement distilling Comet’s novelty.
Novel/Hybird Textual Similarity Measures: Guo et al. [ 26] pro-
posed an approach for candidate trace link prediction that uses a
semantically enhanced similarity measure based on Deep Learning
(DL) techniques. However, unlike Comet, this technique requires
pre-existing trace links in order to train the DL classifier. In con-
trast, Comet does not require known links for the projects it is
applied to, but rather requires a project to serve as a tuning set. We
show that Comet performs well when tuned and tested on different
datasets, outperforming Guo et al.’s DL-based approach when it is
trained in a similar manner. Gethers et al. [ 25], implemented an
approach that is capable of combining information from canonical
IR techniques (i.e., VSM, Jensen-Shannon) with Topic Modeling

techniques. However, their approach can only combine two IR/ML
techniques, whereas Comet can combine and leverage the observa-
tions from several IR/ML techniques, and combine this with other
information such as expert feedback and transitive links.
Modeling of Multiple Artifacts: Rath et al. [ 50] recently explored
linking nontraditional information including issues and commits,
and Cleland-Huang et al. [ 13] have investigated linking regulatory
codes to product level requirements. Comet’s model has the poten-
tial to improve trace link recovery in these scenarios both through
its more robust modeling of textual similarity, and through incor-
poration of transitive link information. Furtado et al. [ 24], explored
traceability in the context of agile development, and Nishikawa et
al. [47] first explored the use of transitive links in a deterministic
traceability model. Additionally, Kuang et al. used the closeness
of code dependencies, to help improve IR-based traceability recov-
ery [ 32]. However, none of these approaches is capable of incor-
porating transitive links while also considering combined textual
similarity metrics and developer feedback.
Incorporation of Developer Expertise: De Lucia et al. [ 18] and
Hayes et al. [ 28] analyzed approaches that use relevance feedback
to improve trace link recovery. However, these approaches are
either tied to a particular type of model (such as TF-IDF [ 18]), or
require knowledge of the underlying model to function optimally.
In contrast, Comet implements a lightweight, likert-based feedback
collection mechanism that we illustrate can improve link accuracy
even when only a small amount of feedback is collected.
Summary of Advancement over Prior Work: Comet’s features
facilitate its application to projects without any pre-existing trace
links, and as our evaluation illustrates, allow it to perform consis-
tently well across datasets. Comet is able to combine information
from transitive links with both robust textual similarity measures
and lightweight developer feedback for improved accuracy. While
some aspects of Comet’s approach have been considered in limited
contexts in prior work – such as developer feedback [ 18,28] and
restricted combinations of IR/ML techniques [ 25] – there has never
been a framework capable of combining all these aspects in a holis-
tic approach. Our evaluation illustrates that Comet’s holistic HBN
is able to outperform baseline techniques on average.
3 BACKGROUND
3.1 Problem Definition
Our goal is to design a model that captures meaningful informa-
tion regarding logical relationships between software artifacts, and
then use this model to infer a set of candidate trace links. More
specifically, given a set of source artifacts S(e.g., requirements, use
cases) such that S={S1,S2, . . .Sn}and a set of target artifacts T
(e.g., source code files, test cases) such that T={T1,T2, . . .Tn}, we
aim to infer whether a trace link Lexists between all possible pairs
of artifacts in SandTsuch that L={(s,t)|s∈S,t∈T,s↔t}
where each pair of artifacts sandtare said to be logical trace links.
3.2 Defining a Probabilistic View of Traceability
3.2.1 The Probabilistic Nature of Software Traceability .The
process of building software is not inherently deterministic, and is
instead the result of decisions made by engineers over prolonged
periods of time that may be hard to predict. Developer decisionsrelated to nearly every observable phenomenon in modern software
development are influenced by a combination of multiple factors.
For instance, the presence of a functional bug may be influenced
by the quality of related requirements, implementation constraints
imposed by a given programming language [ 51], or the change-
proneness of underlying APIs [ 33]. Given that such factors are often
hard to predict, there is a clear sense of randomness inherent to
the software development process. Similarly, the existence of trace
links among software artifacts is also likely to be influenced by
several different effectively random factors.
These factors could include textual similarities between artifacts,
programmatic associations between pieces of code, or even abstract
notions of similarity held by expert developers. For example, the
textual quality of requirements or identifiers in code are typically a
function of several factors such as the fluency and writing style of
the author and the familiarity of key phrases chosen for identifiers
[17]. This may lead to variable names that may be perfectly clear to
one engineer being indecipherable to another. From this view point,
the existence of trace links between software artifacts can be thought
of as an inherently a probabilistic phenomenon.
3.2.2 Traceability as a Bayesian Inference Problem .Hence,
in order to effectively model trace links among software artifacts, it
is necessary to model a collection of random factors that influence
the probability that a trace link exists. Thus, the process of deriving
trace links can be modeled as a bayesian inference problem, wherein
a probability distribution representing the existence of a trace link
between two artifacts can be inferred. As we illustrate, by model-
ing the trace link recovery problem in a probabilistic manner, we
are able to construct an an automated approach that largely over-
comes the typical drawbacks discussed in Sec. 1. To understand this
context, let us consider the general definition of Bayes’ Theorem:
P(H|O)=P(O|H)·P(H)
P(O)(1)
where His a hypothesis regarding some phenomenon, Ois a set of
observations that provide some information about the hypothesis,
and where our goal is to infer or estimate the probability that our
hypothesis is true P(H|O), which is called the posterior probability
distribution, or more simply the posterior. However, a given hypoth-
esis is rarely made in a vacuum, and one typically holds some prior
belief as to the probability that is being inferred. This prior belief
is modeled as a probability distribution P(H), which we will simply
refer to as the prior, and can be influenced by a number of factors.
In order for the posterior to be inferred from a set of observations,
these must be modeled in a probabilistic manner. This is the purpose
of the likelihood P(O|H), which is a probability distribution that
is derived purely from observed data. Thus, in Bayesian inference
initial beliefs are represented as the prior, observations are modeled
as the likelihood and the final beliefs are represented by the poste-
rior. This posterior probability distribution can be inferred via one
of several existing statistical inference techniques. In framing the
problem of inferring trace links as a Bayesian problem, we consider
our hypothesis to be whether a given trace link exists between a
single source artifact Sxand a single target artifact Ty. Given the
nature of trace links (e.g., a link either does or does not exist) we
can model our prior as a distribution on the interval [0,1], where 1
indicates the presence of a link and 0 indicates an absence.

3.2.3 A Hierarchical Bayesian Network for Traceability .In
the context of this paper, we will consider our likelihood (obser-
vations) to be the binary indication that a link exists according
to a set of textual similarity measures and an empirically derived
threshold value. However, given that we aim to model multiple fac-
tors that might influence traceability, our model employs multiple
priors, called hyperpriors, forming a Hierarchical Bayesian Network
(HBN). In this work, we consider three priors corresponding to the
three factors we wish to model: (i) a normalized set of diverse tex-
tual similarity measures, (ii) developer expertise, and (iii) transitive
trace links. We assign each of these priors an initial probability
distribution, which is then influenced and estimated based upon
observable data (e.g. a developer confirming or denying a trace link).
Once this network is established, the posterior can be computed
via one of several estimation techniques. By modeling these three
information sources, our technique is able to largely overcome the
limitations enumerated in Sec. 1. HBNs are also highly extensible
via adjustments to the prior(s). Thus our defined model be capa-
ble of adapting to advancements in textual similarity measures or
considering new development artifacts from future development
workflows.
4 INFERRING TRACE LINKS WITH A
HIERARCHICAL BAYESIAN NETWORK
In this section, we provide a formal description of Comet’s prob-
abilistic model introduced at a high level in Sec. 3.2. To help aid
in the comprehension of Comet’s underlying model, we provide a
graphical representation using plate notation [ 43] in Fig. 1, which
we use to guide our introduction and discussion. The model in Fig.
1is computed on a per link basis, that is between all potential links
between a set of source ( S) and target artifacts ( T). In this section
we will use SxandTyto refer to a single source and target artifact
of interest respectively. Comet’s probabilistic model is formally
structured as an HBN, centered upon a trace link prior θwhich
represents the model’s prior belief about the probability that Sx
andTyare linked. Our model is hierarchical, as the trace link prior
is influenced by a number of hyperpriors, which are constructedin accordance with a set of hyper-parameters that are either de-
rived empirically, or fixed. In Fig. 1, hyperpriors are represented
as empty nodes, and hyper-parameters are represented as shaded
blue nodes. In general, empty nodes represent latent, or hidden,
variables whereas shaded nodes represent variables that are known
or empirically observed quantities. The rectangles, or “plates” in
the diagram are used to group together variables that repeat.
To make our model easier to comprehend, we have broken it
down into four major configurations, which we call stages, indicated
by different colors in Fig. 1. The first stage of our model (shown in
blue at top) unifies the collective knowledge of textual similarity
metrics computed by IR/ML techniques. The second stage (shown
in orange at the bottom) reconciles expert feedback to improve the
accuracy of inferred trace links. The third stage (shown in green in
the middle) accounts for transitive relationships among develop-
ment artifacts, and the fourth stage combines each of the underlying
stages. It should be noted that the first stage of our model can be
taken as the “base case” upon which the other complexities build
and is always required to infer the existence of a trace link. The
order of calculation starts with the first stage and proceeds sequen-
tially. The design and parameterization of our model presented in
this section is not arbitrary, but instead based on the well-founded
theory of conjugate priors [49] which aids in defining appropriate
distributions and hyperparameters for a given prior. We center the
description of our model first upon the likelihood estimation and
then around the estimation of the prior probability distribution
as defined by the four stages. After defining the hyperpriors for
each of the four stages we briefly discuss the inference techniques
we employ to estimate the posterior probability distribution of
our model and thus the probability of whether a given link exists.
While this section provides an overview of our model, we discuss
its instantiation (including utilized IR/ML techniques) in Sec. 5.1.
4.1 Estimating the Likelihood
The likelihood function in our HBN models observed data so that
these observations can be reconciled with our estimated prior prob-
ability distribution to infer a posterior probability. The likelihood is
shown as the observed variable Y(Fig. 1). The variable irepresents
the number of observations made. In the context of traceability, we
express the likelihood as a discrete Bernoulli distribution, as two
artifacts can either be “linked” or “not-linked”:
Y=p(li|θi)=Bern(li|θi) (2)
where liis an observable data point 0,1forinumber of observa-
tions. We define an observation as a function of the textual similarity
score generated by an IR technique between SxandTyand some
threshold kiwhere any similarity above the threshold is considered
an observed link, and any similarity value below this threshold is
considered a non-link. The number of IR techniques or configura-
tions utilized corresponds to the number of observations i. Ideally,
to capture the most accurate trace link observations from IR tech-

are linked. In other words, kishould be chosen for each IR tech-
nique such that the precision and recall of the technique is maximal

the consultation of a ground truth set of trace links. As we illus-
trate in Sec. 5this threshold can often be estimated with surprising
accuracy by analyzing the distribution of similarity values an IR
technique produces for a given set of artifacts.
4.2 Stage 1 - Unifying Textual Similarities
between Development Artifacts
The first “base” stage of our model informs the trace link prior,
represented as a probability distribution p(θ), according to the tex-
tual similarity measurements of a set of IR techniques. However,
converse to the likelihood estimation, the actual textual similarity
values of IR techniques are directly used to estimate a Beta distribu-
tion (the conjugate prior of the likelihood’s Bernoulli distribution).
This Beta distribution is represented as follows:
θ∼B(µ,ν) (3)
where µand νare parameters of the Beta distribution represent-
ing its mean and variance. This prior, and its two parameters are
illustrated in the right-most part of the blue segment (Fig. 1). To
inform this Beta distribution, the textual similarity of values of a
given number iof IR/ML techniques are normalized according to
a sigmoid function centered upon the median of the distribution
of similarity values across all SandTin a given dataset. Then a
logistic regression is performed upon the normalized similarity
values to infer the values ˆαandˆβwhich define a hyperprior beta
distribution θI R. This hyperprior with parameters are shown on
the left of the blue segment (Fig. 1). The mean and the variance of
this hyperprior distribution then inform µandνof the base prior θ:
ν=Var[θI R]µ=Mean[θI R] (4)
Thus, by considering the textual similarity values of a set of IR tech-
niques, our model can effectively reconcile the collective knowledge
to ultimately make an informed prediction.
4.3 Stage 2 - Incorporating Developer Feedback
The second stage of our model is capable of leveraging human
feedback by influencing the prior distribution introduced in the
first stage of our model. To model expert feedback, we estimate
hyperpriors Dand θd, shown in orange in Fig. 1. To perform this
estimation, our model accepts from a developer or analyst, their
confidence that a given link exists as a value between [0,1]. In
Section 4.7we illustrate how such feedback can be collected from
developers in a lightweight manner. This confidence value serves as
a parameter for estimating the distribution of the first hyperprior:
θd∼B(µd=c,sd=0.01) (5)
where θdis a Beta distribution parameterized by its mean µdset
to the confidence value provided by a developer, and standard
deviation sdwhich we set to 0.01 signaling a low variance in the
derived Beta distribution. This distribution then parameterizes the
second hyperprior D, modeled as a Bernoulli distribution. Now that
we have derived a distribution representing developer feedback,
we must define how this distribution affects the prior probability
of the first stage of our model. To do this, we define reward and
penalty functions ϒandΣthat are influenced by σwhich represents
a specified belief factor between[0,1]that controls the extent to
which the feedback influences the trace link prior. The reward
function is defined as ϒ=σ∗D, whereas the penalty function is

defined as Σ=σ∗(D−1). These factors impact the first stage prior
Beta distribution by affecting its mean µ:
µ∼N(µn=Σ+ϒ,sd=0.01) (6)
where the mean of the first stage prior is represented as a normal
distribution parameterized by µnset to the sum of Σandϒ, and a
standard deviation set to 0.01. Thus, in this manner, expert feedback
is utilized to influence the prior distribution that a given trace link
exists. The structure of the Stage 2 hyperpriors allows Comet’s
HBN to effectively consider feedback from multiple developers.
4.4 Stage 3 - Leveraging Transitive Links
As discussed earlier, the probability that a trace link exists between
a source and target artifact can be influenced by transitive rela-
tionships among varying software development artifacts. The third
stage of Comet’s HBN is able to utilize these transitive links to
improve the accuracy of its inferred trace link. However, before we
describe how our model reconciles this information in a probabilis-
tic manner, it is first important to understand the phenomena of
transitive links. At a high level, a transitive link is an inherent rela-
tionship between two software artifacts ( A1,A2) that may influence
the existence of a trace link between either A1and any other artifact
orA2and any other artifact. Comet is currently capable of leverag-
ing two types of transitive links, one based on textual-similarities
(req.↔req.) and one based on dynamic execution information (req.
↔test case). However, Comet could also be extended to model
transitive relationships between other types of artifacts, such as
commit messages or issues. Fig. 2provides an illustration of both
transitive link types, which we detail below. Note that for execution
traces, a relationship is considered strong between a test method
and source method if the test executes the method, and weak other-
wise. For req↔req relationships, it is strong if the textual similarity
is above the threshold τ, and weak if it is below the threshold.
4.4.1 Req.↔Req. Links .Consider S1,S2,S3as three source arti-
facts representing three discrete requirements documents and T1is
a potential target document (i.e., source code file), where the target
relationship being inferred is S1→T1, indicated by the solid line.
The connections between nodes denote relationships among the
artifacts. Consider the scenario in which the relationship between
S1andT1is weak, but S1is highly similar to the other two require-
ments S2andS3. Given that we know the three source artifacts are
highly related, the relationships between S2→T1andS3→T1
have a transitive influence on the target relationship between S1and
T1. For instance, if S2→T1andS3→T1both indicate strong prob-
abilities, then likewise the probability of the target link S1→T1
should be increased to account for these transitive relationships.

4.4.2 Req.↔ Test Case Links .Consider S1to be a source artifact
representing a requirement document, T1to be a potential target
source code file, and TC1,TC2to be test cases, where the target
relationship being inferred is S1→T1, indicated by the solid line.
Consider again the scenario in which the relationship between S1
andT1is weak, whereas the relationship between S1andTC1,TC2
are stronger. If we observe that TC1andTC2are related to T1by
execution information (e.g., TC1andTC2both exercise T1,Exec
in Fig. 2) then, this transitive relationship should influence the
probability that a trace link exists between S1andT1.
4.4.3 Incorporating Transitive Links into COMET’s HBN .In
order for our HBN to incorporate transitive req. ↔req. links, it
must first derive the set of requirements that are related to a given
target requirement Sx. To accomplish this, one of several IR tech-
niques can be used to compute textual similarity, or the first stage
of our model can be used to derive the relationships, illustrated as
s(S1,S2)&s(S1,S3)in Fig. 2. To incorporate information from req.
↔test case links, dynamic information must be collected that pro-
vides the Exec 1&Exec 2relationships illustrated in Fig. 2. In either
case, a specified threshold τsignals whether a pair of requirements
is related, and the total number of related requirements or test cases
is specified by the hyper-parameter π. Once the related require-
ments have been derived, our HBN estimates three hyperpriors, wt,
Bmix and µtrans . First wtis formulated as a Dirichlet distribution
according to the number of related transitive requirements. Then
to estimate Bmix, the first stage of our HBN is computed between
each related requirement and a given target artifact Ty. The inferred
values for each transitive link, and wtare used to form a mixture
model:
Bmix∼Mix(wt,θπ) (7)
where Bmixis a Beta mixture model parameterized by the 1st stage
inference of each transitive link and πweights modeled as a Dirich-
let distribution parameterized by π. This Dirichlet distribution is
then used to derive a meditated normal distribution µtrans :
µtrans∼ρ∗Bmix+(1−ρ)∗Mean[θI R] (8)
where Mean[θI R]represents the mean of the probability distribu-
tion of IR similarity values (from stage 1) on the trace link prior and
ρis represents the belief factor of the transitive links (e.g., the degree
to which the transitive relationships should affect overall prior trace
link probability). µtrans can then be utilized to derive the reward
and penalty functions introduced earlier where ϒ=σ∗(1−µtrans)
whereas Σ=σ∗µtrans . The reward and penalty functions can
then in turn be used to influence the mean of trace link prior µ:
µ∼N(µn=µtrans +Σ+ϒ,sd=0.01) (9)
in the same manner as introduced in Eq. 6. In this way, our model
is capable of incorporating information from transitive links, in-
creasing the overall prior probability if transitive links are strongly
connected to the target artifact Tyand decreasing it if they are not
strongly connected.
4.5 Stage 4 - The Holistic Model
The holistic model combines all three underlying stages. To accom-
plish this, the calculations of the reward and penalty functions for
affecting the mean µof the overall prior are modified to incorporate
information from both expert feedback and transitive links:

Then Eq. 9can be used to derive the new mean for the overall prior
probability distribution of the model.
4.6 Inferring the Posterior
In order to reason about the probability that a trace link exists, we
must estimate the posterior probability distribution of our hierar-
chical model p(Θ|L)according to the observable data Land prior
knowledge of the link p(Θ). Here p(Θ)encompasses the trace link
prior and all constituent hyperpriors depending upon the stage of
the model. Once the posterior has been estimated, Comet utilizes
themean of the distribution as the general probability that a link
exists. We can represent the general calculation of the posterior for
our model using using Bayes Theorem as follows:
p(Θ|L)=p(Θ)p(L|Θ)∫
p(Θ)p(L|Θ)dΘ∝p(Θ)nÖ
i=1p(Li|Θi) (11)
where nrepresents the total number of observations (i.e., the num-
ber of underlying IR techniques and configurations). Comet’s HBN
is non-trivial, and thus the posterior p(Θ|L)cannot be computed
analytically. Therefore, we turn to approximation techniques for es-
timating the posterior probability distribution. Comet can currently
utilize three different techniques including (i) Maximum a Posteri-
ori (MAP) estimation [ 8], a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
technique via the No-U-Turn sampling (NUTS) process [ 29], and
a machine learning-based technique called Variational Inference
(VI) [ 10]. We provide experimental results in Sec. 6for all tech-
niques for Stage 1 of Comet’s model, and NUTS/MAP for Stages
2-4, as VI cannot be applied to more complex stages of the model.
4.7 The C OMET Python Library & Jenkins Plugin
We implemented the four stages of Comet’s HBN in an extensible
traceability library written in python3 . In order to explore the prac-
tical applicability of Comet, we implemented the first two stages
ofComet’s HBN as a Jenkins [ 3] plugin. We did not implement the
final two stages due to time limitations, but are actively working on
this in partnership with Cisco. This plugin was developed by one
of the authors during an internship with Cisco Systems in close
collaboration with researchers, engineers and analysts. The code
and extensive documentation for the Comet library and plugin is
available in our online appendix [2].
4.7.1 An Illustrated Use Case of the COMET Plugin .Fig.3pro-
vides a general overview of the Comet plugin architecture. To
illustrate the utility of the plugin, we describe its workflow from
the viewpoint of a developer. As depicted in Fig. 3-1○the plugin
is triggered when developers commit changes to a given project

using Hierarchical Bayesian Networks ICSE ’20, May 23–29, 2020, Seoul, Republic of Korea
Figure 4: Comet Jenkins Plugin Traceability Report
configured to utilize our traceability plugin in Jenkins. The commit
triggers a job that checks out, compiles, and executes the project
code according to our industrial partner’s existing CI pipeline. As il-
lustrated in Fig. 3-2○our plugin parses and preprocesses the source
code, test code, and requirement text to be analyzed with Comet
once the normal CI’s build flow finishes. The preprocessed corpora
of requirements, code, and tests are then passed to the Comet li-
brary where the first stage of the HBN (configured according to
the tuning datasets described in Sec. 5) is run to establish an initial
set of trace links among artifacts. Note that our plugin can be con-
figured to run according to varying intervals (e.g., every minor or
major release). Given that our plugin supports the first two stages of
Comet’s HBN, it is capable of collecting feedback from developers
to improve trace links. To do this, developers select an option from
a dropdown likert scale, with each option representing a poten-
tial value of µdfor stage 2 of Comet’s HBN (Strongly agree=1.0,
Agree=0.75, Unsure=0.5, Disagree=0.25, & Strongly Disagree=0.0).
To ensure a responsive feedback mechanism to reflect developer
feedback, the Stage 2 link probabilities are precomputed.
Once the plugin job finishes it generates an interactive traceabil-
ity page (Fig. 4), that allows a developer or analyst to view inferred
trace links and provide feedback. As shown in Fig. 4the blue rectan-
gle highlights a drop-down menu that allows a developer to filter
inferred trace links by type (i.e., req ↔src, req↔test cases, src↔test
cases, and artifacts not linked). The drop-down menu highlighted in
red allows developers to filter trace links according to the inferred
probability ranges of θinComet’s HBN including: probably linked
(i.e., θ=[0.7,1)),probably not linked (i.e., θ=[0,0.4)), and unsure
representing links where the model is unable to make a confident
inference ( i.e., θ=[0.4,0.7)). The area highlighted in green lists
the types of selected source and target artifacts allowing the user
to easily inspect candidate trace links as well as provide feedback
on the inferences. When a developer clicks on the feedback link for
a given pair of artifacts, a popup window allows them to select one
of the likert options delineated earlier. Finally, the traceability page
also allows developers to view artifacts that are not linked to any
other artifacts, and thus may be suspicious. Additional screenshots
detailing the workflow of the Comet plugin are available in our
online appendix [2].
4.7.2 COMET’s Complexity & Scalability .We have designed
theComet plugin and library to facilitate easy integration into
modern automated CI/CD systems via a set of higher level APIs
that abstracts much of the complexity of the model for most users,
while still providing mechanisms for advanced users to tweak pa-
rameters. Furthermore, Comet was able to be successfully deployed
into a commercial CI pipeline for a pilot project with our industrialTable 1: Datasets used for Comet’s evaluation. Rq = Require-

partner. We have also designed the Comet plugin and library to be
highly scalable. Trace link probabilities between each pair of arti-
facts can be calculated independently, making the process highly
parallelizable. Thus, we implemented parallel process management
using Theano [4] into the Comet library, allowing computation
to scale across modern multi-core machines. To further optimize
performance, the Comet plugin can makex use of change analysis
in git to only recompute trace link values for artifacts that have
been altered since the last computation.
5 DESIGN OF THE EXPERIMENTS
To evaluate Comet, we perform an extensive empirical evaluation
with two major goals : (i) evaluate the effectiveness of the four stages
ofComet’s HBN in terms of their ability to effectively infer trace
links, and (ii) examine whether Comet is applicable in industrial
workflows. The quality focus of our study is Comet’s effectiveness,
in terms of generating an accurate and complete set of trace links,
and practical applicability. We formulate the following set of RQs:
•RQ1:How effective is Comet at inferring candidate trace links
using combined information from IR/ML techniques?
•RQ2:To what extent does expert feedback impact the accuracy
of the candidate trace links of Comet?
•RQ3:To what extent does information from transitive links
improve Comet’s trace link inference accuracy?
•RQ4:How effective is the holistic Comet model in terms of
inferring candidate trace links?
•RQ5:Do professional developers and security analysts find our
implementation of the Comet Jenkins plugin useful?

from the open source CoEST community datasets [ 1]. These datasets
represent a set of benchmarks created by the research community
and widely used as an effective assessment tool for automated trace-
ability techniques [ 6,12,25,31]. In order to maintain the quality of
our experimental subjects, we do not use all available projects in
the CoEST repository, as we limited our studied systems to those
that: (i) included trace links from requirements or use cases written
in natural language to some form of code artifact, (ii) were written
in English and/or included English translations, and (iii) had at
least 1k LoC. We utilize two datasets to investigate and tune the
hyper-parameters of Comet’s HBN, Albergate, and the Rq →Tests
dataset of the EBT project. We utilize the other six datasets for our

empirical evaluation. The subject system called “LibEST” is an open
source networking related software project, which was created and
is actively maintained by engineers at Cisco as an implementation
of RFC-7030 “Enrollment over Secure Transport”. We derived the
ground truth set of trace links between Rq →Src and Rq→Tests
for this dataset in close collaboration with our industrial partner.
First, one of the authors carefully created an initial set of trace
links. Then, an engineer working on the project reviewed the links
and confirmed or denied a subset, based on their availability. The
author then revised the links using the engineer’s feedback, and
this process continued over several months until the ground truth
was established. The "LibEST" dataset is available along with all of
our experimental data to facilitate reproducibility [2].
5.1.2 Studied IR Techniques .The “base” first stage of Comet’s
HBN is able to utilize and unify information regarding the textual
similarity of development artifacts as computed by a set of IR/ML
techniques. While there is technically no limit to the number of
IR/ML techniques that can be utilized, we parameterized our ex-
periments using ten IR-techniques enumerated in Table 2. The first
five techniques are standalone techniques, whereas the second five
are combined techniques utilizing the methodology introduced by
Gethers et al. [ 25]. This combined approach normalizes the simi-
larity measures of two IR techniques and combines the similarity
measures using a weighted sum. We set the weighting factor λfor
each technique equal to 0.5, as this was the best performing config-
uration reported in the prior work [ 25]. We explain the differences
between the technique employed by Gethers et. al. and Comet in
Sec.2. The other parameters for each of the techniques were derived
by performing a series of experiments on the two tuning datasets,
and using the optimal values from these experiments. For all IR
techniques, we preprocessed the text by removing non-alphabetic
characters and stop words, stemming, and splitting camelCase. We
performed 30 trials for each technique involving LDA, and chose
the number of topics that led to optimal performance on our tuning
projects. To aid in experimental reproducibility, complete configu-
rations for each technique are listed in our online appendix [2].
5.2 RQ 1: COMET Performance w/ Combined
IR/ML Techniques
To answer RQ 1, we ran the first stage of Comet’s HBN on our six
evaluation datasets using the ten IR/ML techniques enumerated in
Table 2. However, as explained in Section 4.2, in order to accurately
estimate the likelihood function Ywe need to choose a threshold
kifor each IR technique that maximizes the precision and recallof the trace links according to the computed textual similarity val-
ues. To derive the best method for determining the threshold for
each IR technique, we performed a meta evaluation on our two
tuning datasets. We examined five different threshold estimation
techniques: (i) using the mean of all similarity measures for a given
dataset, (ii) using the median of all similarity measures across a
given dataset, (iii) using a Min-Max estimation, (iv) a sigmoid es-
timation, and (v) link estimation (Link-Est), where an estimation
of the number of confirmed links for a dataset is made based on
the number of artifacts, and a threshold derived to ensure that the
estimated number of links is above that threshold. We performed
each of these threshold estimation techniques for all studied IR
techniques across our two tuning datasets, and compared each
estimation to the known optimal threshold. We used the optimal
technique across our two tuning datasets, as reported in Table 2.
To aid in reproducibility, we provide a detailed account of these
experiments in our online appendix [2].
To provide a comparative baseline against which we can measure
Comet’s performance, we report results for the best-performing
and median of the studied IR/ML techniques, optimally configured
for each dataset. We chose to optimally configure the baseline
techniques, even though such configurations would not be possible
in practice due to the absence of a ground truth, in order to illustrate
how close Comet can come to the “best-case baseline scenario”.
To provide a comprehensive comparison of Comet to a state
of the art technique for candidate trace link generation, we re-
implemented the DL-based approach proposed by Guo et al. [ 26].
However, it should be noted that the intended purpose of this DL
approach and Comet differ. The DL technique proposed by Guo
et al. was intended to be both trained and evaluated on a single
project that contains a set of pre-existing trace links the model can
be trained upon, and was quite effective in improving the accuracy
of trace links in this scenario. However, as pre-existing trace links
may not always exist Comet does not require them for analysis.
Instead, our experiments aim to illustrate that Comet can accu-
rately infer trace links when tuned on one small set of projects,
and applied to others. Therefore, we design an experimental setup
where both techniques are applied on projects without pre-existing
trace links. Thus, we train the DL approach on our two tuning
projects, using the optimal parameters reported in [ 26]. Our main
goal in comparing with this DL technique is to illustrate the perfor-
mance of a recent ML-based technique applied to Comet’s intended
“cold-start” use case.
In order to measure the performance of our studied techniques
for inferring trace links, we utilize three main metrics, Precision,
Recall, and Average Precision (AP), similar to prior work that eval-
uates automated traceability techniques [ 25,26]. Given that can-
didate link generation techniques infer a probability or similarity
that a trace link exists, a threshold similarity or probability value
must be chosen to make the final inference. In order to summa-
rize the performance of our studied techniques, we calculate the
Average Precision as a weighted mean of precisions per thresh-
old:AP=Σn(Rn−Rn−1)Pnwhere PnandRnare the Precision
and Recall at the nth threshold. Thus, the AP provides a metric by
which we can quantitatively compare the performance of different
approaches. For the results of Comet, we report the highest AP
achieved by the posterior estimation techniques outlined in Sec.
880Improving the Effectiveness of Traceability Link Recovery
using Hierarchical Bayesian Networks ICSE ’20, May 23–29, 2020, Seoul, Republic of Korea
4.6. In addition to AP, we also provide Precision/Recall (P/R) curves
to illustrate the trade-off between precision and recall at different
threshold values. Curves further away from the origin of the graph
indicate better performance. In lieu of a non-parametric statistical
test as suggested by recent work [ 23], we perform a confidence
interval analysis [ 45] between our baseline techniques and Stage 1
ofComet by calculating the standard error across different thresh-
old values, applying bootstrapping where necessary. Thus, if one
technique outperforms another within the bounds of our calculated
error, it serves as a strong indication of statistical significance.
5.3 RQ 2: COMET Performance w/Expert Feedback
Collecting actual developer feedback on trace links for each of our
test datasets was not possible given the time constraints on devel-
opers from our industrial partner, and we did not have access to the
developers of the other projects. Thus, in order to evaluate Stage 2
ofComet’s HBN, we simulated developer feedback by randomly
sampling 10% of the artifact pairs from each studied subject, and
used the ground truth to provide a confidence level for each of the
sampled links. To accomplish this, we provided the model with a
confidence value cof 0.9 if a link existed in the ground truth, and
0.1, if the link did not exist. However, even trace links derived from
experts can be error-prone. Hence, we performed three types of
experiments to simulate imperfect links being suggested to our
model. That is, for the set of randomly sampled links, we inten-
tionally reversed the confidence values according to the ground
truth, for 25% and 50% of the sampled links respectively to simulate
varying degrees of human error in providing link feedback. In other
words, we sampled a small number of trace links from the ground
truth, and then used these links to confirm/deny links predicted by
Comet (i.e., if a ground truth link existed, and Comet predicted it,
then it was confirmed). Because developers may not be correct all
of the time, we simulated this by randomly flipping the sampled
ground truth, which has a similar effect to a developer incorrectly
classifying certain predicted links.
We set the value for the belief factor of the developer feedback
σ=0.5. For these experiments we illustrate the impact of devel-
oper feedback on AP and P/R curves for only the sampled links. In
addition to the baseline IR techniques described in the procedure
for RQ 1, we also compare our results from Stage 2 of the model to
Stage 1, to illustrate the relative improvement.
5.4 RQ 3: COMET Performance w/Transitive Links
To measure the impact that transitive links have on the trace link in-
ference performance of Stage 3 of Comet’s HBN, we examined the
impact of transitive links between requirements as described in Sec.
4.4. We utilize transitive requirement links rather than transitive
links established by execution traces, as only one of our datasets
(LibEST) had executable test cases. To derive the transitive relation-
ships between artifacts, we computed the VSM similarity among
all source documents for each dataset (e.g., requirements, use cases)
and explored two values for the threshold τ, 0.65, and 0.5. We de-
rived these thresholds by examining the total number of transitively
linked requirements in our tuning datasets to achieve a balance
between too many and too few requirements being linked. We set
thebelief factor ρfor Stage 3 of the HBN equal to 0.5. We reportTable 3: AP Results from Stages 1 & 4 of Comet . The given pvalues from the
Wilcoxon test measure the significance of performance variations between
Stage 1, and Stage 4 of Comet’s model compared to the median (Med.) baseline
of IR/ML techniques. “I=Net” signifies the “Industry-Net” dataset.

5.5 RQ 4: Holistic COMET Performance
To evaluate the overall performance of Comet’s holistic model, we
combined our experimental settings for RQ 2& RQ 3. That is, we
randomly sampled 10% of the links from each dataset and simu-
lated developer feedback with a 25% error rate. Additionally, we
incorporated transitive links between requirements using the same
procedure outlined for RQ 3. For the transitive links, we set τto
0.65, and we set the σand ρhyper-parameters both equal to 0.5.
For this research question, we report results across all links.
5.6 RQ 5: COMET Industrial Case Study
Given that the ultimate goal of designing Comet is for the approach
to automate trace link recovery within industry, we perform a case
study with our industrial partner. This case study consisted of two
major parts. First, we conducted a feedback session with six experi-
enced developers who have been contributing to the LibEST subject
program. This session consisted of a roughly 15 minute presentation
introducing the Comet Jenkins plugin. Then the developers were
asked to use the plugin, which had been configured for LibEST, and
evaluate the links and non links for which the model was most con-
fident (i.e., the highest and lowest inferred probabilities). Then after
using the tool, they were asked a set of likert-based user experience
(UX) questions derived from the SUS usability scale by Brooke [ 11].
Additionally, participants were asked free-response user prefer-
ence questions based on the honeycomb originally introduced by
Morville [ 42]. Second, we conducted semi-structured interviews
with two groups consisting of roughly 15 engineering managers
who specialize in auditing software for security assurance. During
these interviews, a video illustrating the Comet plugin was shown,
and a discussion was conducted with the questions illustrated in
Fig.6. We report results from both studies.
6 EMPIRICAL RESULTS
This section presents the results for our five proposed RQs. We high-
light two P/R curves and focus our discussion on the AP results.
However, all P/R curves and confidence interval graphs are cur-
rently available in our appendix alongside all experimental data [ 2].

statistically significant degree according to the confidence intervals.
In some cases, such as for iTrust, LibEST, and eTour, Stage 1 of
Comet significantly outperforms the median IR/ML baseline, and
approaches the performance of the best IR/ML baseline. Fig. 5a
illustrates the P/R curve for the iTrust project, with performance
that outpaces the best IR/ML technique, particularly for lower recall
values. Comet also outperforms the state of the art DL approach
across all subjects, likely because the DL approach had difficulty
generalizing semantic relationships across datasets.
These results signal remarkably strong performance for Comet’s
Stage 1 model. Recall that, the Stage 1 model only utilizes observa-
tions taken from the set of ten IR/ML techniques introduced in Sec.
5.2, thus the fact that the Stage 1 model was able to consistently
outperform the median IR/ML baselines and in some cases, nearly
match the best IR/ML baseline. This indicates that Comet’s HBN
is capable of effectively combining the observations from the un-
derlying IR/ML techniques for improved inference power. This is
significant, as currently practitioners cannot know a-priori which
IR/ML technique for traceability will perform best on a given project
without pre-existing trace links. Thus, by combining the collective
information of several IR techniques Comet’s first stage HBN is
able to perform consistently well , achieving reasonably high per-
formance across projects , lending to the credibility of using Comet
for projects that do not contain preexisting links.
6.2 RQ 2Results: COMET Stage 2 Performance
The AP for for Stage 2 of Comet across all subject programs for both
25% and 50% error rates is given in Table 4. The results indicate that
Stage 2 of Comet’s HBN is able to effectively incorporate expert
feedback to improve the accuracy of its trace link inferences, as
the Stage 2 model dramatically outperforms the median (and best)
IR/ML techniques as well as the first stage of the model, with a
simulated error rate of 25%. Even for the larger error rate of 50%,
we see Stage 2 outperform Stage 1 for LibEST (Rq →Src), LibEST
(Rq→Tests) and EBT, while it slightly underperforms the Stage 1
model for the other subjects. These results illustrate that Stage 2
ofComet’s HBN is able to effectively utilize expert feedback to
improve its inferences, even in the presence of significant noise.

6.3 RQ 3Results: COMET Stage 3 Performance
The AP results for Stage 3 of Comet, which incorporates transitive
relationships between requirements, for both τ=0.55andτ=0.65
are given in Table 5(There were no transitive links in iTrust for
τ=0.65). This table also includes the median of the baseline IR/ML
techniques, as well as the Comet Stage 1 model AP results, for the
set of links affected by transitive relationships (hence the differing
Stage 1 columns). The results show that, in general, for τ=0.65
forComet’s Stage 3 model, the accuracy of Comet’s inferred trace
links improve, with four of the six datasets showing improvements.
Forτ=0.55the results generally exhibit similar or slightly worse
performance compared to Stage 1. The fact that the higher value of
τled to better performance improvements is not surprising, as this
parameter essentially controls the degree of relatedness required to
consider transitive relationships. Thus, a higher value of τmeans
that only highly similar transitive requirement relationships are
considered by Comet’s model. Using a lower value for this parame-
ter might introduce noise by incorporating transitive relationships
between artifacts that don’t have as high a degree of similarity.
The LibEST (Rq→Src) dataset exhibited decreased performance
forτ=0.65, however this is likely because the requirements for
this industrial dataset are based on formal format from the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF). The somewhat repetitive nature of
the language used in these requirements could lead to non-related
requirements being transitively linked, leading to a decrease in
performance. This suggests leveraging transitive relationships be-
tween requirements leads to larger performance gains for more
unique language. Overall, our results indicate that Comet’s Stage 3
model improves the accuracy of links for a majority of subjects.

6.4 RQ 4Results: COMET Holistic Performance
The AP results for the the holistic Comet (Stage 4) model are given
in Table 3. These results show that Comet’s holistic model out-
performs the baseline median IR/ML techniques, and Stage 1 for
all subject programs. For three subjects (LibEST Req →Src, EBT,
and iTrust), Comet’s holistic model matches or outperforms the
best baseline IR/ML technique. Fig. 5billustrates the P/R curve for
the LibEST (Req→Src) dataset, which shows that the performance
gains in inference precision extend for a large range of recall values.
The results of these experiments demonstrate that Comet’s holistic
model is able to effectively combine information from multiple
sources to improve its trace link inference accuracy.
6.5 RQ 5Results: Industrial Case Study
Fig.6provides the responses to the likert-based UX questions from
the six developers who work on the LibEST project after inter-
acting with the Comet plugin. Overall, the responses from these
developers were quite positive. They generally agreed the Comet
plugin easy to use and understand, but more importantly, gener-
ally found the accuracy of the inferred links and non-links to be
accurate. Additionally, we highlight representative responses to the
user experience questions in this section, and provide the survey
questions with response summaries in our online appendix [ 2], in
accordance with the NDA established with our industrial partner.
Overall the developer responses were encouraging, indicating the
practical need for approaches like Comet. For instance, one devel-
oper stated their need for such a tool, “I really want a tool that could
look at test cases and requirements and tell me the coverage. That
way the team can know whether we are missing functionality or not. ”
Another developer explained the need for a feature that incorpo-
rates developer feedback, stating the importance of the “ability to
describe or explain how the code matches up with the code for future
reference. Discussion/comments about such explanation as different
developers might see links that others don’t”, whereas another devel-
oper stated, “Being able to provide feedback is useful and seeing it
update the percentage immediately was nice. ” This indicates that the
support for developer feedback and responsiveness of the Comet
plugin inherently useful. Developers also found the traceability
report to be useful, with most criticism suggesting practical UI
improvements. For instance, developers appreciated “The fact that
there were the three different options for viewing the traceability be-
tween different [artifacts]”, and “The ability to bring up the specific
requirement quickly in the same window. ”. These responses illustrate
the utility that developers saw in the Comet plugin. Given that
these developers had little automated support for traceability tasks,
they appreciated any automated assistance.We also collected feedback that validated the importance of the
practical use cases that the Comet plugin enabled. In these in-
terviews, the teams generally stated that Comet would be very
useful for code auditing, as one manager stated that it would “allow
compliance analysts to [inspect] links, look at the code and validate
[the links]”. Furthermore, a team responsible for security audits
of systems found an interesting use case for Comet that is often
overlooked in traceability analysis. That is, they were interested in
code and requirements that are not linked to any other artifact, as
such artifacts are likely to be suspicious and should be inspected fur-
ther. In this case, Comet’s inferences of non-links would be just as
important as the inferences of links. Overall, the interviewed teams
saw great promise in Comet, and expressed interest in adoption.
7 THREATS TO VALIDITY
Similar to past work on automated trace link recovery approaches [ 26],
our work exhibits two main threats to validity. The first of these
threats is to external validity. We utilize a limited number of sys-
tems to carry out our evaluation of Comet, and thus it is possible
that our results may not generalize to other systems. However, the
systems utilized in our evaluation have been widely used in past
work, and are of varying sizes and domains. We also examine one
industrial grade open source project developed by our partner.
The second threat to validity that affects experimental evaluation
concerns construct validity, and more specifically, the accuracy of
the ground truth for our subjects, and our implementation of the DL
approach by Guo et al. [ 26]. We cannot guarantee that the ground
truth links for all of subjects are perfectly accurate. However, the
ground truth sets for the CoEST datasets have been accepted by
several pieces of prior work [ 6,12,25,31]. The ground truth for
LibEST was derived by a team of the authors, and was validated
with the help of industrial developers working on the project (see
Sec.5.1). We re-implemented Guo et al.’s DL approach closely fol-
lowing the details of the paper, although a full replication was not
possible due to previous use of proprietary industrial dataset. We
will release our code [ 2] for this approach to aid in reproducibil-
ity. Another potential threat to validity is that our simulation of
developer feedback in answering RQ 2is not representative of real
feedback. Due to constraints on developers time, we could not use
real feedback, however, we believe simulating a small number of
links using the ground truth, complete with error rates, represents
a reasonable approximation.
8 CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK
We have presented Comet, which takes a probabilistic view of
the traceability problem and models the existence of traceability
links using a Hierarchical Bayesian Network. We have shown that
Comet performs more consistently than IR/ML techniques, and
has promising industrial applicability. We plan to adapt Comet to
new information sources, investigate tailoring Comet’s analysis to
infer security-related links, and further deploy the Comet plugin
with our industrial collaborators for feedback.
