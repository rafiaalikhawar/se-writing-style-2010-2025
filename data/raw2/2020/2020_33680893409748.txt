the behaviors of a program P: What does it do? Executing the first
test input, we learn how Pbehaves for this input. Executing the
next input, we either observe the same or discover a new behavior.
As such, each execution reveals łsome amountž of information
aboutP’sbehaviors.AclassicmeasureofinformationisShannon’s

Duetoitsefficiency,fuzzinghasbecomeoneofthemostsuccessful
vulnerability discovery techniques. For instance, in the three years
since its launch, the ClusterFuzz project alone has found about
16,000bugsintheChromebrowserandabout11,000bugsinover
160 open source projectsÐonly by fuzzing [ 1]. A fuzzer typically
generates random inputs for the program and reports those inputs
that crash the program. But,what isfuzzerefficiency?
In this paper, we take an information-theoretic perspective and
understandfuzzingasalearningprocess.1Wearguethatafuzzer’s
efficiencyisdeterminedbytheaverage information thateachgener-
atedinputrevealsabouttheprogram’sbehaviors.Aclassicmeasure
of information is Shannon’s entropy [ 39]. If the fuzzer exercises
mostlythesamefewprogrambehaviors,thenShannon’sentropy
is small, the information content for each input is low, and the
fuzzer is not efficient at discovering new behaviors. If however,
most fuzzer-generated inputs exercise previously unseen program
behaviors, then Shannon’s entropy is high and the fuzzer performs
muchbetterat discoveringnewbehaviors.
Weleveragethisinsighttodevelopthefirstentropy-basedpower
schedule for greybox fuzzing. Entropic assigns more energy to
seeds revealing more information about the program behaviors.
The schedule’s objective is to maximize the efficiency of the fuzzer
by maximizing entropy. A greybox fuzzer generates new inputs
by slightly mutating so-called seed inputs. It adds those generated
inputstothecorpusofseedinputswhichincreasecodecoverage.
Theenergyof a seed determines the probability with which the
seed is chosen. A seed with more energy is fuzzed more often. A
powerschedule implementsapolicytoassignenergytotheseeds
in the seed corpus. Ideally, we want to assign most energy to those
seedsthat promise to increasecoverageat amaximal rate.
Weimplementedourentropy-basedpowerscheduleintothepop-
ulargreyboxfuzzer LibFuzzer [27]andcallourextension Entropic .
LibFuzzer isawidely-usedgreyboxfuzzerthatisresponsiblefor
thediscoveryofseveralthousandsecurity-criticalvulnerabilities
in open-source programs. Our experiments with more than 250
open-sourceprograms(60 millionLoC)demonstrateasubstantially
improved efficiency and confirmour hypothesis that an efficient
fuzzermaximizesinformation.
Entropic hasbeenevaluatedindependentlybythedevelopers

2 A PROBABILISTIC FRAMEWORKFOR
BLACKBOXFUZZING
Fuzzing is an automatic software testing technique where the test
inputsaregeneratedinarandommanner.Basedonthegranularity
oftheruntimeinformationthatisavailabletothefuzzer,wecan
distinguishthreefuzzingapproaches.A blackboxfuzzer doesnot
observe or react to any runtime information. A greybox fuzzer
leveragescoverageorotherfeedbackfromtheprogram’sexecution
to dynamically steer the fuzzer. A whitebox fuzzer has a perfect
viewof the execution of aninput. For instance, symbolic execution
enumeratesinterestingprogram paths.kk+1∆(k)S(n)

Thediscovery rate ∆(n), i.e., the expected number of species dis-
covered with the (n+1)-th generated test input is defined as
∆(n)=S(n+1)−S(n). Discovery rate ∆(n)provides an excellent
stopping rule [ 3,40]. One could abort fuzzing when an insufficient

3 ANINFORMATION-THEORETIC MEASURE
OFFUZZER EFFICIENCY
We provide an information-theoretic foundation for non-deter-
ministic blackbox fuzzing. In the context of fuzzing, Shannon’s
entropyHhas several interpretations. It quantifies the average
information a generated test input revealsabout the behaviors (i.e.,
species)oftheprogram.Alternativelywesay,ageneratedtestinput
reducesour uncertaintyby Hinformationunits(e.g.,natsorbits),
onaverage.Entropyalsogivestheminimumnumberofinformation
units needed to reliably store the entire set of behaviors the fuzzer
iscapableoftesting.Moreover,entropyisameasureofdiversity.A
low entropy means that the program does either not exhibit many
behaviors or most generated inputs test the same behaviors (i.e.,
belong to an abundant species).
In this work,we show how entropy quantifiestheefficiencyof
ablackboxfuzzerintermsofthespeciesdiscoveryrate.However,
thereareseveralchallenges thatweneedtoaddress.First,Shannon’s
entropy is defined in the case where each input belongs to exactly
one species. How can we define an entropy when an input can
belong to multiple species? Second, we cannot determine all the
species of Pand their probabilities with regards to Funless we

compute an approximate entropy? Third, we develop information-
theoretic boosting for greybox fuzzing. Yet, for greybox fuzzers the
probabilities {pi}S

whichviolatesourassumptions(Sec. 2.3).Isthereapracticalway
to enforceour assumptions for agreybox fuzzer?

draw a white ball than a black. It takes more attempts to learn
about black balls in Urn 1 compared to Urn 2. Hence, we expect
less information about the urn’s colors in a draw from Urn 1. In
fact, given the same number of colors S, the entropy is maximal

fuzzing a seed t∈ Cgenerates an input that belongs to species Di

3.4 Information-Theoretic EfficiencyMeasure
Intuitively, the rate at which we learn about program behaviors,
i.e., the species in the program, also quantifies ablackbox fuzzer’s
efficiency. We formally demonstrate how Shannon’s entropy H
characterizesthe generaldiscovery rate ∆(n)as follows.
Theorem1. LetShannon’sentropybedefinedasinEquation( 12).

According to Theorem 1, entropy measures the species discovery
rate∆(n)overaninfinitelylong-runningfuzzingcampaign where

ngoes to infinity. In Figure 1, notice that ∆(n) ≥0 foralln≥0.
If we simply took the sum of ∆(n)over alln, we would compute
the total number of species S=/summationtext.1∞
n=1∆(n). However, Sprovides
no insight on the efficiency of the discovery process. Instead, the
diminishing factor 1 /nin Equation ( 14) reduces the contribution

3.6 Tackling AdaptiveBiaswhen Estimating
theGlobalEntropyofaGreybox Fuzzer
We introduced our probabilistic model for non-deterministic black-
box fuzzing which satisfies the assumption that the global species
distribution {pi}S
i=1is invariantduring the campaign ( Section 2.3 ).
However,thisassumptiondoes notholdforgreyboxfuzzingwhich
leveragesprogramfeedback.Generatedinputsthathavediscovered
new species (i.e., increased coverage) are added to the corpus. The
availabilityofadded seedschanges the globalspecies distribution
(butnotthelocaldistributionsforeachseed)andthustheglobal
entropy for a greybox fuzzer. In other words, a greybox fuzzer
becomes more efficient over time.
Global entropy . Clearly, our probablistic model does not di-
rectly apply to model the efficiency of a non-deterministic greybox
fuzzer. However, it is still worthwhile to derive a reasonabe heuris-
tic to estimatethe currentglobal entropy for a greybox fuzzer. We
propose to consider greybox fuzzing as a series of mutation-based
blackboxfuzzing campaigns ⟨F1,F2,...,Fm⟩,each startingwith a
fixed-size corpusright after a new seed hasbeen added to the cor-
pus.Hence,forgreyboxfuzzerswesuggesttoestimatetheglobal
entropy onlyfrom incidence frequenciesthat have been collected
since the last seedwasadded.We callthis a de-biased estimator .
Figure 3.top5shows the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE)
ˆHMLEovertimeforablackboxfuzzer.6Wecanseethattheestimate
approaches the true value reasonably fast: from under one minute
onwards, the entropy appears as a straight line. Hence, it is fair
tosay thatamonotonic increasein entropywould demonstratea
dynamicincreaseinfuzzerefficiency.
Figure 3.bottom shows two entropy estimates over time for a
greybox fuzzer: the unmodified, adaptively biased MLE and the
de-biasedMLE.Weexpectthattheefficiencyofagreyboxfuzzer
and thus the entropy increases over time. As more seeds are added,
previously rare species become łless rarež. Indeed, we observe a
monotonicincrease.The maximumlikelihoodestimator (MLE,bi-
ased) is computed from unmodified incidence frequencies Yiwhile
thede-biased estimator (MLE, de-biased) is computed from inci-
dence frequencies that are reset to zero whenever a new seed is
added.Consideringagreyboxfuzzingcampaignasaseriesofblack-
boxcampaigns,resettingwillpreventanyimpactofadaptivebias

4.1 Overviewof Entropic
Agreyboxfuzzer startswithacorpusofseedinputsandcontinu-
ouslyfuzzesthesebyapplyingrandommutations.Generatedinputs
thatincreasecoverageareaddedtothecorpus.Theprobability(i.e.,
frequency) with which a seed is chosen for fuzzing is called the
seed’senergy. The procedure that assigns energy to a seed is called
the fuzzer’s power schedule . For instance, LibFuzzer ’s standard
schedule assigns more energy to seeds that were found later in the
fuzzingcampaign. Itisthis power schedulethat we modify.
Algorithm 1shows how greybox fuzzing is implemented in Lib-
Fuzzer; our changes for Entropic are shown as green boxes. In
a continuous loop, the fuzzer samples a seed t∈ Cfrom a distri-
butionthatisgivenbytheseeds’normalizedenergy.Thisenergy
is computed using assignEnergy which implements one of our
information-theoretic power schedules. The seed tis then mutated
using random bit flips and other mutation operators to generate
aninputt′. Iftheexecutioncrashesorviolates thefuzzersecurity
policy,enactedbylimitsonexecutiontime,memoryusage,orsani-
tizers [38],t′is returned as crashing input and LibFuzzer stops. If
the execution increases coverage, t′is added to the corpus. We call

discovery of new behaviors. The amount of information about the
species in the neighborhood of a seed tthat we expect for each
generated test input is measured using the seed’s local entropy Ht.
The entropy-based power schedule is inspired by Active SLAM
[13,41], a problem in robot mapping: An autonomous robot is
placed in an unknown terrain; the objective is to learn the map of
the terrain as quickly as possible. General approaches approximate
Shannon’s entropy of the map under hypothetical actions [ 10,13].
The next move is chosen such that thereduction inuncertainty is
maximized.Similarly,ourschedulechoosesthenextseedsuchthat
the information aboutthe program’s species ismaximized.
4.2.1 Improved Estimator. During our experiments, we quickly
noticedthatthemaximumlikelihoodestimator ˆHMLEinEquation15
cannotbeused.Anewseed tthathasneverbeenfuzzedwillalways
beassignedzeroenergy ˆHt
MLE=0.Hence,itwouldneverbechosen
for fuzzing and forever remain with zero energy. We experimented
withascreeningphasetocomputearoughestimate.Eachnewseed
was first fuzzed for a fixed number of times. However, we found
that too much energy was wasted gaining statistical power that
could have otherwisebeen spentdiscoveringmore species.
To overcome this challenge we took a Bayesian approach. We
knowthatentropyismaximalwhenallprobabilitiesareequal.Fora
new seed t, we assume an uninformative prior for the probabilities
pt
i, i.e.,pt
1=...=pt
S, wherept
iis the probability that fuzzing t
generates an input that belongs to species Di. With each input
thatisgeneratedbyfuzzing t,theprobabilitiesareincrementally
updated. The posterior is a Beta distribution over pt
i. The estimate

iis thus the mean of this beta distribution which is also
knownas the Laplace estimator oradd-one smoothing,

4.2.2 Measuring Information Only About Rare Species. During our
initial experiments, we also noticed that the entropy estimates for
different seeds were almost the same. We found that the reason is
a small number of very abundant species which have a huge im-
pactontheentropyestimate.There aresomeabundantspeciesto

5 EXPERIMENTALEVALUATION
5.1 Research Questions
Our main hypothesis is that increasing information per generated
input increases fuzzer efficiency. To evaluate our hypothesis, we
implemented Entropic andask the following researchquestions.
RQ.1Whatistheempiricalcoverageimprovementoverthebaseline?
RQ.2How much fasterarebugsdetected compared to thebaseline?
RQ.3How does the choice of abundance threshold θinfluence the
performance ofour technique?
RQ.4Whatis thecost ofmaintainingincidencefrequencies?
5.2 Setup andInfrastructure
5.2.1 Implementation and Baseline. We implemented our entropy-
based power schedule into LibFuzzer (363 lines of change) and call
our extension as Entropic .LibFuzzer is a state-of-the-art vulnera-
bilitydiscoverytooldevelopedat[blinded]whichhasfoundalmost
30kbugsinhundredsofclosed- andopen-sourceprojects.
Asacoverage-basedgreyboxfuzzer(seeAlg. 1),LibFuzzer seeks
tomaximizecodecoverage.Hence,our speciesisacoverageelement,
called feature. A featureis a combination of branch covered and
hitcount.Forinstance,twoinputs(exercisingthesamebranches)
have a different feature set if one exercises a branch more often.
Hence,feature coverage subsumes branch coverage . In contrast to
LibFuzzer ,Entropic also maintains the local and global incidence
frequencies for each feature. We study the performance hit in RQ4.
LibFuzzer ’s original power schedule assigns more energy to
seedsthathavebeenaddedlaterinthefuzzingcampaign. Entropic
implementsourentropy-basedpowerschedule(Sec. 4.2)whichis
parameterized by the abundance threshold θ. We investigate the
impact ofthe choiceof θinRQ3.

mationeachinputrevealsaboutaprogram’sbehaviorsincreases
the fuzzer’s efficiency.
Information theory has previously found application in software
test selection . Givena testsuite Tand theprobability p(t)that test
caset∈Tfails, onemay seekto minimizethe numberoftest cases
t∈Tto execute while maximizing the information that executing
twould reveal about the program’s correctness. Yang et al. [ 43,44]
give several strategies to selecta test case t′∈T(orasize-limited
setoftestcases T′⊆T)suchthatÐifweweretoexecute t′(orT′)Ð
theuncertaintyabouttestcasefailure(i.e.,entropy)is minimized .
Unlikeourmodel,themodelofYangetal.requirestospecifyfor
each input the expected output as well as the probability of failure
(i.e.,theobservednotmatchingtheexpectedoutput).Hence,Yang’s
modelispracticalonlyinthecontextoftestselection,butnotin
the context of automated test generation. Similarly, Feldt et al. [ 17]
proposeaninformation-theoreticapproachtomeasurethedistance
between test cases, based on Kolmogorov complexity, and uses
it to maximize diversity of selected tests. Although their idea is
complementarytoours,itiscomputationallytooexpensivetobe
directlyappliedtotestgeneration.Finally,byconsideringfuzzingas
arandomprocessinamulti-dimensionalspace,Ankou[ 29]enables
the detection ofdifferent combination infuzzers’ fitness function.

Bugfindingefficiencyandscalabilityareimportantpropertiesof
a fuzzingcampaign. Böhmeand Paul [ 8] conducteda probabilistic
analysis of the efficiency of blackbox versus whitebox fuzzing, and
provide concrete bounds on the time a whitebox fuzzer can take
per test input in order to remain more efficient than a blackbox
fuzzer.BöhmeandFalk[ 7]empiricallyinvestigatethescalability
ofnon-deterministicblack-andgreyboxfuzzingandpostulatean
exponential cost of vulnerability discovery. Specifically, they make
the followingcounter-intuitive observation:Findingthe samebugs
linearlyfasterrequireslinearlymoremachines.Yet,findinglinearly
more bugs in the same time requires exponentially more machines.
AlshahwanandHarman[ 2]introducedtheconceptofłoutput

consideredasmoreeffectivethananotherifitelicitsalargernumber
of unique program outputs. This blackbox criterion turns out to be
similarlyeffectiveaswhiteboxcriteria(suchascodecoverage)in
assessingtestsuiteeffectiveness.Inourconceptualframework,a
unique output might beconsidered as a species. Entropy could be
used as blackbox measure of the efficiency of discovering different
unqiue outputs duringtesting.
687Boosting Fuzzer Efficiency: AnInformationTheoreticPerspective ESEC/FSE ’20, November8ś13,2020,VirtualEvent, USA
8 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented Entropic , the first greybox fuzzer that
leveragesShannon’sentropyforschedulingseeds.Thekeyintuition
behind our approach is to prefer seeds that reveal more informa-
tionabouttheprogramundertest.Ourextensiveempiricalstudy
confirms that our information-theoreticapproach indeedhelpsin
boosting fuzzing performance in termsof bothcode coverageand
bugfindingability.
Information theory . We formally link entropy (as measure
ofinformation)tofuzzerefficiency,developestimatorsandboost-
ing techniques for greybox fuzzing that maximize information,
and empirically investigate the resulting improvement of fuzzer
efficiency. We extend the STADS statistical framework [ 6] to in-
corporatemutation-basedblackboxfuzzingwhereanewinputis
generatedbymodifyingaseedinput.Wehopethatourinformation-
theoretic perspective provides a general framework to think about
efficiency in software testing irrespective of the chosen measure of
effectiveness (i.e.,independent ofthe coveragecriterion).
Practical Impact .Ourimplementationof Entropic hasbeen
incorporated intoLibFuzzer , one of the most popular industrial
fuzzers.Atthetimeofwriting, Entropic wasenabledfor50%of
fuzzingcampaignsthat arerunonmore than25,000machinesfor
findingbugsandsecurityvulnerabilitiesinover350open-source
projects, including Google Chrome. After several additional im-
provements, rapidly facilitated by the Fuzzbench team, Entropic
nowoutperforms all other fuzzers available on FuzzBench [ 30],
Google’s fuzzer benchmarking platform. This result highlights the
practical impact ofour approach.
Open science and reproducibility . The practical impact of
Entropic is a testament to the effectiveness of open science, open
source, and open discourse. There is a growing number of authors
thatpubliclyreleasetheirtoolsandartifacts.Conferencesareadopt-
ingartifactevaluationcommitteestosupportreproducibility[ 23],
but, asalways,more can be done to accommodatereproducibility
as first-class citizens into our peer-reviewing process. We strongly
believethat openness isareasonablepathwaytofosterrapidand
soundadvancesinthefieldandtoenableameaningfulengagement
between industry andacademia.
