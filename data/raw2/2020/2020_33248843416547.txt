ABSTRACT
Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides a visual bridge between
asoftwareapplicationandendusers,throughwhichtheycanin-
teract with each other. With the development of technology and
aesthetics,thevisualeffectsoftheGUIaremoreandmoreattracting.
However, such GUI complexity posts a great challenge to the GUI
implementation. According to our pilot study of crowdtesting bug
reports, display issues such as text overlap, blurred screen, missing
image always occur during GUI rendering on different devices due
tothesoftwareorhardwarecompatibility.Theynegativelyinflu-
ence the app usability, resulting in poor user experience. To detect
these issues, we propose a novel approach, OwlEye, based on deep
learning for modelling visual information of the GUI screenshot.
Therefore, OwlEyecan detect GUIs with display issues and also
locate the detailed region of the issue in the given GUI for guiding
developerstofixthebug.Wemanuallyconstructalarge-scalela-
belleddatasetwith4,470GUIscreenshotswithUIdisplayissuesand
develop a heuristics-based data augmentation method for boosting
the performance of our OwlEye. The evaluation demonstrates that
ourOwlEyecanachieve85%precisionand84%recallindetecting
UIdisplayissues,and90%accuracyinlocalizingtheseissues.We
also evaluate OwlEyewith popular Android apps on Google Play
and F-droid, and successfully uncover 57 previously-undetected UI
display issues with 26 of them being confirmed or fixed so far.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3324884.3416547provides a visual bridge between a software application and end
users through which they caninteract with each other. Designing
a UI requires proper user interaction, information architecture and
visual effects of the UI. A good GUI design makes an application
easy,practicalandefficienttouse,whichsignificantlyaffectsthe
success of the application and the loyalty of its users [27].
However,moreandmorefancyvisualeffectsinGUIdesignsuch

many display issues1such astext overlap, missing image, blurred

especially on different mobile devices.
MostofthoseUIdisplayissuesarecausedbydifferentsystem
settings in different devices, especially for Android, as there are
morethan10majorversionsofAndroidOSrunningon24,000+dis-

the software can still run along with these bugs, they negatively
influencethefluentusagewiththeapp,resultinginthesignificantly
bad user experience and corresponding loss of users. Therefore,
this study is targeting at detecting those UI display issues.

whichfocusesondevelopingapplicationsrapidlythroughfrequent
iterations and continuous feedback. They utilize users’ feedback
to reveal UI display issues, but it is a reactive way for bug fixing
which may have already hurt users of the app, resulting in the loss
of market shares.
Incomparisonwithobtainingfeedbackfromusersforreactive
app UI assurance, we need a more proactive mechanism whichcould check the UI display before the app release, automatically
spotthepotentialissuesintheGUI,andremindthedevelopersto
fixissuesifany.TherearemanyresearchworksonautomatedGUI
testing [3,17,20,24,39,42,44,45,48,49,60] by dynamically ex-
ploringdifferentpageswithrandomactions(e.g.,clicking,scrolling,
filling in the text) until triggering the crash bugs or explicit excep-
tions. Some practical automated testing tools like Monkey [ 21,65],
Dynodroid [ 40] are also widely used in industry. However, these
automatedtoolscanonlyspotcriticalcrashbugs,ratherthanUIdis-
playissueswhichcannotbecapturedbythesystem.Inthiswork,
we aim at detecting the UI display issues with the screenshots
generated during automatic testing by visual understanding.
TounderstandthecommonUIrenderingissues,wefirstcarryout
a pilot study on 10,330 non-duplicate screenshots from 562 mobile
application crowdtesting tasks to observe display issues in these
screenshots. Results show that a non-negligible portion (43.2%) of
screenshots are of display issues which can seriously impact theuser experience, and degrade the reputation of the applications.
Besides, we also examine 1,432 screenshots randomly-chosen from
the commonly-used Rico dataset [ 19], and find 1.2% screenshots
having UI display issues. The common categories of UI display
issuesinclude componentocclusion,textoverlap,missingimage,null
valueandblurred screen. Considering its popularity and lack of
support in current practice of automatic UI testing, it would be
valuableforclassifyingthescreenshotswithUIdisplayissuesfrom
the plenty of screenshots generated during UI testing.
Inspired by the fact that display bugs can be easily spotted by
humaneyes,weproposeanapproach, OwlEye2tomodelthevisual
informationbydeeplearningtoautomaticallydetectandlocalizeUIdisplayissues.Our
OwlEyebuildsontheConvolutionalNeuralNet-
work (CNN) to identify the screenshots with UI display issues, and
utilizes Gradient weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)
to localize the regions with UI display issues in the screenshotsforguidingdeveloperstofixthebug.Toovercomethelackofla-beled data for training our model, we develop a heuristics-based
dataaugmentationmethodtogeneratescreenshotswithUIdisplay
issues from bug-free UI images. We then integrate OwlEyewith
DroidBot[ 36]whichcandynamicallyexploredifferentpagesofthe
mobile apps as a fully automatic tool from collecting the screen-
shotstodetectandlocalizeUIdisplayissues.Notethatonestrength
of our approach over conventional program analysis is that it can
be applied to any platform including Android, iOS, and it takes the
screenshot as theinput which is easy to beobtained in real-world
practice.
Toevaluatetheeffectivenessofour OwlEye,wecarryoutalarge-

2Our approach is named as OwlEyeas it is like owl’s eyes to effectively spot UI
displayissues.Andourmodel(nocturnallikeowl)cancomplementwithconventional
automated GUI testing (diurnal like eagle) for ensuring the robustness of the UI.13 state-of-the-art baselines, our OwlEyecan achieve more than
17%and50%boostinrecallandprecisioncomparedwiththebest
baseline, resulting in 85%precision and 84% recall. As our OwlEye
can also locate the detailed position of the bug in the UI, we carry
out a user study to check its accuracy and the results demonstrate
that 90% of bug locations are correct. Apart from the accuracyof our
OwlEye, we also evaluate the usefulness of our OwlEyeby
applyingitindetectingtheUIdisplayissuesinthereal-worldapps
from Google Play and F-Droid. Among 329 apps, we find that 57of them are with UI display issues. We issued bug reports to the
development team and 26 are confirmed and fixed by developers.

so as to facilitate the design of our approach for detecting UIs with

Figure 2: Examples of five categories of UI display issues
display issues, which accounts for 43.2% (4470/10330) in all screen-
shots. This result indicates that the UI display issues account for a
non-negligible portion of mobile application bugs revealed during
crowdtesting and should be paid careful attention for improving
the software quality.
During the manually examination process, we notice that there
are different types of UI issues, a categorization of these issues
would facilitate the design and evaluation of related approach. Fol-
lowingtheCardSorting[ 59]method,weclassifythoseUIissues
into five categories including component occlusion, text overlap,
missing image, null value andblurred screen with details as follows:
Componentocclusion(47%) :AsshowninFigure2(a),thetex-
tualinformationorcomponentisoccludedbyothercomponents.
ItusuallyappearstogetherwithTextVieworEditText.Themain
reasons are as follows: the improper setting of element’s height, or
the adaptive issues triggered when setting a larger-sized font.

Missing image (25%) :AsshowninFigure2(c),intheiconpo-
sition, the image is not showing as its design. The possible reasons
are as follows: wrong image path or layout position, unsuccess-
fulloadingoftheconfigurationfileduetopermissions,oversized
image, network connection, code logic, or picture errors, etc.
NULLvalue(6%) :AsshowninFigure2(d),therightinformation

This category of bugs usually occurs with TextView. The main
reasons are as follows: issues in parameter setting or database
reading,andthelengthoftextinTextViewexceedingthethreshold,
etc.
Blurred screen (1%) : As shown in Figure 2(e), the screen is
blurred. The reason for this bug might because the defects in hard-
ware, or the exclusion of hardware acceleration for some CPU- or
GPU- demanding functionalities.

cations in Rico dataset5[19] , which is a commonly-used mobile

tionsandwewillfurtherintroducethatdatasetonSection4.We
find that 18 UIs from 16 apps (16/200 = 8.8% apps) are with UI
displayissues.Notethatnumberishighlyunderestimated,asthe
collected UIs do not cover all pages of the applications, and the
applications are not fully tested on different devices with different
screen resolutions.
2.3 Why Visual Understanding in Detecting UI
Display Issues
These findingsconfirm theseverity of UIdisplay issues, andmoti-
vateustodesignapproachforautomaticallydetectingtheseGUI
issues. One commonly-used practice for bug detection in mobile
apps is program analysis, but it may not be suitable in this senario.
Toapplytheprogramanalysis,oneneedtoinstrumentthetarget

tomizetheircodetobecompatibleondifferentmobiledevices(e.g.,Samsung,Huawei,etc)withdifferentscreenresolution,whichisex-tremelyeffort-consuming.Specifically,itisnottrivialtoenumerate
all display issues and develop corresponding rules for detection.
Takeninthissense,it isworthwhiledevelopinganewefficient
and general method for detecting UI display issues. Inspired bythe fact that these display issues can be spotted by human eyes,
we propose to identify these buggy screenshots with visual under-
standingtechniquewhichimitatesthehumanvisualsystem.Asthe
UI screenshots are easy to fetch (either manually or automatically)
andexertnosignificantdifferenceacrosstheappsfromdifferent

localize the detailed issue position on the UI screenshot by Grad
CAM-based model for guiding developers to fix the bug.
3.1 CNN-based UI Display Issues Detection
As the UI display issues can only be spotted via the visual informa-
tion, we adopt the convolutional neural network (CNN) [ 31,34],

convolutional operation is to extract the different characteristics
of the input (i.e., feature extraction). After convolutional layer, the
screenshots will be abstracted as feature graph.

to further pick up larger-scale detail than just edges and curvesby further distilling the features. The pooling function uses thetotal statistical characteristics of the adjacent output of a certain

commonly by taking their average or maximum value. In addition

The fully connected layers further encode all features of the UI

is similar to the result of the previous layer.
3.2 Grad CAM-based UI Display Issues
Localization
Although our classification model can check if the given UI screen-
shot is of display issues, some UI display issues may still be too
small to spot in a large UI screenshot. Therefore, besides the classi-
fication model, we adopt the feature visualization method to locate
the detailed position of the issues for guiding developers to fix the
bug.Thiscanalsohelpusevaluatewhetherthefeatureextracted
by our CNN model is accurate or not. We apply Grad-CAM model
forthelocalizationofUIdisplayissues.GradientweightedClass
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a technique for visualizing the

tains the spatial and semantic information, and this technique uses
theclass-specificgradientinformationflowingintothefinalcon-
volutional layer to produce a localization map of the important
regions in the inputted image. The flow of Grad-CAM is shown
in Figure 5. First, a screenshot with UI display issue is input into
the trained CNN model, and the category supervisor to which the
image belongs is set to 1, while the rest is 0.

3.3 Implementation
OurCNNmodeliscomposedof12Convolutionallayerswithbatch
normalization, 6 pooling layers and 4 full connection layers for
classifying UI screenshot with display issues. The size of convolu-
tional kernel in convolutional layer is 3 * 3. We set up the number
of convolutional kernels as 16 for convolutional layer 1-4, 32 for
convolutional layer 5-6, 64 for convolutional layer 7-8, and 128 for
convolutionallayer9-12.ThemomentuminBNlayerissetas0.1.

PyTorch6framework.
4 HEURISTIC-BASEDDATAAUGMENTATION
Training an effective CNN model for visual understanding requires
a large amount of input data. For example, RESNET [ 25] model
uses 128 million images from ImageNet as training dataset for
image classification task. Similarly, training our proposed CNN for
UIdisplayissuesdetectionrequiresabundantofscreenshotswith
UI display issues. However, there is so far no such type of open
dataset, and collecting the related buggy screenshots is quite time-
andeffort-consuming.Therefore,wedevelopaheuristic-baseddata
augmentationmethodforgeneratingUIscreenshotswithdisplay
issues from bug-free UI images.
Thedataaugmentationis basedontheRico[ 19]datasetwhich
contains more than 66K unique screenshots from 9.3K Android
applications,aswellastheiraccompaniedJSONfile(i.e.,detailed
run-timeviewhierarchyofthescreenshot).Accordingtoourob-
servationonSection2,mostUIscreenshotsinthisdatasetareof
no dispaly issues.
Figure 6: Examples of data augmentation
Algorithm 1 presents the heuristic-based data augmentation al-
gorithm. With the input screenshot and its associated JSON file,the algorithm first locates all the TextView and ImageView, thenrandomly chooses a TextView or ImageView depending on theaugmented category. Based on the coordinates and size of the
TextView/ImageView, the algorithm then makes its copy and ad-
justs its location or size following specific rules to generate the
screenshotwithcorrespondingUIdisplayissues.Figure6demon-
stratestheillustrativeexamplesoftheaugmentedscreenshotswith

Note that, among the five categories of UI display issues, the
category of blurred screen is difficult to be generated following
the above idea. Besides, preliminary results reveal the proposedapproach can detect this category of issues with relatively high
accuracy.Hence,weleavethiscategoryforfuturework,andinthis

Augmentation for Component Occlusion Bug : When this
category of bug occurs, the textual information or component is
occludedbyothercomponents.Therefore,wefirstgenerateacolor

TextView but with a smaller height, then put it to cover part of the
TextView randomly.
Augmentation for Text Overlap Bug : The textual contents
are overlapped with each other, when this category of bug occurs.
To augment this category of screenshots, we generate a piece oftextwiththesamecontentastheoriginalTextView,andoffsetit

5 EXPERIMENT DESIGN
5.1 Research Questions
•RQ1: (Issues Detection Performance) How effective of our
proposed OwlEyein detecting UI display issues?
For RQ1, we first present some general views of our proposed
approach for UI display issues detection and the comparison with
commonly-usedbaselineapproaches(detailsareinSection5.3).We
also present the performance comparison among the variations of
modelconfiguration(e.g.,thenumberofconvolutionallayers)to
further demonstrate its effectiveness. Besides, we also evaluate the
contribution of data argumentation by comparing the performance
with and without the argumented training data.
•RQ2:(IssuesLocalizationPerformance) Howeffectiveofour
proposed OwlEyein localizing UI display issues?
Forevaluatingtheperformanceofissueslocalization,weconduct
a user study to check its accuracy.
•RQ3:(UsefulnessEvaluation) Howdoesourproposed OwlEye
work in real-world situations?
ForRQ3,weintegrate OwlEyewithDroidBotasafullyautomatic
tooltocollectthescreenshotsanddetectUIdisplayissues,andthen
issue the detected bugs to the development team.
5.2 Experimental Setup
The experimental dataset comes from two sources. The first is the
screenshotsfromcrowdtesting,whichcontains4,470non-duplicate
screenshotswithUIdisplayissuesandequalnumberofbug-free
non-duplicate screenshots (see details in Section 2).
The second is the screenshots generated with the data augmen-

of each of the other three categories.
For the augmented 10,000 screenshots with UI display issues,
we first extract their features with ORB feature extraction algo-
rithm [54], rank them randomly, compute the cosine similarity
between a specific screenshot and each of its previous ones, and
removeitwhenasimilarityvalueabove0.8isobserved.Inthisway,
7,800screenshots withUIdisplay issuesare remainedandadded
into the experimental dataset. To make the data balanced, we then

Table1presentsthedistributionofscreenshotsintermsofdifferent
categories. The model is trained in a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060
GPU (16G memory) with 100 epochs for about 8 hours.
5.3 Baselines
In order to further demonstrate the advantage of OwlEye, we com-
pare it with 13 baselines utilizing both machine learning and deep
learningtechniques.The12machinelearningapproachesfirstex-
tract visual features from the screenshots, and employ machine
learnerfortheclassification.Thedeeplearningapproachutilizes
artificialneuralnetworkdirectlyonthescreenshotsforclassifica-
tion. We first present thethree types offeature extraction method
used in machine learning approaches.
SIFT[37]: Scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) is a common
featureextractionmethodtodetectanddescribelocalfeaturesinan
image.Itcanextracttheinterestingpointsontheobjecttogeneratethe feature description of the object, which is invariant to uniform
scaling, orientation, and illumination changes.
SURF[4]: Speed up robot features (SURF) is an improvement
ofSIFT. SURF uses an integer approximation of the determinant
of Hessian blob detector, which can be computed with 3 integer
operations using a precomputed integral image.
ORB[54]: Oriented fast and rotated brief (ORB) is a fast feature
point extraction and description algorithm. Based on the rapid
binary descriptor ORB of brief,it has rotation invariance and anti
noise ability.
With these features, we apply four commonly-used machine
learning approaches, i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM) [ 30], K-
NearestNeighbor(KNN)[ 6],NaiveBayes(NB)[ 30]andRandom
Forests (RF) [ 8], for classifying the screenshots with UI display
issues. The combination of three types of image features and four
learning algorithms generates a total of 12 baselines.
We also experimentwith MultilayerPerceptron (MLP) directly
on the screenshots to better demonstrate the superiority of our
proposedapproach.Indetail,MLPisafeedforwardartificialneural
network [ 23,33]. The network structure is divided into input layer,
hidden layer and output layer. Each node is a neuron that uses
anonlinearactivationfunction,e.g.,correctedlinearunit(ReLU).
It is trained by changing the connection weight according to the
outputerrorcomparedwiththegroundtruth.Weusedeightlayers
of neural network, and we set the number of neurons in each layer
to 190, 190, 128, 128, 64, 64, 32 and 2, respectively.
5.4 Evaluation Metrics
In order to evaluate the issues detection performance of our pro-
posedapproach,weemploythreeevaluationmetrics,i.e.,precision,
recall,F1-Score,whicharecommonly-usedinimageclassification
andpatternrecognition[ 38,41].Forallthemetrics,highervalue
leads to better performance.
Precision is the proportion of screenshots that are correctly pre-
dicted as having UI display issues among all screenshots predicted
as buggy:
precision =Screenshots correctly predicted as buggy
All screenshots predicted as buggy(5)
Recall is the proportion of screenshots that are correctly pre-
dictedasbuggyamongallscreenshotsthatreallyhaveUIdisplay
issues.
recall =Screenshots correctly predicted as buggy
All screenshots really buggy(6)
F1-score (F-measure or F1) is the harmonic mean of precision
and recall, which combines both of the two metrics above.
F1−score =2×precision×recall
precision+recall(7)
InSection6.2,weemployKendall’sW(Kendall’scoefficientof
concordance) [ 56] to assess the agreement of the user evaluated
localization results among different practitioners. It is a commonly-
used measurement for the level of agreement between multiple
items of multiple raters. The closer the test outcome is to 1, the
higher agreement among the evaluation results of the raters.

6 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
6.1 Issues Detection Performance (RQ1)
We first present the issues detection performance of our proposed
OwlEye,aswellastheperformanceintermsoffivecategoriesofUI
displayissuesinTable2.With OwlEye,theprecisionis0.85,indicat-
ing 85% (679/798) of the screenshots which are predicted as having
UI display issues are truly buggy. The recall is 0.84, indicating 84%
(679/800) buggy screenshots can be found with OwlEye.

NULL value 0.855 0.808 0.830
Blurred screen 0.888 0.800 0.842
We then shift our focus to the bottom half of Table 2, i.e., the
performance in terms of each category of UI display issues. All the
fivecategoriesofUIdisplayissuescanbedetectedwitharelative
high precision and recall, i.e., mimimum precision and recall are
0.82and0.80respectively.Thecategory missingimage canbede-
tected with the highest F1-score, indicating both precision (0.86)
andrecall(0.90)achievearelativelyhighvalue.Thismightbecause
screenshotswith missingimage bugshaverelativelyfixedpattern
and the buggy area is relatively large, i.e., the whole image icon
asshowninSection2.Incomparison,thecategory textoverlap is
recognized with the lowest F1-score, e.g., 0.82 precision and 0.81
recall. This is due to the fact that the pattern of this category is
more diversified, and the buggy region is much smaller, i.e., the
overlappingarea between twopieces of textaccounts for amere of
10% of the text component.

6.1.1 Performance Comparison with Baselines. Table3shows
theperformancecomparisonwiththebaselines.Wecanseethat
our proposed OwlEyeis much better than the baselines, i.e., 17%
higher in recall compared with the best baseline (MLP), and 50%
higherinprecisionwiththebestbaseline(ORB-NB).Thisfurtherindicatestheeffectivenessof OwlEye.Besides,italsoimpliesthat
OwlEyeis especially good at hunting for the buggy screenshots
from candidate ones, i.e., larger improvement in recall.

MLP achieves the highest recall among the baselines, indicat-
ingthisdeeplearningapproachisbetteratidentifyingthebuggy
screenshots, yet with a lower precision. The machine learning ap-
proacheswithORBfeatureachievethehighestF1-score(i.e.,0.63
by ORB-NB), indicating this kind of feature is more suitable fordetecting UI display issues. This might because ORB algorithmis the state-of-the-art feature extraction algorithm, and has been
proven to be an efficient alternative to SIFT or SURF [54].
6.1.2 Performance Comparison among Model Configura-
tions.We also conduct experiments to compare the detection per-
formance with different configurations of CNN model. Table 4
showstheperformanceofUIdisplayissuesdetectionintermsof
different convolutional layers and with / without batch normaliza-
tion (BN).
We can see that both the convolutional layers and the batch
normalizationcaninfluencetheissuesdetectionperformance.Gen-
erally speaking, when deepening the neural network, i.e., moreconvolutional layers, both precision (P) and recall (R) would in-
crease.Forexample,thepr ecisionundergo18% improvementwhen

data by removing the 15,640 screenshots generated with data aug-
mentation (details are in Section 5.2). From Table 5, we can see
that both precision (P) and recall (R) improve when the augmented
screenshotsareaddedtothe trainingdata,indicatingthevalueof
data augmentation for effective UI display issues detection. Specif-
ically, 13% and 35% improvement are observed respectively for
precision and recall. The larger improvement in recall indicates
that,withtheaugmenteddataset,morescreenshotswithUIdisplay

greater issues detection capability.

7 DISCUSSION
Generality across platforms. Almost all the existing studies of
GUI bug detection[ 32,36,67] are designedfor a specific platform,
e.g.,Android,whichlimitsitsapplicabilityinreal-worldpractice.In
comparison, theprimary idea ofour proposed OwlEyeis todetect
UIdisplayissuesfromthescreenshotsgeneratedwhenrunningthe
applications with visual understanding. Since the screenshots from
differentplatforms(e.g.,Android,iOS)exertalmostnodifference,
our approach can be generalized for UI display issues detection in
otherplatforms.Wehaveconductedasmallscaleexperimentfor
another popular platform iOS, and experiment on seven screen-
shotswithUIdisplayissuescollectedinourdaily-usedapplications.
Resultsshow thatourproposed OwlEyecanaccurately detectfive(71%) of the buggy screenshots. This further demonstrates the gen-
erality of OwlEye, and we will conduct more thorough experiment
in future.
Generalityacrosslanguages. Anotheradvantageof OwlEyeis
that it can be applied for UI display issues detection in terms of dif-
ferent display languages of the application. The testing data of the
experiment for RQ1 contains the screenshots in Chinese, while the
experiment for RQ3 relates with the screenshots in English, which
demonstrates the generality of our approach across languages. We
also collect 22 screenshots with UI display issues in two other lan-
guages (i.e. German and Korean) from the applications in RQ3, and
runourapproachforbugdetection.Resultsshowthatourproposed
OwlEyecan accurately detect 16 (73%) of the buggy screenshots,
which further demonstrates the feasibility of OwlEye.
Potentialwithmoreeffectiveautomatictestingtool. Results
in RQ3 have demonstrated the usefulness of OwlEyein real-world
practicebeingintegratedwithautomatictestingtoolasDroidBot.
However, we have mentioned in Section 6.3 that some applications
can not be run with DroidBot, and some can only be fetched with
one screenshot due to the shortcoming of DroidBot, both of which
limit the full exploration of screenshots. If armed with a more
effectiveautomatictestingtool, OwlEyeshouldplayabiggerrole
in detecting UI display issues in real-world practice.

and extremely difficult for the developers covering all the popular
contexts when conducting testing. Besides, different from these
works based on static or dynamic code analysis, our work only
requires the screenshot as the input. Such characteristic enables
our light-weight computer vision based method, and also makes
our approach generalised to any platform including Android, IOS,
or IoT devices.
9 CONCLUSION
Improving the quality of mobile applications, especially in a proac-
tiveway,isofgreatvalueandalwaysencouraged.Thispaperfo-
cuses on automatic detecting the UI display issues from the screen-
shots generated during automatic testing. The proposed OwlEyeis
proventobeeffectiveinreal-worldpractice,i.e.,26confirmedor
fixedpreviously-undetectedUIdisplayissuesfrompopularAndroid
apps. OwlEyealso achieves more than 17% and 50% boostin recall
and precision compared with the best baseline. As the first work
of its kind, we also contribute to a systematical investigation of UI
display issues in real-world mobile apps, as well as a large-scale
dataset of app UIs with display issues for follow-up studies.
Inthefuture,wewillkeepimprovingourmodelforbetterperfor-
mance in the classification. Apart from the display issue detection,
wewillfurtherlocatetherootcauseoftheseissuesinourfuture
