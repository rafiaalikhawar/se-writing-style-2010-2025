ABSTRACT
In 2014, a Microsoft study investigated the sort of questions that
data science applied to software engineering should answer. This re-
sulted in 145 questions that developers considered relevant for data
scientists to answer, thus providing a research agenda to the com-
munity. Fast forward to five years, no further studies investigated
whether the questions from the software engineers at Microsoft
hold for other software companies, including software-intensive
companies with different primary focus (to which we refer as
software-defined enterprises ). Furthermore, it is not evident that
the problems identified five years ago are still applicable, given the
technological advances in software engineering.
This paper presents a study at ING, a software-defined enter-
prise in banking in which over 15,000 IT staff provides in-house
software solutions. This paper presents a comprehensive guide of
questions for data scientists selected from the previous study at
Microsoft along with our current work at ING. We replicated the
original Microsoft study at ING, looking for questions that impact
both software companies and software-defined enterprises and con-
tinue to impact software engineering. We also add new questions
that emerged from differences in the context of the two companies
and the five years gap in between. Our results show that software
engineering questions for data scientists in the software-defined
enterprise are largely similar to the software company, albeit with
exceptions. We hope that the software engineering research com-
munity builds on the new list of questions to create a useful body
of knowledge.

1 INTRODUCTION
Software engineering researchers try solving problems that are
relevant to software developers, teams, and organizations. Histori-
cally, researchers identified these problems from their experience,
connections in industry and/or prior research. In 2014, however, a
study at Microsoft [ 7] systematically analyzed software engineer-
ing questions that data scientists can answer and made it accessible
to a wider audience.
Switching context, in the past few years ING transformed it-
self from a finance-oriented company to a software-defined, data-
driven enterprise. From a software engineering perspective, this
includes the implementation of fully automated release engineer-
ing pipelines for software development activities in more than 600
teams performing 2,500+ deployments per month for 750+ appli-
cations. These activities leave a trove of data, suggesting that data
scientists using, e.g., modern machine learning techniques could
offer valuable and actionable insights to ING.
To that end, ING needs questions that are relevant for their
engineers which their data scientists can answer. As we started
looking for existing resources, we came across the 145 software
engineering questions for data scientists presented in the Microsoft
study [7]. However, before adopting the list, we wanted to know:
RQ: To what extent do software engineering questions relevant for
Microsoft apply to ING, five years later?
Microsoft is a large software company, while ING that is a Fin-
Tech company using software to improve its banking solutions
(software-defined enterprise). Moreover, the two companies are at
different scale. In 2014, Microsoft had more than 30,000 engineers
while even today ING is almost half its size with approximately
15,000 IT employees (on a total of 45,000). More details on the
differences in the context of the two companies are available in
Table 1. We try to understand whether the questions relevant for
a software company extend to a software-defined enterprise. We
compare the results of the original Microsoft study [ 7] with our
results at ING to understand the relevance of the questions beyond
Microsoft but also as a guide for other software-defined enterprises
that are undergoing their digital transformation. We further explore
568

whether the technological advances in the last five years changed
the way we develop software. To answer this question, we carried
out a replication of the original Microsoft study at ING. Similar
to the original study, we conducted two surveys: one, to find data
science problems in software engineering, and second, to rank the
questions in the order of their relevance (see Figure ??). For the first
survey, we randomly sampled 1,002 ING engineers and received
116 responses with 336 questions. We grouped the 336 questions on
similarities resulting in 171 descriptive questions. We shared sub-
sets of these 171 descriptive questions with another random sample
of 1,296 ING engineers for ranking. In the end, we received 21,888
rankings from 128 ING engineers. These ranked 171 questions are
the questions that engineers at ING would like data scientists to
solve. Further, we compare our list of 171 questions to the original
list of 145 questions to answer our research question. Our study
shows that the core software development problems, relating to
code (e.g. understanding code, testing, and quality), developer pro-
ductivity (both individuals and team) and customer are same for the
software company and the software-defined enterprise. Nonethe-
less, subtle differences in the type of questions point to changes in
market as well as differences in the context of the two companies.
2 IMPACT OF THE MICROSOFT 2014 STUDY
In order to gain a good insight into the further course of the Mi-
crosoft 2014 study after it was published, including any implica-
tions for research, we conducted a citation analysis. In addition,
we looked at studies that have not quoted the Microsoft study, but
that are relevant to our study. Hence this section also serves as our
discussion of related work. We investigated the 136 studies that,
according to Google Scholar, quote the Microsoft study. First of all,
we looked at the number of times that the 136 studies themselves
were cited by other studies; we limited the further analysis to 70
studies with a citation per year greater than 1.00. We then charac-
terized studies into empirical approach, reference characterization,
SE topic, and machine learning (ML) topic (see Table 2). Note that
one paper can belong to multiple topics. We made the following
observations:
Microsoft itself is building on its study. 11% of the citations come
from Microsoft studies itself, mostly highly cited studies on SE
culture, such as [ 18,41,51]. we notice that all citing Microsoft
studies use a survey among a large number of SE practitioners
(ranging from 16 to 793 respondents with a median of 311), whereas
other studies based on a survey generally reach substantially lower
numbers of participants.

Other 4 5%
Half of the citing studies analyze SE process data, and 24% uses a
survey. Looking at the empirical approach (see the first sub-table
in Table 2), indicates that 43% of the studies contain a quantitative
component, in which analysis of SE process data in particular is part
of the study. Good examples are [ 9,28]. Furthermore, 24% of the
citing studies uses a survey among SE practitioners, for example
[18,22,45,69,75]. Ten percent is based on interviews with SE
practitioners, such as [ 20,41,42,50]. Seven percent contains a
literature review, for example [ 12,45,73]. Another 7% conducts an
experiment [33, 62], case study [49, 59], or field study [9, 10].
Only three out of 70 studies explicitly answer a question from the
initial Microsoft study. The second sub-table in Table 2 shows that
only 3 studies (4%) explicitly refer their research question to an
initial Microsoft one: [ 16,28,33]. Nine studies (13%) partly try to
answer a MS question: [ 8–10,30,52,62,64,65,70]. 29 studies (39%)
refer to the original Microsoft study because they used it as an
example for their own study [ 17,59], either with regard to the
study design [ 20,22,29,37,46,48,67], the rating approach (Kano)
[51,61], or the card sorting technique [ 19,54,60,63]. Furthermore,
a large part (38 studies, 54%) of the citing studies simply refers to
the original Microsoft study in a simple related work way.
A majority of citing studies is about Software Analytics, Testing
related studies, and SE Process. The third sub-table shows that most
cited studies are about software analytics, often combined with
a focus on the role of the software engineer and its perceptions,
e.g. [ 42,51]. In other cases the emphasis on software analytics is
569Questions for Data Scientists in Software Engineering: A Replication ESEC/FSE ’20, November 8–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
combined with a more technical focus on machine learning, e.g.
[21,48]. Other studies within the topic software analytics are about
a variety of methods, tools, and techniques [ 2,3,11,14,15,27,38,
47,55,71–73]. Many of the studies that cite the Microsoft study—
and which are often quoted themselves—relate to testing or test
automation. Fifteen studies (21%) are about testing [ 8–10,13,23,
24, 33, 45, 66], debugging [80] and code review [25, 46].
12 studies (17%) handle SE process related topics, such as produc-
tivity of software engineers [ 52], visualization [ 6,31], and continu-
ous delivery [ 74,76]. In addition, studies also relate to continuous
delivery pipelines and pipeline automation [ 74,78]. Another fre-
quent topic in citing studies is data and models, including aspects
of cloud development [ 32,49,55]. Driven by a tendency toward
automation of pipelines, software generates a large amount of data.
Many different data sources—such as version control systems, peer
code review systems, issue tracking systems, mail archives—are
available for mining purposes [29, 79].
34% of the cited studies includes some form of Machine Learning.
One third of the citing papers do include some form of machine
learning (ML), ranging from applying a ML technique for analysis
purposes to coming up with examples of the application of ML
in practice. As the fourth sub-table in Table 2 shows, 8 studies
include examples of applications of ML in practice, e.g. [ 11,41,55].
Text related techniques such as NLP occur 5 times, e.g. [ 23,61],
ensemble techniques 3 times [ 30,37,60], and instance-based and
deep learning both 2 times [ 14,21,27,48]. Four other techniques—
neural networks, clustering, decision trees, and regression—occur
one time. Perhaps this finding supports a trend that is visible in
SE research, where more and more machine learning techniques
are being used in SE analyzes and vice versa, also called AI-for-
Software-Engineering [1, 40, 53].
13% are about the cultural aspects of software engineering. Soft-
ware analytics is an area of extensive growth [ 56]. The original
Microsoft 2014 study influenced ongoing research, looking at the
136 papers citing it gives the impression that it certainly did inspire
other researchers and practitioners in setting up studies on software
developers needs. Nine studies (13%) of the citing studies are about
cultural aspects of software engineering, such as topic selection in
experiments [ 58], characteristics of software engineers [ 20,50,67],
causes for frustration [ 19], or challenges for software engineers
[29, 63, 69].
3 STUDY DESIGN
Our study design comprises of two parts. In part one, we replicate
the original Microsoft study at ING. We follow the step-by-step
procedure prescribed in the original study, with slight modifications
appropriate for our context
3.1 The Initial Survey
We sent the initial survey to 1,002 ING software engineers randomly
chosen from a group of 2,342 employees working within the IT
department of ING in May 2018. Unlike the Microsoft study, we did
not offer any reward to increase the participation. This is a deviation
from the original study but aligns with the policy of ING. Out of the
1,002 engineers 387 engineers started the survey, 271 of them even

study. The figure was re-used with permission of the Microsoft 2014 study authors.

filled the demographics but stopped when asked to write questions.
In the end, we received 336 questions from 116 responses for a
response rate of 11.6%. Table 3 shows the distribution of responses
across discipline and role.
3.2 Coding and Categorization
Next we did an open card sort to group 336 questions into categories.
Our card sort was open, meaning that we coded independently

role in the initial survey as well as rating survey.

from the Microsoft study. To create independent codes, the first
author who did a majority of the coding did not study the Microsoft
paper before or during the replication. The other authors knew the
paper from before and merely skimmed the methodology section
for replication.
We let the groups emerge and evolve during the sorting process.
This process comprised of three phases. In preparation phase , we
created a card for each question. Questions 1 to 40 were tagged by
the second author. Questions 41 to 80 were tagged by the fourth
author. Questions 81 to 90 were tagged by both the second and
the fourth author. The tags of questions 1 to 90 were discussed by
both the second and fourth author and based on their discussion
final tags were prepared. The remaining questions 91 to 336 were
then tagged by the first author, based on the tags from the previous
step. We discarded cards that made general comments on software
development and did not inquire any specific topic.
Inexecution phase , cards were sorted into meaningful groups and
were assigned a descriptive title. Similar to the Microsoft study, the
questions were not easy to work with; many questions were same or
similar to one another, most were quite verbose while others were
overly specific. We distilled them into a set of so-called descriptive
questions that more concisely describe each category (and sub-
category). In this step, out of the 336 questions, 49 questions were
discarded and the remaining 287 questions were divided into 35
sub-categories. An example of reaching descriptive question is
presented below1:
‘What factors affect the composition of DevOps teams?’
from the following respondents’ questions:
/cent“Would it be better to create specialized development teams instead
of DevOps teams?"
/cent"What is your idea of an ideal team that should develop software?
How many and what kind of people should be part of it?"
Finally, in analysis phase , we created abstract hierarchies to de-
duce general categories and themes. In total, we created 171 de-
scriptive questions, a full list of which is available in the technical
report [4].
3.3 The Rating Survey
We created a second survey to rate the 171 descriptive questions.
We split the questionnaire into eight component blocks (similar
to the Microsoft study) and sent component blocks to potential
respondents. The idea behind using the split questionnaire survey
design is to avoid low response rate. Each participant received a
block of questions along with a text "In your opinion, how important
is it to have a software data analytics team answer this question?"
with possible answers as "Essential" ,"Worthwhile" ,"Unimportant" ,
"Unwise" , and "I don’t understand" [39].
The rating survey was sent to the remaining 1,296 software
engineers at ING. Here too, 360 engineers started the survey (28%),
but many of them did not complete it (36% drop-out rate). Finally,
we received 128 responses, for a somewhat low response rate of
10%. On an average each question received 21,888/177=123 ratings
making the resulting ranks stable. Table 3 shows the distribution

tive question.of responses for the rating survey based on discipline and current
role.
3.3.1 Top-Rated/Bottom-Rated Questions. Finally, to rank each
question, we dichotomized the ordinal Kano scale avoiding any
scale violations [ 44]. We computed the following percentages for
each descriptive question:
•Percentage of ’ Essential ’ responses among all the responses:
Essential
Essential +W orthwhile +Unimportant +Unwise
•Percentage of ’Essential’ and ’Worthwhile’ responses among
all the responses (to which we refer as Worthwhile+ ):
Essential +W orthwhile
Essential +W orthwhile +Unimportant +Unwise
•Percentage of ’ Unwise ’ responses among all the responses:
Unwise
Essential +W orthwhile +Unimportant +Unwise
We rank each question based on the above percentages, with
the top rank (#1) having the highest percentage in a dimension
(Essential, Worthwhile+, or Unwise). Table 5 and Table 6 presents
the most desired (Top 10 Essential, Top 10 Worthwhile+) and the
most undesired (Top 10 Unwise) descriptive questions. For all 171
questions and their rank, see the technical report [4].
3.3.2 Rating by Demographics. Unlike the Microsoft study, we did
not have employee database to rank responses based on demograph-
ics, and privacy regulations prevented us from asking people-related
aspects such as years of experience (another deviation from the
original study). Nonetheless, in both the initial and the rating sur-
vey, we asked the following professional background data from the
participants:
•Discipline: Participants were asked to indicate their primary
working area: Development ,Test,Project Management ,Other
Engineer (e.g. architect, lead), or Other Non-Engineer (only
one selection was possible).
•Current Role: Participants were asked to indicate their cur-
rent role: Individual Contributor ,Lead ,Architect ,Manager ,
Executive , orOther (more selections were possible).
To investigate the relations of descriptive questions to profes-
sional background (discipline or current role), we built stepwise
logistic regression models. We build our own models since the refer-
enced study did not share scripts to run statistical tests although we
did follow their procedure as is. Stepwise regression eliminated pro-
fessional backgrounds that did not improve the model for a given
question and a response. In addition, we removed professional back-
grounds for which the coefficient in the model was not statistically
significant at p-value < 0.01. For each of the 171 questions, we built
a model with Essential response (yes/no) as a dependent variable
and professional background as independent variable. We built sim-
ilar models for Worthwhile+ and Unwise responses. In total, we
built 513 models, three for each of the 171 descriptive questions.
3.4 Comparison of Questions
As a preliminary analysis, we start by looking at the similarities and
differences in the broader themes or categories in both the studies.

Table sorted on the percentage difference in the number of questions in the ING study compared to the Microsoft study.
Then for each theme, we see how the prominent questions in ING
compare against the prominent questions at Microsoft.
To make the comparison systematic, we followed a two-step
approach. First, we ran word count on the questions from both the
companies presenting a text-based comparison to identify broad
differences. Further, the first two authors manually analyzed top 100
essential questions from the two companies in detail. The authors
drew affinity diagrams using Microsoft questions (see Figure ??)
and appended related questions from ING to it. In case no cluster
fits a question, a new cluster is created. This resulted in three types
of clusters: match and no match (addition of ING questions and
deletion of Microsoft questions). Analyses of the three clusters and
the frequency distribution of questions (in addition to the previous
three analyses) present insights into our research question.
4 RESULTS
The original Microsoft study came up with 145 questions that soft-
ware engineers want data scientists to answer. Replicating the
original study at ING, we identified 171 data science questions.
This section presents a comparison of the two sets of questions
based on category, type of questions within categories, top-rated
questions, bottom-rated questions, and questions relevant for dif-
ferent demographics. Next, we compare the questions from the two
companies using word count and affinity diagrams to answer our
research question.
4.1 Categories
We noticed that some of our categories directly match the Microsoft
study. Other categories, however, can be mapped to one or more
categories of the Microsoft study. No new emergent category in
our study indicates that broadly there are no differences between
the questions for a software-defined enterprise from a software
company. For further analysis, we map our categories on to theirs,
details on which are available in Table 4.
Next, we explore the essential questions at ING and their distin-
guishing link to the questions from the Microsoft study.
4.1.1 Bug Measures (BUG). The essential questions at ING relate
to the effort spent on bugs, methods to prevent security-relatedvulnerabilities, and the relationship between bugs and specific ING-
related development platforms.
"How does the effort spent on fixing vulnerabilities and bugs relate
to effort spent on writing software correctly from the start?"
"What methods are most effective in preventing security-related
vulnerabilities or bugs from being introduced in software code?"
4.1.2 Development Practices (DP). The performance and productiv-
ity of DevOps teams was found in a number of questions including
team happiness and work pleasure (# 1 question), ways of decision
making, non-overlapping development activities in the same envi-
ronment, product ownership and business responsibilities, licensing
of tools, and the choice of a data modeling approach.
"What factors affect the performance and productivity of DevOps
teams with regard to team happiness and pleasure in your work?"
"What factors affect the performance and productivity of DevOps
teams with regard to evidence-based decision-making versus decision-
making based on expert opinions?"
"What factors affect the performance and productivity of DevOps
teams with regard to simultaneous slow and fast developments at the
same time in the same environment?"
4.1.3 Development Best Practices (BEST). This category empha-
sized best (or worst) development practices relating to technology
selection, effectiveness, and choice of tools.
"How can we make sure that we build for re-usability and scalabil-
ity?"
"What factors affect high performance teams?"
"When do you remove an old module that you think is not being
used anymore?"
4.1.4 Testing Practices (TP). Questions here ranged from auto-
mated test data generation, on-demand provisioning of test en-
vironments, testing of high volumes, to question like "should we
let loose Chaos Monkey" [35] [5]
"To what extent does on-demand provisioning of development and
test environments, including up-to-date data affect delivery of software
solutions?"

Figure 2: Analysis of ING 2019 and MS 2014 questions.
"What factors affect performance testing on high data volumes?"
"How can a system for (semi) automated CRUD test data generation
improve delivery of software solutions?"
"Should we let loose Chaos Monkey, like Netflix?
4.1.5 Evaluating Quality (EQ). This category included questions
on code analysis, ways to assess quality of software code, and
effectiveness of testing practices.
"What methods can be applied to analyze whether software code is
working as expected?"
"To what extent does testability of software code affect the quality
of code?"
4.1.6 Customers and Requirements (CR). The essential questions
related to measure customer value, requirement validation, and the
use of formal models. Notably, questions relating to development
trade-offs such as backward compatibility or the impact of testing
in production appeared in the Microsoft study but not ours.
"How to measure the customer value of a software product?"
"How can requirements be validated before starting actual software
development?"
"How can user feedback be integrated in an efficient and effective
way into software code?"
4.1.7 Software Development Lifecycle (SL). Questions in this cat-
egory related to the effectiveness and performance in lead time,
cost, and quality (same as the Microsoft study) but also questions
relating to security and risk from a management perspective.
"What factors affect providing new technologies to consumers, and
can implementations of new technology be internally and externally
benchmarked?"
"What factors affect estimation of lead time, cost, and quality of
software deliveries?"
4.1.8 Software Development Process (PROC). Our questions related
to development processes, technology selection, and deployment
of software solutions. At Microsoft, in contrast, questions related
to the choice of software methodology (e.g. ways in which agile is
better than waterfall? and benefits of pair programming). We also
noticed that at ING topics like the effects of automated continuous
delivery pipeline popped up which were not seen in the Microsoft
study."How can we improve the deployment process in DevOps teams?"
"Does a focus on quick release of features and bug fixes into pro-
duction help to achieve confidence and agility?"
4.1.9 Productivity (PROD). This category had questions on the
productivity of DevOps teams - but also individual developers,
ranked essential. Notably, questions related to the measurement of
individual developers (e.g. the questions mentioned below regarding
"great coder" and "open spaces") were often ranked "Unwise". Quite
unlike the Microsoft study, where respondents considered these
questions as unwise, engineers at ING had a mixed opinion.
"What factors affect the performance of DevOps teams and the
quality of software code with regard to quantity and quality of envi-
ronments?"
"Are developers working in an open space with several teams more
effective or less than developers working in a room with just their
team?"
"What makes a great coder? What aspects affect the performance
of DevOps teams and the quality of software with regard to charac-
teristics of an individual software engineer?"
4.1.10 Teams and Collaborations (TC). Essential questions here are
typically about dependencies between teams, team composition,
team maturity, and knowledge sharing among teams.
"To what extent do dependencies on other teams affect team perfor-
mance?"
"How does team maturity affect code quality and incidents?"
"What factors affect the composition of DevOps teams?"
4.2 Top-Rated Questions
Table 5 shows top 15 "Essential" and top 10 "Worthwhile or higher"
questions. Interestingly, only two out of the top 15 “Essential” ques-
tions were a part of the top 10 “Worthwhile or higher” questions
and none vice-versa. This potentially means that our participants
are more pronounced and opt for Essential or Worthwhile only
when they feel so. Culture can be another possible reason since all
participants at ING are located in one country while participants
of the Microsoft study were more diverse [34].
Our top questions are on development processes, technology
selection, and deployment of software solutions. The top related
questions at Microsoft, in contrast, relates to the choice of software
methodology (e.g. ways in which agile is better than waterfall? and
benefits of pair programming). We also noticed that in our study
topics like the effects of automated continuous delivery pipeline
popped up which were not seen in the Microsoft study.
Notably, a large fraction of the top 20 "Essential" or "Worthwhile
or higher" questions at Microsoft (9 out of 20; including top 2)
relates to customers. This suggests that for Microsoft customer
benefit is most important or perhaps one of the most important
question. Our study, in contrast, paints a very different picture.
Only two out of the 336 questions in the initial survey mentioned
the word "customer" and only one of those questions made it to
the top-20 (Q58 "How to measure the customer value of a software
product" at rank 10 "Essential"). This question is, in line with the
Microsoft study, marked with icon /usr, in Table 5).

Table is sorted on Rank Essential. The icon /usrindicates customer related questions, ³indicates questions that focus on the engineer and the effects of software development
practices and processes on her work, and ⋆indicates quality related questions.
Another eight "Essential" or "Worthwhile or higher" questions in
the Microsoft study (marked with icon ³) focus on the engineer and
the effects of software development practices and processes on her
work. In our study, we identified nine questions with this icon. In
addition to the focus on individual engineer, many of the questions
in our study relates to the concept of the DevOps team. Overall,
it seems that Microsoft has a big focus on customer while ING
emphasizes on the engineering team itself. Finally, seven questions
in the Microsoft study (marked with the icon ⋆) were about quality-
related issues (same as ours with eleven questions).
4.3 Bottom-Rated Questions
Table 6 shows the top 10 unwise questions. The most "Unwise"
question (Q27) at ING is the use of domain-specific language for
use by non-experts. In the Microsoft study, the top five "Unwise"
questions were all about a fear that respondents had of being rated.
This effect can be seen in our study too (two of the top ten unwise
questions - Q161 and Q30 - relate to measuring the performance of
individual engineers), but not nearly as strongly as in the Microsoft
study. Respondents in our study are torn on this topic; Q161 and
Q30 are ranked as "Unwise" by respectively 22.2% and 20.0% of
the respondents, but also ranked as "Essential" by another group
of 44.4% and 40.0% of the respondents. Also, it was interesting tosee that measuring and benchmarking time to market of software
solutions (Q38) is one of the top 10 unwise questions. It indicates re-
sistance against comparing departments based on key performance
indicators like the time to market.
4.4 Rating by Demographics
Table 7 shows essential questions for different disciplines (Devel-
oper, Tester, Project Management) and roles (Manager, Individual
Contributor, Architect). The complete inventory of questions for
"Worthwhile or higher" and "Unwise" responses is present in the
technical report [4].
4.4.1 Discipline. Microsoft study showed tester as a specific disci-
pline mainly interested in test suites, bugs, and product quality. We
do not see the discipline "tester" in our study. This can be seen in
Table 7 in which overall scores relating to "Test" are low and high-
est for "Development". Software engineers in the DevOps teams at
ING consider themselves to be generic developers, and testing is an
integrated part of the discipline "developer". Both developers and
testers are for example significantly interested in the testability of
software code, and the quality of software related to an agile way
of working and working in DevOps teams. Other findings relate to
developers being significantly interested in team performance, e.g.
regarding practices of good software teams from the perspective

4.5 Compare ING and Microsoft Questions
A comparison of the top 15 words from each company (see Table 8)
shows that a majority of the popular themes are same (e.g code,
test, software, and quality.). The subtle differences, however, exists
relating to rank (words in italics do not make it to top-15 in another
company) and use of the word in another company (underlined).
A subset of these differences can be attributed to differences in
terminology. For instance, Microsoft uses terms like employee/em-
ployees and team/teams, while its equivalent at ING are team/squad
and engineer. Apart from this, Microsoft questions focused more on
bugs, cost, time, customers, and tools while ING employees talked
about version, problem, systems, process, and impact.
Next, we inferred 24 themes from the clusters in the affinity
diagram organically merging into three broad categories: relating
to code (like understanding code, testing, quality), developers (indi-
vidual and team productivity) and customers (note that while cus-
tomers did not make it to the top-10 essential questions, they were
important in the top-100). The 24 themes are automated testing,
testing, understanding code, documentation, formal methods, code
review, debugging, risk, refactoring, deployment, bug fixing, legacy,
software quality, requirement, release, cloud, customer, estimation,
team productivity, employer productivity, cost, team awareness,
and agile working. Investigating each theme and category in detail,
we noticed that despite minor differences in the individual ques-
tions (some questions are broad in one company and specific in
another), largely the key questions remain the same. For instance,
employees at both the companies find questions relating to team
productivity and employee productivity important, and yet assess-
ing and comparing individual employees is undesirable. There were,

top-15 of one company and not the other are printed in italic. Words in one list and not
the other are underlined .however, subtle differences. For instance, in the Microsoft study, we
noticed a few questions eliciting the need for agile (vs. waterfall)
as well as automated testing. In the ING study, however, we do
not see such questions. Rather, we see questions relating to the
functional aspects of agile and automated testing. Another subtle
difference between the two companies is relating to code size. While
not stated explicitly, from the nature of questions, it seems that the
software teams at Microsoft are dealing with a large legacy code-
base. This was reflected in questions relating to team awareness,
code monitoring, backward compatibility, and refactoring. Such
questions, however, did not occur in ING. Other than the above,
we saw cloud-related questions appearing in the Microsoft study
only, while deployment-related questions appeared in ING only.
In a nutshell, the core software development challenges of ING
are consistent with Microsoft. There are although some nuanced
differences which relate to the evolution of software market in the
last five years as well as differences in the characteristics of the two
companies.
5 DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss potential explanations for the differences
in the list of questions found in our study compared to the Microsoft
study. We saw questions eliciting the need of agile in Microsoft
study while at ING the questions related to functional aspects. Our
hypothesis here is that in the last five years there is a change in the
market: while in 2014, the questions on the adoption of agile and
automated testing were common, in 2019 agile and automated test-
ing became the norm. We noticed that many questions at Microsoft
deals with the scale of legacy code while no such question appeared
at ING. One potential explanation for the observation can be that
software systems at ING are not of the same scale as Microsoft.
Nonetheless, it remains a lesson that in the next 10 years, ING can
also be dealing with the complexity of large code base as Microsoft
is experiencing today. Finally, some questions appeared in only one
organization. We believe that these observations have something
to do with the individual practices followed at Microsoft and ING.
The deployment-related questions at ING might be a result of the
adoption of continuous delivery as a service. Surprisingly, we did
not see any finance-related questions in the ING study. ING is a
finance-based company and we expected to see some issues relating
to both finance and software appear. We noticed that employees
often talked about security, but no real finance-related questions
appear. One explanation for this observation can be that the data sci-
ence challenges relating to software development are independent
of the actual field to which it is applied. Supporting this argument,
145 questions from Microsoft also did not bring up any product
specific details. Another potential explanation can be that through
our question we anchored our respondents into asking software
development related questions only.
5.1 Implications
One of the key findings of this paper is a list of 171 questions
that software engineers in a large, software-driven organization
would like to see answered, in order to optimize their software
development activities. From this, we see implications both in terms
of practice and industry.
576ESEC/FSE ’20, November 8–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA Hennie Huijgens, Ayushi Rastogi, Ernst Mulders, Georgios Gousios, and Arie van Deursen
From a practical perspective, our study offers a new way of
thinking to software development organizations who care about
their development processes. The questions originally raised by
Microsoft are not just relevant to one of the largest tech compa-
nies in the world, but also to large software-defined enterprises
active outside the tech-sector proper. Inspired by these questions,
an organization may select the most relevant ones, and seek ways
to address them. While some questions are fundamentally hard
to answer, organizations can make a starting point by collecting
relevant data about their development processes. This, then, can
help to make the development process itself more and more data-
driven. This is exactly how ING intends to use the questions, and
we believe companies around the world can follow suit.
From a research perspective, we have seen that the original
Microsoft study has generated a series of papers that apply some
form of Machine Learning to address the challenges raised in that
study. In the research community, AI-for-Software-Engineering is
an increasingly important topic, with many papers appearing that
seek to apply machine learning to address software engineering
problems. Our study aims to add urgency and direction to this
emerging field, by highlighting not just which questions canbe
answered, but which ones should be answered, from a practitioner
perspective.
5.2 Threats to Validity
While our study expands the external validity of the original study,
the fact remains that the two lists of questions are based on just two
companies, which are both large organizations with over 10,000
software developers. Our study highlights relevance to the FinTech
sector, but it would be interesting to see further replications, for
example in the automotive or health care sector, with different
regulatory and additional safety constraints. We expect that many
of the questions are also relevant to smaller organizations, especially
given the agile way of working at ING. Nevertheless, it will be
worthwhile to further explore this.
From a perspective of internal validity, creating codes indepen-
dent of the prior study is challenging. It is possible that the similar-
ities and differences seen compared to the Microsoft study relates
to factors (e.g. researcher bias) other than the actual data. We tried
mitigating it by limiting our exposure to the previous study, not
involving authors from the Microsoft study, and multiple authors
generating codes independently. Nonetheless, these biases are likely
to exist.
For reasons of replication, we have used where possible the same
survey questions, method of analysis and division into work area
and discipline as in the Microsoft study [ 7]. Apart from positive ef-
fects, this choice also had a negative effect with regard to analysis of
demographics, mainly due to the fact that ING uses a different way
of working, including corresponding roles and team structure, than
within Microsoft. Especially mapping the professional background
"Discipline" of the original study on the demographic "Discipline"
as applied within ING was challenging.
ING works with DevOps teams, where an engineer fulfills both
the area of developer and that of tester. As a result, testers wereunder-represented in both of the surveys we conducted. As a mit-
igation measure we therefore opted for combining the results of
developers and testers in the further analysis.
Another potential threat is sensitivity of the ranks which mostly
occurs at the extreme sides of the ranking, when, e.g., none of the
participants label a question as ‘Unwise’. In our study, on average
each question received 21,888/177=123 ratings and hence sensitivity
of ranks is unlikely.
The presented results are free from corporate influence includ-
ing Microsoft. A number of stakeholders at ING (CIO, Corporate
Communications) reviewed the submitted paper and approved it
without any changes. Although self-censorship by the authors re-
main a potential threat. Researchers may have their biases which
can potentially influence the results.
As also emphasized in related work on replications [ 77] [68]
[36] [43] [57] [26], our study seeks to replicate earlier findings in a
different context (e.g. other companies) and during a different time
(environments and perceptions of engineers do change over time).
In order to facilitate future replication of our study, we make the
total set of descriptive questions and additional info on results of
our tests available in our technical report.
6 CONCLUSION
Conducted at ING—a software-defined enterprise providing bank-
ing solutions—this study presents 171 questions that software engi-
neers at ING would like data scientists to answer. This study is a
replication of a similar study at software company Microsoft, which
resulted in 145 questions for data scientists. Further, we went a step
beyond to investigate the applicability of Microsoft’s questions in
ING, as well as changes in trends over the last five years.
We compared the two lists of questions and found that the core
software development challenges (relating to code, developer, and
customer) remain the same. Nonetheless, we observed subtle differ-
ences relating to the technology and software process developments
(e.g., currently the debate about agile versus waterfall is now largely
absent) and differences in the two organizations (e.g., Microsoft’s
focus on solving problems with a large code bases and ING’s chal-
lenges with continuous deployment). We complete our analysis
with a report on the impact Microsoft 2014 study generated, also
indicating the impact that our study is capable to generate.
A thorough understanding of key questions software engineers
have that can be answered by data scientists is of crucial importance
to both the research community and modern software engineering
practice. Our study aims to contribute to this understanding. We call
on other companies, large and small, to conduct a similar analysis,
in order to transform a software engineering into a data-driven
endeavour addressing the most pressing questions.
