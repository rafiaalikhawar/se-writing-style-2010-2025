Abstract —Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are complex
systems that must satisfy multiple requirements such as safety,
compliance to trafﬁc rules, and comfortableness. However, sat-isfying all these requirements may not always be possible dueto emerging environmental conditions. Therefore, the ADSs mayhave to make trade-offs among multiple requirements duringthe ongoing operation, resulting in one or more requirementsviolations. For ADS engineers, it is highly important to knowwhich combinations of requirements violations may occur, asdifferent combinations can expose different types of failures.However, there is currently no testing approach that can gen-erate scenarios to expose different combinations of requirementsviolations. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce thenotion of requirements violation pattern to characterize a speciﬁc
combination of requirements violations. Based on this notion, wepropose a testing approach named EMOOD that can effectively
generate test scenarios to expose as many requirements violationpatterns as possible. EMOOD uses a prioritization technique to
sort all possible patterns to search for, from the most to the leastcritical ones. Then, EMOOD iteratively includes an evolutionary
many-objective optimization algorithm to ﬁnd different combi-nations of requirements violations. In each iteration, the targetedpattern is determined by a dynamic prioritization technique togive preferences to those patterns with higher criticality andhigher likelihood to occur. We apply EMOOD to an industrial ADS
under two common trafﬁc situations. Evaluation results show thatEMOOD outperforms three baseline approaches in generating test
scenarios by discovering more requirements violation patterns.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are making revolu-
tionary changes in the domain of transportation. As ADSs
are complex and safety-critical systems, their testing is vitalfor their wide acceptance [1]. Although on-road testing of

ADSs such as Waymo [2] and V oyage.auto [3], existingstudies [4], [5] have shown that billions of miles provideonly limited assurance, since such time-consuming and costlytesting approach would still miss dangerous and rare situationsin the real world.
One-road testing for the ADS under test can be augmented
by existing approaches [6]–[18] of virtual testing in computersimulations [18], [19] (in short as simulation-based testing),e.g., generating critical test scenarios in which the autonomousvehicle under test fails (e.g., the vehicle collides with ob-stacles). Considering that the test scenario space is complexand multidimensional, evolutionary search techniques [6]–[14]are applied to explore this test scenario space. In particular,these evolutionary search techniques aim to identify criticaltest scenarios that indicate complex driving conditions underwhich the ADS’ behaviors violate speciﬁc requirements, e.g.,safety [6], [7], [10] and compliance to trafﬁc regulations suchas lane keeping [9] and adhering to trafﬁc light [8].
However, these existing simulation-based testing approaches
do not consider combinations of requirements violations,which are highly important for two main reasons. First,satisfying all the requirements may not be possible for anADS in practice, as unexpected events may happen in highlyopen and dynamic environments, e.g., intrusion of a hiddentrafﬁc participant or weather disturbances [20]. In responseto these unexpected events, the control software of the ADShas to make trade-offs among requirements, likely resultingin one or more requirements being violated. Second, differentcombinations of requirements violations can expose differenttypes of failures. For example, the type of failure in whichthe autonomous vehicle collides while running a red lightis different from the one in which the autonomous vehiclecollides while violating the lane keeping, as the differentcombinations of requirements violations may provide differentinsights about the cause of the collisions.
Generating scenarios that expose different combinations of
requirements violations is a challenging problem. One ideais to enumerate all possible combinations of requirementsviolations as the objective functions in the evolutionary search,

in order to identify critical test scenarios that expose dif-
ferent combinations of requirements violations. However, asthe number of the requirements increases, the number ofcombinations of requirements violations grows exponentially;thus, testing all of them could be impossible under limitedtime and resources.
To address the preceding challenge, our work is based on
an insight consisting of two aspects. First, the search shouldﬁrst focus on combinations of requirements violations withhigher criticality, i.e., including more violated requirements
with higher importance, as these combinations may lead tomore serious accidents for the ADS under test. Second, somecombinations of requirements violations are impossible tooccur for the ADS in reality, and the search should not focuson them, in order to avoid wasting the search time.
Based on our insight, in this paper, we propose EMOOD,
a search-based testing approach to generating diverse testscenarios that effectively expose different combinations ofrequirements violations in the ADS testing. Similar to existingwork [6], [7], [10], we cast the problem of exposing differentcombinations of requirements violations into a search-basedtest-scenario generation problem. For EMOOD, we introduce
the notion of requirements violation pattern (also referred to
as pattern in the rest of the paper), i.e., a speciﬁc combinationof requirements violations that the ADS under test can exhibitas the objective functions to search for. The notion of re-quirements violation pattern facilitates the determination of theADS behaviors’ violations of requirements. EMOOD conducts
a type of dynamic evolutionary search, i.e., Evolutionary
Many-Objective Optimization (EMOO), whose objectives aredetermined by Dynamic Prioritization (DP) that prioritizes thepatterns in terms of criticality and likelihood to occur.
In particular, EMOOD starts with the initial ranking (of
all the patterns) built statically based on the criticality of
each requirement, and iteratively runs the heuristic dynamicprioritization algorithm (DP) to adjust the ranking additionallybased on the dynamically estimated likelihood of occurrence
of patterns: the more similar an unexposed violation patternwith exposed patterns is, the more likely the pattern can occur.
This paper makes the following main contributions:
•The notion of requirements violation pattern for character-
izing different combinations of requirements violations.
•An effective approach for generating test scenarios toexpose diverse requirements violation patterns, namely,EMOOD, which iteratively applies Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization (EMOO) whose objective functionsare selected by dynamic prioritization (DP).
•An initial prioritization technique (IP) for ranking patternsbased on their criticality, i.e., the importance and numberof violated requirements included in a pattern.
•A heuristic technique in DP for prioritizing patterns todynamically rank them based on their criticality and like-lihood of occurrence.
•Evaluation results for showing that EMOOD can discover
diverse patterns with higher criticality, and given the sametesting budget, it is more effective than baseline approachesthat do not prioritize the patterns during the search.

OTIV A TION
Fig. 1(a) shows the decision process of an autonomous
driving system (ADS), as reported in previous work [4]: theADS is operating in a complex environment (including trafﬁcparticipants). The autonomous vehicle running the ADS iscalled ego vehicle. The environment is perceived by sensors
(e.g., camera, Lidar, and radar for object detection and local-ization). The ADS requirements are determined by differentstakeholders, such as the passengers (e.g., comfortableness)and the authorities (e.g., safety standards [21]). Then, the ADSmakes optimal decisions based on the observed situation andcontrols the vehicle through actuators, e.g., accelerating anddirection changing. Both sensor inputs and actuator outputs aresequences of timestamped values. The ADS runs iteratively atregular time steps. At every time step, the ADS decides theoptimal trajectory to be followed by minimizing cost functionsrelated to different requirements to achieve (requirementsviolations are penalized in the cost function). In such a process,the ADS needs to make trade-offs among the requirements.The ﬁnal output is the trajectory with the least overall cost(the red line in Fig. 1(b)).
As a case study, we use an ADS with an optimization-
based path planner (provided by our industry partner) calledADS
PP, which repeatedly uses a weighted cost function
that considers various requirements to select the least costlypath.ADS
PP can run in a simulator, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
Besides the navigation mission, i.e., moving from an initialposition to the destination, ADS
PP considers four categories
of requirements during the planning process as follows:
•Stability (R 1): the ADS should assure the stable control
and avoid dangerous actions for the vehicle [22]. R1.1: the
ADS should avoid impossible steering angles.
•Safety (R 2): the ADS should avoid collision with moving
or static objects along the path [22]. R2.1: the ADS should
keep a safe distance from other objects.
•Compliance (R 3): the ADS should respect the trafﬁc
regulations enforced by law in a geographical area [22].R
3.1: the velocity of the vehicle should be less than the
speed limit; R3.2: the vehicle should not run the red light;
R3.3: the vehicle should stay in the correct lane.
•Comfortableness (R 4): the planned trajectory should be
comfortable for the passenger [23]. R4.1: the vehicle’s
velocity should not change too much; R4.2: the vehicle’s
acceleration should not change too much.
During the operation, ADS PP is required to respond to the
uncertain and dynamic environment, and adjust the trajectoryfor the ego vehicle to follow. For example, Fig. 1(b) shows a
type of scenario in which the ego vehicle plans to turn right
into lane-1 at the intersection, while vehicle-a is crossing the
intersection from left to right. However, there are differentversions of this scenario that can lead to different behaviorsofADS
PP, and different satisfaction/violation of the require-
ments; we here consider two examples, i.e., Scenario-A and

Scenario-B.I nScenario-A, vehicle-a proceeds at high speed,
and the ego vehicle orders an emergency braking to bring
the vehicle to a halt; however, the ego vehicle cannot stop in
time and collides with vehicle-a (i.e., violation of requirement
R2). In Scenario-B, instead, the vehicle-a proceeds slightly
slower than in Scenario-A, and, in this case, the ego vehicle
accelerates and tries to cut into the lane before vehicle-a. This
action plan requires a higher speed from the ego vehicle, to the
point to exceed the speed limit; still, the ego vehicle cannot
cut into the lane quickly enough, and collides with vehicle-
a(i.e., it violates both R2andR3). Although the ego vehicle
collides in both scenarios, Scenario-B may be more interesting
for debugging, because the occurrence of collision could be
related to the violation of the speed limit requirement, whichcan provide a different insight about the cause of the collision.For example, if the ego vehicle decelerates to wait for vehicle-
ato pass, the collision may not happen in Scenario-B.
Testing how ADS
PP handles the requirements requires
ﬁnding critical scenarios in which one or more requirementsare violated; such type of testing is particularly challenging.Furthermore, with the increase of the number of requirements,there could be different requirements violation combinations.We need approaches that can (1) ﬁnd critical test scenariosforADS
PP in which one or more requirements are violated;
(2) expose all possible combinations of requirements viola-tions for ADS
PP, if these combinations can occur in reality.
III. F ORMALIZA TION AND PROBLEM STA TEMENT
We here formalize an ADS and its environment by consid-
ering the input and conﬁguration variables of ADS PP.
A. Autonomous Driving System
At any time instant k, the state of an object is a tuple of three
elements, i.e., sk=(pk,vk,ak). The vector pk=(x,y)is the
geometric center of the position of the object, while vkandak
are its velocity and acceleration. The state of the ego vehicleiss

k. We deﬁne Oas the set of objects interacting with the
ego vehicle, e.g., pedestrians, other vehicles; their state can be
described as so
k,witho∈O . The trajectory of the ego vehicle
is a sequence of the vehicle’s states T=[se
0,..., se
T], where
the time interval between two consecutive states is ﬁxed as τ,
andTis the simulation time duration.

for the ego vehicle to follow. A scenario Sce describes the
environment in which the ego vehicle is operating, including
(i) a map of the road structure; (ii) information of trafﬁcregulations (e.g., location of trafﬁc lights); (iii) dynamic be-haviors of objects ([ s

(vi) duration of the simulation T. We assume that the driving
model of other vehicles is ﬁxed and described by standard
kinematic equations.
The system under test is the ADS of the ego vehicle. For
simplicity, we view it as a function that, given a scenario Sce,
produces the trajectory of the ego vehicle, i.e., T=ADS(Sce).
B. Requirements Violation Evaluation
It is challenging to verify the absolute violation/satisfaction
(false/true) of requirements directly from the behaviors of theADS operating in complex and changing environments [24].In previous work [9], [10], various quantiﬁable metrics areprovided to indicate the dangerous behaviors of the ADS.However, the previous work does not show how these metricsreﬂect requirements violation/satisfaction results.
To ﬁll this gap, we provide a systematic way to design
the quantiﬁable metrics (QMs) for requirements and theirmapping functions to the requirements evaluation results.Given a requirements set R={R
1,...,R n}for the ADS
to consider during the decision process, we introduce Xias
the QM for each requirement Ri.Xiis deﬁned as a function of
the trajectory of the ego vehicle and the running scenario, i.e.,X
i=hi(T,Sce). To evaluate the violation of requirement Ri,
we compare Xiwith the threshold gispeciﬁed in the deﬁnition
ofRi; in this way, we get the evaluation result yi=f(Xi,Ri),
ranging over the Boolean domain Di. We set up three types of
evaluation functions according to the relationship between theQM and the threshold in the requirement to indicate whethera requirement is violated (y
i=1) or satisﬁed (y i=0). Fig. 2
shows the three Boolean evaluation functions, in which lbi,
ubi, andgiare the lower bound, upper bound, and threshold
ofXi, as speciﬁed in the requirements. The function flt(Xi)
describes the LESS THAN relationship. A requirement Riis
satisﬁed if Xi≤gi; otherwise, the requirement is violated
andyi=1 . Similarly, fmt(Xi)describes the MORE THAN
relationship (g i≤X i), andfcl(Xi)describes the AS CLOSE
AS POSSIBLE relationship (g i−σi≤X i≤gi+σi). Note that
there can be other evaluation techniques to describe require-ments satisfaction, such as fuzzy membership functions [25].All the QMs of the requirements described in Section II canbe assessed from our project website [26].
281Example 1. Requirement R2.1 states that the ego vehicle
should keep safe distance from other objects. QM X2.1=
min
k∈T,o∈O(/bardblpe
k−pok/bardbl)is the minimum Euclidean distance
between the ego vehicle and other objects including vehicles,
pedestrians, etc. X2.1should be MORE THAN the minimum

uation function is formulated with function fmtas follows:

ternVi=[y1,...,y n]∈Dis a vector, representing a distinct
combination of requirements violation for the behavior of theADS under test. Given the violation pattern V
i, the initial re-
quirements set Rcan be split into two subsets of requirements,
i.e., the set of satisﬁed requirements Ri
S={Rk|Vi[k]=0}
and the set of violated requirements RiV={Rk|Vi[k]=1}.
For example, Vi=[ 1,1,0,0,0,0,0]represents a require-
ments violation pattern with the evaluation of seven require-
ments, where the ﬁrst two are violated, and the other ﬁveare satisﬁed. The set of all possible requirements violationpatterns is deﬁned as V={V
0,...,V m−1}, where mis the
total number of patterns in V.F o rADS PP, we evaluate the
requirements reported in Section II, and there are 27= 128
requirements violation patterns in V.
C. Problem Statement
For the ADS, the testing approach Ttargeting requirements
violations can be deﬁned as a function /angbracketleftS,Vf/angbracketright=T(ADS,R),
whereSis a set of critical test scenarios exposed by TandVf
is the set of requirements violation patterns that are coveredbyS(V
f⊆V ). It is challenging for testers to explore the
space of all possible scenarios to expose all the patterns withlimited time or computing resources. Another challenge is thatsome patterns may not be achievable, and the testers shouldavoid wasting time searching for these patterns. In summary,the general problem that we aim to solve is as follows:
Given the ADS as the system under test, along with a set
of requirements Rthat should be achieved by the system,
design a testing approach Ttargeting requirements violations,
which can effectively ﬁnd test scenarios to expose differentrequirements violation patterns of high importance.

Fig. 3: Overview of the proposed approach (EMOOD)
by DP . In particular, DP aims to give preferences to thosepatterns with higher criticality and likelihood to occur. Thecombination of EMOO, IP , and DP makes it possible for ourapproach to explore different test scenarios, thereby exposingmore types of requirements violation patterns.
More speciﬁcally, the approach works as follows. In the
beginning, in IP , given the ADS requirements and their im-portance, we rank the requirements violation patterns basedon their criticality (see Section IV-B). The criticality ranking
list of all patterns after IP is V
c. Then, test generation starts by
employing an iterative evolutionary process. At each iteration,
the ﬁtness functions of the searching process (i.e., EMOO) aredeﬁned based on the targeted pattern (see Section IV-C); inthe ﬁrst iteration, the targeted pattern is V
c[0]. The population
speciﬁes values for the variables of an abstract test scenario
(i.e., a scenario in which some ﬁelds are parameterized). Itis instantiated by these values to produce a concrete test
scenario Sce that is executed with the ADS simulator. The
ﬁtness scores Xof the behaviors of ADS Tin each test
scenario are computed by running the ADS simulator anddoing requirements violation evaluation.
After the execution of EMOO, we perform the dynamic
prioritization (see Section IV-D). In particular, the patternlikelihood prioritization (see Alg. 1) is used to sort all possiblerequirements violation patterns based on their likelihood tooccur. Such likelihood is estimated by considering the relationbetween exposed and unexposed patterns. The occurrencelikelihood ranking of patterns V
lis merged with the criticality
rankingVcto update the list of patterns to search for Vt,s oa s
to identify the most critical patterns that are likely to occur.The ﬁrst element V
t[0]of the merged list is used, in the next
iteration, as the pattern targeted by EMOO.
Using DP , the approach continually changes its ﬁtness
functions round by round, until the given testing time orresource budget exhausts. The whole process is described inSection IV-E in detail. The output is a set of test scenarios thatfacilitate reproducing the wrong behaviors of the ADS and theset of requirements violation patterns that have been identiﬁedduring the testing.
B. Initial Prioritization (IP)
As it is time-consuming and economically expensive to test
whether each pattern in the set Vis possible to occur, we
need to determine their order of being searched for. In the
282beginning, we prioritize the patterns based on their criticality,
which is deﬁned based on the following two ranking rules:
•P 1: a pattern Viis ranked higher than another pattern Vjif
the highest importance level of the violated requirements
inViis higher than that in Vj.
•P 2: a pattern Viis ranked higher than another pattern Vj
ifVihas more violated requirements in importance level
pthanVj, whileVihas the same number of violated
requirements in importance level lasVjfor∀p<l< =q
whereqis the maximum importance level.
RuleP1is designed based on the predeﬁned importance
levels among different categories of requirements in ADS
behaviors as deﬁned in previous work [22] (e.g., the safetyrequirement’s importance level is higher than that of thecompliance requirement). For the functionality of the sys-tem, certain requirement R
imay be split into a set of
sub-requirements {Ri.1,...,R i.M i}to be achieved, where Mi
is the number of sub-requirements (e.g., R3is instantiated
into{R3.1,R3.2,R3.3}). For simplicity, we assign the same
importance level to the sub-requirements belonging to thesame category, as done in ADS
PP provided by our industry
partner. For ADS PP, the requirements listed in Section II
rank from the highest to the lowest one, i.e., R1/followsR2/follows
R3{R3.1,R3.2,R3.3}/followsR 4{R4.1,R4.2}. Thus, according to
P1,Viis ranked higher than (/follows P1)Vjif∃Rk∈Ri
V,∀Rk/prime∈
Rj
V:Rk/followsRk/prime.
Assume that importance level pis the highest level where
patternsViandVjdiffer in terms of the number of violated
requirements in the same level. Rule P2is designed based
on the assumption that in the critical scenarios in which the
trajectory generated by the ADS violates a larger number ofrequirements in importance level p, the wrong decision logic
of the control software is more likely to be exposed.
We apply these two ranking rules, assuming that P
1takes
precedence over P2, as suggested by our industry partner.
Based on P1andP2, to compare the criticality of patterns
ViandVjis to compare the number of violated requirements
level by level from the highest to the lowest importance levels.Therefore, the set of all requirements violation patterns Vcan
be transformed into a sorted list of patterns V
c=P{1,2}(V),
ranging from the most to the least critical patterns; we namethe list criticality ranking. Note that V
cis a partial order, and
some patterns could have the same ranking. The ﬁrst elementV
c[0]inVis a unit vector where all the requirements are
violated, while the last element Vc[m−1]is the zero vector
indicating that all requirements are satisﬁed.
C. Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization (EMOO)
As it is difﬁcult to generate critical test scenarios in which
one or more requirements are violated [27], we use a search-
based testing (SBT) approach, which has been shown to bevery effective for ADS testing [6], [9], [12]. We cast theproblem of generating ADS critical test scenarios for a speciﬁcrequirements violation pattern as a many-objective optimiza-tion problem [28], where the ﬁtness functions are deﬁned asthe indicators for requirements satisfaction/violation.

Fig. 4: The relationship of requirements violation patterns
For the many-objective optimization algorithm, we use the
Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm version 3 (NSGA-III) [29], as it is good in solving problems with many ob-jectives (four or more) [30] and so is suitable for our case.In our work, NSGA-III generates a number of ADS criticaltest scenarios by maximizing or minimizing the indicators thatcharacterize the violation or satisfaction of the requirements(i.e., QMs X
iintroduced in Section III-B). Here, we discuss
how we apply NSGA-III to our case.
Individuals. As explained in Section III-A, test scenarios de-
scribe the characteristics of the operating environment and the
initial state of the ego vehicle. In EMOO, we aim at generatingtest scenarios. However, searching over all the possible sce-narios is not feasible. Hence, we follow a pragmatic approachalso adopted by other work [31], [32]. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁneanabstract scenario that speciﬁes some ﬁxed characteristics,
such as the road structure and the other trafﬁc participants; inthe abstract scenario, some characteristics (e.g., initial positionand acceleration of a vehicle) are parameterized with variablesdeﬁned over some domains. In the search, an individual is anassignment to these variables. Given an individual, a concrete
test scenario can be derived by instantiating the abstract
scenario with the values assigned to the variables in theindividual.
Fitness Functions. For a targeted requirements violation
patternV
i∈V , there is a corresponding set of quantitative
ﬁtness functions F={F1,...,F n}, whose values indicate the
QMs of the requirements. Since the requirements evaluation
is Boolean as shown in Fig. 2, Viis an n-dimensional vector
of{0,1}.F o rVi[k]=0, the satisfaction of the Rkshould be
guaranteed (R k∈Ri
S), while for Vi[k]=1 ,Rkis expected
to be violated (R k∈RiV). Based on the set of satisﬁed
and violated requirements RiSandRiV, the set of ﬁtness
functions Fis also split into Fi

D. Dynamic Prioritization (DP)
In this phase, we select a pattern to be used as the target for
the next search round of EMOO. The rationale is that we want
to select a critical pattern that can occur in reality. Thus, DPﬁrst computes a ranking of patterns based on their likelihoodof occurrence. Then, DP merges this ranking with the rankingbased on the criticality V
c.
283Algorithm 1: Pattern Likelihood Prioritization
Input:Vt: patterns that have not been found;
Ved: patterns that have been searched for.
Output: Vl: likelihood rankings for patterns

7 k←GetClass (Vi);
8 r(Vj)+ =γk/prime−k·r(Vi)
9Vl←sort(Vl,r(Vl));

1) Likelihood Prioritization: The intuition of occurrence
likelihood ranking for requirements violation patterns is that if
a speciﬁc requirements violation pattern has been found, there
is a high likelihood to expose similar/related violation patternsthat are less critical than the found pattern. To prioritize thepatterns, we ﬁrst deﬁne the relationship between differentpatterns to estimate the likelihood of their occurrence.
Deﬁnition 2. (Requirement Violation Pattern Relationship)
Given two requirements violation patterns V
k=[y1,...,y n]
andVk/prime=[y/prime
1,...,y/prime
n],i f∃i∈{1,...,n}:yi=1∧y/prime
i=
0∧(∀j∈{1,...,n}\{i}:yj=y/prime
j), then pattern Vkis the
predecessor of pattern Vk/prime, andVk/primeis the successor ofVk.
As shown in Fig. 4, we construct a graph to describe the
relationship between different requirements violation patterns
based on Def. 2. The relationship between two patterns isdescribed with an arrow (→), where the left-hand side of thearrow indicates the direct predecessor and the right-hand sideof the arrow indicates the successor. Note that a requirementsviolation pattern V
icould have multiple direct predecessors,
as well as multiple successors. Therefore, the set of patternsVis a partially ordered set according to the relationship. The
pattern with all requirements violated ( [1,1,...,1,1]), has no
predecessors, while the pattern with no requirements violated([0,0,...,0,0]) has no successors. All the patterns can be
classiﬁed into n+1 classes (C
0,...,Cn) based on the number
of violated requirements.
Alg. 1 shows the prioritization based on likelihood that
exploits the pattern relationship introduced in Def. 2. First,we initialize a reward function for each pattern V
iasr(Vi)
(Line 1), indicating the likelihood that the pattern occurs inreality. The higher the reward is, the higher the likelihood ofthe pattern is to be found. Given the list V
tof patterns that
have not been found so far, and the list Vedof patterns that
have been treated as ﬁtness functions to search for, the rewardfor each requirement violation pattern is initialized as follows:
r(Vi)=⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩r+
0,V i∈V\V t
r−
0,V i∈V ed∩V t
0,Vt\V ed(1)
For requirements violation patterns that have been found
(V\V t), we assign a positive reward r+
0, and for patterns thathave been searched but not found (i.e., Ved∩V t), we deﬁne a
constant penalty as r−
0. The remaining patterns are those that
need to be searched for (i.e., Vt\V ed), and their reward is
initialized as 0; we identify them as Vl(Line 2). The rewards
of patterns in Vlare updated as described as follows.
To calculate the rewards of patterns Vlthat we need to
search for, we consider the rewards of their predecessors. Theidea is that if a predecessor V
iof a requirements violation
patternVjhas been previously found (V i∈V\V t), it is
likely that Vjmay occur. On the other hand, if Vihas been
searched for but not found (V i∈V ed∩V t), the likelihood
that pattern Vjcan be found is low. Based on these heuristic
rules, the algorithm works as follows. Given a pattern Vjthat
has not been searched for and not been found (Line 3), thealgorithm iterates over the other patterns V
iinitialized with
non-zero rewards (Line 5); for those that are predecessors ofV
j(Line 6), it updates the reward of Vjwith reward r(Vi)
discounted based on the distance between ViandVj(Line 8).
Note that γ∈(0,1), and so the factor γk/prime−kdecreases as
the distance increases. Finally, it prioritizes the sequence Vl
of requirements violation patterns to search for, based on thecomputed rewards ranging from the highest to the lowest(Line 9), as the higher the reward, the higher the likelihoodthat this pattern is exposed in the next round. We call V
las
(estimated) likelihood ranking.
2) Merging Criticality and Likelihood Rankings: Then, we
merge the rankings of requirements violation patterns in Vland
Vcwith a weighted sum, following a classical approach used in
multi-criteria decision-making [33]. The criticality ranking Vc
indicates the importance of the patterns, while the likelihood
rankingVlindicates the likelihood of the occurrence of each
pattern. By combining these two ranking algorithms, we canselect (for the next round of EMOO) the patterns that areboth critical and likely to be found. The weights for these twolists are deﬁned as a vector [w
c,wl], and the ﬁnal rank of a
patternViis determined by/summationtext
j∈{c,l}wj·rank(Vj(Vi)), where
rank(Vj(Vi))is the function to retrieve the rank of ViinVj.
The merged ranking substitutes Vt.
E. Details of EMOOD
We here describe the details of our EMOOD approach (as
shown in Fig. 3), i.e., how to combine the initial prioritization(IP , Section IV-B), the evolutionary many-objective optimiza-tion (EMOO, Section IV-C), and the dynamic prioritization(DP , Section IV-D) during the testing process. Alg. 2 showsthe algorithm of EMOOD, aiming at generating test scenarios
that expose different requirements violation patterns.
EMOOD receives a set Vof requirements violation patterns to
search for, the total number Mof generations, and the budget
Gof generations in each search round. The output of EMOOD
is a setSof test scenarios and requirements violation patterns
V
fthat have been found.
Initially, the approach applies initial prioritization (see
Section IV-B) to rank the patterns by criticality (Line 1),obtaining ranking V
c. The list of patterns to search for Vt
is initialized with Vc(Line 2). Then, at each iteration, EMOO
284Algorithm 2: EMOOD

starts with a randomly selected population set P(Line 5), and
a requirement violation pattern to search for that deﬁnes the
ﬁtness functions (Line 6): the pattern is the ﬁrst element ofthe list of unfound patterns V
t. EMOO performs a number
gof generations using NSGA-III [29] (Line 7) until the
stopcondition is reached: either the total number Gof
generations is reached or the targeted pattern has been found.The number gof used generations is subtracted from the total
budgetMof generations (Line 8). The pattern that has been
searched for is stored in set V
ed(Line 10). Then, Vtis updated
by removing the patterns that have been found (the targetedone and/or also other patterns) according to the requirementsviolation evaluations of all solutions generated during search(Line 11). Note that some of the patterns, despite having beensearched for, may not be discovered within their dedicatedsearch round, either because they are too difﬁcult to discoveror they are not achievable at all.
Finally, EMOOD applies dynamic prioritization: it ﬁrst uses
Alg. 1 to get the likelihood ranking V
lof the patterns
(Line 12); then, it merges the rankings VtandVlwith a
weighted sum (Line 13). EMOOD can be stopped when the total
numberMof generations is reached or all patterns have been
found, i.e., Vt/negationslash=∅(Line 4). Note that, in the ADS testing, the
most time-consuming part of the search is running simulationsto compute ﬁtness functions. EMOOD does not increase the
number of simulations compared to EMOO with the originalNSGA-III.

Fig. 5: Two abstract trafﬁc scenarios for the experiments
A. Experimental Design and Settings
1) Trafﬁc Scenarios: We consider two abstract trafﬁc sce-
narios (where left-hand trafﬁc is assumed), as shown in Table I.
Each abstract trafﬁc scenario deﬁnes shared characteristics ofthe generated test scenarios (e.g., road map, speed limit), andspeciﬁc characteristics (e.g., position, speed, acceleration ofthe ego vehicle and other vehicles, duration of the trafﬁc light)that are left as search variables for EMOO. The ego vehiclewithADS
PP follows the requirements reported in Section II.
The two abstract trafﬁc scenarios identify two different
driving situations that will possibly lead to different behav-iors ofADS
PP, and thus patterns of potential requirements
violations. To ensure that the simulations start from a validand meaningful state, we have the following two constraintson the initial state of the simulation (also used for other ADSsin previous work [8]): (1) there is a safe distance between theego vehicle and other vehicles when all the vehicles start, and(2) the ego vehicle is far from the trafﬁc light such that it hassufﬁcient time to react.
Overtake (S
O):As shown in Fig. 5(a), the ego vehicle is
proceeding on lane-2, encounters vehicle-a proceeding slowly,
and tries to overtake it. Meanwhile, vehicle-b is coming from
behind the ego vehicle on the passing lane lane-1. Moreover,
vehicle-c is proceeding in the opposite direction on a different
lane. InSO, there are 15 search variables, including the initial
states (i.e., position, velocity, and acceleration) of the ego
vehicle, vehicle-a, vehicle-b, and vehicle-c, respectively, and
the location and duration of the trafﬁc light. Table II reportsthe search space for the trafﬁc scenario S
O.
Turn Right (S T):As shown in Fig. 5(b), the ego vehicle turns
right at the intersection. Meanwhile, vehicle-a is crossing from
left, vehicle-b is crossing from right, and vehicle-c is waiting
at the intersection. As shown in Table II, there are 12 searchvariables: the initial states of the ego vehicle and the otherthree vehicles, respectively, and the duration of the trafﬁc light.

2) Baseline Approaches: To the best of our knowledge,
at the moment of writing, there do not exist any automated
testing approaches targeting requirements violation patterns.We compare EMOOD with three approaches, including the
random test generation algorithm (the baseline of comparisontypically adopted in SBSE research [34]) and two variants ofEMOOD, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach interms of pattern detection and coverage.
•Random: it randomly generates values for variables in thesearch space of S
OandSTto create test scenarios and
checks which patterns are discovered.
•EMOO: application of EMOO using ﬁtness functions target-ing pattern V
c[0](i.e., all requirements violated). Fitness
functions are never changed over the search process. Notethat, since V
c[0]is the most critical pattern and the ancestor
of all the patterns, other patterns can be discovered whiletrying to cover it.
•EMOO-IP: the combination of initial prioritization withupdated objective functions but without the dynamic prior-itization. In this case, each EMOO execution uses the mostcritical pattern (in V
c) that has not been searched so far.
3) Conﬁgurations and Implementations: We implement the
baselines and our approach in Python, and use jMetalPy [35]as the search framework. For Random, we use the implemen-
tation of random search in jMetalPy [35]. For the settings ofthe EMOO algorithm, we adopt NSGA-III [29]. The settingsfor NSGA-III are the default ones in jMetalPy: parent selec-tion with tournament selection [36], SBX crossover operator,polynomial mutation operator, crossover rate of 100%, andmutation rate equal to the reciprocal of the number of searchvariables. For each EMOO-based algorithm, the size of thepopulation is 50. The weights used when merging V
candVl
are[wc,wl]=[ 1,1].
Each approach (EMOOD and the baselines) is used to test
the ADS for some generations. As the termination conditionGforEMOO, EMOO-IP, and EMOOD, we set 100 generations
for the ﬁrst round and 50 generations for the subsequentrounds. As global budget M, we set a total number of
400 generations across all the rounds. Hence, totally we canevaluate50×400=20000 scenarios. For Random, in order to
assure a fair comparison, we set 20000 ﬁtness evaluations as
the termination condition. To take into account the randomeffect during the search, we repeat each algorithm ten times.0 100 200 300 400

B. Results and Analysis
We next answer the two research questions and then provide
qualitative analysis.
1) Evaluation on Pattern Detection (RQ1): We investigate
the discovered requirements violation patterns by the different
approaches and how the patterns are related. Fig. 6 showsthe average number of the patterns discovered during theallocated generations. The detailed comparisons of the patternsdiscovered during the search process are shown in Fig. 7.
As shown in Fig. 6, we can ﬁnd EMOOD’s average number
of discovered patterns to be 30.7 and 28.8 in S
OandST,
respectively, outperforming the three baseline approaches, i.e.,Random, EMOO, and EMOO-IP. For the ﬁrst two baseline
approaches Random andEMOO, there is a large increase in
the number of patterns discovered within the 50th generation,while the speed to ﬁnd new patterns decreases after the 100thgeneration. The reason is that both EMOO-IP andEMOOD
could change the objective functions to search for, leadingto the discovery of new patterns during the search process.Compared with the third baseline approach EMOO-IP, EMOOD
adjusts the sequence of the targeting pattern to search forby also considering the likelihood to occur, thus excludingpatterns that cannot occur and saving the search time. Hence,inS
Oand inST,EMOOD could ﬁnd, respectively, 4.7 and 3.2
patterns more than EMOO-IP.
We also observe that Random performs better in STthan
inSO,a sSThas a smaller search space. Thus, the gaps in the

∗In the simulator, ADS PP is terminated once collisions are detected.
average number of the discovered patterns between the four
approaches are smaller in STthanSO.
We next perform a statistical test on the ﬁnal results of the
approaches across the ten runs. Following a guideline [37],we use the Wilcoxon signed rank test [38] and the V argha-Delaney’s ˆA
12effect size [39]. Table III reports the results
of the statistical test obtained when comparing the number ofthe patterns discovered by Random, EMOO, EMOO-IP, and
EMOOD forS
OandST. As shown in the table, the p-values
of the results between EMOOD and the baseline approaches
are all lower than 0.05, and the ˆA12statistics show a large
effect size (close or equal to 1). Hence, the number of thepatterns discovered by EMOOD is signiﬁcantly higher than
those discovered by the baseline approaches; moreover, wealso notice that each technique of the approach (i.e., IP , DP ,and EMOO) signiﬁcantly improves over the approach withoutthat technique.
Moreover, we want to know whether EMOOD’s higher ef-
fectiveness is due to its capability to discover more patterns(which do not necessarily subsume patterns discovered bythe baseline approaches) or its capability to subsume all thepatterns discovered by the baseline approaches plus some otherpatterns. We compare all the discovered patterns in the tenruns for the four approaches, as shown in Fig. 7. We ﬁnd that,across ten runs, EMOOD could aggregately discover 42 and
41 patterns in S
OandST, respectively. In addition, EMOOD
could discover 6 and 5 extra patterns (not discovered by anybaseline approach), accounting for 14% and 11.9% of the totalnumber of discovered patterns in S
OandST, respectively.
Thus, EMOOD’s higher effectiveness lies in its capability to
discover extra patterns compared with the baseline approaches.
Finally, to check whether the effectiveness of EMOOD comes
at the cost of computation time, we compare the whole execu-tion time of EMOOD and the baseline approaches. Considering
that the simulation time of each test scenario could be large,we parallelize the simulation of the generated test scenarios
Fig. 8: RQ2–The sum of criticality of discovered patterns
using 30 threads. Table IV reports, for each approach, the timecost of the test simulations, the computation time (excludingthe simulation time during ﬁtness evaluation), and the totaltime cost. ADS
PP will be terminated in the simulation after
violating some requirements, especially for Safety(R2.1),i f
the ego vehicle’s behaviors are abnormal. We observe thatthe time costs of EMOO, EMOO-IP, and EMOOD are less
thanRandom, because these three approaches could generate
more scenarios with violations of R
2.1, and these scenarios
are terminated earlier. Moreover, we observe that the mostexpensive part of the approaches is due to the simulations.
Answer to RQ1: Each phase (EMOO, IP , and DP) ofEMOOD provides a signiﬁcant contribution in discovering
requirements violation patterns. Indeed, the approaches ofRandom, EMOO, EMOO-IP, and EMOOD are in the order
of increasing effectiveness, indicating that the EMOO,IP , and DP techniques all provide a relevant contributiontoEMOOD’s overall effectiveness. Additionally, EMOOD’s
effectiveness does not come at the cost of time.
2) Evaluation on Criticality (RQ2): We analyze the crit-
icality of requirements violation patterns discovered by eachapproach; to this aim, we propose a metric for assessing thecriticality. As explained in Section IV-B, the initial rankingV
cranks the patterns based on their criticality. Therefore,
we quantify the criticality of each pattern by its rank in Vc,
i.e.,K(Vi)=1−rank (Vc(Vi))
|Vc|. The sum of the criticality of
discovered patterns can be calculated as/summationtext
Vi∈VfK(Vi). Fig. 8
shows the results for the sum of the criticality of discoveredpatterns. We ﬁnd that EMOOD achieves the highest sum for
the criticality of discovered patterns, being 8.75 and 9.23 onaverage for S
OandST, respectively.
We also compare the results in Fig. 8, for each pair of
approaches for SOandST, using the same statistical tests
used in RQ1. We report the results online [26] due to spacelimit. Using signiﬁcance level α=0.01, we observe that EMOOD
is always signiﬁcantly better than the baseline approaches;EMOO-IP is always better than Random, and better than
EMOO inS
O;EMOO is better than Random inSO;i nt h e
other cases, there is no signiﬁcant difference.

age number of the patterns discovered by each approach in
each scenario by ranks in Vc. Compared with the baseline
approaches, EMOOD identiﬁes more patterns with higher ranks
(i.e., ranks from 1 to 32), while the gap decreases for thepatterns with lower ranks (i.e., ranks from 97 to 128). Inmore complex scenarios such as S
O, the gaps between the
number of discovered patterns are more obvious betweendifferent approaches because complex scenarios might havemore challenging states that are difﬁcult to reach. We also ﬁndthat the results of violation criticality are consistent with theresults of pattern detection in RQ1. In simpler scenarios such
asS
T, the difference between the baseline approaches and
EMOOD is lower, showing that EMOOD is particularly useful in
ﬁnding critical patterns in large search spaces.
Answer to RQ2: Random testing is limited in ﬁndingcritical requirements violation patterns in complex sce-narios, while as the combination of EMOO, IP , and DP ,EMOOD is more effective than the baseline approaches.
3) Requirements Violation Pattern Analysis: We next an-
alyze a concrete test scenario to better understand what thegenerated critical test scenarios look like and what are thebehaviors and requirements evaluation results of the egovehicle with ADS
PP in this scenario.
We next consider some results found by EMOOD inST.A s
shown in Fig. 7(b), EMOOD discovers 5 patterns not discovered
by the baseline approaches; Fig. 9 reports the scenario expos-ing the most critical one among these patterns. In this concretescenario, the behavior of the ego vehicle violates the majorityof the requirements, i.e., V=[ 1,1,1,0,0,0,1], indicating the
violation of {R
1.1,R2.1,R3.1,R4.2}. This pattern also ranksﬁrst in all of the discovered patterns in ST. Fig. 9(a) shows the
start of the scenario in which the ego vehicle is acceleratingand moving into lane-3 to turn right at the intersection quickly.
In this process, the speed of the ego vehicle reaches 16.82m/s ,
exceeding the speed limit (16. 67m/s ) a little, as shown in
Fig. 9(a). Reacting to the violation of the speed limit, the ego
vehicle reduces the speed when it reaches the intersection and
encounters vehicle-a crossing from left to right in the lane-
1at the moment shown in Fig. 9(b). To avoid the potential
collision with vehicle-a, the ego vehicle decelerates a lot and
turns its direction to right. However, this dangerous actioncauses its curvature rate to reach 0.4, which exceeds the limitofK
limit=0.2. Fig. 9(c) shows the moment in which the
ego vehicle reaches the maximal curvature rate at the speed of
0.56m/s , while there is another vehicle-b crossing from right
to left. Finally, the ego vehicle fails to ﬁgure out a feasible
trajectory and ends with a collision with vehicle-b as shown
in Fig. 9(d). The change rate of acceleration of this trajectoryis 0.39, exceeding the threshold r
a=0.3.
We next show how the patterns discovered by EMOOD are
useful in an industrial setting, i.e., whether they provide theengineers of our industrial partner useful insights regardingthe faults of ADS
PP. Considering the previous example, we
ﬁnd that, at the start of the scenario, the ego vehicle ﬁrst
accelerates to cross the intersection, and then decelerates whenencountering with vehicle-a. However, it is too late for the
ego vehicle to change its direction and brake. We estimate
that this series of requirements violations in this scenario canbe due to that the ego vehicle is not sensitive to exceeding
the speed limit. Based on this result, we modify ADS
PP by
penalizing the selection of paths that require the violation ofthe speed limit; we run the same scenario with the modiﬁedADS
PP, and ﬁnd that the ego vehicle does not violate the
speed limit and, at the intersection, changes its direction intolane-2 until vehicle-b has passed, and then changes into lane-
1. The ego vehicle ends with no requirement violated: the
maximal speed is 15.9m/s , the maximal curvature rate is 0.13,
the acceleration change rate is 0.19, and no collision occurs.
Such type of information is useful for engineers of our industrypartner to re-engineer ADS
PP.
C. Threats to V alidity
The threats to external validity primarily include the degree
to which the subject ADSs, their faults, and abstract testscenarios are representative of true practice. Our evaluationis conducted with only one system ADS
PP provided by our
industry partner. Moreover, the evaluation results are based ononly two common scenarios, i.e., S
OandST, These threats
could be reduced by more experiments on wider types ofADSs and more abstract scenarios in future work. The threatsto internal validity are instrumentation effects that can biasour results. Faults in our prototype and the search frameworkjMetalPy might cause such effects. To reduce these threats,we manually inspected the intermediate results of applyingour approach.

Search-Based Testing. Search-based testing (SBT) for test
generation is an active area in ADS testing. The idea is to
use optimization to efﬁciently generate critical test scenar-ios in which the autonomous vehicle under test fails (e.g.,collision). Abdessalem et al. [6] use multi-objective searchwith a surrogate model [7] and learnable evolution algorithmto test an Advanced Driver Assistance System (such systemsupports levels 1-2 of automation [40]). For the testing ofADSs with higher-level automation and a more dedicateddecision-making process, Cal `o et al. [10] propose an approach
to generate avoidable collision scenarios in which a differentlyconﬁgured ADS would not lead to collisions. Gambi et al. [9]generate, through procedural content generation and search-based testing, challenging scenarios in which the vehicleunder test departs the lane, while Li et al. [12] introduceA V-FUZZER, a framework based on fuzzing to ﬁnd safetyviolations of the ADS under test. In contrast to our work,none of these preceding approaches considers the problem ofmultiple requirements violations, but consider the generationof critical scenarios for only one speciﬁc ADS requirement,such as safety. Furthermore, EMOOD identiﬁes critical test
scenarios covering different requirements violation patterns.
Many-objective Optimization in SBT. Many-objective
search [30] is increasingly used to address the need for
many objectives to represent different decision criteria in-volved in software engineering tasks. The usage of many-objective search presents an important challenge, since thehigh-dimensional Pareto fronts demand more time and mem-ory resources to be generated. For object-oriented systems,Panichella et al. [41] design a highly scalable many-objectivegenetic algorithm (MOSA) for the many-objective branchcoverage problem. Their later work [42] proposes DynaMOSAto dynamically focus on not-covered objectives according tobranch, statement, and mutant coverage to generate tests;DynaMOSA is now the default algorithm in EvoSuite [43], anautomatic test generation framework. However, the precedingexisting work on many-objective optimization in search-basedtesting is slightly different from our approach, as we executemany rounds of EMOO, using different patterns as objectivesto search for, and our prioritization aims at selecting the targetpatterns. Namely, based on a new insight of the relationshipbetween requirements violation patterns, we design DP to au-tomatically select the most likely-to-occur and critical patternsto search for at the beginning of each EMOO execution.
Coverage Criteria. Since it is infeasible to test ADSs under
all possible conditions due to the large test scenario space
(other vehicles, road structure, etc.), some work [44] proposescoverage criteria for ADS testing. Hauer et al. [16] deﬁnecategories of different scenarios that should be covered. Totest any possible behaviors of the ADS under test, Laurent etal. [13] use weight coverage to cover different conﬁgurationsof a path planner, while Tian et al. [45] use neuron cover-age to guide the generation of tests for neural networks inautonomous vehicles. However, neither scenario coverage nordriving behavior coverage criteria can guarantee that unsafebehaviors of the ADS are tested in terms of requirements vio-lations, and so they cannot guarantee to expose all the possiblerequirements violation patterns. In contrast, EMOOD targets
requirements violation patterns to identify diverse critical testscenarios for the ADS. Therefore, through the coverage ofdifferent requirements violation patterns, unsafe behaviors ofthe ADS are more likely to be exposed, so that ADS engineerscan build a resilient ADS in extreme or stressful scenarios.
Requirements-Based Testing. Requirements-based testing for
autonomous systems aims at system conformance with all
identiﬁed requirements [46]. As ADSs are complex cyber-physical systems that are challenging to test and debug,requirements-based testing approaches have been proposed tocheck the requirements satisfaction during the developmentprocess to decrease the resources needed to design the sys-tems [23]. To generate tests to expose requirements violations,two mainstream approaches, i.e., model checking and modeltesting, have been proposed for cyber-physical systems [47].Model checking approaches [4] attempt to ﬁnd failures whenthey exist or prove the absence of failures through formalveriﬁcation. However, because formal veriﬁcation considersall possible executions, it often has difﬁculty in scaling tocomplex systems with a large space of system states [27],[47]. Model testing approaches [23], [48] identify and specifyrequirements for the system behaviors and generate test sce-narios that violate the requirements speciﬁcations. However,these approaches do not target different combinations ofrequirements violations, whereas EMOOD can help effectively
discover the most critical and likely-to-occur requirementsviolation patterns.
VII. C
ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have proposed EMOOD, an automated
testing approach for ADSs, that targets requirements violationpatterns. EMOOD builds on Evolutionary Many-Objective Op-
timization (EMOO), which is guided by Initial Prioritization(IP) and Dynamical Prioritization (DP) of requirements viola-tion patterns to identify the violation pattern to search for dur-ing each iteration. Our evaluation results on an industrial ADShave shown that EMOOD outperforms the baseline random
testing and evolutionary search, and generates test scenariosthat expose more violation patterns with higher criticality.
Our current approach requires to specify, as input, an ab-
stract scenario over which the search is performed. Different
abstract scenarios may or may not allow to cover speciﬁcrequirements violation patterns. Such manual selection ofabstract scenarios requires rich domain knowledge and maylimit the approach’s effectiveness. In future work, we plan toinvestigate tool automation to identify abstract scenarios; somework [16] has been proposed to identify the scenario types that
should be considered for ADS testing, and we plan to leveragesuch work to specify our initial abstract scenarios.
