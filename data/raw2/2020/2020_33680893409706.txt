ABSTRACT
The typical software tutorial includes step-by-step instructions for
installing developer tools, editing files and code, and running com-
mands.Whenthesesoftwaretutorialsarenotexecutable,eitherdue
to missing instructions, ambiguous steps, or simply broken com-
mands,their valueis diminished. Non-executabletutorials impact
developersinseveralways,includingfrustratinglearningexperi-
ences, andlimitingusabilityofdeveloper tools.
TounderstandtowhatextentsoftwaretutorialsareexecutableÐ
and why they may failÐwe conduct an empirical study on over
600 tutorials, including nearly 15,000 code blocks. We find a naive
execution strategy achieves an overall executability rate of only
26%. Even a human-annotation-based execution strategyÐwhile
doubling executabilityÐstill yields no tutorial that can successfully
executeallsteps.Weidentifyseveralcommonexecutabilitybarri-
ers, ranging from potentially innocuous causes, such as interactive
prompts requiring human responses, to insidious errors, such as
missing steps and inaccessible resources. We validate our findings
with major stakeholders in technical documentation and discuss
possible strategies for improving software tutorials, such as pro-
vidingaccessiblealternativesfortutorialtakers,andinvestingin

The	Node.js	runtime	is	now	installed,	and	ready	to	run	an	application!	Let's	write	a	Node.js	application.
Note: 	When	installing	from	the	NodeSource	PPA,	the	Node.js	executable	is	called	 nodejs ,	rather	than
node .
Create	Node.js	Application
We	will	write	a	 Hello	World 	application	that	simply	returns	"Hello	World"	to	any	HTTP	requests.	This	is
a	sample	application	that	will	help	you	get	your	Node.js	set	up,	which	you	can	replace	with	your	own
application--just	make	sure	that	you	modify	your	application	to	listen	on	the	appropriate	IP	addresses
and	ports.
Hello	World	Code
First,	create	and	open	your	Node.js	application	for	editing.	For	this	tutorial,	we	will	use	 nano 	to	edit	a
sample	application	called	 hello.js :
$cd ~  
$nano hello.js  
Insert	the	following	code	into	the	file.	If	you	want	to,	you	may	replace	the	highlighted	port,	 8080 ,	in
both	locations	Ƈbe	sure	to	use	a	non-admin	port,	i.e.	Ĥģĥ4	or	greaterƈ:
#!/usr/bin/env nodejs  
var http = require('http');  
http.createServer(function (req, res) {  
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});  
  res.end('Hello World\n');  
}).listen( 8080 , 'localhost');  
console.log('Server running at http://localhost: 8080 /');  
Now	save	and	exit.
This	Node.js	application	simply	listens	on	the	specified	address	Ƈ localhost ƈ	and	port	Ƈ 8080 ƈ,	and
returns	"Hello	World"	with	a	 200	HTTP	success	code.	Since	we're	listening	on	 localhost ,	remote

Theidealtutorial,asdescribedinDigitalOcean’sguidelinesfor
tutorial creators [ 35], should follow several principles. First, tu-
torials should be accessible for all tutorial takers, being łas clear
and detailed as possible without making assumptions about the
reader’s background knowledge.ž Furthermore, tutorials should be
executablefromstart-to-finish:łWeexplicitlyincludeeverycom-
mand a reader needs to go from their first SSH connection on a
brand new server to the final, working setup.ž Finally, tutorials are
not merely scripts, but should explain and impart knowledge: łWe

information they needto understand the tutorial. The goal isfor
our readers to learn, not just copy andpaste.ž

Unfortunately, tutorials can fall far from this ideal. Despite their
importance, software tutorials require considerable effort to pro-
duce,test, andmaintain inorder to ensure a high-quality learning
experience.Tutorialcreatorsfaceseveralbarriers: supportingdif-
ferentlevelsandenvironmentsoftutorialtakers[ 31],preventing
instructions from becoming stale as tools or environments quickly
evolve [19], and overcoming the expert blind spot effect [26], when
tutorialcreatorsdonotanticipatestepswherenovicetutorialtakers
may have difficulty [ 24]. As a result, undiscovered issues [ 18] in
softwaretutorialscanleadtofrustratingandineffectivelearning
experiences [ 16,23].
To systematically understand what issues software tutorials
containÐandwhattutorialcreatorscandotoavoidthemÐweinves-
tigatesoftwaretutorialsthroughthelensof executability ,measuring
to what extent we can follow step-by-step instructions to their łfi-
nal, working setupž. To this end, we conduct an empirical study of
663tutorials,firstbymeasuringexecutabilitywithanaiveexecu-
tion strategy (as one would łjust copy and pastež), and finally with
a more sophisticated strategy using human-annotation for inter-
preting and executing instructions. Through a qualitative analysis,
weidentifiedseveralissuesintutorialsthatlimitedexecutability,
and we validated these issues with 6 informants, who were expert
stakeholders intechnical documentation.
Our findings show that with a naive execution strategy, we
achieve overall executability rate of only 26%. Even with a more
sophisticated strategy using annotated tutorials, executabilityrate
only increases to 52.3%Ðand even more concerning no tutorial
successfully executed all steps to its łfinal, working setupž. Our
qualitative analysis revealed several issues, such as inaccessible
resources,missingsteps,inconsistencyinhandlingfilecontent,and

questions:
2.1 Research Questions
•RQ1: Can tutorials be naively executed. If not, why?
Can the average tutorial be run to completion naively, or
will it result in failure? What failures occur when there is
limitedknowledge onhowto followinstructions?
•RQ2: Can tutorials be executed with limited human-
annotation? What extra human interpretation is needed
tointerpretandexecutemoreinstructions?Whatbarriersremain that prevent fully automated testing of a software
tutorial?
2.2 Data Collection

italOcean4,and Linuxize5.Alltutorialswere relatedto installing
softwaretools,security,andconfiguringandoperatingvirtualcom-
puting environments, topics frequently important in continuous
deploymentprocessesinsoftwareengineering[ 27].Weusedaweb-
scraping script to crawl and download all tutorials for the Ubuntu
operating system hosted on the sources, yielding a total of 780
tutorials.
Weorganizedourcollecteddataintotargetplatformspecified
bythe tutorial (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04), and then removed duplicate tu-
torials with the same content but targeting different platforms. We
also excluded tutorials that targeted adeprecated Linux distro (i.e.
Ubuntu12.10) for which we could not find a stablebaseimage, and
tutorialsthatwere primarily focusedonusing GUIinterfaces (e.g.
łHowToSetUpContinuousIntegrationPipelineswithDroneon
Ubuntu 16.04ž6). After filtering, our collected dataset of 780 tutori-
alswasreducedto663tutorials.Insummary,ourfiltereddataset
included339tutorialsfromVultr,224tutorialsfromDigitalOcean
and100tutorialsfrom Linuxize.
We then drew a stratified random sample of tutorials in our
dataset(6%),inordertofacilitatequalitativeanalysis,asdoneinKim
and Ko[16],whoinspecteda sampleof30tutorials.Becauseour
tutorial sources were not uniformly represented in the dataset, we
determinedastatisticallyrepresentativesamplesizeforeachsource.
To do so, we used a proportionate stratified random sampling [ 15]
byconsideringeachsourceasastrata.Weusedarelaxedconfidence
interval (80% ±10%) to calculate the sample size of each strata,
allowingustotargetdiversityoverrepresentativeness[ 25].This
yielded a total of 40 tutorials containing 787 content blocksÐ20
tutorials from Vultr, 14 tutorials from DigitalOcean, and 6 tutorials

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04 3/25up-to-date versions, so we’ll use that repository instead.
First, add the repository.
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot 
You’ll need to press ENTER  to accept. Then, update the package list to pick up the new
repository’s package information.
$ sudo apt-get update 
And finally, install Certbot’s Nginx package with apt-get .
$ sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx 
Certbot is now ready to use, but in order for it to configure SSL for Nginx, we need to verify
some of Nginx’s configuration.
Step 2 — Setting up Nginx
Certbot can automatically configure SSL for Nginx, but it needs to be able to find the correct
server  block in your config. It does this by looking for a server_name  directive that matches
the domain you’re requesting a certificate for.
If you’re starting out with a fresh Nginx install, you can update the default config file. Open it
with nano  or your favorite text editor.
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default 
Find the existing server_name  line and replace the underscore, _, with your domain name:
. . . 
server_name example.com  www. example.com ; /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

tus of the operation. Anew execution harness is createdfor every
tutorial.
2.4 Baseline: NaiveExecution
ToanswerRQ1,weimplementabaselinetechnique,wecall naive
execution whichsimplyexecutestextwithinacontentblock.The
technique closely mirrors previous studies on executability, where
no interpretation is performed on the code snippets on Stack Over-
flow[37]orgists [ 12]when measuring executability rates.
Wedesigned a customCSSselectortoextractcodeblocksfrom
each source of tutorials (see Figure 2). A code block is defined in
the HTML specification as an element that łrepresents a fragment
ofcomputercodež,andismarkedbythe <code></code> tag.After
extraction,weexecutetheverbatimtextasashellcommandwithin
theexecutionharness.Theresultingexitcode,thestdoutandstderr
streamsarealsorecorded.Ifthecommandneverterminatesafter10
minutes,werecordatimeout,andmarktheremaininginstructions
as unreachable.
To measure executability, we count the number of code block
executions reporting a non-error exit code (indicated by 0). We
donotdirectlyusestderrtodetermineexecutionfailure,assome
commandsprintinformationtostderr,suchas python --version .
We discuss the limitationsofthis approach inSection 5.
Toidentifywhyexecutionfails,wefirstclusterthecommandsby
exitcodeafter execution,asdonebyHortonand Parnin [12].The
distribution of execution failures provides a high-level overview
of failure causes (e.g. an exit code status of E127occurs when a
commandcannotbefound).Tounderstandwhyacodeblockcannot
be naively executed, we then perform an open card sort [33], using
similar method used by Begel and Zimmermann [2], to organize
code blocks into descriptive categories. The categories provide
insight into various possible interpretations under which a code
blockcould be executed.
2.5 Human-Annotation-Based Execution

several benefits: First, the annotations provide a boundedinterpre-
tation of instructions. For example, if we provide an annotation
with an expected response from a command, such as type "yes"
or enter, we can specifically measure how the presence of interac-
tive prompts effects executability. More importantly, we can begin

ample,acomplexoperationmightinvolvestartingacommandas

erations. Finally, automation is ultimately possible in future efforts,
suchastechniqueswhichtrytoautomaticallyinferannotationsfor
commands.
2.5.2 Design. The design of Docable is inspired by behavioral-
driven testing tools, such as Cucumber, which uses an external
stepfileforselectingandassertingexpectedtestbehaviors.Here,
weextendthisconceptbyprovidingcapabilitiesforfirstselectinga
commandfromatutorial,andthenprovidinganannotatedstepthat
describes how to execute the command. Steps select code blocks
by matching text occurring above the block. For example, in the
stepfileshowninFigure 3,thetextłLet’screateasmallserverusing
PHPž can be used to select the associated code block. The file
annotation tells Docable that content should be saved as a file
calledserver.php.

Docable also has the ability to generate an HTML report based
on the original tutorial, which enables inspection of tutorial execu-
tion. In this report, passing code blocks are highlighted in green,
failingcodeblocksarehighlightedinred,andancillaryinformation
suchaserroroutputandexitcodeserrorsareaddedtotheendof
code blocks.An example report isshowninFigure 4.
2.5.3 Annotations. We derived annotations from the results of our
opencardsortanalysis(seeSection 3.3).Forexample,wecreated
the expect annotation based on the Outputcategory derived in
Section3.3.3. When creating the annotations, we balanced engi-
neering effort with support from tutorials. For example, we did not
implementreplacingsearchandreplaceoperationsonfiles,since
fewtutorialsusedthistechniqueandengineeringeffortwouldbe
high.
We derivedthe following annotations:
•run.Runacode blockas-is,that is naively.
•file.Select content and store as a file located at the given
path.
•user.Perform command as user. For example, installation
often requires being run as the root user.
•input.Provideinputto interactive prompts.
•expect.Code block is expected output of command another
command.
•serve.Runcode inabackground process.
•persistent. Allocate a terminal shell to run a series of com-
mands. For example, some tutorials are written to be run in
differentterminals.

providesan affirmative response to prompts7.
We re-ran our experiments with our automated patch, which
waseffectiveinreducingthenumberoftutorialsthattimedoutand
allowed more code blocks to be executed. However, an overall low
rateofexecutabilitypersisted:26%(3,916outof14,876codeblocks).
Surprisingly, our results are consistent with naive executability
rates found in other studies of code snippets. For example, a recent
studybyPimenteletal .[29]foundthatonly24%ofJupyternote-
bookscouldbeexecutedwithoutexceptions.Similarly,only25ś27%
ofPythoncodesnippetsfoundinStackOverflowposts[ 14,37]and
GitHubgists [ 12]are executable.
3.2 Errors andExitCodes
We categorized exit codes to identify preliminary explanations for
why the code block could not be naively executed (see Table 2).
Naiveexecutionofmanycodeblocksresultedin E127,whichoccurs
whenacommandcannotbefound.Thisindicatesprevioussteps
to setup tools did not succeed, or possibly content that was not
a command was being executed. Exit codes, such as E2,E5, and
E128indicated that commands failed when expected resources,
services, or files were unavailable or inaccessible. Finally, many
commands were still inaccessible, indicated that possibly other
typesofcommandswerestilltimingoutduetointeractiveprompts.
3.3 CodeBlockTypes
Ouropencardsortrevealedfourhigh-levelcategoriesbasedonthe
inspection of787code blocks.
3.3.1 Commands(573). Codeblocksprimarilyinvolvedcommands
that should be executedin aterminal. However, commands some-
times hadspecializedexecutioncontexts:
•text editor : Open atexteditor.
•template: Incomplete command requiring tutorial taker to
fillinplaceholdervalues.
•interactiveprogramshell :Thecommandopensaninteractive
shell to inputmore commands, such as the MySQLshell.
3.3.2 FileContent(111). Codeblocksoftenreferredtocodesnip-
pets and configuration files that needed to be placed inside the file
system. However, frequentlythe tutorial providedinstructions for
manipulating existing file contentÐand the types of manipulations
variedgreatly.Weobservedthefollowingmanipulationoperations:
•add: Append contentto the end ofafile.
•partial: Updatepart ofafile withcontent.
•search and replace : Substitute existing content with new val-
ues.
•uncomment : Enablecontentinexisting configurationfiles.
•conditional : Multiple options exist on what to update in file.
3.3.3 Instruction Output (93). Code blocks often contained the
outputofacommand,thatis,thestandardoutputresultingfrom
executing a command. How the output was displayed varied in
several subtleways:
•partial: Trimmedoutput.
•template: Outputwithplaceholdervalues.

interactive prompts.
•interactive program shell : Results of interactive shell com-

3.4 Summary
Naive execution yielded a low execution rate. Multiple factors con-
tributedtowhynaiveexecutionfailed.Cascadingfailures,incom-
pleteinstructions,missinginteractiveinputandalackofhuman
interpretationwerejustsomeofthefactors.Ourinspectionofcode
blocks further revealed that in addition to there being multiple
types of code blocks, those code blocks also required considerable
nuance ininterpretationwhen executingthem.
4 HUMAN-ANNOTATION-BASED
EXECUTION RESULTS
Inthissection,weanswertheresearchquestion: RQ2:Cantuto-
rialsbe executed with limited human-annotation?
4.1 Annotations
We created771annotations for the 40 tutorials. The majorityof an-
notationscorrespondedtolabelingcodeblocksassimplecommands
(455).However,thereweremorecomplexcommandswhichneeded
oneormoreadditionalannotations,including38inputannotations,
47 user annotations, and 3 commands that needed to be run in the
background (serve). Finally, 82 commands needed to be associated
with a specific terminal session (persistent). We also created 112
fileannotations forcreating filecontentataspecifiedpath and 39
annotations for matching expectedoutputwithcommand output.
Welabeled131codeblocksas skipthatwedeliberatelydecided
to not execute, either because another code block would subsume
it,oritwasforpresentation.Forexample,sometutorialspresented
file content in a stagged manner. That is, they built up the file con-
tent, provided an explanation, and then continued to explain more
fragmentsoffilecontent.Inthiscase,weimplicitlyapplied skip

4.2 Executability Rates
Docable execution of annotated code blocks resulted in an execu-
tionrateof52.3%(343outof656codeblocks,whenexcludingprevi-
ouslymentioned131skippedcodeblocks).Furthermore,notutorial

unable to bring anytutorial to its łfinal, workingsetup.ž
4.3 WhatExecution FailuresRemain?
We present the remaining execution failures as themes based on
our qualitative analysis of Docable reports, and give examples
of tutorials instructions that exhibited this problem. Finally, we
include excerptsofthe informants expertreviewofour findings.
Simplifyingassumptionsaboutenvironment. Tutorialsmake
simplifyingassumptionsabouttheuser’senvironment.For exam-
ple, some tutorials will assume the package manager’s listing is
up-to-date and do not explicitly mention running the ‘apt-get
update’ command. Unfortunately, omitting this step can result
inintermittenterrors(seeFigure 5).Anotherwaytutorialsmake
simplifyingassumptionsisbyrequiringprerequisites.Prerequisites
are sometimes listed at the beginning of the tutorial and described
in natural language or reference other tutorials which should be

installing the package "steam", which omits an explicit apt-
get updatecommand.
Our informants recognized this as a general problem with tu-
torials: łThere’s an implicit assumption about the environmentž
(I5) and łmany tutorials assume you have things like a working
databasež (I4). If tutorials łwere all written with *less* assumptions
and were more comprehensive that would be great, and people
could justskimover the parts they already knewž (I4).
Informants believed tutorials became problematic if they use
łtoomuchreferralwithinatutorialorsetupinstructionstoanother
tutorialž(I4).Furthermore,łmostoftutorialsbuilduponothers,and
sometimesthatcanrunmultiplelevelsdeepž(I3).Foratutorialtaker,
itcanbeunclearhowlongtheadditionalsetupwilltake,orwhether
those prerequisite tutorials are up-to-date. Even informants can be
frustratedwith thisastutorial takers: łOnce Iwas *attempting* (Igaveup)toinstallanapplicationandthefirsttutorialallowedme
achoiceof6waysto installsomething andnone worked.ž (I4)
Inconsistent file content blocks Tutorials often contain file
content blocks without explicitindicationofthe expectedaction
atutorialtaker shouldmake. Sometimesthewholecontentofthe
file is shown, and sometimes only a subset of a file that need to
beupdated.Othertimesthetutorialinstructthetutorialtakerto
uncommentpart ofthe existing file orappend to the end of file.

ingandpresentingthesedifferences.Forexample,sometutorials
indicate omitted content with ł...ž characters and expect you to add
the new content displayed. Other tutorials display exiting content
andexpectyoutoreplaceasmallpartofthefile.Forexample,in
thetutorialbelow,thecodeblockshowstheexistingcontentinthe
’settings.py’for Django.
Inadvertently replacing the whole ’settings.py’ file with this
content would not only introduce syntax errors, but would also
omitessentialcontent.Finally, thereisasmallpartofthe filethat
needstobeupdated: "your-server-ip" shouldbereplacedwith
the real IP address of the server, which could be missed by the
tutorial taker.

We also observed several instances where tutorials contained
volatileinstructions, that is instructions whose behavior would
produce different results. Volatile instructions often involved com-
mandsthatoutputdynamic information, suchasPID(processID),
IPaddresses,andusernames.Asaresult,theactualoutputproduced
by the command would not match the expected output in the code

makesiteasier for people to run customcode.ž
After being introduced to Docable , some informants started
systematically reviewing their owntutorials łFrom our side, sincewe started playing with docable we made a few corrections on
how we write tutorials. Overall, what docable has promoted for
us is consistency.ž (I5) For example, the informant now ensures

4.4 Summary
Executingtutorialswithlimitedhuman-annotationsubstantially
improves executability rates of tutorials over a baseline of naive
execution. However, all evaluated tutorials still contained execu-
tion failures, often caused by a multitude of problematic tutorial
writingpractices,suchasmissingandinconsistentinformationand
documentation rot. Informants offered their insight on the validity
andimpact ofthesefindings.
5 LIMITATIONS
Our mixed-methods approach of investigating tutorials introduces
certaintrade-offsandlimitations.
As explained in the study by Kim et al. [ 16], tutorials exist in
different genres suchas interactive tutorials (ex. Khan Academy8),
webreference(ex.W3Schools9),MOOCs(ex.edX10),educational
games (ex. Code Combat11), and creative platforms (ex. Alice12). In
this study, we focused on web reference genre on topicsrelated to
configurationoftoolsandcomputingenvironments.Othertypes
of genres and domains may have different kinds of executability
barriers.
Therewereseveraltrade-offswemadeinourimplementationof
theexecutionharnessandexecutabilitystudy.Forexample,because
we remotely executed throughssh, a few commands,such as ufw,
coulddisruptthenetworkconnection.Wealsolimitedourscope
ofexecution.Forexample,wedidnotexecuteinlinecodeblocks,
which were relatively rareÐonly 10 instances found in our sample
dataset.Therefore,evenhigherexecutionratescouldbeobserved
through additional engineering effort on the execution harness
withoutnecessarily changing tutorials.
Finally,we acknowledgethat qualitativeresearch, howeverrig-
orously conducted, involves not only the qualitative data under
investigationbut alsoalevel of subjectivityandinterpretationon
the part of the researcher as they frame and synthesize the results

ity[21].Tosupportinterpretivevalidity,wefollowedtheguidelines
setby[20]andperformedapeerdebriefingwithourresults.Our
sampling method was parameterized with a higher tolerance for
error. Therefore ourstudy limits our ability to draw precise conclu-
sions fora sample-to-population or statistical generalization when
characterizing the frequency orportion of failures.
6 RELATED WORK
TheworkbyKimandKo [16]istheclosestrelatedworkinterms
ofresearchmethodandgoal.KimandKo [16]alsoperformedan
qualitative inspection of 30 tutorials across a variety of domains.
However, their method differed in how they characterized tutorial
content. In the study, the authors made an assessmentof whether
tutorials fitbestpracticesinpedagogy, suchas connecting tolearn-
ers’ prior knowledge, and encouraging meta-cognitive learning.
They found deficiencies in all these categories across a variety
of tutorials and domains. In both Kim and Ko [16]and our work,
anoverarchinggoalistoassessthequalityoftutorials;however,
whereas Kim and Ko [16]view quality through a pedagogical lens,
we viewquality throughan executability lens,withalonger-term
goalofautomatedandcontinuous testing.
Studieshavecharacterizedthepainpointsofbothtutorialtakers
andtutorialcreators.Tutorialtakersstumblewhentutorialscon-
tainmissingdependenciesorsteps[ 23],donotexplainunexpected
errors or side effects, and have unclear adaption paths for tailor-
ingcontenttodifferentgoals[ 18].Headetal .[10]interviewed12
tutorial creators and discovered pain points related to duplicate
instructions and composing and reusing code fragments from a

tutorial author tool, Torii, which allowed authors to split, annotate,
and link tutorial content. Our study provides empirical evidence
validating several of these concerns, and provides additional tech-
niques for allowing continuous testingof tutorials.

7 DISCUSSION
Our findingsdemonstrate numerouswaysin whichtutorials con-
tain instructions that are not directly executable. When naively
executed, we found only 26% of code blocks inside tutorials ran
successfully, consistent with other experiments on executability
of other softwareartifacts [ 12,14,29,37]. Human annotationwas

on a particular path. Although executing annotated tutorials with
Docable substantially improved executability, numerous issues
whichcouldnotbesimplyresolvedbyannotationpersisted,reveal-
ing underlying issues with quality and accessibility of instructions.
In the remainder of this section, we present design implica-
tions for technical writers, toolsmiths, and software engineering
researchersthatcanhelpreducesomeexecutabilitydifficultiesin
software tutorials.
7.1 Implication IÐProvide Accessible
AlternativesforTutorialTakers
Weobservedseveralaccessibilitybarriersthatlimitwhocanfully
takeadvantageofthelearningexperiencesofferedbytutorials,such
asinaccessibleresources(Section 4.3)andinteractiveprompts(Sec-
tion3.1),whichcanincreasethedifficultyofsuccessfullyexecuting
atutorial(Section 4.2).
Not every tutorial taker will have readily available access to
costly infrastructure resources. Several tutorials required resources
suchasregistereddomainnamesandextrafeatures,suchasaddi-
tionaldiskvolumes,object-stores,andclustersÐallexpensesthat
can quickly exclude disadvantaged and non-traditional learners
who do not have the resources necessary to obtain them. Profes-
sionalscanbeimpactedaswell.Atutorialtakermaybeworking
on a prototype or investigating possible platforms for a product,
andmaybewearyofmakinglargeinvestmentsinordertofollow
atutorialthat maynot even work.
Tutorials can inadvertently exclude novice learners by omit-
ting details that are important for shepherding cautious learners
throughtheir firstlearning experience.Research incomputer edu-
cationhasfoundthatlearnerswithlowerself-efficacyhavemore
difficulty handling unexpected and exploratory behaviors [ 1], such
as interactive prompts [ 18]. Interactive prompts can be difficult for
learners who do not know how to response exactly, especially if
theyarefirstlearninganewtoolorcommand.Forexample,com-
mands such as ‘ mysql_secure_installation ’or‘lxd init ’can
ask up-to dozens of prompts, including complicated configuration
options such as bridge networking. We found many instances of
tutorialswhichsimplyaskedthereaderto answertheprompts or
followtherestoftheprompts withoutgivingdetailsforwhatshould
betheresponsetoeachprompt.Whenunguided,suchpromptscan
be frustratingandoverwhelming for novices.
Learners desire more accessible resources that leverage their
background [ 32] and providing alternative formats for flexibility
inlearning[ 5].Surprisingly,simplestepscanprovideimproveac-
cessibility for tutorial takers. For example, many tutorials required
prerequisites, such as having a registered domain name, before the
readercanfollowthestepsofthetutorial.However,wefoundafew
tutorialsthatofferedasimplealternativeifthiswascurrentlyun-
obtainableforthetutorialtaker.Thetutorialsinstructthereaderto

7.2 Implication IIÐInvestin Automated
TutorialTesting
Weobservedseveralissuesthatimpactthequalityoftutorials,such
asdocumentationrot,missingandvolatileinstructions(Section 4.3)
whichresultedinlowerexecutionrates(Section 3.1and4.2).łTuto-
rial maintenance is inherently difficult...our tutorials are written
by and for humans, so there’s always a chance that there will be
errors(even withallthe work we do to minimizethemž (I2).
Automatedtutorialtestingcanhelpiftutorialcreatorsarewilling
tomakeminimalinvestments.Forexample,tutorialsat learnk8s13
uses annotations on their code blocks for rendering output. These
can be extended to support annotations that assist with automated
execution:

3systemctl start rot13

Tutorialscanshowintermediatestepsofupdatingafile,butshould
include a final content block, or offer programmatic methods of
displayingandupdatingcontent,suchasłjqwhichautomatically
filtersoutthe outputandgive what isneededž (I1).
Finally,tutorialtestingcanbecomplementedwithothersources
of testing and feedback. For example, Drosos et al . [7]deployed
pain-scale surveysin anonline learning environment to automati-

ortranslatedintootherlanguages,etcž(I6).
7.3 Implication IIIÐProvide Self-Contained
Tutorials.
We observed tutorials that made simplifying assumptions about
environment and tutorials that required running other tutorials
thatsometimescouldłrunmultiplelevelsdeepž(I3).Furthermore,
whentutorialsdonotexplicitlycontroltheirdependencies,docu-
mentation rot could lead to breaking changes within the tutorial
(Section4.3). Many tutorials that we analyzed included multiple
linkstoothertutorialswhichexplainhowtosetupaprerequisite
but it is not clear which link should be used by the user, or if those
tutorialswillalsohave theirownprerequisites.
One informant mentioned their effort to flatten dependencies łin
recenttutorialsthey’vetriedtopullalldependenciesupand"flatten
outthedependencytree"sothatit’sclearup-fronteachstepyou
need to take firstž (I3). We observed several Vultr tutorials, where
alldependenciescouldbeinstalledinasingletutorial14.Another
informantdescribedtheireffortstobetterpackagingtutorials:łIf
the tutorial is using a VM, we package all dependent files and arti-
factssuchasDockerimageswithintheVM.Whenwe dependon
an external script, we fork the script and host it alongside the doc-
umentation. This is similar to your finding to avoid use of external
servicesas much as possible ž(I5).
Otherinterestingapproachwouldinvolveautomaticinference
andconstructionbaseimagesforrunningtutorials.Forexample,
DockerizeMe [13]isatechniquethatgivenaPythoncodesnippet,
canautomaticallyinfersystemandtransitivedependenciesrequired
to successfully execute a code snippet. Such a technique could
beadoptedtodeterminethedependenciesnecessaryforrunning
a tutorial. Similarly, a tool such as opunit[22] could provide a
simple mechanism for determining whether or not prerequisites
were appropriately satisfiedbefore starting atutorial.
7.4 Implication IVÐBe Intentionalon Whether
InstructionsareHuman-Readable or
Machine-Readable
We observed several executability barriers, such as placeholders
incommands(Section 3.3.1),conditionallogicinfilecontent(Sec-
tion3.3.2,interactiveprompts(Section 3.1),andłtemplatevalues
areinconsistentbetweentutorialsandrarelymachinereadablež(I6),
which needed extensive human interpretation (Section 4.1) to over-
come. These executability barriers often involves, human-readable
steps, łcommands and file contents with placeholder values that
shouldbechangedbythereader,allforthepurposeofproviding
additionalinformation andcontextž(I2), such fillin apassword or
replace this IP or MAC address . One tutorial even asks the reader
to go to a website, locate a download link, and use it in a curl
command.Tutorialcreatorsneedtoconsiderwhetherthesehuman
readable steps are intended to be truly educational or an unwanted
learningbarrierthat reduces the accessibilityofthe tutorial.

material from online resources, due to configuration and docu-

up-to-date [ 5,36], and determining what portion might require
manual adaption[ 6,36].

inside commands, there can be an interactive component in the
tutorial that allows the user specify the desired value for this pa-
rameter, which is then automatically propagated throughout the
tutorial instructions. Finally, łit would be interesting if there were
a standardised format for storing tutorial data, which would allow
one piece of structured data to both be rendered into a human-
friendly page, but also interpreted by a machine and automatically
executedž (I6).
8 CONCLUSION
In this study, we conducted a mixed-methods study through an
empirical study on tutorials collected from various online sources,
andthroughaqualitativeanalysisoftutorials.Wefirstusedanaive
execution strategy to determine a baseline level of executability.
We then inspected code blocks in tutorials and devised a set of
annotationsthatcouldbeappliedtoimprovetheirexecutability.By
executingtheseannotatedtutorialswith Docable,wewereableto
obtain a higher rate of executability, but still observed a significant
