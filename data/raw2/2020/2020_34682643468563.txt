1 INTRODUCTION
Open source has democratized software development. Developers
flocktoOSSprojectshopingtoaddcertainfunctionality,contribute
to a worthy goal, and sharpen their skills. However, more than
80%ofOSSprojectsbecomeabandonedovertime,especiallythe
smallerandyoungerprojects[ 44].CertainlynotallOSSprojects
are meant to be widely used or even to persist beyond a college
semester.However,eventhelarge,popularOSSsoftware,widely
usedinourdailylivesandbyfortune500companies,startedout
as small projects. Thus, from a societal perspective, it is important
to ask: Why do some nascent OSS projects succeed and become
self-sustaining while others do not [ 40]? And can the latter be
helped?
To aid developer communities to build and maintain sustainable
OSS projects, nonprofit organizations like the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF) have been established. ASF runs the ASF Incuba-
tor(ASFI)[ 15],wherenascentprojectsaimingtobeapartofthe
ASF community are provided with stewardship and mentor-like
guidance to help them eventually become self-sustaining and even
top-levelprojectsinASF.ProjectsinASFI,called podlings,arere-
quiredtoadheretoASFrulesandregulations,includingkeepingall

project developers andASF committeesdecideif a podling should

uationtestswhetheraprojecthaslearnedenoughandisresponsible

Podlings in ASFI receive a mentor, file monthly reports, and
get feedback. In spite of this support, many podlings fail. Most
ASFI committers do not lack coding expertise, but graduating from
the incubator requires more: it asks for effective teamwork and
sustainable,communitydevelopment.Theserequirementsaremost
challengingtomeet.FromcommentsinASFI,weseethatdevelopers
areconfusedbytheexpectationof‘TheApacheWay’,especially
initially. E.g., from project Flexon 05 Jan 2012, ‘...I think there is

The frustrations sometimes persist beyond the initial period. A
commentfromproject Flexon06Jan2012,states‘...manypeople
are confused and lost as to what to do. Who is providing that
direction for them?’ In large part, understanding how to achieve
the graduation requirements seems to be the culprit, likely due
to the abstract nature of those concepts. Another reason is that
comparisontoothersisdifficult.Fromproject Raveon28June2011:
‘[sporadic adherence to requirements] makes it very confusing and
difficult to compare against what other projects as some are doing
toolittlewhileothersare doing toomuch...’
Thus,thereisaneedtoconnecttheproverbialdotsonhowto
getfromthepointofentryintoASFItocheckingallthegraduation
requirementboxes.Thatbringsustothemotivationofourpaper.
The extrinsically labeled ASFI dataset offers heretofore unavail-
able,fine-grainedrecordsofhistoricaltrajectoriesofprojectsunder
policies andregulationsofASFI.We positthat:
The process that ASFI projects follow toward becoming sus-
tainablecanbemodeledasafunctionofasmallsetofproject
features,sothattheoutcome(graduation/retirement)canbe
predicted early on, from the successes and failures of others,
allowing for trajectory adjustmentif needed.
To deliver on that, in addition to the historical, outcome-labeled
ASFIdata,wealsoneedatheoreticalframeworkthatcancapture
thecomplexityofOSSdevelopment.Overthepast30yearsresearch
inorganizationalbehaviorandmanagementhasdocumentedthe
evolutioninprojectmanagementpractices[ 8],astheyhavemoved
toward more successful models [ 2]. Thesocio-technical view of
an organization [ 30] has emerged as one of the more successful
hybridmodelsrecognizingthebenefitsthatintegratedtreatment
of the technical aspect (code, machines, device, etc.) and the social
aspect (people, communication, well-being, etc.) hasonan organi-
zation [36]. Likewise, OSS projects have been effectively studied
fromthesocio-technicalsystem (STS)perspective[ 1],withthesocial
side capturing humans and their communication channels, and the
technical capturingthe content and structure ofthe software [ 43].
Here, inspired by the socio-technical systems modeling perspec-
tive,andtheavailabilityofextrinsicallylabeledhistoricaldataof
project sustainabilityfromASFI, ourgoalsare: (1)to identifysocio-
technicalfeaturesdistinguishingprojectsthatgraduatefromthe
ASF Incubator from those that do not (i.e., find the determinants
of OSS project sustainability), and (2) to build temporal forecast-
ing models that can predict sustainability outcomes at any time
pointintheprojectdevelopment,andthus(3)toofferpracticaland
timelyadviceoninterveningtocorrectaproject’scourse,especially

and qualitative empirical studies. We start by gathering project
technical traces(commits) and socialtraces(emails) fromtheASF

Our contributionsinthis paper are:
•We provide a novel longitudinal dataset of hundreds of OSS
projects’ development traces under ASF regulation, with
extrinsically labeledprojectsustainabilitystatus.
•WeproposethefirstOSSprojectsustainabilityforecastmea-

(≥93%accuracyas early as 8months intoincubation).
•We find that ASF incubator projects with fewerbutmore
focusedcommitters and morebutdistributed (participating
inasynchronousdiscussions)communicatorsaremorelikely
to gainmomentum to self-sustainability.
•Wedescribeastrategyforreal-timemonitoringofthesus-

This paper is a first step toward showing that end-results of
OSS projects’ sustainability trajectories can be effectively forecast
and possibly corrected upward, if needed. Our motivation goes
beyond ASFI as many more nascent projects fail outside of ASFI,
soself-monitoringandself-adjustmentmaybemorepertinentto

2 BACKGROUNDAND THEORIES
We present background on the Apache Software Foundation (ASF)
andOSSsuccess,andthenweintroducerelatedtheoriesthrough
whichwe generateour Research Questions.
2.1 ApacheSoftwareFoundationIncubator
Communityovercode isthetenetoftheApacheSoftwareFounda-
tion (ASF) community [ 22]. Their belief is that if they take good
care ofthe community,goodsoftware willemergefrom it.
However, conflictsareubiquitous inOSS projects[ 27],andnot
even ASF can escape them. To minimize conflicts, ASF requires
projects to make all communication publicly available on the mail-
inglists,summarizedpopularlyas ifitdidnothappeninthemailing
lists, it did not happen [42]. The communication records benefit
developers as they reflect on previous decisions and trace their
precursors, therefore improvingefficiency andproductivity.
The ASF community adopts ademocraticwayinmanyof their
affairs. For example, contributors are invited to vote +1 (yes), 0
1057Sustainability ForecastingforApache IncubatorProjects ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021,Athens,Greece
(okay), or −1 (no) to project-wide changes. However, ASFcommit-
ters can live in different time zones, and their response to a project
decision can delay largely. Regarding that, ASF community adopts
theLazy Consensus [31]. Moreover, the ASF community also be-
lieves inEarned Rights , that newcomers should be treated the same
wayif they have proven theirtechnical skills.
The goal of the ASF Incubator (ASFI) is to help projects become
self-sustained and eventually join ASF. Like many OSS developers,
ASFIcommittersworkatwillandtherearenoformalobligations
on them. Thus, ASFI projects are required to show they are able
to recruit new committers, and fill existing technical debt [ 38].
However, attracting new committers is difficult as they can be
affected by both social and technical barriers [ 46]. To address this
issue, the ASFI community has established a set of specific rules
that emphasizeprovidingmentorship to newcomers [ 47].
During incubation, ASFI projects need to adopt ASF procedures
to developand cultivatethe projects’ community,and standardize
their working style. To graduate from the incubator and finally
becomeapartoftheASF,projectsarerequiredtodemonstratethey
canself-governandbeself-sustained[ 12].Thespecificrequirement
ofsustainabilitycanvaryfromoneprojecttoanother[ 13,18].A
project’sgraduationisultimatelyapprovedforitsself-sustainability
by ASF’s Project Management Committee via several rounds of
publicvoting3.
2.2 OSSProjects Success andSustainability
Recently, substantial work has focusedon modeling thesuccess of
OSSprojects[ 34,37,48].Eventhoughthereisnouniversallyagreed
definitionofOSSsuccess[ 19],therearetwomainperspectives.The
firstoneisfromthedevelopmentprocessviewpoint,whichisoften
measured by technical metrics of software [ 21], e.g., code defect
density[39],responsetime[ 35],anderrorresolutionrate[ 28].The
second one is more from the social angle, including contributor
growth [59], community participation [ 32], and communication
patterns [ 56]. In effect, K. Crowston et al. [ 11] studied the opera-
tionalizingsuccessmeasuresunderthecontextofFLOSSprojects.
N. Cerpa et al. [ 7] provide survey evidence that factors in the logis-
ticregressionmodelsarenotaspredictiveasexpected.D.Surianet
al.[49]identifydiscriminativerichpatternsfromsocio-technical
networksto predictprojectsuccessinthecontextof SourceForge
projects. J. Coelho et al. [ 9] conduct mixed-method analysis on
GitHubprojects,andtheyfindthatmostofmodernOSSprojects
fail due to project characteristics and team issues. M. Valiev et
al. [53] conducted studies on sustained activity within the PyPI
ecosystem,andfindthatrelativepositioninthedependencynet-
work has a significant impact on project sustainability. None of
these consider forecasting over time and thus are not useful for
real-time monitoring, which is the major contribution of this work.
AlthoughOSSsuccessandsustainabilitymeasuresimilaraspects
ofprojects[ 58],theyare,infact,notthesamething.Therearetwo
maindifferencesbetweenthetwo.First,OSSsuccessismeasured
statically while sustainability is measured dynamically. Second,
sustainability is a measure related more to the human and social
aspect (e.g., the ability to take responsible collective action, and
3https://incubator.apache.org/guides/graduation.htmlanopenandinclusiveatmosphere,etc.)thanthetechnicalaspect
(defectdensity,technical advantage,etc.).
Therefore, the sustainability of an OSS project becomes even
moreimportantwhenitisapartofalargerecosystem[ 20,53].Such
OSSprojectsareinter-dependenttoeachother,thesustainability
and stability of one project can introduce tremendous network
effecttoitsecosystem.4Therefore,thesustainabilityofOSSprojects

OSS projectsinthe ecosystem that relyonthem.
2.3 Socio-technical SystemsTheory
Socio-technical structure plays an important role in achieving col-
lectivesuccessinOSSprojects[ 4,14,56].ASocio-TechnicalSystem
(STS) comprises two entities [ 51]: the social system where mem-
bers continuously create and share knowledge via various types of
individualinteractions,andthetechnicalsystemwherethemem-
bers utilize the technical hardware to accomplish certain collective
tasks. The theory of STS is often referenced when studying how
the technical system is able to provide efficient and reliable indi-
vidual interactions [ 24], and how the social subsystem becomes
contingent in the interactions and further affects the performance
ofthe technical subsystem[ 16].
OSS projects have been studied from the network view [ 14].
González-Barahonaetal.[ 23]proposedusingtechnicalnetworks,
where nodes are the modules in the CVS repository and edges
indicatetwomodulessharecommoncommitters,tostudytheor-
ganizationofASF projects.
Moreover,insocio-technicalsystems,governancecanbeapplied
through long-term or short-term interventions. Smith et al. [ 45]
proposed two conceptual approaches: ‘Governance on the outside’
objectifies the socio-technical and is managerial in approach. ‘Gov-
ernanceontheinside’ismorereflexiveabouttheroleofgovernance
inco-constitutingthesocio-technical.Fromthatperspective,the
ASFIcommunityisauniquesystemthathasbothoutsideinfluence
(regulations from ASF committee) and inside governance (moti-
vatedbythe projectmanagers).
2.4 ContingencyTheory
Contingencytheory is the notionthat there is no one best way to
governanorganization.Instead,eachdecisioninanorganization
mustdependonitsinternalstructure,contingentupontheexternal
context(e.g.,stakeholder[ 52],risk[10],schedule[ 54],etc.).Joslinet
al. [26] find that project success associates with the methodologies
(e.g., process,tools,methods, etc.) adopted by the project. Andnot
a single organizational structure is equally effective in all cases. As
theorganizationalcontextchangesovertime,tomaintainconsis-
tency, the project must adapt to its context accordingly. Otherwise,
conflictsandinefficiencyoccur [ 3], i.e.,one size does not fitall .
To address the conflicts caused by incompatible fitting to the
project’scontext,previousworksuggeststhinkingholistically.Lehto-
nen et al. [ 29] consider the project environment as all measurable
spatio-temporalfactorswhenaprojectisinitiated,processed,ad-
justed, and finally terminated, suggestingthat the samefactor can
haveanoppositeinfluenceontheprojectsunderadifferentcontext.

project governance to be part of the project context, concluding
that project governance can impact the use and effectiveness of
projectmethodologies.

3 HYPOTHESESAND RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Our goal is to build effective models for forecasting ASFI project
sustainability. Here, we generate our hypotheses and formulate
research questions based on prior work and the pertinent theories.
3.1 Hypotheses
STS theorysuggeststhatpublicly observableparticipation andde-
centralized contributions to software projects foster sustainable
collaborations. The ASFI ecosystem is in a form of a typical STS
wherethetechnicalactivitiesbuildasharedcodeartifactandthe
social ones mediate knowledge and organizational details to in-
dividuals. Since all activities are logged, various socio-technical
metrics can be calculated.
Our main hypothesis is that the STS formalism and the full
availability of the projects’ longitudinal digital traces, will make it
possibletobuildan accuratemodelof sustainability.Accordingto
contingencytheory,nosingleorganizationalstructureisequally
effectiveunderallcircumstances.Thus,acrossASFIprojects,weex-
pecttoseethatthesamesocio-technicalfactorsmayhavedifferent
contributionstosustainability.Finally,weposit,percontingency
theory, that the roles of some social-technical factors may vary
over time. Moreover, we expect to see that similar ASFI projects
canendwithdivergentoutcomes(graduationorretirement)over
time basedonactions they have undertaken.
3.2 Research Questions
WeformalizetheaboveintoourRQs,asfollows.Thefirstisavalida-
tion of contingency theory hypotheses, that there exist measurable
differencesbetween graduatedprojectsand retiredprojects,along
withmultiple features. Namely,
RQ1Arethere significantdifferencesamongSTS measures,be-
tween graduatedprojectsandretiredprojects?
Next,STStheoryholdsthatprojectsustainabilityisassociated
with social and technical network features. Contingency theory
implies there will be multiple such features in play. Thus, we ex-
pectthataquantitativetemporalmodelmaybefittedwelltothe

projectsare available.
RQ2Howwellcanwepredictthesustainabilitybasedontempo-
ral traces of ASFI projects? And, can we identify the determinants
alongwiththeirweightsanddirections?
To make the model useful in practice it needs more than just
accuratepredictionsofoutcomes,italsoneedsto generatetimely
adviceonwhethertheprojectshouldstaythecourseorimplement
specific corrective action to improve the graduation trajectory. We
formulate this as:RQ3Canwemonitorprojectsustainabilitystatusinacontinuous

4 DATA AND METHODS
We collected historical trace data of commits, emails, incubation
length, sponsor information, and incubation outcome for 263 ASFI
projects,whichhaveavailablearchivesofbothcommitsandemails
from03/29/2003to10/31/2019[ 57].Amongthem,176projectshave
already graduated, 46 have retired, and 41 are still in incubation.
Thelatter,projectsstillinincubation,werenotstudiedinthispaper.
WecollectedtheASFIdatafromtwosources:ASFmailinglists
and SVN commits. The mailing list archives are open access and
canbeaccessedthroughthearchivewebpage, http://mail-archives.
apache.org/mod_mbox/ . They contain allemails and commitsfrom
theproject’sASFentrydate,andarecurrent.WeconstructedURLs
for individual project files in the ASF incubator as Project URL .
The project URLs use the pattern: project-name/(YYYYMM).mbox .
For example, for project hama, the full URL is http://mail-archives.
apache.org/mod_mbox/hama-dev/201904.mbox . Eachsuch file con-
tainsamonthofmailinglistmessagesfromtheproject,forthedate
specifiedintheURL.Here devstandsfor‘emailsamongdevelopers’.
However, we findthat many projects,especiallytheseover ten
years old, which used SVN, used a bot in the devmailing list to
recordallcommits,thusamessagefrom devisnotalwaysanemail.
Similar emails were sent to the ‘commits’ mailing list, which, thus,
containssomeemails.Therefore,wecollectedboth devandcommits
mailing lists files for the 222 graduated or retired ASF Incubator
projectsthroughthe archive webpage5.
4.1 Data Pre-processing
ASFmanagesandrecordsthecommunicationsamongpeopleby
globally assigning an exclusive email name to each developer at
the project-level. However, somedevelopers still prefer to use their
personal email/name instead of the assigned one, which in turn
complicatestheidentificationofdistinctdevelopers[ 61].Weper-
formedde-aliasingforthosedeveloperswithmultiplealiasesand/or
emailaddresses,asfollows.Wefirstremovetitles(e.g.,jr.)andcom-
mon words in the name (e.g., admin, lists, group) from usernames,
then we match with both the original order and switched first/last
name order whenever names contain exactly one comma to elimi-
nateambiguousstyles.Thenwematcheachdeveloperwithher/his
multiple email addresses (if any).
Manyprojects,especiallythoseovertenyearsoldthatusedSVN,
utilizeda botfor extensive mailings(empirical evidence shows26%
of popular GitHub projects use bots) [ 55], thus forming outliers in
the dataset. Some broadcast emails are automatically generated by
theissuetrackingtool(e.g.,JIRA),andnodeveloperwouldreplyto
them. We eliminated the broadcast messages that no one replied
to, and we find many of them are generated by automated tools.
We find some developers contributed many commits by directly
changing/uploadingmassive non-sourcecodefiles(e.g.,data,con-
figuration, and image files). Since those can form outliers in the
dataset,commitstofileswithextensiondata:.json,.xml,.yml,.yaml,

As result, we identify 21,328 unique contributors (who either

mitted code, and 18,205 only posted/replied to discussions without
committing code. The remaining 1,654 contributors engaged in

gagedindiscussionactivities(i.e.,sendingemails),theremaining

4.2 STSandSocio-technical Networks
Weusesocio-technicalnetworkstoanchorourstudyofOSSSTS.
Network science approaches have been prominent in studying
complex dynamics of OSS projects [ 5,49], although the specific
definitionmayvary withdomaincontext[ 33].
In this paper,we define the projects’socio-technical structure
using social (email-based) and technical (code-based) networks,
inducedfromtheiremailstothemailinglistsandcommitstosource
files, as follows. Similar to the approach by Bird et al. [ 4], we form
a social (email) network for each project, at each month, from
the communications between developers: a directed edge from
developer AtoBexists ifBhas replied to A’s post in a thread or
ifAhas emailed Bdirectly (which is contained in the łin-reply-
tožfield).Thetechnical(code)collaborationnetworksareformed
foreachproject,ateachmonth,byincludinganundirectededge
betweendeveloper Aanddeveloper Bifbothdeveloper AandBhas
committedtothesamecodingsourcefile(s) Fthatmonth(excluding
the SVN branchnames).
4.3 Features/Metrics ofInterest
The socio-technical and project features/variables that we chose
for this study have been identified based on our discussion and
considerationoftheunderlyingtheories.Allourdataislongitudinal.
All metrics are aggregated over monthly intervals, for each project,
from the start to the end of its incubation [ 60]. We started with 29
variables, given theirstatisticsas Supplementary Material.
VariableSelection We used Lasso regression [ 50] (L1 regular-
ization) to identify a smaller set of 18 linearly independent vari-
ables, plus the outcome, described in the following. We used 𝑅’s
libraryglmnet[17]for the Lassoregression,with 𝜆=0.001.
Outcome: Graduation Status. Graduation grad_status is a bi-
naryvariable(0=‘Retired’or1=‘Graduated’)indicatingtheprojects
graduationstatusinthe incubator,as discussedabove.
Longitudinal ProjectMetrics: The number of Active Developers
num_act_devs isthecountofcontributorswhohavebeenactive
by either making commits or participating in discussions. Num-
ber ofcommits num_commits is thecount ofsource code commits
made by all committers in the project. The process of excluding
the commits that do not contain source code is described in the
Data Section. The number of Emails num_emails is the number of
emails(includingboththreadstarteremailsandreply-toemails).
num_files is thetotal number ofunique source codefiles created
duringtheincubation.Tomeasurethecontinuityofactivities,wedefinec_interruption andeasthesumofthetimeintervalsofthe
top3longestinterruptionsbetweensuccessivecommitsandsucces-
siveemails,respectively.Thecommitpercentage top_c_fract and
email percentage top_e_fract are the percentages of respective
activities performedbythe top10%contributors.
Longitudinal Socio-Technical ProjectMetrics: For each project
network,for eachmonth,weconstructed thetechnicaland social
networks, and from them calculate the number of active nodes,
c_nodes, and edges c_edges in the technical network; e_nodes
ande_edges in the social network. The prefix c_in a variable’s
nameindicatesitisofthetechnical(code)network,whiletheprefix
e_in a variable’s name indicates it is of the social (email) network.
Additionally, we calculated the mean degrees c_mean_degree and
e_mean_degree (sumofallnodes’degreedividedbythenumber
ofnodes)inthetechnicalnetworkandsocialnetwork,respectively.
We calculate the clustering coefficients c_c_coef ,e_c_coef as
the number of connected triplets divided by the number of all
tripletsinthecorrespondingmonthlynetwork.Thelong-tail-edness
c_long_tail ,e_long_tail is calculated as the degree of the 75 𝑡ℎ
percentileofnodesinthenetwork,forthemonthlynetworks,in
thetechnicalandsocialnetwork,respectively.Togetasenseofthe
range and variability in these variables, we show them aggregated
over allmonths andprojectsinTable 1.

historicalASFIrecordsintomonthlydata,foreachmonthfromthe
incubation start date to the project graduation/retirement from the
incubator. We interpret the monthly LSTM output probability as
thegraduationforecast ,i.e.,theprobabilityoftheprojecteventually
graduating.
We prepared the data as follows. We randomly divided the
projects into trainingand testsets inan 8-to-2ratio. Because we
have variables that are of very different magnitudes, and many
of those are not normally distributed, thus we choose to use the
MinMaxScaler functionto standardize allprediction variables.
Weimplementeda3-layerLSTMmodel:a64neuronsLSTMlayer,
followed by a 0 .3 rate drop-out layer, and a dense layer with the
softmaxfunctiontoyieldthepredictedoutcomeoftheclassification
task (graduate/retire). If the probability of graduating is higher
than0.5thenwepredicttheprojectwillgraduate,otherwise,we
predictitwillretire.Wevalidatedthecutoffchoicebyexaminingthe

binarycross-entropyasthelossfunctionand 𝐴𝑑𝑎𝑚astheoptimizer.
Sincethelengthofthetemporaldataofeachprojectvaries,instead
of using zero-padding, which could possibly introduce variance
to the model, we chose to use a slower but more reliable way by
only feeding one training sample at a time. We use the accuracy,
precision, recall, and 𝐹1-measure to evaluate the performance of
theLSTMmodelusingthe classification_report functionfromthe
sklearnpackage.

4.4.2 LIME-Based Interpretable Model. Black-box deep learning
models, like LSTMs, are less ideal for decision making than in-
terpretable approximations of deep learning models. One such
approachistheLocalInterpretableModel-agnosticExplanations
(LIME)[41].Givenapre-trainedmodelandaninputinstance,LIME
reasonshowtheblack-boxmodelyieldedtheoutput,byprobing
the model along each of the features. LIME yields a magnitude andasign(positiveornegative)thatcharacterizethecontributionof

Assumption LIMEassumesthatanycomplexmodelislinear(i.e.,

LIME firstartificially generateslargeenoughsamples thatare pre-
sumablyveryclosetothegivensample(bysomedistancemeasure).
Then,bytrainingonthepredictionsofthosenewlygeneratedsam-
ples given by the complex model, LIME can locally approximate
the complex model using linear models, thereby presenting the
coefficients ofvariables of the inputinstance.

LSTMmodel5,000timesbyfeedingitthenewlygeneratedsamples.
LIME uses a similarity/distance function to measure the impor-
tance of each new sample on the locality of the instance to be
explained. Lastly, LIME fits a weighted linear model dataset, and
the explanations all come from the final linear model. Since the
LIMEframeworkrequiresallsamplestohavethesameshape,we

Project-specific vsOverallModeling WeusedtheLIMEresults
intwo modeling ways: project-specific level and overalllevel.In the
former, we used LIME to obtain the monthly coefficient of each
variable and then aggregated them over all months to obtain a
project-specific coefficient. In the latter, we aggregated project-
specific coefficients over all ASFI projects to obtain the coefficients
for eachvariable over allprojects.
5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
5.1 RQ1:Graduatedvs. RetiredProjects
To perform exploratory data analysis, we first contrast ASFI gradu-
atedandretiredprojectsalongthetechnical(code-based)andsocial
(email-based)dimensionsinour data.

We observe notable differencesas follows. The medianincubation
monthsofretiredprojectsis significantlyhigher thanofthegrad-
uatedprojects,suggestingthatretirementisnotaneasydecision,
andthatperhapsnecessarytimeisgiventoprojectstochangetheir
trajectories andachieve graduation.
Graduated projects also tend to have more code commits and
more email communications, implying that, in terms of criteria for
graduation, the ASF community values both technical contribution
(as commits) and social communication (as emails), and both of
themmaybeofimportanceinbuildingasustainablecommunity.
Such results also motivate us to expand our research goals from
descriptive data to inferential data with more complex network
features.
Across both the social and technical networks, the network size
varies for the graduated projects, indicating that projects of any
size can be sustainable, and it also suggests that project size can
beusedasacontrolinmodeling.Thenotabledifferencebetween
graduated and retired projects, and the lack of variance in network
sizes in the retired projects suggests recruitment difficulties in the
latter,exposing themto significant risksas people leave.
Answer to RQ1:We observe significant differences across

5.2 RQ2:Interpretable Forecasting
Here we present the results of training an LSTM model on our
ASFI data, and an LSTM-derived LIME model on the same data,
using the methods as described above. We use those models for
forecastingbyeachmonthintotheprojecttheeventualgraduation
outcome.First,weshowtheperformancecurvesoftheLSTMmodel,
over time, in Figure 3. The overall accuracy, and F1-value, and
theirstandarderrors(greyarea),forthefullmodelandthemodel
without the socio-technical variables, suggest an excellent and
stable predictive performance of the trained LSTM model, with
significantcontributionfromthesocio-technicalnetworks.Asearly
as month 8the accuracyis93%,andstaying above after that.
ThetotalincubationtimevariessignificantlyacrossASFIprojects.
Whileformostprojectstheincubationtimeisbetween8months
and 25 months, some spend more than 30 months in incubation,
whileothers only 6months,asshown in the insetplotin Figure 3.
Thus,themodel’sperformancedecreasesforprojectswithbelow
8andabove25incubationmonths,duetoinsufficientdataabove
andbelowthosevalues.
Next, we apply LIME to understand and interpret the LSTM
model and derive regression-like coefficients for the features in the
socio-technical networks. To illustrate how to interpret the results

trajectory changed, and then changed again, we looked through
theirdiscussionsonthe mailinglist.
In the month with the lowest graduation forecast, the project
released a major version of their software, following which the
committers showed less activity. We also noticed that the ASF
incubator Project Management Committee (PMC) routinely sent
an email to the project asking for the periodically report6, but
such reportswere notrequested formore than 2monthsafterthe
release. Lastly, we saw email arguments on the technical direction
for the project’s future development. Unsurprisingly the project
was going to fail if no one observes such situation and takes action
tointervene.However,anemailfromoneofthemajorcontributors,

5.4 RQ3:Actionable Recommendation
We start with a caveat. Precise actionable models require inter-
ventionsandrandomizedexperiments.Ourmodelsarenotbased
onsuchexperiments,andanyactionabilitywederivefromthem
must, therefore, be less powerful than those. At best, our experi-
mentscanbeconsidered naturalexperiments ,asubclassofquasi-
experiments where the class assignment is not controlled by theexperimenter. Thus, any interventions we suggest here must be
validated experimentally in order to avoid large uncertainties in
outcomes.Withthatcaveatinmind,wesoughttoanswer,tothe

event of a 0.3 magnitude in their forecast probability curve. Of
thoseprojectsthathavenotexperienceddownturns,theaverage
incubation time was 16 months, versus 28 months for projects that
have had downturns, implying an association between downturns
and length of stay in the incubator. We note that the upturn events
tendtobeassociatedwithASFmentors’intervention.Thisisconsis-
tent with one of the responsibilities of ASF mentors: to watch over
the projects they are mentoring and keep them on track. However,
downturneventsdonotcorrelatesimilarlywithextrinsicevents;
wethinktheytendtobemorerelatedtoprojects’internalevents,

shows that the median bounce-up time is about 2.5, and, respec-
tively,3.5monthsfordropsof0%-5%,and,respectively, >5%inthe
graduation forecast. We also noted that graduated projects seem to
bounce-upfasterthanretiredprojects.So,weusethemedianofthe

ğ3Ecosystem andproject-specific fine-tuning. Ourstrategycan

that for graduated projects (in green) there is an apparent upward

stage development deserves more attention from project managers.
From month 6 to month 12 we do not observe a significant change,

However, we find increasing variance in months 12 through 18.
One possible reason is that many graduated projects achieve their

thuslowering the graduationforecast.Theseconsiderationscan be
taken into account during forecastmonitoring, with more frequent
monitoring chosen or increased attention paid at times around

Werecognizethatsomesocio-technicalelementsaremoredif-

that some projects can easier modify some features than can other

Mechanistically,herearesomepossiblereasonsforwhyfeatures,
e.g., number of commits/files, may have different effects across
projects.First,havingmuchmorethantheusualamountofcode

be the result of a project pivoting which may lead to longer stay

them(e.g.,bugs,documentation,mentoring,andtraining),resulting
in code quality issues and technical debt, especially for smaller

increase in commits and/or file touches may mean not having time
for propercommunication,whichcanslow progress andresultin
community collapse. In effect, the coefficients of the same factor
can vary underdifferentprojectcontexts.
Lastly,awordofcaution.Intermsofexpectationsthatincluding

even if not correlated, the effect of increasing multiple features

Answer to RQ3: Our strategy can be used as a monitoring
toolthatfeedssuggestionsintodevelopers’decisionprocess.
Project-specific features can be selected from the suggestions
forinterventionwhenexperiencingdownturns.Thealgorithm
can be made bespoke by introducing more frequent monitor-

What actually happened in the project is that that initial period

6 THREATS TO VALIDITYAND CONCLUSION
Threats.First, our commit and email data is from only hundreds
of projects ASF incubator projects. Thus, generalizing the impli-
cations beyond ASF, or even beyond the ASF Incubator projects
carriespotentialrisks.ExpandingthedatasetbeyondASF,e.g.,with
additionalprojectsfromotheropen-sourcedincubatorprojectscan
lowerthisrisk. Second,we do not considercommunicationsother
than through the ASF mailing lists. However, ASF’s policies and
regulationsinsistonthe useof mailinglists,which lowersthis risk.
Lastly,interpretingdeeplearningmodelsisstillanart,andLIME
models are approximations. They may be particularly sensitive to

in this paper may result in changes of more than one variable, e.g.,
increase the active developers may also increase the number of
commits.
Conclusion. Understanding why many nascent projects have
failed may help others improve their individual practice, organiza-
tionalmanagement,andinstitutionalstructure.Hereweshowed
7http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/commonsrdf-dev/that quantitative network science approaches combined with state-
of-the-art AI methods can effectively model ASF incubator project
sustainability, from a novel longitudinal dataset of socio-technical
contributions in ASFI projects, more narrow in scope than general
OSS projects but with extrinsic graduation/sustainability labels.
We also demonstrated the combined power of mixed methods:
both quantitative and qualitative studies. Through case studies,
we identified specific reasons for success and failure of projects,
complementing our models. Finally, we developed a strategy for
translational use of the models in practice. Our methods make it
