When engineering safety-critical systems like medical devices, it is
of vital importance to ensure the system design meets the safety

mps [40]”. Design reviews, sometimes carried out by independent
inspectors, are one of the main methods for ascertaining the satis-
faction of safety requirements. In fact, one of the most widely used
industrial standards for embedded systems—IEC 61508 [ 31]—rates
design reviews as Highly Recommended (the highest importance
rating)for allsystemsat all criticality levels.
The design of a software-intensive system often involves model-
ing. Modeling techniques have received wide industry acceptance,
especiallyincriticaldomainslikeavionicsandtelecommunications,
wherestate-basedmodelsareprevalentfordescribingsystembe-
haviors. These models consist of a finite set of states including the
start state(s), a set of events (or “inputs”), and a transition func-
tionthatdeterminesthenextstatebasedonthecurrentstateand
event [9]. Many variants exist, e.g., Statecharts specifying “Remote
Identification” and other features at AT&T [ 45], RSML (require-
ments state machine language) adopted by the FAA to regulate
collisionavoidance installed on commercial aircrafts [36], etc.
With the use of model-driven engineering being on the rise,
state-basedmodelsbecomelargerandmorecomplex.Thispresents
asignificantchallengefordesignreviews,wheretheinspectormay
have to browse through the models and manually analyze large
numbers of links between safety requirements and design mod-
els [11]. Automated requirements traceability [ 18,30] can alleviate
this challenge, e.g., information retrieval algorithms rely on the
textual information of requirements and that of model elements to
establishplausibletraceability[10].
Inmodel-richbutnotnecessarilytext-richsituations,researchers
havedeveloped slicingtechniquestoautomatically identifythose
modelelementsrelatedtoagiveninterest(e.g.,aneventorachang-
ing requirement) [ 9]. For instance, the seminal work by Korel et
al.[35] analyzed data and control dependencies for backward slic-
ing, and more recently, Nejati et al.[44] used reachability analysis
to perform forward slicing. While the resulting slice (trace) typi-
callybearsarecallvaluecloseto100%,theprecisionlevelisvery
low. For example, forward slicing combined with natural language
processing achieved the best performance in tracing 16 require-
mentschangestothedesignmodels,andeventhisbestperformance
hadanaverageprecision ofonly29 .4%[44],meaningthata large
number of false positives were generated.
In thispaper,we present a novelapproach to tackling thefalse
positives that have plagued automated traceability research for
decades [ 10,18,30,49,67]. The idea is to intentionally generate
many “false positives” from a state-based model (i.e., the tracingtarget) and then to check whether a safety requirement (i.e., thetracing source) is met in them in order to find the actual slice-
trace.Ourkeyinsightisthatfalsepositivesare“close”tothemodel

This section uses a water distiller example adapted from [ 24]t o

IEC 61508 [ 31] defines functional safety as part of the overall
safetyrelating to the equipment under control (e.g., the water dis-
tiller). The goal is to ensure that any safety-related system must
work correctly or fail in a predictable, safe way. In our running

an EFSM consists of states (including an initial state and an exit

aneventoccursandtheguard(conditionpredicate)associatedwith
the transition is evaluated to be true. During a transition, some
action (input/output operation, variable manipulation, etc.) may be
performed.
Figure 1 shows a SysML SMD design depicting the intended
behaviorofthewaterdistiller.Inthisparticulardesignwith9states
and15transitions,therealtraceoftherequirement,“preventing
the water level from staying low,” consists of only three states (i.e.,

The model elements in the real trace (also known as the answer

safety requirementsrather thanby thedesign. Forexample, anin-
dependent inspector not involved in the construction of the SysMLmodels would be interested solely in “water level being low or not”

performedorifthereisashutdownstateintheSMDdesign.Inthe
running example, therefore, we designate “water level” to be the
onlypointofinterestandexplainhowbackwardslicing[ 35]and
forward slicing [ 44] work based on this point of interest (slicing
criterion).
•Backwardslicing (BS)identifiesthosemodelelementsthat
affect“water level”by analyzingthedefine-use dependen-
cies of this interested data variable. Beginning with the exit
state of Figure 1, the BS algorithm [ 35] traverses the SMD
backward and selects {s6,s5,s4,s3,s2}to be the model slice.
•Forward slicing (FS)identifiesthosemodelelementsthat
are being affected by “water level” via reachability analy-sis. Beginning with the initial state, the FS algorithm [
44]
traverses the SMD in a forward manner and returns the
reachable subset of {s3,s4,s5,s6,s7,s8,s9}as the model slice.
It is important to point out that, given the safety requirement
of “preventing the water level from staying low”, we follow the
essencesofthestate-of-the-art[ 35,44]togeneratethecandidate
traceabilitylinks.With {s4,s5,s7}serving as the answer set of the
runningexample,BSachievestherecall=67%andprecision=40%,

Figure 2 presents the TIM underlying our work. While “require-
ment” is a central artifact type, the “tracing source” of Figure 2shows it is the mitigation of “hazard”-contributing “fault” thatgives rise to this specific type of functional safety “requirement”.
Referringtotheexamplementionedearlier,“automaticroboticarm
stoppage” (requirement) is needed to mitigate the “velocity sensor
failure” (fault), which in turn contributes to the danger of “moving
the patient’s arm at an excessive velocity” (hazard) [ 25,40]. This
shows the human-centric nature surrounding the “tracing source”
of Figure 2, as the causal chain of reasoning involved in this thera-

expertise. Methods like fault tree analysis (FTA) [ 58] and failure
modes and effects analysis (FMEA) [ 64] can facilitate but cannot
replace the manual work in safety requirements engineering.
Since requirements engineering must span the gap between
theinformalworldofstakeholderneedsandtheformalworldof
software systems behavior, the key question over the use of formal
methods is not whetherto formalize, but whento formalize [ 52].

linkthe“tracingsource”and“tracingtarget”ofFigure2.InourTIM,
each SMD design “verifies” one or more “safety properties”. These
properties are derived from the functional safety requirements and
are formulated into temporal logic formulas amenable to modelchecking. Our TIM places the derivation and formulation of the
safetypropertiesinside “tracingsource”,emphasizing thehuman-
centricnature of these activities.
On the “tracing target” side of Figure 2 is the SMD, which is
typicallyused in SysMLto modelthe behaviorof critical compo-
nents,suchashardware,software,data,personnel,procedures,and
facilities[ 53].Wheninspectingfunctionalsafetydoesnotrequire
anentireSMDdesign,itbecomesvaluabletoidentifythespecific
modelelements(i.e.,thesubsetofstatesandtheirtransitions).This
subsetrepresentsa modelslice ofawholeSMD,andinthispaper,

thetraceabilitylinks with respect to a given safety requirement.
Although tracing is aimed at identifying the specific states and
transitions, Figure 2 shows that the SMD semantics are definedalso by “trigger”, “guard”, and “effect”. In our running exampleof Figure 1, water temp
=100is a “change event” and shutdown
command isa“signalevent”,both triggeringthewaterdistillerto
alter its behavior. A “time event”, for instance, could trigger the
scheduledmaintenance at noon, September 1, 2019 (notshown in
Figure 1), and in many occasions, “guard” like ! sludge ok specifies
thecondition thatmust betruefor atransition tohappen.Finally,
“effect” in Figure 2 represents an action invoked directly on the
object that owns the state machine as a result of transitioning into
a state [53], e.g., open drain orshut valves.
The TIM of Figure 2 delineates the focuses of our work pre-
sented in this paper. For example, it is beyond our current scope to
trace a single safety property over multiple SMDs or over differenttypes of SysML models like internal block and activity diagrams.
With manual effort in specifying safety properties, our objective is
to automatically and accurately slice the SMD design to find the
traceabilitylinksforthe criticalrequirements.
4 MUTATION-DRIVEN TRACEABILITY
We tackle the low precision challenge faced by contemporary trac-
ing algorithms from a new angle: Rather than striving for defining
an accurate tracing mechanism which often ends up with many
imperfectlinks,ourcoreideaistocreatemanyimperfecttracing
targetsandthentakefulladvantageofthemtodiscoverthelinks.
TheseimperfecttracingtargetsaremutantsoftheSMDdesign,and
ourentire approach shown in Figure 3 is driven by them.
An important check is performed before the mutants are gener-
ated.Thisisrepresentedbythedecisionnode(diamond)inFigure3.

mutants killed), the more effective the test set. In mutation testing,
onlyfaultsconstructedfromseveralsimplesyntacticchangesare

all programs differing from a correct one by only simple errors
is so sensitive that it also implicitly distinguishes more complex
errors.”Oneofthefirstsetofmutationoperatorswasimplemented
in the Mothra system [ 34] and contained 22 operators, ranging

ment(changing),ordeletion(removing).Differentfrommutating
a program that is textual, we automatically mutate the graphical
SMD by first exporting the model into an xmi file. We perform this
step in the Cameo MagicDraw tool [51].
We developed a Python script to modify M.xmi: Removing an
existing model element (mo 2,m o5,o rm o7), changing its syntactic
property(mo 4,mo8,mo10,mo11,mo12,mo13,ormo15),andadding
anincorrectone(mo 3,mo9,ormo14).Duetotherathercomplex
subsumptionrelationsinvolvedinmo 1andmo 6,theyarenotim-
plemented in our current Python script. Each resulting M’.xmi
corresponds to one single syntactic change in one location (i.e.,
applyingonlyonemutationoperator),thoughthesameoperator
at one location may generate more than one mutant, e.g., mo 10
applied to t4 (“water temp = 100”) of Figure 1 outputs five mu-
tants byreplacing“=” with“ <”, “≤”,“!=”, “≥”, and“>”. Ourcurrent
SMD mutation implementation is trying to be comprehensive asour goal is to use M’for tracing; selective mutation is investigated
experimentally in Section 5.
4.2 Verifying Model Mutants
Oncethe SMDmutantsare created, they undergo model checking
soastoautomaticallyverifythesafetyproperty P.Aninnovative
aspect of our implementation is to leverage LTL model checking
within process mining (i.e., the ProM tool [ 56,66]). Process mining
employs data mining algorithms to extract operational knowledge
from event logs [ 65]. These event logs record instances (or “cases”)
ofsomeunderlyingprocess(e.g.,thatofgrantingsabbatical),but
automatically extracting that process is difficult when there is a
lotofflexibility[ 66].Ourmodelmutantsareagoodfittoprocess
mining in that flexibility of each mutant is restricted to a single,
simple, and syntactic change over the original SMD M.
Figure 4 shows a sample event log recording our running exam-
ple’s SMD, and for comparison purposes, one mutant’s records are
also displayed (namely, mo 4applied to t5). Figure 4 highlights the

mark a mutant is killed if its model checking fails (i.e., the injected
fault causes Pto no longer be satisfied2); otherwise, the mutant is
survived.
One of the killed mutants in the running example is “flipping
t5” shown in the bottom of Figure 4. Compared to Mthat allows
the water level to be low for some time before not being low even-
tually, the “flipping t5” mutant fails to meet the safety property
Pexpressed in formula (2). For instance, a traversal containing
“...s4→s5→s4→s7...”,whichispermittedin M,isnolonger
valid due to the injected fault. Thus, model checking PonM’effec-
tively distinguishes the faults directly violating the safety property
from the remaining faults whose negative effects are not observed
via automated verification.

5 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
5.1 Research Questions
We set out to answer three research questions.
RQ1:Howaccurateisourproposedmutation-driventraceability
approach?
While overcoming the low precision challenge is our primary
goal, we do not want our approach to hurt recall. Our measures
forRQ1alsoincludeF 1whichistheharmonicmeanofrecalland
precision defined as F 1=2×precision×recall
precision +recall. We use the state-of-
the-artBS[ 35]andFS[ 44]algorithmsintroducedinSection2as
baselinesfor accuracycomparisons.
RQ2:How to best operate our approach in practical settings?
When no answer set is available, fully automated solution is
preferred.AsourautomatedimplementationisbuiltupontheProM
tool, we investigate here the influence of threshold_ Kvalue on
tracing accuracy. In our tracing algorithm presented in Figure 5,
threshold_ Kis a key condition to identify potentially removablestates. Discovering an optimal threshold range can readily transfer
our approach into ProM tooling, especially in terms of delivering a
new traceability service with a calibrated correlation analysis.
RQ3:How can selective mutation be instrumented in our ap-
proach?
Because mutation’s cost is not negligible, reducing effort is of
practical value. RQ3thus examines one way toward selective mu-
tationinformedbyfeatureablation[ 26]:byremovingthemutation
operatorsinaspecificcategory(e.g.,“state”),weareinterestedin

not be set while the vehicle’s speed is high, which mitigates the
risk of accident.
The “tracing target” parts of Table 3 show that the average size
of the SMD designs of ACC and PS is about 14 states and 17–22

therefore to identify all the real traces and only the real traces.
5.3 Results
Theanswersto RQ1ontracingaccuracyaresummarizedinTable4
where the average recall, precision, and F 1values are reported.
The BS algorithm [ 35] misses a few true links in ACC and quite
some in PS. One reason is that, when a state has multiple outgoing
transitions, slicing backward from the exit state often fails to cover
thosebranchesthatrequireforwardtracing.Forexample,inPS’s
tracing of a liveness property ensuring braking is applied whenRPM is close to 4000, BS is unable to reach the braking paths ofthe SMD and covers only the paths by following RPM’s define-
use dependencies. In contrast, the FS algorithm [ 44] achieves 100%
recall based on its reachability analysis; however, its results areTable4:TracingAccuracy(BSreferstobackwardslicing[35],

isthathighervaluesofthreshold_ Kfacilitatesthecondition,cor-

ever, too high of a value will cause few states to satisfy: correla-

RQ3is aimed at exploring ways to reduce the cost of our ap-
proach. As our current implementation favors comprehensiveness,

Python script took about 9 days, and model checking them within
ProMtookroughly2hours.Iflessnumbersofmutantscoulddeliver

learning, feature ablation is designed to assess the informativeness

when comparing theperformance of an approach trained with all

5.4 Threatsto Validity
Wediscusssomeofthemostimportantfactorsthatmustbecon-
sidered when interpreting our experimental results. A threat to
constructvalidityisourchoiceofmeasuringthe tracingaccuracy
basedonlyontherelevantstates;inparticular,weexcludethetran-sitions in the answer set definition. The states and their transitionsareclearlyrelated,andourrationaleisnottoover-penalizeanauto-
mated and scalable method for missing correct model elements or
returningincorrectones.Thefeedbackfromtheexpertdevisingthe
answer set recommends using transitions as anchoring constructs
because “they inject the state machine with life stories.”
A threat to internal validity concerns the quality of the safety
properties expressed in LTL formulas. As we manually performed
this task, we relied on the decision node of “model checking P
onM” in Figure 3 to make sure the SMD design models [ 43,61]
met the LTL properties. A confounding factor is the number of
variables (e.g., “speed”, “RPM”, etc.) expressed in the properties, as
thevariablesplayakeyroleinouroperationsoftheBS[ 35]and
FS [44] algorithms. Table 3 shows that each LTL property contains
anaverageoftwovariables;however,thetracingaccuracyofBS,
FS, and our own approach is likely to be influenced by this number
and ourresults must be interpreted with this in mind.
As far as the external validity is concerned, our experimental
subjectsarebothdrawnfromtheautomotivedomain,andtherefore

6 RELATED WORK
To position our work in the existing literature, we review three
strands of research: tracing safety-critical requirements, slicing
state-based design models, and mutation analysis.

Slicinghasbeenmostlyappliedtosourcecodeinordertolocate
thepartsoftheprogram thataffectauser-specifiedpointofinter-
est (known as the slicing criterion) [ 63]. Since Weiser’s seminal
workonprogramslicing[ 70],researchershaveinvestigatedslicing
in state-based models [ 9]. Of particular relevance to our work is
applyingmodelslicingtosupportsafetyinspections.Nejatiandher
colleagues [ 46] presented a comprehensive framework with con-

safetyrequirementsandSysMLmodels.Acontrolledexperiment
quantified the benefits of using design slices in terms of increasing
the correctness of conformance decisions from 50% to 63% and
reducingtheeffortofsafetyinspectionsby27%[ 11].Toimprove
the automated traceability, Nejati et al.[44] used reachability anal-
ysis to perform forwarding slicing. This state-of-the-art serves as a
baseline in our evaluation, though two important differences shall
benoted.First,theTIMof[ 44]includesSysML’sblockdefinition
diagrams and activity diagram, whereas our tracing target is fo-
cused on SMDmodels.Second, the slicing criterionof [ 44] consists
of a specific requirements change, whereas our slicing criterion isgiveninanLTLformulacapturingrequirementssafety.Although
LTL formula and model checking have been used in model slic-ing [
21,54], to our best knowledge, none of the existing slicing
approachesperforms model checking on millions of mutants.
In mutation analysis, faults are automatically seeded into the

this distinction. A test set’s effectiveness can then be scored on the
proportionofthekilledmutants,andadditionaltestcasescanbe

have also applied mutation analysis to reveal faults and to guidethe generation of new test cases [
2,8,28,62]. Our work differs
fundamentallyfrompriorresearchinthatourintentionisnottokill as many mutants as possible, but to use the killed-survived
distinctionto automatically trace safety requirements.
7 CONCLUSIONS
We have presented a mutation-driven approach to tracing safety
requirementsandSMDinSysMLmodeling.Notonlyistheconcep-
tualframework depicted, but an automated implementation based
on model checking within process mining is developed. Experi-
mental results show the precision improvements, and the practical
supportthatcanbedeliveredasProMplug-ins(especiallyourSMD
mutationscript and calibrated correlation analysis).
The novelty of our work lies in our creation of many imper-
fecttracingtargets,leadingtonewwaysofestablishingtraceabil-
ity links. Our future work includes expanding the TIM to han-dle more complex requirements with socio-technical interdepen-dencies [
12,50], improving the usability of the model slices with
visualization and executability [ 38,48], and integrating the new
generationofdeeplearningbasedrefactoringmethodsforintelli-
gently identifying mutation locations or mutant names [ 33,37,69]
to further enhance tracing capabilities.
