ABSTRACT
Software engineering candidates commonly participate in white-
board technical interviews as part of a hiring assessment. During
these sessions, candidates write code while thinking aloud as they
work towards a solution, under the watchful eye of an interviewer.
While technical interviews should allow for an unbiased and inclu-
sive assessment of problem-solving ability, surprisingly, technical
interviews may be instead a procedure for identifying candidates
who best handle and migrate stress solely caused by being examined
by an interviewer (performance anxiety).
To understand if coding interviews—as administered today—can
induce stress that significantly hinders performance, we conducted
a randomized controlled trial with 48 Computer Science students,
comparing them in private and public whiteboard settings. We
found that performance is reduced by more than half, by simply
being watched by an interviewer. We also observed that stress and
cognitive load were significantly higher in a traditional technical in-
terview when compared with our private interview. Consequently,
interviewers may be filtering out qualified candidates by confound-
ing assessment of problem-solving ability with unnecessary stress.
We propose interview modifications to make problem-solving as-
sessment more equitable and inclusive, such as through private
focus sessions and retrospective think-aloud, allowing companies
to hire from a larger and diverse pool of talent.

Most companies in the software industry administer a technical
interview as a procedure for hiring a software developer [ 3,49].
Companies believe technical interviews offer a “reasonably consis-
tent evaluation of problem-solving ability, communication skills,
and preparedness” [ 75]. Technical interviews can also give visibility
to the personality of the candidate, how they interact with their
future colleagues and how much they pay attention to details—such
as checking all possible test cases—and knowledge of programming
languages. Companies also find it important to reduce unwanted
stress [ 8] during a technical interview, as “not everyone does their
best work in fast-paced, high-pressure situations” [ 52]. In principle,
companies should expect the technical interview process to be a
sound and fair assessment of a candidate’s ability, and thus yield a
steady stream of qualified candidates for positions that open up in
the company.
Technical interviews can also introduce other effects on can-
didates who report unexpectedly “bombing” [ 50], “freezing” [ 67],
or “choking” [ 59] during this critical hiring procedure. Through a
happy accident, the software industry has seemingly reinvented
a crude yet effective instrument for reliably introducing stress in
subjects, which typically manifests as performance anxiety [78]. A
technical interview has an uncanny resemblance to the trier social
stress test [41], a procedure used for decades by psychologists and
is the best known “gold standard” procedure [ 1] for the sole pur-
pose of reliably inducing stress. The trier social stress test involves
having a subject prepare and then deliver an interview-style pre-
sentation and perform mental arithmetic, all in front of an audience.
Alone, none of these actions consistently induce stress in a subject;
however, the unique combination of cognitive-demanding tasks
with a social-evaluative threat (essentially being watched) is consis-
tent and powerful. If a technical interview is essentially a de facto
version of a trier social stress test, then the implications can be
profound. Rather than measuring the few that answer correctly in a
timely manner, companies are most likely measuring the ability of
the few who perform well under stress [ 31]. Rather than measuring
explanation skills, companies are most likely measuring the ability
of candidates to handle or mitigate stress (e.g. through practice [ 58]).
Finally, rather than avoiding unwanted stress, technical interviews
may be inadvertently designed with the sole purpose of inducing it.
To understand how to maintain the desirable goals of a technical
interview (e.g. measure time and correctness), while mitigating
the undesirable effects of stress, we created a design probe [ 77]
which removed the social-evaluative threat component of a techni-
cal interview. To this end, we designed an interview format where
participants privately solved a technical problem on a whiteboard,
without any monitoring or interaction with an interviewer. We
evaluated this format in a randomized controlled trial to under-
stand the impact of stress during a technical interview and whether
481

we could isolate and dampen its influence. We then compared this
to a typical interview format, where a candidate used talk-aloud
to explain their problem-solving in front of a proctor. Participants
wore specialized eye-tracking glasses, which allowed us to obtain
measurements associated with high cognitive load and stress. We
then compared the correctness, self-reported experiences, and cog-
nitive load and stress levels of participants across the interview
settings.
We found that participants reported high levels of stress and
often had difficulty coping with someone else being present while
they attempted to solve a cognitively-demanding task. The impact
on performance was drastic: nearly twice as many participants
failed to solve the problem correctly, and the median correctness
score was cut more than half, when simply being watched. In con-
trast, participants in the private setting reported feeling at ease,
having time to understand the problem and reflect on their solution.
Finally, measures of cognitive load and stress were significantly
lower in the private setting, and majority of participants solved
the problem correctly. We also observed that no women success-
fully solved the problem in the public setting, whereas all women
solved it correctly in the private setting. Standard NASA-TLX pro-
cedure [ 35] and various cognitive metrics, provided evidence that
higher rates of stress could causally explain these differences across
groups.
We suggest that private interview settings have considerable
advantages for candidates, that both reduce their stress and allow
more accurate assessment of their problem-solving abilities. The
implications of this work include several guidelines for more effec-
tive administrations of coding interviews. By offering the ability to
solve a problem in private, even if only for an initial few minutes,
it could substantially increase the amount of qualified candidates,
particularly in traditionally underrepresented groups, entering the
workforce. Furthermore, we can expect these changes to minimize
or mitigate other problematic effects experienced by candidates—
such as stereotype threat—that impact interview performance but
are orthogonal to assessing candidates’ actual problem-solving abil-
ities.
2 METHODOLOGY
The goal of our experiment was to understand whether being
watched causes stress in participants and affects their problem-
solving. We designed a block randomized controlled trial [ 72] to
compare a traditional version of a technical interview (our control)
with an experimental condition involving a private problem-solving
session (our treatment). Participants were randomly assigned to a
condition, performing the same task—a between-subjects design.
In this section, we describe our experimental settings and the data
we collected to measure the effects of our experiment.
2.1 Participants
We recruited 50 undergraduate and graduate students at NC State
University (12 identified as female), who participated in our study.
Students were required to have knowledge of Java or any other
high-level programming languages and previous course experience
in algorithms and data structures. We made sure that students had
the typical knowledge required for a technical interview, includingconstructing data structures, implementing search and sorting al-
gorithms, and characterizing running time and space requirements.
Furthermore, students represent potential technical interview can-
didates, as many were actively engaged in their initial job search
prior to graduation. To use head mounted eye-trackers as a part of
our study, participants had to have normal or corrected-to-normal
vision. They received extra course credit through an experiment
pool and could end the experiment at any time. The study was
approved by the local ethics board. The first and second authors of
the paper conducted the study.
To estimate our population size for our study, we used the results
of our pilot study to obtain estimators for effect size. Through a
power analysis of 2-sample 1-sided test with 80% power and 5%
Type I error [ 19], we found that approximately 18 participants
would be required in each group.
2.2 Pilots and Tasks
We ran pilot studies at the authors’ institutions. During our pilots,
we experimented with tasks that would satisfy the following criteria:
be solvable within the time limits of the experiment, demonstrate
sufficient difficulty such that cognitive load can be induced and is
not trivial to solve, and have ecological validity—the problem should
be similar to those used in actual interviews. Based on feedback and
observations during the pilot studies, we found some tasks were
too complex, where participants would quickly give up after a few
minutes, and some tasks too ambiguous, which required too many
clarification questions. Ultimately, we found the following problem
satisfied all our criteria: Longest Substring Without Repeating Char-
acters . The problem can be found in “Elements of Programming
Interviews in Java (13.9)” [ 3] and represents a class of problems
related to string manipulation, a concept most candidates should
be familiar with. For example, we did not want to conflate a lack of
familiarity with complex data structures (heaps or red-black trees)
or specialized algorithms (dynamic programming or quicksort) with
interview performance. Furthermore, the problem itself contains a
large solution space with multiple possible approaches, including
a brute force solution and other more sophisticated approaches.
Finally, we note that—within the past six months—this coding ques-
tion has been used in technical interviews at well-known software
companies such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Facebook,
Adobe, and Uber.1
2.3 Procedure
2.3.1 Onboarding. Using a script, the experimenter verbally shared
the details of the study with participants. Participants were in-
formed they would be wearing a pair of mobile eye-tracker glasses
and recorded audio and video footage would be collected. After
consent was obtained, participants filled out a pre-survey to obtain
background information.
2.3.2 Interview Formats. We created two interview settings: pub-
lic setting andprivate setting (see Figure 1). In the public setting,
wearing an eye-tracker, participants solved the technical interview
problem in the presence of an experimenter. The participant was

instructed to talk-aloud while solving the task, which is a standard
practice in technical interviews [ 29,49]. The lab space contained a
whiteboard at the front of the room. An experimenter was situated
near the participant for the entire session without interrupting
participants’ thought process. If a participant asked for clarifica-
tion, the response was brief. For example, if a participant asked,
“Does this look correct”, the experimenter was instructed to reply,
“Complete to the best of your ability”.
In the private setting, participants were provided a private room
with a whiteboard to solve the technical interview problem in isola-
tion. Participants were provided a private room with a whiteboard.
Participants were informed that the experimenter will step out of
the room and will not return while they are solving the problem.
Thus, they had to make sure that there is no questions left for
them. When the participant was ready to begin the task, they wore
the eye-trackers, the door was closed, and the participant worked
in privacy, until the task was completed within allotted time. Af-
ter the experiment, we clarified with participants if they had any
uncertainty about the problem they just solved.
2.3.3 Apparatus. Participants wore a head-mounted mobile eye
tracking device, SMI Eye Tracking Glasses 2W (SMI-ETG), which
participants wore as normal glasses. The SMI-ETG captures both
the environment with a high-definition scene camera (960x760
pixel resolution, 30 frames per second), and the participant’s eye
movements (60 Hz) with binocular inner cameras positioned at the
bottom rim of the glasses. The glasses were connected to a mobile
recording unit, a customized Samsung Android device. The SMI-
ETG is capable of providing metrics related to eye measurements,
such as fixations, saccades, and pupil size and projecting the gaze
point onto the visual scene and exporting into a video [27].
2.3.4 Eyetracking Data. For each participant and task, we collected
screen recordings in video format (at 30 frames per second) and a
time-indexed data file containing all eye movements and measure-
ments recorded by the eye-tracking instrument.2
2.3.5 Calibration. Calibration improves the accuracy of measure-
ments collected from an eye tracking device. Before calibration,
we ensured that the eye-tracker fit comfortably by adjusting the
2Collected eye-tracking data can be found at: https://go.ncsu.edu/technical_interviewsnose bridge. We asked participants to confirm that they do not
have difficulty seeing the coding area on the board. To perform
the calibration, we initiated the calibration software and then we
asked participants to fixate on three markers on the board. Target
markers were selected in such a way that they cover different gaze
angles.
2.3.6 Experiment. Participants received a printed problem state-
ment. The printout also included three examples, which indicated
what the expected output would be when given an input. For exam-
ple, “Given the input abcabcbb , the answer is abc, with the length
3.” We asked participants to provide a reasonable solution written
in a programming language of their choice. We emphasized that
their thought process and correctness of the solution were impor-
tant while efficiency and syntax were secondary. Participants could
freely use basic utility functions such as sort , if desired.
We asked participants to confirm their understanding of the prob-
lem before proceeding. The experiment ended when the participant
completed the task or a 30 minute time limit had passed. After the
experiment, the participant completed a post-survey and a NASA
Task Load Index (TLX) questionnaire [ 35] to collect information of
participants’ self-evaluation about their performance. We designed
our post-survey to subjectively complement the questions of the
NASA-TLX questionnaire.
3 ANALYSIS
We analyzed the data to assess performance on the task, measure
the resulting cognitive load, and to identify possible sources of
stress or cognitive load.
3.1 Measuring Correctness and Complexity of
Solutions
We scored the code against the following test cases, which were
also provided to participants:
(1)Consecutive letters in a substring. For example, given
the input ‘ abcabcbb ’, the output is ‘abc’.
(2)Only one letter. For example, given the input ‘ bbbbb ’, the
output is ‘b’.
483ESEC/FSE ’20, November 8–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA Mahnaz Behroozi, Shivani Shirolkar, Titus Barik, and Chris Parnin
(3)Non-consecutive letters in a substring. For example, given
the input ‘ pwwkew ’, the output is ‘wke’.
Passing each test case is worth 1 point. Hence the scores range
0–3. To facilitate evaluation, we went through each solution and
manually translated it into executable code, filling in incomplete
syntax when necessary. We consider passing all three test cases as
indication of a successful task, otherwise, the participant has failed
the task, as done by Wyrich and colleagues [80].
We did not require an optimal solution but we did examine
the solution to determine its runtime complexity. For example,
a solution using two nested loops would have a 𝑂(𝑛2)runtime
complexity.
Finally, we recorded time to complete the experiment. Partici-
pants who exceeded the time limit before completing the task were
not scored and instead marked with a Timeout .
3.2 Measuring Cognitive Load
We measured cognitive load [ 73] using two proxy measures well-
established in the literature: fixation duration andpupil dilation.
A fixation is when eyes stop scanning, holding the central foveal
vision in place so that detailed information about the stimulus can
be caught by the visual system. Fixation duration measures how
long the gaze remains engaged in a particular point. A longer fixa-
tion is well correlated with task difficulty and indicates increased
processing effort [ 47,51,60,71]. Eye-tracking studies do not tradi-
tionally normalize fixations when comparing task difficulty because,
in aggregate, they measure effort in a unit of time, and not in a
unit of space. It is standard to simply compare lengths of fixations
between different text [ 60], images [ 16,82], and code [ 4,14,32]
when understanding relative difficulty of tasks.
Pupil dilation measures the size of the pupil over time. Prior
studies have identified a relationship between increases in pupil
dilation and the mental demands of a task [ 38,69]. That is, when
people need to maintain more items in active memory or perform
more mental operations, the size of their pupils increase.
While fixation data is readily available from our eye-tracker,
pupil dilation is notably noisy and requires more extensive data
cleaning. Our eye-tracker provides the pupil diameter (millimeters)
over time (approximately every 16.7 milliseconds). We adopted
guidelines proposed by Kret and Sjak-Shie [ 43] for filtering out data
that coincided with blinks and any values out of pupil diameter
normal range (1.5mm–9mm). We then proceeded with removing
disproportionately large absolute pupil size changes sympathetic
to luminance changes (2–4mm) [ 6], which are not related to much
smaller information-related dilations (.5mm) [33].
To facilitate comparison across participants and reduce noise,
we adopted temporally course measures [40] by averaging fixation
and pupil diameter data in time windows of 30 seconds. Hence,
each time window possesses a mean fixation duration and mean
pupil dilation size. Lastly, we used an empirically determined cut-
off where we would stop analyzing windows when the number of
active participants still engaged in the task dropped below 50%.
3.3 Measuring Factors of Task Difficulty
To identify contributing factors of cognitive load, we first measured
six factors obtained from the NASA-TLX [ 35]: effort, frustrationand stress, mental demand, temporal demand, physical demand,
and performance, each answered on a scale from 1–21. Each factor
was averaged across participants and then compared across groups
for differences.
To investigate whether stress played a role in performance differ-
ences, we also investigated eye movements related to stress. Stress
inhibits attentional processes [ 11] and as a result, eye movements
become more difficult to control and slower [ 12]. In particular,
we used saccade velocity , which measures the speed of traveling
between areas of interest. Because saccadic velocity is not under
voluntary control, numerous studies have used it as an unbiased
measure of stress level. For example, participants exhibiting high
stress had slower eye movements compared with low stress partic-
ipants in a gaze targeting task [ 17]. We also obtained temporally
course measures [ 40] by averaging saccade velocity into 30 second
time windows.
4 RESULTS
From the 50 participants we recruited, two participants (both were
female) decided to terminate and withdraw from the study. Three
were unable to complete the task within the allocated time of the
experiment. Finally, one participant had successfully completed the
task, but had an incomplete recording due to equipment failure,
and four participants did not have pupil dilation data available. As a
result, we had 48 participants, 22 in private setting and 26 in public
setting, that we could use for complete or partial data analysis (e.g.
TLX, correctness of solution, etc.).
4.1 Participant Experiences and Observations
Participants shared general challenges with problem-solving in
both interview settings. Participants, typically used to coding on
a computer, sometimes struggled with performing the task on a
whiteboard. Participants deprived of programming environments,
with aids such as syntax highlighting and auto-completion, were
burdened with recalling low-level syntax details, such as declaring
a function or variable. P24 found it “challenging to remember cer-
tain aspects of Java while I was working through the solution.” P18
had trouble remembering “function calls specific to java for String
Builder”, which you could usually “just google really quick.” Partic-
ipants also had trouble thinking of the “appropriate data structures
and string operations” needed to solve the problems, and strove to
achieve “an optimal solution” (P19), despite our guidance that they
focus on completing the task correctly. For example, P34 felt they
did poorly because they did not provide an “optimized solution
immediately; wasting time of the proctor.”
However, each interview setting also brought unique experiences
and challenges for participants.
Stress from being watched and think-aloud. Most participants in
the public setting expressed concerns related to being watched,
time pressure, and multiplexing tasks.
Participants expressed feeling “very nervous, ” “rushed,” “stressed,”
“monitored,” and “unable to concentrate.” P43 stated “I was con-
stantly supervised, which made me nervous.” P25 felt unnerved
that someone was “watching me and they are not commenting on
my progress.” P22 described being “self-conscious about the whole

process” because their work was visible. One participant similarly
became more deliberate, worrying about “making the mistakes that
are usually very obvious” in front of someone—they ultimately did
not complete the task within the time limit.
The beginning was especially troublesome. Participants strug-
gled with starting the task: “thinking of a solution immediately”
(P27), “organizing my mind in a short time” (P29), and “as soon as I
see the problem, I become blank” (P36). For these participants, the
beginning was often the most stressful part of the task, especially
with someone else evaluating them and “taking pauses might make
me seem slow-wired” (P22). Even as this initial wave of stress wore
off, participants were still aware of time pressure throughout the
task: “I feel like the more time I take, the less chance of me getting
the job ” (P25).
Participants also had difficulty with performing tasks that in-
volved multiple simultaneous actions. Participants felt stressed by
having to “talk while trying to write” (P44 and P25), and “think and
talk and do code at the same time” (P39). P41 found it difficult to
“constantly speak during solving” and “lost breath at a few places
during the task.”Time and space to work alone. Participants in the private set-
ting particularly noted a reduction of stress. Solving the problem
privately helped participants feel “pretty comfortable” (P14), “less
stressed” (P20), or even “not feel any stress” (P15). P18 expressed
that solving the problem privately is “better than panel” watch-
ing you, otherwise, it would be “difficult to code when someone
watches over” (P16).
Participants “did not feel rushed” because they were “working
alone” (P2). P6 reported “I liked having space + time to think about
the problem without worrying about making sure someone looking
over my shoulder could follow what I was doing. I did not feel very
rushed since I was the one who determined when I was done.”
Challenges with isolation. However, the private setting also
brought its own unique challenges for participants, relating to
lack of feedback and difficulty in time management. P2 expressed
uncertainty about “the logistics of the question” while being alone
in the room. They realized that they were “unsure about the meth-
ods” they were writing and needed feedback to proceed. For one
participant, the lack of an examiner was problematic because they

initially misunderstood the question and had no one available to
explain—as a result, they decided to end participation in the study.
Managing time became burdensome for some participants. Par-
ticipants were not “paying attention to the time during the task”
and “remembered it at the very end”, resulting in them wondering if
they were taking too long (P4). Without having “awareness of time”
(P8) at the beginning, when participants realized how much “the
time [was] passing”, some felt “stressed by a huge margin” (P18).
Observations. Based on replays of video recordings and overlays
of eyetracking data, we noted a few observations that helped explain
some of the participants’ behavior.
Participants had a higher stability of eye movement when
problem-solving in a private setting versus public setting. That
is, participants in public had a more scattered and erratic set of
eye movements (characterized by larger visual dispersion and scan
paths), whereas in private, the eye movements were more focused
and in control. Additionally, participants in private were more likely
to perform mental execution [81] of their code, that is tracing the
behavior of their code under the control of a given test input. For
example, in Figure 2, a participant’s gaze can be seen following the
control flow of the program, while they verbally spoke about the
result of each instruction. Many failed participants neglected to per-
form mental execution of their code when in the public setting—an
indication that they may have not felt at liberty to allocate time to
it or felt uncomfortable performing mental executions while being
observed.
Finally, we also have found some notable instances where partic-
ipants suddenly reset their solution. For example, one participant
was more than half way through their solution, when they suddenly
erased the board without any declaration or signal. They wanted
to start all over, but only five minutes remained in the session, and
as a result they could not successfully complete their task.
4.2 Impact on Correctness and Time
Performance
Participants in the public setting provided significantly lower scores .
They also tended to finish their tasks faster than participants inthe private setting (on average, 1 minute and 36 seconds sooner);
however, not significantly so. Results for all participants can be seen
in Table 1. Figure 3 also shows the percentage of the participants
in each setting that remained active during each minute of the
experiment.
In the public setting 61.5% of the participants failed the task
compared with 36.3% in the private setting. The correctness of the
solutions in the public setting (excluding timeouts) was 1.58 ±1.29
with median of 1 passed test case. In the private setting their score
was 2.29±1.12 with median of 3 passed test cases. A Mann–Whitney
U test showed the difference to be significant ( 𝑍=180.5, 𝑝=0.038,
𝑑=0.57).
Interestingly, a post-hoc analysis revealed that in the public
setting, no women ( 𝑛=5) successfully solved their task; however,
in the private setting, all women ( 𝑛=4) successfully solved their
task—even providing the most optimal solution in two cases. This
may suggest that asking an interview candidate to publicly solve a
problem and think-aloud can degrade problem-solving ability.
Figure 3: Percentage of participants remaining active dur-
ing the experiment session. More than 50% of the partici-
pants finished their task in less than 10 minutes in the pub-
lic setting. In the private setting, participants generally took
longer.
4.3 Impact on Cognitive Load
Participants in the public setting had a higher cognitive load . To
enable a better comparison across the settings, we focused on data
collected during the first 10 minutes of the programming task, since
a majority had already completed the experiment in the public
setting by that point (see Figure 3)—i.e., analyzing data after 20
minutes would only include a few participants. Figure 4 shows
the mean dilation size changes over time (solid line) and with the
colored bands representing 95% confidence intervals. The pupil size
remains relatively stabilized and low in the private setting, while it
remains high and fluctuates in the public setting.
Participants had significantly longer fixations, a robust measure
of cognitive load [ 47], when problem-solving in a public setting.
The mean fixation duration in the public setting (251.48 ±13.37ms)
compared to the private setting (238.99 ±17.36ms) was significantly
different based on a Wilcoxon signed-rank test ( 𝑍=25.0, 𝑝=0.0028,
𝑑=0.78). Participants had significantly larger pupil sizes in the pub-
lic setting, an indication of elevated cognitive load [ 69]. A mean
dilation size in the public setting (0.13 ±0.009mm) and in the private
486Does Stress Impact Technical Interview Performance? ESEC/FSE ’20, November 8–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
setting (0.12±0.003mm), is significantly higher based on a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test between the settings ( 𝑍=23.0, 𝑝=0.0022, 𝑑=1.43).
Returning to Figure 4, interestingly, we observe a decrease typ-
ically around five minutes in the public setting. After inspecting
participant videos, we hypothesize that this drop is due to partici-
pants reaching a partial solution (e.g., their first passing test case).
Unfortunately, this respite may be short, as cognitive load continues
to rise again as they must address bugs and more difficult test cases.
We also note that the two bands do overlap, which indicates that a
small subset of candidates in the public setting exhibited the same
level of cognitive load as those solving it in private. This represents
a wider disparity between participants in the public setting, as
some participants may be disproportionately experiencing higher
cognitive load.
These results indicate that the public setting increases the ex-
traneous cognitive load [ 73] of a task, which could occur from
additional demands from talk-aloud, stress from being watched, or
possible changes in problem-solving strategies.
Figure 4: Mean dilation size in first 10 minutes of the exper-
iment across the settings. Participants in the public setting
experience larger mean dilation size, indicating a larger cog-
nitive load. Dilation size fluctuates for the public setting par-
ticipants while it remains stable throughout the experiment
in the private setting.
4.4 Influence of Stress on Task Performance
Participants experienced higher stress levels in the public setting.
A Mann–Whitney U test on median ratings from five NASA-TLX
categories did not identify any significance difference in effort,
mental demand, physical demand, or performance across settings.
However, frustration and stress was significantly higher in public
(11) vs. in private (7) based on a Mann–Whitney U test ( 𝑈=184.0,
𝑝=0.004, 𝑑=0.64).
Participants had slower eye movements , a marker for high stress
[12], when problem-solving in a public setting. We found that the av-
erage saccade velocity was slower for the participants in public set-
ting (94.41±45.59◦/s) compared to private setting (120.77 ±39.43◦/s).
A Wilcoxon signed-rank confirmed this was significantly differentbetween the settings ( 𝑍=277, 𝑝=0.003, 𝑑=0.59). In Figure 5, a box-
plot also depicts the distribution of ranges, including median values
(public median=84, private median=119.25).
The results of the TLX survey and slower saccade velocity both
indicate that stress was higher in the public setting. Increased stress
can explain some of the previously observed increase in cognitive
load, independent of the intrinsic cognitive load [ 73] of the task
itself.
Figure 5: Participants in the public setting had slower eye
movements, as indicated by mean saccade velocity, a mea-
sure of how fast a person looks away or towards an area of
interest. Slow values coincides with high stress, due to inhib-
ited attention processes.
5 LIMITATIONS
Except for one interview, our interviews were all conducted by
women. In practice, since most technical interviews are typically
conducted by men, additional factors, such as stereotype threat [70],
may further influence and degrade performance of candidates. A
lack of peer parity [ 30] among underrepresented minorities and
hostile or indifferent interviewers [ 8] could further influence per-
formance.
We have chosen our question to be challenging but solvable. In
particular, we asked for candidates to prioritize correctness over
runtime optimality. Our reasoning was partly based on results by
Wyrich and colleagues [ 80], where they found that only one partici-
pant out of 32 could provide a correct and optimal coding challenge
solution. Another reason was that it is a common expectation in
interviews for a candidate to first reach a simple solution before
engaging in optimization [ 3,49]. For our problem, a brute solution
𝑂(𝑛3)is possible [ 3], yet only one participant used the approach.
Participants were also able to obtain the optimal solution 𝑂(𝑛)in
both settings. Also, participants may have had prior exposure to
the problems, though no participant explicitly indicated this.
Some factors of our experiment could affect the generalizabil-
ity of the results. Our interview settings may be producing less
stress than real interviews with real stakes, while adding discom-
fort from the eye-tracker. Furthermore, our experimenters did not
487ESEC/FSE ’20, November 8–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA Mahnaz Behroozi, Shivani Shirolkar, Titus Barik, and Chris Parnin
participate in problem-solving. They did not give feedback if par-
ticipants were taking a wrong route to the solution nor interrupt
with probing questions about the problem-solving process—it is
unclear whether an interactive interviewer has an additional pos-
itive ornegative effect on performance. Although most students
participate in technical interviews, they may not fully represent
industry developers [ 63], who may perform differently in interview
settings. Finally, while our technical interview question is used by
well-known companies in practice, other coding questions may be
easier or more difficult—individual task characteristics [ 22] may
elicit different kinds of mental effort and thus may have different
interactions with stress. Similarly, in some cases, small amounts of
stress can enhance performance [ 2]. Hence, we are not claiming
that all interview questions will result in the same barriers.
One construct validity issue is the accuracy of the eye tracker.
While we used a professional eye tracking instrument, environmen-
tal factors can disrupt the accuracy of our measures. For example,
our eye tracker was also sensitive to lighting conditions. Further-
more, dynamic and free movement in the environment limited our
ability to perform automated analysis of fixed areas of interest, such
as fixations on particular words or lines in a coding solution. Some
participant data was incomplete, for example, four participants did
not have pupil dilation data available, and one participant had no
recording due to equipment malfunction during the participant
session. We mitigated against this issue by filtering and reducing
sources of noise, such as blink events, using temporal coarse values
in time windows [ 40], and using multiple, redundant measures.
Future work can consider alternative ways to detect stress [ 37] and
analyze events with normalization [15, 39, 66].
6 RELATED WORK
Despite their importance, technical interviews are understudied in
the scientific literature. Ford and colleagues [ 29] conducted a study
from the perspective of hiring managers and University students
participating in mock technical interviews. The study identified a
mismatch of candidates’ expectations between what interviewers
assess and what they actually look for in a candidate. Behroozi
and colleagues [ 8] conducted a qualitative study on comments
posted on Hacker News, a social network for software practitioners.
Posters report several concerns and negative perceptions about in-
terviews, including their lack of real-world relevance, bias towards
younger developers, and demanding time commitment. Posters
report that these interviews cause unnecessary anxiety and frustra-
tion, requiring them to learn arbitrary, implicit, and obscure norms.
Researchers have investigated challenges faced by disadvantaged
and low-resource job seekers [ 5,54], the effectiveness of resources
such as online career mentoring [ 74], and alternative job seeking
interventions, such as speed dating [23]. Our study provides em-
pirical evidence validating several of these concerns, and provides
additional interventions for job seekers.
Using head-mounted eye trackers, Behroozi and colleagues [ 7]
conducted a preliminary study with 11 participants solving one
problem privately on paper and one problem on a whiteboard.
They found that the settings significantly differed in metrics as-
sociated with cognitive load and stress. The study concludes that“programming is a cognitively intensive task that defies expecta-
tions of constant feedback of today’s interview processes; however,
more studies are needed to better understand what characteristics
contribute to high cognitive load.” Wyrich and colleagues [ 80] con-
ducted an exploratory study with 32 software engineering students
and found that coding challenge solvers also have better exam
grades and more programming experience. Moreover, conscien-
tious as well as sad software engineers performed worse. Studies
have also characterized the impact of interruptions on program-
ming tasks [ 20], including more frequent errors [ 56]. Our study
complements this prior work by offering empirical evidence that
explains how think-aloud and being watched contribute to lower
technical interview performance.
Examining the grey literature of software engineering—that is,
non-published, nor peer-reviewed sources of practitioners—provides
some additional, though contradictory insights. Lerner [ 44] con-
ducted a study of over a thousand interviews using the interview-
ing.io platform, where developers can practice technical interview-
ing anonymously. Their significant finding is that performance
from one technical interview to another is arbitrary, and that in-
terview performance is volatile—only 20% of the interviewees are
consistent in their performance, and the rest are all over the place in
terms of their interview evaluation. In contrast, a study conducted
at Google by Shaper [ 65] investigated a subset of interview data
over five years to determine the value of an interviewer’s feedback,
and found that the four interviews were enough to predict whether
someone should be hired at Google with 86% confidence. Unfor-
tunately, this study simply establishes the number of interviews
(four) needed to consistently reach a hire/no hire decision, not the
accuracy nor validity of the decision. Regardless, our study finds
that interview practices may be confounding stress induced from
assessment with problem-solving ability.
7 DISCUSSION
Our findings demonstrate that stress impacts technical interview
performance; indeed, in our study, participants in a traditional
technical interview format
•obtained significantly lower scores (Section 4.2),
•experienced significantly higher extraneous cognitive load
(Section 4.3), and
•experienced significantly higher stress levels (Section 4.4).
Furthermore, participants reported (Section 4.1) feeling “very
nervous”, “rushed”, “stressed”, “monitored”, and “unable to con-
centrate” as a result of being watched. Participants also reported
extraneous cognitive load associated with having to “think and talk
and do code at the same time” (P39). When not being monitored,
participants were more likely to perform mental execution, allow-
ing them an opportunity to evaluate and build confidence in their
solution before having someone examine it. Moreover, our findings
suggest that social anxiety may cause the candidates not be capable
of communicating their thoughts and solutions, which can add up
to their stress and deteriorate their performance.
We have demonstrated how one possible technical interview
design, a private interview, significantly reduces the effects of un-
wanted stress on candidates and results in significant changes in
performance, stress, and cognitive load. For companies that want
488Does Stress Impact Technical Interview Performance? ESEC/FSE ’20, November 8–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
to avoid conflating assessment of technical and communication
skills with handling and mitigating stress, we have provided an
experimental framework for designing and evaluating alternative
technical interview procedures.
In the remainder of this section, we present interim guidance
for future directions on technical interviews—consider the recom-
mendations as hypotheses that need further evaluation rather than
outright policy.
7.1 Guidance I—Use Retrospective Think-aloud
for Accessing Explanation Skills
Although companies want to accurately assess candidates based
on their actual skills, they can inadvertently favor a candidate’s
ability to handle or mitigate stress. In most technical interview
formats candidates are asked to think-aloud. Think-aloud protocols
are methods to add visibility to cognitive process of a candidate
while doing a set of specified tasks rather than only evaluating their
final product. There are two main types of think-aloud methods:
concurrent think-aloud [62,76] and retrospective think-aloud [36,53].
In concurrent think-aloud, candidates explain their thoughts in
tandem with doing the task. Just as subjects given the trier social
stress test, candidates who must vocalize their thought-process in
real-time risk exposure to a social evaluative threat that can hinder
performance in both explanation and problem-solving [ 21]. Van
Den Haak et al . [76] also showed that verbalising thoughts at the
time of performing tasks generally increase errors and impede task
completion. In retrospective think-aloud, candidates first finish
the task and then walk the interviewers through their thought
process. That is, candidates can perform the task in their own
manner with limited impact on performance [ 62]. To implement
retrospective think-aloud in technical interviews, interviewers can
first provide the candidate with a problem description and allow
them to privately solve the problem, followed by an explanation
of their thought process and a discussion about their solution with
the interviewer. This interview format mitigates many of the issues
our participants experienced from feeling monitored or supervised,
while giving companies an opportunity to still evaluate explanation
skills.
Another way to effectively assess explanation skills is to use
interview formats that simultaneously reduce the social-evaluative
threat and while increasing focus on the explanation component
of the assessment. For interviewers who want to assess how the
candidate would communicate with other members of the team,
the technical problem itself is primarily a shared vehicle through
which the interviewer and candidate engage in a conversational di-
alogue. For example, Microsoft has attempted to reframe technical
interviews as as more of a conversation in which both the candi-
date and the interviewer work together to solve the problem [ 52].
We recommend starting with straight-forward problems that are no
more difficult than first-year computer science exercises, and then
using these exercises as a way to progressively elicit explanations
about their knowledge and experience on different topics. For ex-
ample, consider the Rainfall Problem3, a programming task that
has been used in a number of studies of programming ability [28].
3The basic description of the Rainfall Problem is to write a program that will read in
integers and output their average, stopping when the value 9999 is input.If the candidate does well in their explanation, the interviewer can
probe more complex scenarios, such as scaling this problem to a
distributed algorithm, or building a user interface for such a system,
depending on the expectations of the position. In certain scenar-
ios, it may not even be necessary to fabricate a problem to drive
the discussion. At Netflix, some interviewers ask the candidate to
“teach something that they know,” and the candidate can choose
any topic of their interest, job-related or otherwise.4
7.2 Guidance II—Evaluate the Kinds of Stress
Necessary for Position
Although companies have been mindful to eliminate the influence
of stress from their assessment procedures, some view stress as
an important characteristic of the job, and should not hire candi-
dates who cannot manage stress: “the real problem is in your head:
your anxiety about job interviews is sabotaging something you’re
otherwise perfectly good at” [8].
In this case, it is important to delineate the kinds of stress a de-
veloper would typically encounter in a day-to-day manner. Given
important tasks that must be completed in a timely manner, the
ability to tolerate stress from time pressure is a reasonable consider-
ation [ 46]. However, time pressure is distinct from other sources of
stress [ 55], which might manifest during an evaluation but not dur-
ing day-to-day tasks, such as performance anxiety [78], commonly
called “stage fright,” or closely-related test anxiety [34]. Therefore,
with interview formats explored in our study, it is still possible to
assess the ability for a candidate to perform under time-pressure,
without evaluating other sources of stress.
If stress is an important consideration for the job, companies
should consider ways to help candidates mitigate its effects, such as
stress inoculation training. As such, interview candidates have been
advised to practice (or “grind” [ 8]) on various problems and solu-
tions in order to become immune to its effects [ 49]—Mekka Okereke,
a senior manager at Google recommends doing at least 40 prac-
tice sessions. While stress inoculate training [ 64] can be effective,
developers also note the immense time commitment [ 8] required
to train for technical interviews and the disparity caused by some
candidates not having the same available time or resources [ 54] to
train as others. Honeycomb, a women-lead DevOps company, tries
to eliminate stress by giving advanced details: “No surprises... un-
knowns cause anxiety, and people don’t perform well when they’re
anxious. We willingly offer up as much detail in advance about
the process as we can, even down to the questions” [ 45]. Yet, there
may be some companies that still need to assess candidates on
their stress-tolerance. For them, handling stress may be even more
important than candidates’ technical skills. In that case, companies
should be clear about that requirement. This let candidates to de-
cide whether those companies are suitable for them or that is the
culture they want to fit in.
7.3 Guidance III—Provide Accessible
Alternatives
We observed several instances where the nature of the whiteboard
interview interfered with the candidate’s ability to perform their
4Personal correspondence with Netflix interviewer.
489ESEC/FSE ’20, November 8–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA Mahnaz Behroozi, Shivani Shirolkar, Titus Barik, and Chris Parnin
task. Several changes to the interview procedure can reduce the
effects of stress and cognitive load.
7.3.1 Warm-up Interview. The technical interview format is sub-
stantially different from how developers do their day-to-day pro-
gramming activities. To reduce stress, provide the candidate with
a warmup exercise that gives them an opportunity to familiarize
themselves with the interview setting, experience the interview
format, and ask questions about the technical interview process. Ide-
ally, the warmup interview should be conducted by an interviewer
who does not score the candidate.
7.3.2 Free Reset. As we found in our study, in stressful situations
some participants may forget or “blank” on a particular solution.
Interviewers should acknowledge that interviews are stressful situa-
tions, and allow the candidate a “free reset“ to request another prob-
lem or start again on the existing problem without incurring any
penalty. Having such a safety net can reduce the candidates’ stress
and improve their performance in the technical interview. Simi-
larly, dropping the lowest performance interview can reduce noise
associated with problematic questions or unfavorable interviewer–
candidate interactions.
7.3.3 Partial Program Sketches. If you’ve ever had to write a paper,
you know that starting from an entirely blank page can be both
difficult and intimidating. Participants in our study also reported
additional stress from having to write a program from scratch, for
example, from having to recall the syntax of the language without
having any cues. Instead of asking participants to write a program
from scratch, interviewers can provide participants with an initial
skeleton that contains a partial solution, such as the method signa-
ture, a sample invocation, a few input and output examples, and
even some sample code snippets for the programming language.
7.3.4 Familiar Affordances. Conducting technical interviews on
the whiteboard can also unnecessarily increase the cognitive load
for the candidate, especially if the candidate does not routinely write
on a whiteboard. To mitigate this, offer the candidate the option to
use a laptop, or allow them to solve the technical problems using
pencil-and-paper. By doing so, candidates do not have to write
code on an unfamiliar medium just for purposes of the interview.
Although not well-advertised, interviewers at Google can elect
to use pencil-and-paper to conduct their interviews instead of a
whiteboard.5
7.4 Guidance IV—Consider Impacts on Talent
and Diversity
As companies embrace diversity and strive for inclusive hiring prac-
tices, companies should evaluate how their technical interviews
support or detract from that goal. Hiring procedures that inadver-
tently exclude large segments of population can contribute to “leaky
pipelines” [ 9], with impact to increased hiring costs [ 25,61] and a
disproportionate reduction in hiring of minorities and other under-
represented groups [ 13,18,42,57,79]. For example, a large popu-
lation of people are impacted by performance anxiety (estimated
40 percent of all adults in the U.S. [ 24]). Collectively, otherwise
5Personal correspondence with Google interviewer.qualified candidates—who happen to perform poorly due to perfor-
mance anxiety–could be excluded from fair consideration for hiring.
Furthermore, scientific evidence finds that women experience dis-
proportionately more negative effects from test and performance
anxiety [26, 48, 68], which could explain our observations.
As we observed in our study, candidates who perform in tradi-
tional interview setting are more likely to fail, but not necessarily
for reasons related to problem-solving ability. As a result, how an
individual responses to stress and extraneous cognitive load can be
driving hiring decisions instead of ability. For example, if two candi-
dates performed equally well, the job may still go to the candidate
who better projects confidence [ 29]. Beyond gender, these proce-
dures could further impact the performance—and thus exclusion—of
other demographics, such as high-anxiety individuals [ 10] and neu-
rodiverse (e.g., dyslexia, autism, or anxiety) job seekers. Even wider
bands of demographics, such as disadvantaged and low-resource
job seekers [ 54] can be impacted by unwanted stress in hiring pro-
cedures. For example, Mekka Okereke, a Google senior manager
speaking at a recent “Is the Technical Interview Broken?” panel,
notes that students at Stanford take courses for passing technical
interviews, CS9: Problem-Solving for the CS Technical Interview.
Mekka finds that most students typically lack these resources, and
specifically runs workshops at HBCUs to provide interview training.
He reports that 40 practice interviews are needed to help some-
one overcome performance anxiety—a time-consuming application
of stress inoculation. Companies must decide at what cost they
are willing to pay for verifying explanation skills in tandem with
problem-solving ability, and what impact that has on their ability
to hire diverse and talented candidates.
8 CONCLUSION
Our study raises key questions about the validity and equity of a
core procedure used for making hiring decisions across the software
industry. We suggest that private interview settings have consider-
able advantages for candidates, that both reduce their stress and
allow more accurate assessment of their problem-solving abilities
and can be easily extended to allow assessment of communication
skills through retrospective think-aloud. Although this study is one
of the first to provide insights into impacts of stress on technical
interviews, we have only examined this effect in the context of one
coding challenge, from participants from one University. A larger
collection of studies, including active participation by industry to
pilot alternative hiring procedures, would be valuable for informing
how to create a valid and inclusive hiring process for all.
