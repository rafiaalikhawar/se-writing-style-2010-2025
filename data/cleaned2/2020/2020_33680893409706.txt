let s write a node.js application.
note when installing from the nodesource ppa the node.js executable is called nodejs rather than node .
create node.js application we will write a hello world application that simply returns hello world to any http requests.
this is a sample application that will help you get your node.js set up which you can replace with your own application just make sure that you modify your application to listen on the appropriate ip addresses and ports.
hello world code first create and open your node.js application for editing.
for this tutorial we will use nano to edit a sample application called hello.js cd nano hello.js insert the following code into the file.
if you want to you may replace the highlighted port in both locations be sure to use a non admin port i.e.
4 or greater !
usr bin env nodejs var http require http http.createserver function req res res.writehead content type text plain res.end hello world n .listen localhost console.log server running at now save and exit.
this node.js application simply listens on the specified address localhost and port and returns hello world with a http success code.

theidealtutorial asdescribedindigitalocean sguidelinesfor tutorial creators should follow several principles.
first tutorials should be accessible for all tutorial takers being as clear and detailed as possible without making assumptions about the reader s background knowledge.
furthermore tutorials should be executablefromstart to finish weexplicitlyincludeeverycommand a reader needs to go from their first ssh connection on a brand new server to the final working setup.
finally tutorials are not merely scripts but should explain and impart knowledge we alsoprovidereaderswithalloftheexplanationsandbackground information they needto understand the tutorial.
the goal isfor our readers to learn not just copy andpaste.
esec fse november8 13 virtualevent usa samimmirhosseiniandchrisparnin unfortunately tutorials can fall far from this ideal.
despite their importance software tutorials require considerable effort to produce test andmaintain inorder to ensure a high quality learning experience.tutorialcreatorsfaceseveralbarriers supportingdifferentlevelsandenvironmentsoftutorialtakers preventing instructions from becoming stale as tools or environments quickly evolve and overcoming the expert blind spot effect when tutorialcreatorsdonotanticipatestepswherenovicetutorialtakers may have difficulty .

to systematically understand what issues software tutorials contain andwhattutorialcreatorscandotoavoidthem weinvestigatesoftwaretutorialsthroughthelensof executability measuring to what extent we can follow step by step instructions to their final working setup .
to this end we conduct an empirical study of 663tutorials firstbymeasuringexecutabilitywithanaiveexecution strategy as one would just copy and paste and finally with a more sophisticated strategy using human annotation for interpreting and executing instructions.
through a qualitative analysis weidentifiedseveralissuesintutorialsthatlimitedexecutability and we validated these issues with informants who were expert stakeholders intechnical documentation.
our findings show that with a naive execution strategy we achieve overall executability rate of only .
even with a more sophisticated strategy using annotated tutorials executabilityrate only increases to .
and even more concerning no tutorial successfully executed all steps to its final working setup .
our qualitative analysis revealed several issues such as inaccessible resources missingsteps inconsistencyinhandlingfilecontent and documentationrot whichdetractfromtheusabilityandvalueof the tutorials.
our informants generally agreed with significance of theresults andillustrated scenarios where these problems have occurred however informantshadamixedconsensusontheseverity of some problems and how to best address them.

how to secure nginx with let s encrypt on ubuntu .
digitalocean 25up to date versions so we ll use that repository instead.
first add the repository.
sudo add apt repository ppa certbot certbot you ll need to press enter to accept.
then update the package list to pick up the new repository s package information.
sudo apt get update and finally install certbot s nginx package with apt get .
sudo apt get install python certbot nginx certbot is now ready to use but in order for it to configure ssl for nginx we need to verify some of nginx s configuration.
step setting up nginx certbot can automatically configure ssl for nginx but it needs to be able to find the correct server block in your config.
it does this by looking for a server name directive that matches the domain you re requesting a certificate for.
if you re starting out with a fresh nginx install you can update the default config file.
open it with nano or your favorite text editor.
sudo nano etc nginx sites available default find the existing server name line and replace the underscore with your domain name .

context.
rather than devising an automatic execution technique we wanted to use the opportunity to derive annotations forinstructionsbasedonhumanclassification.thisapproachhas vxgr dsw jhw lqvwdoo vwurqjvzdq vwurqjvzdq soxjlq hds pvfkdsy pruhxwlov ?

inthisexample the apt get install commanddidnotexecute successfully.
several benefits first the annotations provide a boundedinterpretation of instructions.
for example if we provide an annotation with an expected response from a command such as type yes or enter we can specifically measure how the presence of interactive prompts effects executability.
more importantly we can begin tomodeldifferentlevelsoftutorialreaderunderstanding.forexample acomplexoperationmightinvolvestartingacommandas backgroundprocess whichrequiresmoreknowledgeaboutshelloperations.
finally automation is ultimately possible in future efforts suchastechniqueswhichtrytoautomaticallyinferannotationsfor commands.

design.
the design of docable is inspired by behavioraldriven testing tools such as cucumber which uses an external stepfileforselectingandassertingexpectedtestbehaviors.here weextendthisconceptbyprovidingcapabilitiesforfirstselectinga commandfromatutorial andthenprovidinganannotatedstepthat describes how to execute the command.
steps select code blocks by matching text occurring above the block.
for example in the stepfileshowninfigure thetext let screateasmallserverusing php can be used to select the associated code block.
the file annotation tells docable that content should be saved as a file calledserver.php.
377esec fse november8 13 virtualevent usa samimmirhosseiniandchrisparnin docable also has the ability to generate an html report based on the original tutorial which enables inspection of tutorial execution.

annotations.
we derived annotations from the results of our opencardsortanalysis seesection .
.forexample wecreated the expect annotation based on the outputcategory derived in section3.
.
.
when creating the annotations we balanced engineering effort with support from tutorials.
for example we did not implementreplacingsearchandreplaceoperationsonfiles since fewtutorialsusedthistechniqueandengineeringeffortwouldbe high.
we derivedthe following annotations run.runacode blockas is that is naively.
file.select content and store as a file located at the given path.
user.perform command as user.
for example installation often requires being run as the root user.
input.provideinputto interactive prompts.
expect.code block is expected output of command another command.
serve.runcode inabackground process.
persistent.
allocate a terminal shell to run a series of commands.
for example some tutorials are written to be run in differentterminals.

summary executingtutorialswithlimitedhuman annotationsubstantially improves executability rates of tutorials over a baseline of naive execution.
however all evaluated tutorials still contained execution failures often caused by a multitude of problematic tutorial writingpractices suchasmissingandinconsistentinformationand documentation rot.
informants offered their insight on the validity andimpact ofthesefindings.
limitations our mixed methods approach of investigating tutorials introduces certaintrade offsandlimitations.
as explained in the study by kim et al.
tutorials exist in different genres suchas interactive tutorials ex.
khan academy8 webreference ex.w3schools9 moocs ex.edx10 educational games ex.
code combat11 and creative platforms ex.
alice12 .
in this study we focused on web reference genre on topicsrelated to configurationoftoolsandcomputingenvironments.othertypes of genres and domains may have different kinds of executability barriers.
therewereseveraltrade offswemadeinourimplementationof theexecutionharnessandexecutabilitystudy.forexample because we remotely executed throughssh a few commands such as ufw coulddisruptthenetworkconnection.wealsolimitedourscope ofexecution.forexample wedidnotexecuteinlinecodeblocks which were relatively rare only instances found in our sample dataset.therefore evenhigherexecutionratescouldbeobserved through additional engineering effort on the execution harness withoutnecessarily changing tutorials.
finally we acknowledgethat qualitativeresearch howeverrigorously conducted involves not only the qualitative data under investigationbut alsoalevel of subjectivityandinterpretationon the part of the researcher as they frame and synthesize the results setby andperformedapeerdebriefingwithourresults.our sampling method was parameterized with a higher tolerance for error.
therefore ourstudy limits our ability to draw precise conclusions fora sample to population or statistical generalization when characterizing the frequency orportion of failures.

however their method differed in how they characterized tutorial content.
in the study the authors made an assessmentof whether tutorials fitbestpracticesinpedagogy suchas connecting tolearners prior knowledge and encouraging meta cognitive learning.
they found deficiencies in all these categories across a variety of tutorials and domains.
in both kim and ko and our work anoverarchinggoalistoassessthequalityoftutorials however whereas kim and ko view quality through a pedagogical lens we viewquality throughan executability lens withalonger term goalofautomatedandcontinuous testing.

our study provides empirical evidence validating several of these concerns and provides additional techniques for allowing continuous testingof tutorials.

not every tutorial taker will have readily available access to costly infrastructure resources.
several tutorials required resources suchasregistereddomainnamesandextrafeatures suchasadditionaldiskvolumes object stores andclusters allexpensesthat can quickly exclude disadvantaged and non traditional learners who do not have the resources necessary to obtain them.
professionalscanbeimpactedaswell.atutorialtakermaybeworking on a prototype or investigating possible platforms for a product andmaybewearyofmakinglargeinvestmentsinordertofollow atutorialthat maynot even work.
tutorials can inadvertently exclude novice learners by omitting details that are important for shepherding cautious learners throughtheir firstlearning experience.research incomputer educationhasfoundthatlearnerswithlowerself efficacyhavemore difficulty handling unexpected and exploratory behaviors such as interactive prompts .
interactive prompts can be difficult for learners who do not know how to response exactly especially if theyarefirstlearninganewtoolorcommand.forexample commands such as mysql secure installation or lxd init can ask up to dozens of prompts including complicated configuration options such as bridge networking.
we found many instances of tutorialswhichsimplyaskedthereaderto answertheprompts or followtherestoftheprompts withoutgivingdetailsforwhatshould betheresponsetoeachprompt.whenunguided suchpromptscan be frustratingandoverwhelming for novices.
learners desire more accessible resources that leverage their background and providing alternative formats for flexibility inlearning .surprisingly simplestepscanprovideimproveaccessibility for tutorial takers.
for example many tutorials required prerequisites such as having a registered domain name before the readercanfollowthestepsofthetutorial.however wefoundafew tutorialsthatofferedasimplealternativeifthiswascurrentlyunobtainableforthetutorialtaker.thetutorialsinstructthereaderto update their etc hosts file which allows routing the requests of thedomainnametoalocalipaddress thereforeeliminatingtherequirementforaregistereddomainname.similarly commandswith interactive prompts may not always be asking for configuration optionsrelevanttothetutorial.whenpossible interactivepromptscanbereducedbyusingdefaultvalues orprovidingcommandflags suchas yor q.asaresult tutorialscanreduceuncertaintyfortutorialtakers andimprovetheabilityforlearnersofallbackgrounds to learn.how to install zammad .

implication iii provide self contained tutorials.
we observed tutorials that made simplifying assumptions about environment and tutorials that required running other tutorials thatsometimescould runmultiplelevelsdeep i3 .furthermore whentutorialsdonotexplicitlycontroltheirdependencies documentation rot could lead to breaking changes within the tutorial section4.
.
many tutorials that we analyzed included multiple linkstoothertutorialswhichexplainhowtosetupaprerequisite but it is not clear which link should be used by the user or if those tutorialswillalsohave theirownprerequisites.
one informant mentioned their effort to flatten dependencies in recenttutorialsthey vetriedtopullalldependenciesupand flatten outthedependencytree sothatit sclearup fronteachstepyou need to take first i3 .
we observed several vultr tutorials where alldependenciescouldbeinstalledinasingletutorial14.another informantdescribedtheireffortstobetterpackagingtutorials if the tutorial is using a vm we package all dependent files and artifactssuchasdockerimageswithinthevm.whenwe dependon an external script we fork the script and host it alongside the documentation.
this is similar to your finding to avoid use of external servicesas much as possible i5 .

such a technique could beadoptedtodeterminethedependenciesnecessaryforrunning a tutorial.
similarly a tool such as opunit could provide a simple mechanism for determining whether or not prerequisites were appropriately satisfiedbefore starting atutorial.

these executability barriers often involves human readable steps commands and file contents with placeholder values that shouldbechangedbythereader allforthepurposeofproviding additionalinformation andcontext i2 such fillin apassword or replace this ip or mac address .
one tutorial even asks the reader to go to a website locate a download link and use it in a curl command.tutorialcreatorsneedtoconsiderwhetherthesehuman readable steps are intended to be truly educational or an unwanted learningbarrierthat reduces the accessibilityofthe tutorial.

for example it was common to update the wrong sectionofaconfigurationfile especiallywhentheoptionwasrepeatedacrossmultipleareas.professionalsalsostruggletoreuse material from online resources due to configuration and documentation issues being uncertain on whether the material is up to date and determining what portion might require manual adaption .

there areseveralstepsthattutorialcreatorscantaketoensureabetter experience for tutorial takers while maintaining machine readable steps.tutorialscan makeitpossibleforuserstofilloutthevariable values and have it flow into the tutorial code i3 .
for example if thetutorialneedstoreplacethetext sammy openvpn server ip inside commands there can be an interactive component in the tutorial that allows the user specify the desired value for this parameter which is then automatically propagated throughout the tutorial instructions.
finally it would be interesting if there were a standardised format for storing tutorial data which would allow one piece of structured data to both be rendered into a humanfriendly page but also interpreted by a machine and automatically executed i6 .
conclusion in this study we conducted a mixed methods study through an empirical study on tutorials collected from various online sources andthroughaqualitativeanalysisoftutorials.wefirstusedanaive execution strategy to determine a baseline level of executability.
