these incidents could significantly degrade system s availability and customers satisfaction.

identifying linked incidents in large scale online service systems.
in proceedings of the 28th acm joint european software engineering conference and symposium on the foundations of software engineering esec fse november virtual event usa.
acm new york ny usa pages.
introduction incidents or unplanned interruptions or outages of the service are inevitable in large and complex online service systems .
in practice system failures keep occurring due to frequent updates of system components changes in operation environment mobility of devices etc.
some devastating incidents in large online service systems can significantly degrade system availability and drastically affect user experiences.
for example the estimated cost of an onehour downtime for amazon.com on prime day in its biggest sale event of the year is up to million1.
therefore many cloud service systems build the incident management icm system to manage incidents and ensure high quality services .
when an incident occurs on call engineers oce will check the system logs and conduct troubleshooting actions .
meanwhile engineers will sometimes link several inter related incidents for efficient and effective diagnosis.
for example a few incidents are usually reported together due to system dependencies where esec fse november virtual event usa y. chen x. yang h. dong x. he h. zhang q. lin j. chen p. zhao y. kang f. gao z. xu d. zhang mitigating one incident can well resolve several other incidents.
moreover the links may represent other relevant information such as re occurrence relation or co occurrence relation between two incidents.
detecting and recording such related incidents are valuable for incident diagnosis.
large online systems are composed of many services with these services coupling with each other heavily.
the incidents may happen in one service and are actually caused by problems in another service.
incident links discovered by oces can provide strong evidence on such coupling structure and bring insights to fault diagnosis.
some traditional techniques used for duplicate bug detection can partially be applied to the incident linkage problem in online service systems .
for example natural language processing techniques used for mining textual information in bug reports can help us retrieve similar bug reports .
extending information retrieval framework with textual information is more effective in locating similar bug reports .
however linking incidents of large scale online service systems remains a complicated problem and contains several new challenges first incidents are not only manually written by reporters but are also generated automatically by monitors .
the hybrid reporting interface in icm system provides a convenient and reasonable tunnel for collecting useful information for investigating the incident but these reports are intertwined with different patterns of textual description while many traditional bug duplicate methods only focus on human written bug reports .
second incidents with distinct descriptions may be linked either because they share the same cause or they are sequentially happened.
for example a failure in the physical network will cause the failure of the virtual network and both of these two failures will be reported as incidents.
mitigating the source incident will automatically mitigate all the other incidents caused by this incident.
however traditional text based duplicate bug detection methods will label these two failures as different incidents .
in practice oces tend to link two incidents together for understanding and fixing the problems.
third the dependency structure is neither known nor fixed in large online service systems the inter dependency among different services and components could be highly complex and this inter dependency keeps changing as there are frequent updates in the system.
therefore it is hard to use the dependency graph to identify linked incidents as done in .
to our knowledge no previous work has been conducted on such a link identification problem with component dependencies which is especially important for large online service systems.
in this paper we investigate the underlying links among the incidents in large online service systems.
we propose an effective framework for predicting linked incidents which is called lidar linked incident identification with data driven representation .
lidar is a scalable framework that can identify possible links among a large number of incidents using both semantic information in incident description and the dependency structure online service systemengineers monitorsincident reporting incident triageincident linkage root cause analysis ocesicm incident mitigationlink identificationfigure the workflow of an incident management system in microsoft.
of the online service system.
for the semantic information we use a deep textual embedding module to learn the semantic information which is able to consistently encode the same symptom reported from both automated monitors expressed in a structured pattern and human engineers expressed in a natural language .
meanwhile we use a representation learning approach to capture the inter dependency relationship among different components.
at last we learn the links among incidents by combining both the incident semantics and the service dependency representation.
our major contributions are as follows we investigate the linked incidents problem in an incident management system of large online service system.
we construct a component dependency network and adopt a network representation learning technique to encode the components into a latent feature space.
the component dependency network is extracted from historical incident links and is embedded to preserve the network structural information.
we encode the textual description of incidents with an advanced deep learning model to capture the semantic features for incident link identification.
by utilizing the inter dependency among components as well as the textual information in the descriptions of incidents we develop an integrated framework that can effectively identify possible linked incidents.
the remainder of this paper is as follows an overview on the linked incidents of a large online service system in microsoft is shown in section .
in section we introduce our proposed framework for incident link identification in icm systems for large online service systems.
experimental results of our method on a real world icm system and an extensive case study are shown in section .
we discuss lessons learned in section summarize related work in section and conclude our work in section .
overview of linked incidents in an icm system .
the incident management system in microsoft the workflow of the investigated icm system is shown in fig.
.
to detect incidents various system monitors and alerting tools are deployed at different levels of a real world large online service 305identifying linked incidents in large scale online service systems esec fse november virtual event usa table an illustrative of different types of linkage.

system in microsoft.
as shown in fig.
the system is constructed with a multi layer structure.
microsoft provides thousands of online services for billions of users all around the world.
in this section we first provide an overview of the incident management process in a large online service system from microsoft and discuss the potential of using incident linkage information to accelerate incident mitigation and root cause analysis.
then we conduct a detailed investigation on incident links such as conditions when incidents are linked and examples of linked incidents.
finally we will introduce the hierarchical structure of the system and show the importance of correctly identifying cross component incident links.
due to privacy policies of microsoft we have deliberately masked sensitive data throughout this paper.
in the icm system each application is composed of several services and each service is composed of several components.
each component will detect if an element fails to meet its expected functionality.
if an element fails an incident report will be automatically generated using the pre defined patterns filled with the corresponding environment variables and will be reported to the icm system.
meanwhile the icm system usually allows its users to manually submit incident reports with customized descriptions to the system because there are always failure situations that have impact on customers but cannot be detected by existing monitors.
the creation of an incident in the icm system would immediately trigger the triage process where engineers in the icm system would investigate and find the correct responsible component to take over the incidents.
once the responsible component of the incident is found oces within the assigned component would try different actions to mitigate the incident.
after the incident is successfully percentage of reported linked incident00.
.
.
a b c d e f machine reported human reportedfigure percentage of human and machine reported linked incidents in different applications application a f mitigated the engineers in the team will conduct postmortem analysis on the root cause of this incident.
they will also determine whether this incident should be linked to other existing incidents and label all the linked incidents accordingly.
this is also known as the incident linkage step.
through the whole process the incident mitigation step usually consumes a lot of time and labor resources.
this consumption can be greatly reduced by transferring past knowledge and solutions to current incidents by identifying the links.
therefore this work focuses on identifying incident links for oces shown as the dashed line in figure so as to quickly find the mitigation solution as well as to figure out the right root cause of the incident.
.
incident links in the icm system there are a variety of incidents linked by on call engineers.
we illustrate some incident links in table .
in general incidents are linked due to duplicate descriptions or relatedness.
.
.
duplicate links.
duplicate links are those linked incidents that refer to the same malfunction case described from the same or different perspectives.
for example the first line in table is a typical duplicate link.
as we have mentioned in the previous section incidents are reported by both human and online monitors the linguistic style of whose descriptions for the same incident may be quite different.
the first line of table shows the linked incidents where the parent and child incident title are similar but with different styles of description.
in our system parent incidents refer to incidents investigated by engineers earlier while child refers to those investigated later.
the parent incident title starts with auto monitoring which indicates that the report is sent by a monitor automatically.

while the child incident is a simple description about a missing database report which is probably reported by a human engineer.
further these two incidents happened at different components mostly because their reporting sources are from different services.
after investigation it has been found that both of the two incidents describe the database missing report issue but they are described in different ways and come from different aspects of the system.
as shown in figure for the six applications in our icm system at least around of the linked incidents are related to human reported incidents.
therefore proposing approaches that can capture both human and machine reported incidents is helpful for finding mitigation methods and root cause analysis.
.
.
sequentially related links.
the second type of link is when the incidents happen sequentially.
in large online service systems different components work jointly to support a number of online services.
it is common that one incident that indicates the malfunction of some parts of the system may also affect the functionality of other parts which leads to incidents that happen sequentially.
for example if the storage of a cloud system broke down many products running on cloud storage would probably be impacted.
if we treat these incidents independently it will largely ignore the rich information of the functional inter dependencies .
in practice linking these incidents together can also significantly help engineers understand specific incidents and better fix the incidents.
figure gives an illustrative example of a series of sequentially reported incidents in the investigated large online system.
in figure i1is an outage with regard to the cooling condition in a data center which is also an incident with high impact.
it directly causes a great number of incidents.
among them i2is also an impactful incident related to the cooling system and it causes six other incidents.
similarly i3is caused by i2 and causes incidents including i4.
finally incident i4causes two alertings i5andi6.
this type of linked incident series is quite common in the system which may substantially reflect the possible operational and functional dependency on different components services and projects.
among all incidents presented in figure the textual description of these incidents may be distinct and the components these linked incidents belong to can be quite different.
all these incidents happened sequentially one after another .
traditional bug de duplicate methods have not considered this type of links.
.
cross component links in the current icm system a great proportion of the incident links are cross component links meaning that the two linked incidentstable title of the incidents in figure incident title i1 cooling system is malfunctioned and impacted multiple services in the sa area i2 sa area datacenter experiencing cooling issues i3 alertings reaches threshold temperature metric api is overload i4 database account login error and the dependency components error i5 alerting dependency component analysis meets errors i6 alerting web api has delays.
belong to different components which may be either duplicate links or related links.
these links are strong indicators of the underlying component structure which keeps evolving due to frequent updates in the system.
for example in the following case component a and component b are related by the sequential link between incident a andincident b .
such cases of cross component incident links occur frequently in our investigated system.
previous bug de duplicate methods mainly focus on incidents happening at the same component and fail to deal with this situation.
in our attempt to predict incident links we consider characterizing this complex component dependency structure in addition to utilizing the textual description of incidents.
incident a application a encountered a network outage.
component a network controller incident b storage timeouts in region wu.
component b web service team overall incident linking is both a challenging and important function in an icm system.
to correctly predict true links among incidents we not only need to effectively learn the semantic representation of a sentence but also need to model the system component dependency structure with high quality.
in our work we consider both semantic and component dependency features to learn incident links.
proposed approach to deal with different types of incident links we propose lidar a deep learning based model for identifying incident links.
in this section we will first introduce the overall structure of the proposed model which is composed of two modules dealing with the textual descriptions and the component dependency information respectively.
then we will describe each module in detail.
finally the integration combining these two modules for link identification will be described.
.
an overview the overall structure of the proposed method lidar is shown in figure .
to consider both the textual information and system structure information we extract two features from each incident for learning the description of incident in natural language and the corresponding component that is responsible for the incident.

the model mainly consists of two modules textual embedding module and component representation learning module.
these two features are fed into two modules the textual embedding module and the component representation module.
these two modules are aimed to extract the textual information and the component dependency information respectively.
first to deal with the challenges brought by textual description from different sources we introduce a text encoder that can grasp the semantic representation of the incident description rather than textual only information.
the textual module is trained to map the textual description into a high dimensional semantic representation.
then to understand the system architecture and dependencies component representation module is realized with a novel network representation learning approach.
each component in the system is learned to be embedded into a low dimensional latent space according to their correlation with other components according to historical links.
afterwards the component level similarity is obtained by the similarity of these component embedded vectors capturing both the similarity in structural position as well as the graph distance between two components.
after calculating similarities from these two distinct modules we integrate them together to obtain the final score and set a threshold for link identification.
.
modeling textual description an incident title describes the symptom of the incident including the location detailed occurring environment impacted services and customers etc.
this kind of comprehensive information is of great help in finding potential links with other incidents.
here we learn the relationship between two incidents descriptions by adopting a representation approach using deep neural network.
the module for textual information extraction is a representation learning process in nature which learns a mapping from texts in natural language into a representative numerical vector in the latent space and pushes the linked incidents close to each other in this space.
to better extract the semantic features we use a three stage textual representation method including word level embedding deep feature mapping and semantic comprehension.
specifically word level embedding is used for learning textual information while the other two stages aim at learning higher level semantic features for each title.
in the first stage the textual description in natural language is embedded word by word as word vectors using fasttext .
this method provides a scalable solution to generate pre trained word vectors on infrequent text by using sub word vectors.
each incident title is then encoded as a numerical matrix of dimension l dwhere lis the number of effective words in the description 308esec fse november virtual event usa y. chen x. yang h. dong x. he h. zhang q. lin j. chen p. zhao y. kang f. gao z. xu d. zhang anddis the length of the vector for each word which is also the dimension we want to preserve in this encoding stage.
in the second stage multiple d convolutional kernels and a max over time pooling layer are applied on the matrix obtained from the first stage.
with the application of multiple convolution kernels of different sizes we can get multiple feature maps extracting the correlation among the words in different lengths of n grams.
the max over time pooling layer selects the most representative ngrams in each channel and thus provides a succinct representation for all the meaningful n grams of the description.
in the third stage a neural network with fully connected layers is adopted to learn the useful relations among the representative n grams and outputs the learned representative vector for the description of each incident.
to learn the matching degree between the descriptions of incidents this encoding module is trained based on a siamese neural network which is a state of the art method for learning entity matching tasks.
it consists of two twin neural networks one for each link description in a pair of incidents with known relation.
these two neural networks are identical in structure sharing the same configuration with the same parameters and weights .
this kind of structure focuses on learning embeddings in deep layer that places the same descriptions closer and can learn underlying semantics.
with the help of such a siamese neural network the encoding schemes are well learned in a supervised fashion according to the incident link labels.
.
modeling component dependency the component dependency structure is learned by treating the components and their dependency as a network.
historical links are used to inspect component relations and these components are then learned to be represented by a low dimensional vector retaining their structural information in the dependency network.
.
.
construction of component dependency network.
in large online service systems a component is usually responsible for a certain kind of incidents.
for example the database component is likely to encounter incidents such as running out of memory no response to query etc.
to some extent component information provides strong hints on possible links over the incidents.
the component dependency network is constructed in the following way for all the historical incident links up to a specific time point we find all the corresponding components of the involved incidents.
then for each pair of different components connect them with an edge if they each have at least one incident linked to each other.
a component dependency network g v e is thus constructed with v vi representing the set of components and e representing the set of existence of historical incident links between every two components.
.
.
encoding component dependency network.
the component dependency will be encoded into a network representation which is in essence a mapping function from all the component vin the component dependency network gto a continuous d dimensional feature space .
the primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent or encode the network structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models.
here we utilizenode2vec an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks.
based on the established component dependency network we first adopt the nd order random walk sampling strategy in node2vec and obtain sequences of components.
then the skip gram representation learning framework is adopted to encode components as dense low dimensional representations.
finally the distance or similarity between two given components in the dependency network can be easily calculated based on the output of the component representation learning module.
.
combining structural and textual information both the textual embedding and the component representation learning will output its own vector representation for different types of information.
based on these learned representations we can calculate the linkage confidence score s i j for any two incidents i andj s i j scomp i j stext i j where scomp andstextrepresent the similarity calculated using the vector representations from the component representation learning module and the textual embedding module respectively.
here the similarity score scomp andstextis calculated by the cosine distance in corresponding semantic space.
the larger s i j is the more likely that there exists a link between incidents iandj.
in practice we can identify links l i j by a threshold cutting the score sinto a binary response l i j 1ifs 0otherwise.
this threshold parameter in and the weight parameter in can be chosen according to the prediction performance on a separate validation set.
the validation set is selected as incident links from the training set.

incident linkage to evaluate the performance of the proposed incident linkage method lidar we test our method on ten p1 p2 ... p10 applications in microsoft and adopt several classical metrics for evaluating classification tasks.
in the experiment lidar is compared with the following stateof the art and baseline methods dwen a deep learning based duplicate bug report detection method which extracts text features from bug reports and builds a neural network model for predicting whether or not two bug reports are duplicate.
dbtm an information retrieval based duplicate bug report detection method which models a bug report as a textual document describing certain technical issue s and models duplicate bug reports as the ones about the same technical issue s .
it takes advantage of both ir based features and topic based features.
simple a naive approach which uses the historical linked components for identifying whether two incidents belongs to the same component if they belong to the same component then these two incidents are linked.
lidar t this is the textual part of our proposed method.
only textual information is used for prediction.
lidar c this is the structure part of our proposed method only component representation information is used for prediction.
lidar this is our proposed method.the comparison results are shown in table .
the ten subject applications are labeled as p1 p2 ... p10in the table.
it is evident that our method can outperform other state of the art duplicate bug detection methods in the incident linkage task among all ten applications.
moreover except for lidar dwen has obtained the highest precision among all other comparing methods in all ten different applications we tested.
the information retrieval based method dbtm has low recall values compared with other methods.
this is mainly because reports for the same incident could use different descriptions in our icm system but the dbtm method is mostly text based.
if some linked incidents do not have the same words in their descriptions the text based methods could fail to detect them.
meanwhile comparing to other baseline methods alternative methods lidar t and lidar c can obtain a significant performance improvements in all subject applications.
we can further find that the overall performance of lidar is better than lidar t and lidar c because combining the component information and textual information can compensate each other and provide better performance.
.
human machine incident linkage an icm system contains incidents reports from two sources human and machine.
incidents from different sources use quite different writing styles.
although most of the reported links are between machine reported incidents machine machine links practitioners pay great attention to investigating links between human reported incidents and machine reported ones human machine links to improve the system .
many text based duplicate bug report detection methods such as dbtm fail to deal with this scenario.

figure visualization of embedded component vectors from services.
approach is capable of identifying both types of links by incorporating different sources of information.
to evaluate the performance for human machine links we randomly select human machine links from our icm system.
meanwhile we select machine machine links in comparison.
the results are listed in table .
as confirmed by previous empirical studies deep learning based methods can obtain the best performance among all other methods.
here we list both lidar and dwen s performance for human machine link prediction task.
due to the space limit we only listed the dwen baseline results in table .
according to table both lidar and dwen can obtain good performance in machine reported incident linkages over percent to be specific.
this is because machine reported incidents share almost the same template and descriptive patterns which can easily be learned by both models.
however for the human reported incidents it is hard to learn the descriptive patterns.
the lidar method is able to understand the semantics of incident descriptions other than the textual information and thus can help link the human reported incidents better.
as a result lidar obtains a significant performance improvement comparing to dwen in the human machine link prediction task.
.
effectiveness of component representation learning apart from the performance evaluation we have shown in table we have also investigated the effectiveness of component representation learning.
ideally the encoded component vector should give a good representation of the component.
one way to check the effectiveness of learned representation is to investigate whether the component vectors from the same service can be grouped together.

figure visualizes multiple embedded component vectors with dimension dc 64from the following services data analytics service database service database query service extension service networking service support service and storage service.
to visualize these dvectors we apply the t sne t distributed stochastic neighbor embedding method to transform the vector from the high dimensional space into a two dimensional space.
in figure components from the same service are presented in the same colour.
by looking at the spatial distribution of components we can find that our embedding method can cluster the components from the same service together in the latent space.
this observation reflects the effectiveness of component representation learning similar components from the same service have similar encoded vectors and are more likely to have incident links.
.
parameter sensitivity in our proposed approach the combination of textual embedding model and component representation learning model is conducted by an ensemble step with the parameter in equation .
to investigate the sensitivity of model performance on the value of this parameter we examine the performance of our proposed model under different values.
figure records the values of three performance metrics i.e.
precision recall and f score obtained in the link identification task with the value of varying from to .
we can see that all of these three evaluation metrics remain stable under different parameter settings.
therefore we can conclude that lidar is parameter insensitive from this experiment and thus it is easy to use without huge effort in tuning the weight parameter.
.
case study to evaluate the effectiveness of lidar in practice an extensive case study is conducted.
it turns out that the proposed method can discover the links between incidents in the large online service system we discussed in section .
a virtual machine reboot case is chosen for illustration.
one day a population of customers had experienced the virtual machine reboot issue in the cn area.
according to the diagnosis records in the icm system this incident 311identifying linked incidents in large scale online service systems esec fse november virtual event usa table a list of candidate incidents that would be potentially linked to an incident happened in cn area ranking component incident title correctness cloud service cache cn component is unhealthy based on on call testing service near real time alerting detected error suspicious application a enumberate storage engineering customer impacted in the cn area for the storage issues cloud service cache highlight cn area is unhelthy because ignored storage alerts storage triage cn component is unhealthy based on on call testing cloud service cache cluster is unhealthy and runners and organic counters are having issues storage triage hit limit for overall bandwidth tps stamp throttling on some cluster storage triage storage roles quorum check failed severely from cluster cloud service cache cn component is unhealthy based on on call testing.

storage database table iom has detected customer impacting incident for storage in cm region storage triage storage roles quorum check failed severely from cmcluster cloud service cache cn component is unhealthy based on on call testing.
is caused by a network failure.
to investigate which incidents are related to this incident we collect hundreds of incidents happened around the reported time of this investigated incident.
the results of identified incidents that are likely to be linked to the investigated one is shown in table .
we list the top most probable candidates ordered by the calculated linking score using lidar.
having checked with on call engineers we find that out of these incident candidates have links with the investigated incident related to the virtual machine rebooting issue .
as shown in the table top incidents happened at the cloud service cache and storage components.
these components are recognized to be commonly affected by network issues the cloud service cache depends heavily on network errors while the performance of storage is largely influenced by the network as well.
as previously shown the root cause of the investigated incident is a network failure.
thus it is quite reasonable to find that incidents from both the cloud service cache component and storage component are more likely to be linked with the investigated incident.
meanwhile incidents textual descriptions imply rich information.
many incidents that are linked to the investigated incident contain the keyword cn area.
this keyword gives the occurring location information of the incident which is obviously an important indicator of possible links.
therefore our model can automatically capture this important textual information for link identification.
another keyword that many linked incidents have is storage .
this observation is consistent with the findings in the above paragraph that the storage component plays an important role.
lessons learned modeling semantics information for incidents.
in our investigated system incidents are reported by both engineers and automated monitors.
different incident formatting patterns from human and machine lead to different textual distribution in the incident titles although the semantic information they try to convey is quite similar.
to learn the linking patterns from diverse textual sources we adopt the siamese network based on textual convolutional neuralnetwork textcnn which is proved practical for mining semantics of natural language .
by virtue of the textcnn framework our model can not only learn links between incidents that are similar in textual descriptions but also those incidents with different textual descriptions but the same semantic meaning i.e.
the duplicate incidents from different sources.
effectiveness of components representation.
the underlying component dependency structure of online service systems is extremely complex.
although a complete component structure can be obtained by piecing up the designed system architecture the actual functional dependency and common error propagation structure can hardly be derived purely from these system architectures.
therefore we choose a data driven approach to establish such a component dependency graph from an incident perspective.
the learned component dependency graph is therefore more appropriate for analysis and diagnosis of incidents and can help us understand such a large complex system better.
fusing information from different sources.
as explained both the textual description and the component structure contain key information about different aspects of incident links which motivates us to combine these two sources together in our model.
the textcnn module can well capture the underlying semantic information in the incident title and the siamese network is capable of learning to match incidents of all types of links.
moreover the learned component representation naturally benefits the identification of links across components including most duplicate links and related links and thus can supplement and improve the incident linking model.
by integrating different data types and different information sources our proposed model sees a great improvement in the incident linking task.

fault diagnosis of software intensive systems our approach for incident linking could largely help with the process of root cause analysis which is also a well studied topic in literature.
root cause analysis also referred to as fault localization fault isolation or alarm event correlation is the process of inferring the set of faults that generate a given set of symptoms .
it is the key procedure of troubleshooting in large systems and is widely applied in a number of different areas such as computer networks software industrial systems and so on.
understanding the root cause of observed symptoms can largely help the healing and improvement of large online systems.
reviewed different techniques in the literature and how they satisfy performance and scalability requirements.
it also listed several types of challenges with regard to system level rca including the combination of both domain knowledge and system knowledge.there are also works on failure prediction for a system with inter connected components in literature but few work has focused on predicting the potential links among the numerous incidents.
proposed an approach towards automated repair of software defined networks sdn using the causal graph called meta provenance .
however this kind of approach cannot be directly applied to complex online systems for two reasons first the incidents failures in sdn applications are restricted in smaller domains while in large online systems the incidents come from much more types of sources second the incidents in sdn applications can form a much denser causal graph but the incidents in large online systems tend to spread into many different components making their relations quite sparse in terms of an incident graph.
conclusion the identification of linked incidents is important for building an intelligent icm system for large online service systems.
correctly identifying linked incidents can not only help mitigate the incidents but also analyze the root causes to prevent recurrence of similar incidents.
in this paper we investigate the linked incidents in a large online service system and find two important indicators for identifying potential links among numerous incidents the component dependency learned from past incident links and the textual description of incidents.
starting from this observation lidar a deep learning based framework integrating two representation learning modules for the component dependency and the textual descriptions is designed to discover potential links among numerous incidents.
extensive experiments and studies have shown the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed method.
we believe our work can greatly facilitate incident management for large scale online systems.
despite the superior performance of lidar there are limitations in current implementation.
first the component dependency network is established using historical links thus it does not consider new components that have not appeared in the historical incidents.
moreover the training phase of current implementation is done offline so it does not update in a real time manner.
in the future more effort can be devoted to the following directions improving the link identification performance by incorporating more data sources such as the time and location of incident occurrence severity of incidents developing an online learning scheme based on the current work so that any new signals on incident linkage can be integrated into the model in time extending the current work to combine with other adjacent processes such as the triage phase and the root cause analysis process to make the icm system more intelligent.
