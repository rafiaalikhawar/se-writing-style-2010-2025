equality and fairness can result in user dissatisfaction and negative socioeconomic impact.
engineering these values in software however requires technical and methodological support throughout the development life cycle.
this paper investigates to what extent top software engine ering se conferences and journals have included research on human values in se.
we investigate the prevalence of human values in recent publications in these top venues.
we classify these publications based on their relevance to di erent values against a widely used value structure adopted fr om the social sciences.
our results show that a only a small proportion of the publications directly consider values classified as directly relevant publications b for the majority of the values very few or no directly relevant publications were found and c the prevalence of directly relevant publications was higher in se conferences compared to se journals.
this paper shares these and other insights that may motivate future research on human values in software engineering.

in this paper we investigate to what extent research in top tier seconferencesandjournalshasconsideredthefullrangeofhuman values.
in particular we classified publications in the international conference on software engineering icse the acm joint europeansoftwareengineeringconferenceandsymposiumonthe foundations of software engineering esec fse the ieee transactions on software engineering tse and the acm transactions on software engineering and methodology tosem from to based on their relevance to different values.
whilst we acknowledgethat other sub disciplines such ashcior requirements engineering may contain work on se and human values classifying such venues is out of the scope of this paper and would warrant further study.
thispaperinvestigatesthepublicationsfromthosevenuesgenerallyconsideredtobetopgeneralsevenues.forthisreasonspecialist journals such as empirical software engineering ese focused on empirical se was considered out of scope of this study.
we argue that if the top venues do not address human values then the sefieldmaywanttofindwaystolifttheprominenceofresearch on values in se.
the paper addresses the following three research questions rq1 to what extent do publications in top se venues address human values in software?
rq2 which values are commonly considered in publications in top se venues?
rq3 howarethosepublicationsaddressinghumanvaluesdistributed across venues?

a paper was classified as directly relevantto a particular value if its main research focus is to define refine measure orvalidateaparticularvalue orproposeasolution e.g.
a tool technique or methodology to address one or more human values in software.
we use direct relevance rather thansimply relevance because papers often make broad statements intheirintroductorytextaboutthebenefitoftheworktosociety but such claims may not be the main research focus nor have been validated.
direct relevance was assigned only to those papers withamainfocusonhumanvalues.multipleraterswereusedto cometoconsensusontheclassification.thereisinevitably however some degree of subjectivity in the classification.
we therefore followedrecommendedpracticeinsocialsciencetomitigatethreats to validity.

therefore we take inspiration from the social sciences.
social scientists have been searching for the most useful way toconceptualizebasichumanvaluessincethe1950s .in1973 rockeach captured human values and organized them into 2categories .
in schwartz introduced his theory of basic humanvalues henceforthreferredtoasschwartz svaluesstructure svs which recognized human values grouped into value categories .
while these two value structures remain the most well recognized ways of representing values there areat least ten other value classifications .
in this paper we use schwartz stheory whichisthemostcitedandmostwidelyapplied classification in the social sciences .
it has also been applied in numerouscomputerscience andsestudies .forexample schwartzwasusedtoincorporatevaluesinthesedecisionmakingprocess tomeasurethevaluesofsoftwaredevelopers and to predict movie genres for certain personality types .
in svs schwartz introduced motivationally distinct value categoriesrecognizedacrossmorethan20cultures .eachvalue categoryhasunderlyingdistinctmotivationalgoals seetable1 which relate to one or more of three fundamental needs of human existence namely needs of individuals as biological organisms requisites of coordinated social interaction and survival and welfare needs of groups .
schwartz subdivided each value category into a set of closely related values .
these value categories and values are arranged in a circular motivational structure as shown in figure .

to classify papers against values we followed a methodology similar to that of prior classification work in se .
as withpriorstudies ourswasbasedonmanualclassificationofpaperabstractsbymultipleraters.classificationbasedonabstracts ratherthanreadingthefullpaper issub optimalbutstrikesabalancebetweenaccuracyandtimeneededforthestudy.allpapers had multiple raters and inter rater agreement was measured using fleiss kappa .
in total we employed seven raters 5m 2f with varying levels of experience in se research ranging from phd students to professors.
note that this is a relatively high number of raters compared to similar studies .

to make choices about these design decisions we 411first carried out a pilot study before carrying out the main study.
both the pilot and main study assumed svs as the classification scheme.allratershadreasonableknowledgeaboutsvsandhad conducted research on socio technical aspects in se.
.
pilot study thepilotstudyhadthreesteps i paperselectionandallocation of papersto raters ii paper classification and iii calibration of classification decisions made by different raters.
the aim of the pilotstudywasnottomeasurerelevanceofpaperstovalues rather we had the following objectives totesttheappropriatenessofsvsastheclassificationscheme for se publications todevelopacommonunderstandingregardingthemeaning of human values in se contexts to collect insights from raters to feed into the experimental design of the main study i paper selection and allocation of papers to raters.
we randomly selected49papersfromicse2018asourpilotstudydataset.these were equally allocated among the seven raters with three raters per paper.
common practice is to assign two raters per paper threewereassigned inthepilottogeta betterunderstanding of how to map papers to values.
icse was chosen as it has thebroadest coverage of se research .
we chose the most recent icse proceedings at the time of the study.
ii paperclassification.
ratersclassifiedpapers independently based on the title abstract and keywords which is an approach usedinsimilarclassificationstudiesinse .raterswere instructedtodecideifapaperwas relevant or notrelevant to human values relevance was deliberately left ill defined as one of the objectives of the pilot was to influence the definition of this terminthemainstudy.forrelevantpapers raterswereaskedto classifythepapersintoonevaluecategory e.g.
power andthen into one value within the category such as wealthorauthority see figure .
raters were not mandated to follow the hierarchical structure of svs that is they could classify a paper into value x andvaluecategoryyevenifxdidnotbelongtocategoryy.the raters however followed a common protocol for this as part of the calibrationinthepilotstudy.thiswastogiveusawaytoassess the appropriateness of the hierarchy in svs.
iii calibration.
afterclassification allsevenratersmettodiscusstheclassificationdecisions.themainobjectivewastocalibrate decisionsandusethistorefinethedefinitionofvaluesrelevance.
the intention was notto decide which rater picked the correct classification.
following the pilot study we made a number of observations which were fed into experimental design of the main study.
observation raters found that almost every paper could be classified into a small number of values such as helpfulness wisdomorinfluence because ingeneral allresearchtriestoadvance knowledge.
thus an indirect argumentcould almost always be madewhyapaperisrelevanttohelpfulness e.g.
apaperontest ingishelpfultotesters wisdom anypaperadvancesknowledge thus leading to greater wisdom or influence e.g.
a paper on animprovedsoftware processinfluenceshowsoftware isdeveloped .
this observation illustrated the difficulty of working withvaguelydefinedconceptssuchasvalues butalsotheimportance of a better definition of relevance.
decision1 itisbeyondthescopeofthispapertofullyandformally define all the values hence it was decided in the main study to use inter rater agreement as evidence that a value was sufficiently understood in the context of a particular paper to provideconfidenceintheresults.thedefinitionofrelevancewas however refined forthemain study.raterswere instructednot to make indirect arguments why a paper might be relevant toavalue.instead inthemainstudy classificationwasbasedon direct relevance a paper is defined as directly relevant to a valueifitsresearchfocusistodefine refine measure orvalidate a particular value or propose a solution e.g.
a tool technique or methodology aimedataddressingahumanvalue.thisrevised definition places emphasis on those papers with a main research contribution of a particular value not merely a broad statement about relevance to a value.
observation2 ratersobservedthatsomepapersaddressedvalues as a generalconcept rather than considering any specific value.
anexamplewouldbeapaperthatpresentsamethodologyfor refiningvaluesintoasoftwarearchitecture.thesepapersshould not be classified into any particular value category or value.
decision to facilitate classification of such papers we introduced a new value category in the main study named holistic view.
a paper classified under holistic view relates to values generally without focusing on any specific value .
observation3 ratersfoundthatsomepapers giventheirbroader coverage of values should be classified under more than one value.
decision3 toaccommodatesuchpapersinthemainstudy raters were allowed to select up to three values.
this decision allowed raters to appropriately link a paper with the number of values it addressed rather than being obliged to pick just one category as done in similar studies .
observation4 thepilotstudygaveusanopportunitytomeasure howlongittookraterstoratepapers.wefoundthat onaverage each rater spent four minutes per abstract.
given the number of papers in the main study see table assigning three raters per paper would be infeasible.
decision out of necessity we reduced the number of raters in the main studyto two.
this is consistent withthe number of raters in similar studies .
.
main study similar to the pilot study the main study also had three phases i paper selection and allocation of papers to raters ii paper classification and iii disagreement resolution.
the final stage was different to the pilot study because rather than calibrating ratings toinformexperimentaldesign ratersindisagreementmettotry and reach a consensus.
i paper selection and allocation of papers to raters.
for the main study we selected papers from icse fse tse and tosem over thelastfouryears.thesearethesamevenuesusedinsimilarpaper classification studies .
we selected all papers in tse and tosem.forfse weusedallpapersfromthemaintrack andfor icse we used all papers from the main track from the software 412table classified publications by venue track and year venue track 2015201620172018total icse main track icse seip icse seis esec fse main track123143124122512 tse tosem total engineeringinpractice seip track andfromthesoftwareengineering in society seis track.

ii paper classification.
similar to the pilot study raters were askedtoclassifypapersonthebasisofthetitle abstractandkeywords.
however the main study used a different definition of relevance assuggestedbythepilotstudy.raterswereaskedtoclassify papers as directly relevant or not directly relevant where the definitionofdirectrelevanceisasgiveninsection3.
.papersfounddirectlyrelevanttovalueswerefurtherclassifiedintoacategory and then to a specific value s .
throughout the process raters complied with the decisions made during the calibration step in the pilot study.
iii disagreementresolution.
giventhesubjectivenatureofthe classification raters sometimes disagreed.
this could arise at three levels a relevance level where raters disagreed on whether a paper wasdirectly relevantor not b value categorylevel where ratersdisagreedonthechoiceofvaluecategory and c valuelevel where raters disagreed on the choice of value.
to attempt to resolve these disagreements raters met to discuss their views about why the paper in question was classified in a certainway.iftheraterscouldnotcometoanagreement athird rater was introduced as an arbiter.
the arbiter facilitated a second round of discussion sharing his or her own views to facilitate a consensus.however ifthedisagreementpersisted thearbiterdid not force a decision.
alignedwithpreviousstudies wecalculatedinter rateragreementusingfleiss kappa onceattemptsatresolvingdisagreements had taken place.
the results of the kappa measure are interpreted according to the agreement strengths introduced by landis andkoch .
we achieved almost perfect agreements on relevance levelandcategorylevelwithkappavaluesequalto0.92and0.

the agreement of value level was found as substantial with kappa value equal to .

discussion ourresultsindicatequitestronglythattopseresearchconferences and journals pay only limited attention to human values in software.furthermore ofthosepapersclassifiedasconsideringhuman values asignificantproportion relatedto security thus implying that even where consideration of human values exists it often tends to be about security issues.
it would be premature to conclude that se research ignores humanvalues.itmaybethatworkonhumanvaluesinseexistsin other se conferencesand journals or indeed in otherdisciplinary areas such as hci or information systems.
nevertheless we argue that the lack of human values in leading general se venues is problematicasitsuggestseitherthatseresearchersarenotpayingsufficientattentiontotheimportanceofhumanvalues orthatthey are butsuchworkisnotappearingintheleadingsevenues and hence arguably not receiving the most visibility.
thereare however twofurtherconsiderationswhichaffecthow our results should be interpreted.
firstly oneshouldnotexpectallsepaperstobedirectlyrelevant to values.
for example a paper describing a new static analysis techniqueisconcernedchieflywithadvancingthestateoftheartinstatic analysis not with broader questions of human values.
indeed one might argue that most se papers are of this ilk and hence one should only aimfor a relatively lowpercentage of values relevant papers.
whilst valid this argument begs the question as to what is the target percentageofvaluespapersthatthecommunityshouldaimfor?thisisanopenquestion butwewouldarguethatitshould be higher than the current number because as demonstrated insection of human values were not considered at all.
thismeans that of values generally deemed to be important insociety are ignored in leading se research.

for example it has of tenbeencommentedthatvalueslikematureloveorobedienceare outside the scope of se.
we argue the contrary.
software pervades every aspect of our society and increasingly with the advent of artificialintelligence makesdecisionsonourbehalf.surely then allvaluesarerelevanttosoftware.evenvaluesthatmayseemat firsttobefarfromtraditionalse suchasmaturelove arerelevant if we are to design software systems that promote or support love.

note that as our raters were not constrained by the schwartz hierarchy any concerns about the hierarchy s relevance to an se context do not affect our overall results.
note also that extreme care needs to be taken if attempting to adapt schwartzfor se.
the schwartz modelhas been validated fordecadesbymanyresearchersacross20differentcultures itis far from a trivial task to create a new values theory.

threats to validity inthissectionwediscusslimitationsofthisresearchcategorized asinternal externalandconstruct validity threats.
construct validity choosingaclassificationschemesuitedfor thesoftwareengineeringdomainwasoneofthemainchallenges forthisresearch.intheabsenceofanse specificschemetoclassify human values we selected svs a well established theory fromsocial sciences to study and explain human values that has been successfully applied in se .
svs was adopted in this research as an independent classification scheme instead of developing our own to mitigate the risk of introducing researcher bias.
the definition of directly relevant was crucial to the clas sification of selected publications.
the definition was therefore carefullydevelopedasacriteriatoallowclassificationofresearch mainlyfocusedonaddressinghumanvaluesbutatthesametime avoid classifying almost every paper as relevant merely on the premise that all research is helpful or useful .
similar toglass etal.
lackof mutualexclusion was achallengeforourclassificationscheme.itwasoftenpossibletoclassifyapaperasrelatingtomorethanoneindividualvalue.thiswebelieve was more to do with the ill defined nature of human values than a limitation of the chosen classification scheme.
still the potentialthreat was mitigated by using an iterative process and conduct ing rater training to better understand and clarify relationships between values and their categories.
insomecases theratersfoundthatcertainpaperswererelatedto humanvaluesingeneralratherthantoanyparticularvalue.forcing such papers into a single value category would have influenced results.
to mitigate this we added a new holistic view category to ourclassificationscheme.thiscategoryisneededforsebecause some papers develop general values methods rather than a specific value.
we classified such papers in holistic view.
internal validity threatsforthisstudyarisefromthecomplexities of categorizing papers into the selected classification scheme.

the findings of this study however may be biased towards icse and fse as they published more papers in the selected period compared to journals icse fse vs. tse and tosem .
related work classification of papers has been widely adopted in the se liter ature as a way of providing insights on trends anddirectionsinseresearch.suchfindings thoughnotconclusive can indicate the general attitude of se researchers as well as the priorities in se research.
paper classification helps to highlight the gaps and the needs for further research in specific se domains.mary shaw for instance analyzed the abstracts of research papers submitted and accepted to icse to identify differentresearch types trends in research questions contribution typesand validation approaches.
the author also studied the program committee discussions regarding the acceptance or rejection of the papers.
another example is the work by vessey et al.
who categorizedsamplesofsepaperspublishedfrom1995to1999in six journals based on topic method and approach.
another study by williams et al.
classified icse publications from using a framework developed in psychology and sociology as alens to understand how se research captures human and social perspectives.
however paper classification methods rely on classification schemes that can be general or specific depending on the purposeoftheclassification.toclassifydifferentsepapers montesi and lago presented a classification approach based on the call for papers of top tier se conferences and journals included inthejournalcitationreportsandtheinstructionstoauthorsof relevantjournalsandpublishedworks.also ioannidisetal.

sjoberg et al.
surveyed se papers in nine journals and three conferences from to with the aim to characterize controlled experiments in se by characterizing thetopics ofthe experimentsand theirsubjects tasks and environments.
moreover some paper classifications have identified gaps in se practice.anexampleistheworkbystolandfitzgerald where the authors observed the lack of a holistic view in se research.
the work contributed a framework for positioning a holistic set of research strategies and showed its strengths and weaknesses in relation to various research components.

the authors compared a random sample of papersintwoperiods 1990and1991 andfoundthat the quantity of empirical evaluation has grown but the soundness of evaluation has not grown at the same pace.

conclusions and future work repeated incidents of software security and privacy violations continuetoattractresearchers attention.inthispaper however we investigated the prevalence of a broader range of human values including trust equalityandsocial justice in software engineering research.
using the schwartz values structure as our classification scheme whichidentifies58humanvalues weclassified1350papers recently published in top tier se conferences and journals.
we conclude that only a small proportion of se research in leading venues directly considers human values.
