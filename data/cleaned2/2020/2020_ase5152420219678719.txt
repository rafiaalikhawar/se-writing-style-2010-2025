however stl model checking is still quite limited as existing stl model checking methods are either incomplete or very inefficient.
this paper presents a new smt based model checking algorithm for verifying stl properties of cyber physical systems.
we propose a novel translation technique to reduce the stl bounded model checking problem to the satisfiability of a first order logic formula over reals which can be solved using state of the art smt solvers.
our algorithm is based on a new theoretical result presented in this paper to build a small but complete discretization of continuous signals which preserves the bounded satisfiability of stl.
our translation method allows an efficient stl model checking algorithm that is refutationally complete for bounded signals and that is much more scalable than the previous refutationally complete algorithm.
index terms signal temporal logic model checking smt i. i ntroduction many safety critical systems such as cars and airplanes interact with physical entities and therefore are hybrid systems exhibiting both discrete and continuous behaviors.
the safety requirements of such cyber physical systems cpss often involve continuously changing states of physical environments.
signal temporal logic stl is a temporal logic formalism to specify linear time properties of continuous signals .
stl is widely used for specifying and analyzing safety requirements of safety critical cpss including automotive avionics robotics and medical systems .
there are many approaches for analyzing stl properties.
stl monitoring checks whether a signal satisfies an stl property and stl falsification tries to find a counterexample of an stl property by randomly generating signals.
these methods are based on concrete sampling of signals and cannot be used to guarantee correctness.
on the other hand the reachability analysis of hybrid automata such as can guarantee the correctness of invariants and some stl formulas can be encoded using reachability .
however model checking of general stl properties is still very limited as existing stl model checking algorithms are incomplete or inefficient.
recently two stl model checking techniques have been proposed.
the method proposed in this work was partially supported by the national research foundation of korea nrf grants funded by the korea government msit no.

2019r1c1c1002386 .samples a finite number of concrete time points to perform the reachability analysis over those points and therefore the correctness cannot be guaranteed.
the work provides a refutationally complete model checking procedure for stl but the algorithm is not scalable in practice.
a common challenge in existing approaches is to discretize continuous signals to reason about temporal operators.
since model checking of hybrid systems involves an infinite number of states that continuously change over an uncountable time domain signal discretization has been studied for effectively analyzing temporal logic properties e.g ltl of hybrid systems.
the important problem is obtaining complete discretization of a signal to preserve the correctness of model checking while maintaining the size of discretization as small as possible for the performance of the analysis.
this paper proposes a new smt based model checking algorithm for verifying stl properties of hybrid systems that is refutationally complete with respect to bounded signals.
our algorithm is based on a new theoretical result to build small but complete discretized signals for the bounded satisfiability of stl.
our algorithm combines the advantages of the previous methods it considers a finite number of sampled time points but which is complete for stl model checking without any loss of information.
we consider bounded signals with finite variable points excluding zeno behaviors which is typically assumed when analyzing real time and hybrid systems .
for a signal with finite variable points the satisfaction of a temporal logic formula must depend on a finite number of sampled time points.
there exist signal discretization methods proposed for different temporal logics but they cannot be directly applicable to stl.
the main difficulty comes from the timed until operator ui which often results in too fine discretized signals that prevent efficient model checking.
this paper presents a novel technique to build a complete but reasonably coarse discretized signals for stl sec.
iv .
a complete discretization of signals allows reducing the bounded satisfaction problem of stl into the satisfiability of a first order formula.
it is well known that temporal logics for discrete systems such as ltl and mitl can be analyzed for each subformula in a modular way .
however an effective translation of stl is nontrivial because temporal operators in stl involves arbitrary nonnegative intervals of the real 36th ieee acm international conference on automated software engineering ase 36th ieee acm international conference on automated software engineering ase .

p reliminaries on signal temporal logic a. hybrid automata hybrid automata are state machines with continuous variables.
many verification techniques and tools for hybrid systems use hybrid automata as their modeling formalisms and cps models can often be translated into hybrid automata for verification .
therefore we also use hybrid automata as the modeling formalism in this paper.
in a hybrid automaton h discrete states are given by a set ofmodes q and continuous states are specified by a finite set of real valued variables x. a state of his a pair q v of a mode q qand a vector v rl where x l. aninitial condition init q v defines a set of initial states.
aninvariant condition inv q v defines a set of valid states.
ajump condition jump q v q v defines a discrete transition between states q v q v .
a flow condition q vt flow q v t defines a continuous evolution of x s values from v0to vtover time tin mode q. consequently a hybrid automaton ish q x init inv flow jump .
asignal represents a continuous execution of a hybrid automaton h given by a function q rlover time domain dom .
the value t denotes the state of hat time t. a signal isbounded if its domain is bounded i.e.
.
a signal is atrajectory ofh written h if describes a valid behavior of h i.e as depicted in fig.
there exists a sequence of times t0 t1 t2 such that i t0 is an initial state ii for each time interval ti ti h s state evolves from ti according to the flow condition satisfying the invariant condition but not changing the mode and iii at each time point ti i a discrete transition takes places by the jump condition.t0 t1 t2 t3 t0 q0 t1 q1 t2 q2 t3 q3 fig.

figure shows a hybrid automaton for a simple autonomous car .
the position x y and direction depend on its speed vand steering angle see fig.
.
the car dynamics is modeled as the ordinary differential equations x vcos y vsin v l tan where lis the distance between the front and rear axles .
there are three modes left straight and right of assigning different control values to vand .
initially the car can be in any of the three modes.
when the difference between and a goal direction gis greater than some threshold c the car turns left or right at low speed vlowwith steering angle .
otherwise the car goes straight at high speed vhigh.
b. signal temporal logic properties of hybrid automata trajectories can be specified in signal temporal logic stl .
the syntax of stl over a set of state propositions is defined by p ui where p and i r 0is an interval of nonnegative real numbers.
other operators can be derived by equivalences e.g.
i ui i i .
the set of all subformulas of is denoted by sub and the set of propositions occurring in is denoted by prop .
the meaning of a proposition pis specified as a function p q rl bassigning to each state q v ofha boolean value in b. examples of state propositions include relational expressions of the form f x 0over variables x where f rl ris a real valued function.
we assume that state propositions are definable in first order real arithmetic.
example .
for the hybrid automaton in example consider the following stl formulas v v at some time in the first30seconds vwill go over km h and stay above km h for20seconds .

for two intervals iandj the minkowski sum i j i i j j is denoted by i j and the minkowski difference i j i i j j is denoted by i j. e.g.
and a b c d a d b c .
for a singular interval t the sets t iand t iare often written as t iandt i respectively.
the following property for interval operations is particularly useful for stl.
lemma .
for two intervals i k r t k iiff there exists t tsuch that t kandt t i. the semantics of stl is defined as the satisfaction relation of a formula with respect to a signal and a time t. to properly deal with bounded signals a bound is explicitly considered.

a time point tis called a variable point for pif the truth value of pchanges at time t. for example consider a signal y cos t over in fig.

there are four variable points for proposition y .
an stl formula isstable for a signal in an interval j written stable j if the truth of does not change over j i.e.
for any u u j u iff u .
definition .

the behavior of real time and hybrid systems is associated with sequences of disjoint time intervals .
let denote the set .

apartition of an interval dis a family of nonempty disjoint intervals p ji i where p n such that i each interval jiis either open or singular ii sn i 1ji d and iii sup ji inf j k for any i k .consider two partitions p ji i andq kj j of the same interval.
qis called finer thanp written q p if each interval kj q is a subset of some interval ji p. a finer partition qis called a refinement of a coarser partition p .
the coarsest partition that is finer than both p andqis denoted by p q which always exists .
example .
consider three partitions of the interval p q andr .
notice that e p e q and e r .
then ris finer than both of pandq and r p q .
but neither p q norq p holds.
a formula is called stable for a signal inp ji i or pis stable for with respect to written stable p if is stable for in each interval ji p. when stable p ji indicates that is true in ji and ji indicates that is false in ji.
a formula that is stable in pis stable in a finer partition q p .
lete i denote the set of endpoints of an interval i e.g.
e ande .
let e p denote the set of all endpoints of the intervals in a partition p. variable points are then related to stable partitions as follows.
proposition .
for a signal and a partition pof an interval d dom stable p iff every variable point t of indfor is an endpoint in p i.e.
t e p .
in many real time temporal logics the stability of a formula is related to the stability of its subformulas .
the cases for negation and conjunction are stated as follows.
proposition .
for a signal and a partition pof an interval d dom stable p iffstable p .
if stable p andstable p then stable p .
the case of ui is not straightforward.
even if and are stable for a signal inp ui need not be stable inp.
as depicted in fig.
the satisfaction of ui at time tdepends on the satisfaction of int iand the satisfaction of in .
there are several methods to build a refinement of pby taking iinto account .
suppose that there is a finite number of variable points of a signal for the set of propositions in an stl formula .
by the above results there exists a partition psuch that every subformula of is stable for inp.
in this case we call fully stable for inp.
there is also a finite number of variable points of for the set of subformulas sub .

o verview of bounded stl m odel checking a. problem statement the stl model checking problem is to check whether every trajectory of a hybrid automaton hsatisfies an stl formula .
this problem is in general undecidable the reachability problem of hybrid automata a special case of stl model checking is already undecidable .
an appropriate notion of bounds is needed to cope with this undecidability.

.
an smt based bounded stl model checking framework bounded stl model checking restricts the search for a counterexample of a formula tobounded trajectories with finite variable points .
there are two bound parameters for the time domain and nfor the number of variable points for the set of subformulas sub .
that is the truth of each sub can change at most ntimes in .
definition bounded stl model checking problem .
an stl formula is satisfied at time tin a hybrid automaton h up to bounds 0andn n denoted by h t n iff t for every trajectory hwith at most nvariable points with respect to sub where dom .
b. smt based bounded stl model checking the bounded stl model checking problem can be solved by discretizing signals with full stability .
when an stl formula is fully stable for a signal in a partition p i.e.
stable p for each sub can be discretized as the truth values of the subformulas sub in each interval in p. this observation leads to the concept of discrete signals.
definition .
adiscrete signal for a formula is p where pis a partition and sub p bassigns a truth value to subformula sub and interval ji p. intuitively a discrete signal involves an infinite number of matching continuous signals.
a continuous signal matches a discrete signal p written if i pis a partition of dom ii is fully stable for in p and iii i iff ji for each subformula sub and interval ji p. the bounded stl model checking problem h t n is equivalent to finding a bounded trajectory hthat satisfies the negated formula i.e.
t n .
this problem can be decomposed into the problems of finding a discrete signal p where i andt ji and finding a bounded trajectory hthat matches .
an smt based bounded stl model checking framework proposed in is shown in fig.
.
the existence of discrete signals and matching trajectories is encoded in smt provided the reachability of hcan be encoded in smt.
this procedure is refutationally complete if a bounded counterexample to exists then it is guaranteed to be found for some bounds.
c. key challenge and our approach one of the major challenges in smt based bounded stl model checking is to find efficient smt encodings.
indeed the previous technique often produces very complex and huge smt encodings that conventional smt solvers cannot solve within a reasonable time.
the contribution of this paper is to propose much more efficient smt encodings.

.
an stl formula ui and a stable partition pfor and the inefficiency is due to redundant endpoints in discrete signals.
e.g.
suppose both p1andp2are fully stable for in fig.
.
the corresponding discrete signals are equivalent in terms of the satisfaction of but p2contains redundant endpoints t t4 and t6 .
a fully stable partition built for in usually has many redundant endpoints.
another problem is that a bound parameter of the previous algorithm is the number of variable points for the set of propositions prop .
a signal with kvariable points for prop can have o k 2d variable points for sub where d is the nesting depth of ui.
therefore the previous algorithm may generate unnecessarily large encodings.
we address this challenge in a twofold way.
we develop an efficient technique to build fully stable partitions for stl that are much smaller than those produced by the previous approaches .
we develop a flexible technique to encode discrete signals its bound parameter is the number of variable points for the set of subformulas sub and the size of the resulting encoding is linear in the size of .
iv.
p artition construction for stl this section presents a simple method to build a partition that is fully stable for an stl formula .
as mentioned there are a couple of methods that can be adapted to build fully stable partitions for stl formulas but they result in too fine refinements in general.
section iv a presents a precise condition for the stability of ui .
using this condition section iv b explains how to construct a reasonably coarse partition for ui .
finally section iv c explains how to build fully stable refinements for general stl formulas.
a. stability conditions for ui figure illustrates the main intuition behind our method.
consider a partition p ji i where both and are stable in p. suppose is true in j2 .
.
.
j and is true inj6 .
.
.
j .
by definition ui is true at time t if there exists t tsuch that t t iandt s8 m 6jm.
by lemma this condition is equivalent to t s8 m 6jm i. that is ui is stably true in s8 m 6jm i.
346the important observation from fig.
is that the satisfaction of ui can be expressed using a partition pfor the subformulas and .
if ui is true at time t jn there exists a subsequent interval jm m n such that is true in jm and is true in all intermediate intervals jn jn .
.
.
j m. the relation between such indices nand mis denoted by u p in short up .
the following lemma then follows from lemma and the definition of up.
lemma .
suppose and are stable for a signal in a partition p ji i .
let n m u piff jm and ji for any n i m. fort jn t ui iff n m up.
t jm i. the above lemma exactly characterizes the set of time points in which ui is true.
this gives a necessary and sufficient condition for ui to be stable in a refinement interval k below denoted by nscd ui p k n in short nscdp k n .
letup n denote the image set of nunder the relation up i.e.
up n m n m up .
lemma .
suppose and are stable for a signal in p ji i .
let nscd ui p k n denote the condition k s m up n jm iork s m up n jm i .
for an interval k jn stable k ui iffnscdp k n .
proof.
let t t k. suppose t ui .
by lemma t jm1 ifor some n m up.
this implies k s m up n jm i. since t k t jm2 ifor some m2 up n .
by lemma t ui .
let t s m up n jm iandt s m up n jm i fort t k. then t jm1 ifor some m1 up n but t jm2 ifor any m2 up n .
by lemma we have t ui and t ui .
example .
letp .
consider a formula pu q and a signal such that i ji p q forj2 observes m up jm i where up .
therefore pu qis stably true in the subinterval j2 and stably false in j2.
b. stable refinements for ui variable points in a stable partition pinvolve the rising and falling edges of a boolean truth signal for .
an interval ji p has a rising edge written i p if is true in ji but false in ji or there is no previous interval .
similarly ji p has a falling edge written i p if is true in ji but false in ji or there is no next interval .
definition .
given a partition p ji i andi i p iff ji and i or ji 1 and i p iff ji and i nor ji 1 .consider fig.
.
since up n n by lemma if m 8andt jn then t jm iimplies t ui .
hence s8 m 6jm idoes not contain variable points.
fors8 m 6jm its endpoints are variable points for the left endpoint inf j is a rising edge for and the right endpoint sup j8 is a falling edge for .
accordingly the left and right endpoints of s m jm i are respectively inf j sup i andsup j8 inf i .
this suggests the definition of variable point candidates.
definition .
for a formula ui a partition p and a signal where and are stable for inp the set of variable point candidates c ui p r in short cu p is v m p p v inf j m sup i cd m v v m p p v sup jm inf i cd m v where cd m v n. n m up inf jn v.the until refinement of a partition pfor ui denoted by r ui in short ru isru p q where qis the partition with the endpoints cu p .
not all endpoints of pare considered for finding variable point candidates in cu p only variable points for are needed.
e.g.
in the above example neither inf j sup i norsup j7 inf i is a candidate in cu p. ife cu p e p thenp s until refinement is just p. this motivates the concept of maximally stable partitions with respect to a signal .
definition .
a partition pismaximally stable for if any partition that is strictly coarser than pis not stable for .
it follows from proposition that for a stable partition p there exists a unique maximally stable partition denoted by max p that is coarser than p. simply put max p is the partition with variable points as the only endpoints.
lemma .
suppose is stable for a signal in a partition of domain d. letobe the partition such that e o e d is the set of variable points for ind.
then max p o. a variable point for inpis either an endpoint ofmax p or an endpoint of max p .
the partition max p max p is the coarsest partition that contains all these variable points.
indeed variable point candidates cu p can be obtained using max p max p as follows.
lemma .
given ui suppose and are stable for in a partition pof .
letobemax p max p where o li i .
for any n m uo we have inf ln inf l m sup i inf l m sup i cu p inf ln sup lm inf i sup lm inf i cu p example .
in fig.
o max p max p contains intervals l1 j1 l2 s5 m 2jm and l3 s8 m 6jm.
the left endpoint of l2isinf j2 and the endpoints of l3 iare inf j6 sup i andsup j8 inf i .
since uoand inf j2 inf j6 sup i sup j8 inf i by lemma inf j6 sup i andsup j8 inf i e ru .
347the stability of a formula ui in the until refinement ru follows from lemma and the lemma below.
lemma .
leto max p max p where and are stable for inp.
for any intervals kj ru and lk o kj lkimplies nscdo kj k .
proof sketch.
leto lk k .
it follows from lemma that for each kj ru ifkj lnand n m uo then either kj lm iorkj lm i holds.
then forkj ru andlk o where kj lk by the above claim we can easily see that nscdo kj n holds.
c. fully stable refinements for stl we present how to obtain a fully stable refinement for a formula given a partition that is stable for each proposition inprop .
we inductively build a fully stable refinement for each subformula.
for the negation and conjunction cases we apply the existing methods proposition and for theuicase we apply the until refinement in def.
.
definition .
for an stl formula a signal and a partition p where each proposition p prop is stable for inp the refinement r p is defined by r p p p r p r p r p r p r p r p ui ru r p r p theorem .
an stl formula is fully stable for a signal inr p where each p prop is stable for inp.
proof.
we proceed by structural induction on .
the cases of pand immediately follow from the definitions induction hypothesis and proposition .
let q r p andq r p .
by induction hypothesis stable q andstable q hold.
by the monotonicity of stability with respect to stable q q andstable q q .
by proposition stable q q .
ui let q r p r p .
as shown in the above case and are fully stable for inq.
since ru q and are also fully stable for inru .
leto max q max q .
consider any interval kjin ru .
since ru o there exists an interval lkino such that kj lk.
by lemma nscdo kj k holds.
thus by lemma ui is stable for inkj.
as a consequence ui is fully stable for inru .
example .
letp .
consider an stl formula pu q and a signal such that p p q since p has a rising edge and p has a falling edge cpu q p is .
thus r pu q q where q .
then q pu q similarly since q has a rising edge and q has a falling edge c q and therefore r q. consequently r p the refinement of p isq.
the size of the until refinement r ui is at most 3n for a partition p ji i because each interval ji ican introduce two fresh endpoints.
example below exhibits the worst case.
as a result the size of the refinement r p is at most o k t 2d where t is the number of uiandd is the nesting depth of ui given kthe size of a base partition for propositions.
example .
consider u .
.
andp ji i .
let j2k k j2k k k and for k n j2k j2k j2k 1 and j2k .
each time point k k n is then a variable point and 2k 2k up.
therefore cu p sn k k .
k .
where all endpoints of pcontributes to the size of cu p. because cu p e p e ru 3n.
the work gave an example of an stl formula where a signal has o 2d variable points for the set of subformulas sub .
the worst case exponential size of r p is not avoidable.
the refinement construction in also has the same upper bound o k t 2d .
but our refinement minimizes redundant variable points to reduce the partition size as mentioned in sec.
iii c whereas the existing methods do not apply such a reduction.
v. e ncoding of bounded satisfiability for stl the bounded stl satisfiability problem is to check whether there exists a bounded signal that satisfies and has a finite number of variable points.
this section presents a symbolic method to encode the bounded satisfaction of stl in a decidable fragment of first order logic using theorem .
we symbolically represent discrete signals using logical variables sec.
v a and identify constraints on those variables imposed by the stl semantics for a discrete signal sec.
v b and by the full stability of a partition sec.
v c .
a. symbolic representation with full stability for an stl formula we consider the problem of finding a discrete signal p with at least one matching signal see sec.
iii b .
we symbolically encode this problem as a first order formula so that there exists such a discrete signal iff the encoding is satisfiable.
discrete signals are symbolically represented using first order variables as follows.
definition .
for an stl formula andn n a symbolic discrete signal is n j j i i sub where each jis a real variable and i is a boolean variable.
intuitively ninvolves a symbolic partition ji i such that j2j j andj2j j j for each j where 0 and n .
the variables for the left and right endpoints of jiare denoted by l ji andr ji respectively.
each boolean variable i represents the truth value of subformula in symbolic interval ji.

a symbolic discrete signal 4for j puiq an assignment of the variables in a symbolic discrete signal ngives a concrete discrete signal n p called an instance of n where p ji i is a concrete partition and is a concrete truth mapping with i i for each sub andi .
example .
figure illustrates a symbolic discrete signal for j puiq andn .
the truth of each subformula in the i th symbolic interval ji i is represented as boolean variable i .
for an assignment with 17 and 27 j3 and j4 .
b. encoding of discrete signals for stl in stl the truth of a non atomic formula is determined by the truth values of s subformulas.
for a symbolic discrete signal n variable i for and variables for its subformulas must satisfy certain constraints imposed by the semantics of stl.
we can easily see the constraints i i for negation and i i i for conjunction.
to identify constraints for ui we need to obtain an equivalent formula where the satisfaction of each subformula depends only on a single interval in a partition p. for this purpose we consider a global time temporal operator uk i with an extra global time interval k. the satisfaction of uk i is bounded by the global interval kas follows.
definition .
for a signal and a time point t the satisfaction of uk i is defined by t uk i t t t k t t i t t k t using global time constraints we can apply the syntactic separation method to syntactically decompose a formula uk i into a boolean combination of the subformulas and that depend only on disjoint segments of the global interval kas follows.
we can repeatedly apply this procedure to obtain a formula separated at multiple time points.
proposition .
for two successive intervals k1andk2 uk1 k i uk1 i k1 uk2 i where k1 k2is an interval k1 k2 and sup k1 inf k .
now consider a partition p ji i of domain where and are stable for a signal inp.
let vi ji for each i be a time sample from the i th interval ji andln s n j njn for each n be the n th suffix interval.
we then have the following separation law.lemma .
for any indices i n with1 i n n vi uln i iff v i jn iand vn or v n and vi uln i .
proof sketch.
by proposition uln i is equivalent to ujn i jn uln i .
by lemma and the stability of jn vi ujn i iffvi jn iand vn and vi jn iff vn .
the truth values of and at a time sample vi ji represent the truth values of and in the entire interval ji provided and are stable for a signal inji.
since sup li vi ui iff vi uli i .
by repeatedly applying the above separation law the satisfaction of uli i atvi jican be expressed using the satisfaction of and at time samples vi vi .
.
.
v n. this allows us to define the constraints between a variable i ui and variables n and n i n n. let a termuirepresent a time sample from symbolic interval ji.
a constraint i ui n which corresponds to the satisfaction of uln i at time sample ui is then inductively defined as follows.
as explained above i ui i corresponds to the satisfaction of ui at time sample ui.
definition .
for1 i n n ui l ji r ji i ui n and i ui n is the first order formula ui jn i n n n i ui n .
the resulting constraint for a symbolic discrete signal n is a quantifier free first order formula stl below.
we denote by stl for an assignment the formula obtained by replacing each variable xby x .
definition .
for n j j i i sub stl is the conjunction of the following equalities i i i i i i ui i ui i example .
consider 3with j4 1 2 j5 2 andj6 2 .
then 4 puiq 4 puiq 4 puiq and 4 puiq n for n is the quantifier free formula 1 2 jn i n p n q n p 4 puiq n .
consider an assignment for a symbolic discrete signal n. suppose that the stl formula is fully stable for a signal in the corresponding partition ji i where the signal matches the assignment for each proposition p prop i.e.
p t i p for any t ji in each interval ji .
then stl exactly captures the constraints by the semantics of stl as follows.
lemma .
suppose that is fully stable for a signal in ji i and t ji p t i p for each p prop .
the following are equivalent i stl is true.
ii i iff ji for each sub .
proof sketch.
the proof is by structural induction on .

c. encoding of fully stable partitions figure shows several auxiliary predicates to encode the building blocks of the until refinement condition in def.
.
the predicates un m m and m represent n m up m p and m p respectively cf.
lemma and def.
.
the predicate endpv n mrepresents that vis an endpoint of one of ji n i m and cand ui represents that all candidates in cu pare endpoints in ji i .
the refinement condition in def.
can then be encoded as a quantifier free formula using those auxiliary predicates definition .
for an stl formula and a symbolic discrete signal n par is the conjunction of the conditions cand ui for each subformula ui sub .
example .
consider pu q i p i q i puiq i forpu q. then cand pu qis the first order formula p q cd1 p q p q cd1 p q p q cd2 p q p q cd2 p q because 0 1 j1 and j2 .
we show below the encodings for some auxiliary predicates cd1 p q u1 p q endp cd2 p q v2 n un p q l jn endp n cd2 p q u1 p q endp u2 p q endp endp endp endp endp p 1 p p 1 p 2 pu1 p q 1 p u2 p q p 2 p 1 p p 2 p u2 p q 2 p 2 q consider an assignment for a symbolic discrete signal n. par asserts that p ji i includes all variable point candidates for all subformulas ui .
therefore the refinement of pispitself and theorem implies that is fully stable for a signal inp provided the signal matches for each proposition in .
lemma .
suppose t ji p t i p for each p prop .
the following are equivalent i r p pforp ji i and i iff ji for each sub .
ii par stl is true.
proof sketch.
par enforces r p pfor each subformula sub where p ji i .
the lemma then easily follows by structural induction on from the correctness of par lemma and theorem .
the remaining question is how to encode the existence of matching signals.
for bounded satisfiability we only need to consider piecewise constant signals which can be represented as a sequence of variables 1 2 .
.
.
2n.
let sig 1 .
.
.
2n v p prop v2n i i p p i 1 n where i p p i asserts that pholds in the i th interval.
the bounded satisfiability of can be reduced to the satisfiability of a first order encoding as follows.
theorem .
an stl formula is satisfiable by a bounded signal with a finite set of variable points iff for some number n n 1 par stl sig is satisfiable.
proof.
suppose for a signal with a finite settof variable points for sub .
for the partition pwith e p t consider the refinement r p where r p 2n.
let vibe an element of each i th interval of r p and be an assignment with ji i r p i vi and i iff vi for i and sub .
by lemma satisfies the encoding.
suppose the encoding is satisfiable by an assignment .
let be a piecewise constant signal with t ji .
t i .
then for each p prop t ji i p p t .
it follows from lemma that 1 iff .
vi.
smt b ased model checking algorithm we now consider the bounded model checking problem of an stl formula for a hybrid automaton h stated in def.
.
this problem is equivalent to finding a bounded trajectory of hthat satisfies the negated formula .
thanks to lemma the only remaining challenge is to encode the existence of matching bounded trajectories of h. a. encoding of matching bounded trajectories we follow an smt based approach for the reachability of hybrid automata to encode boundary trajectories of h. the reachability of hcan be reduced to the satisfiability of an smt formula provided init inv flow and jump conditions can be encoded in smt .
finding a bounded trajectory ofhwith at most kvariable points for prop can be considered as a special case of reachability .
figure shows the first order encoding h trj for a matching trajectory h. an initial state s0 0satisfies the init condition and there are n 1time points j j n at which discrete jumps canoccur from state st j 1tos0 j. the value of evolves from state s0 jtost jaccording to the flow condition satisfying inv indicated by cnt s0 j st j .

the equality st j s0 jallows the truth of a proposition to change without jumps.
by construction lemma .
h trj is satisfiable by an assignment iff there exists a trajectory h with at most n 1jumps where t ji p t i p for each p prop .
finally in a similar way to the case of bounded satisfiability theorem the bounded model checking problem of an stl formula for a hybrid automaton hcan be reduced to the satisfiability of a first order encoding as follows.
theorem .
h 0 n holds iff for some number n n 1 par stl h trj is satisfiable.
b. algorithm our model checking algorithm is shown in alg.
.
parand stlare in linear arithmetic.
for polynomial flow conditions h trjis in nonlinear real arithmetic supported by smt solvers .
for flow conditions with transcendental functions the satisfiability of h trjcan be undecidable but there are approximate solvers .
our algorithm is refutationally complete for bounded trajectories with finite variable points assuming an oracle for the satisfiability of the encoding.
algorithm bounded stl model checking input hybrid automaton h formula bounds andn 1forn tondo h trj encoding of h s trajectories foreach sub do stl add conditions for i i def.

the size of h trjiso n h .
the size of stliso n2 as there is a condition for each subformula and each i th step i where the size of the condition for ui iso i .
for par all predicates in fig.
can be encoded as formulas of size o n2 using a typical encoding method to introduce extra boolean variables for predicate instances .
as mentioned in sec.
iii c a bound parameter kof the previous algorithm denotes the number of variable pointsforprop and the size of the encoding is o k t 2d with t the number of uiandd the nesting depth of ui.
because the size of a refinement is o k t 2d in principle our algorithm needs a larger bound than the previous algorithm.
however in practice the size of a refinement can be much smaller than in the worst case see sec.
vii .
c. handling universal quantification the encoding h trjincludes universal quantification over time e.g.
cnt s0 j st j andmatchi p as in typical smt based methods for the reachability of hybrid automata .
several smt solvers including z3 and yices2 provide limited support for these formulas but require high computational complexity.
our algorithm can be combined with two methods to remove universal quantification.
quantifier free encoding for polynomial hybrid automata such conditions can be encoded as quantifier free formulas.
when a polynomial fis monotonic on an interval and a predicate pis convex t .
p f t can be reduced to p f a p f b .
since the monotonicity of fcan be expressed as a convex invariant of the derivative f we can obtain a quantifier free formula by applying this repeatedly.
invariant simplification for invariant stl properties of the form p iq the model checking problem is equivalent to the reachability.
finding a counterexample of p iqcan be reduced to checking whether there exists a state satisfying qthat is reachable within the time interval ifrom an initial state satisfying p. therefore universal quantifiers in matchi p can be safely replaced by existential quantifiers.
vii.
e xperimental evaluation we have implemented our algorithm of alg.
along with simplification methods in sec.
vi c using yices2 as the underlying smt solver.
this section experimentally evaluates our technique by addressing the following research questions rq1 how effective is our algorithm compared to the previous algorithm for bounded stl model checking?
rq2 how effective is our encoding compared to the previous encoding for bounded stl satisfiability checking?
rq3 how effective is our approach compared to reachability analysis techniques for invariant stl properties?
we have run all experiments on intel xeon .8ghz with gb memory.
more details on the benchmark models and experiments can be found in the supplementary material .
a. rq1 stl model checking of hybrid automata we consider the following hybrid automata models adapted from autonomous cars car thermostat the and water tank wat systems load management of batteries bat and railroad gate controllers rai .
we use two variants of continuous dynamics linear dynamics and polynomial dynamics of degree .
for each model we use four stl formulas d holds and d has a counterexample ford and b 1contains one temporal operator and b contains two nested temporal operators for b .

.
bounded satisfiability of stl new filled boxes empty boxes we have performed bounded model checking of these stl properties up to bound n for linear models and n for polynomial models.
we assign different time bounds to different models since depends on different model parameters.
we measure the size of the smt encoding the size of the symbolic discrete signal and the cumulative execution times to run stl model checking including smt solving by the underlying solver.
we set a timeout of 120minutes.
the experimental results are summarized in table i. enc denotes encoding sizes in thousands given by the number of connectives in the encoding.
denotes the size of symbolic discrete signal given by the number of real variables.
for the cases with counterexamples the table also shows the smallest bound n nfor which a counterexample is found.
as discussed in sec.
vi b bounds have different meanings in our algorithm and the previous algorithm .
for our algorithm a bound corresponds to the size of a fully stable refinement and therefore is the same as the bound.
for a bound denotes the number of variable points for the set of propositions and thus is usually larger than the bound.
this can result in huge differences in the encoding size.
as shown in table i our algorithm significantly outperforms the previous algorithm in most cases.
in particular our algorithm shows much better performance for complex stl formulas with nested temporal operators 2 and 2 .
the performance improvement is due to the much compact size of the encoding by our method.
e.g.
for 2 and linear cases our algorithm produces times smaller encodings.since different notions of bound nare used the previous algorithm often found counterexamples of 1 and 2 at a smaller bound.
thanks to our partition construction method the differences are often very minor or1 .
the only exceptional case is bat with linear dynamics for 2 a counterexample was found at k 4by the previous algorithm but at k 8by our algorithm.
even in this case our algorithm performed much better than the previous one.
b. rq2 bounded stl satisfiability checking to evaluate the effectiveness of our encoding for parand stl we have performed bounded stl satisfiability checking using theorem .
we randomly generate stl formulas of different sizes and complexity specifically there are 50formulas for each nesting depth d .
we measure the execution time and the size of generated smt formulas up to bound n with a timeout of 30minutes.
figure summarizes the experimental results in box plots.
the x axis shows nesting depth d and the y axis shows encoding sizes and execution times seconds accordingly in a log scale.
filled boxes indicated our encoding method and empty boxes indicates the previous method .
outliers are plotted as individual points in the box plots.
as seen our method produced much smaller encodings that can be solved in a much shorter time.
this improvement tends to be more apparent for more complex formulas for example ford the previous method mostly timed out whereas our method only needed less than 3seconds on average.

c. rq3 comparison with reachability analysis methods we compare our approach with three reachability analysis tools for hybrid automata hycomp hc spaceex se and flow fs .
we consider two versions of our algorithm one with invariant simplification onew in sec.
vi c and one without invariant simplification new .
for each model we consider two invariant properties that can be handled by those tools i holds and i does not hold.
we measure the execution times for analyzing the invariant properties with a timeout of 15minutes.
since each tool has a different notion of bounds we use the number of jumps nand the maximum time horizon as the common bound parameters which are encoded in the models .
for spaceex we use pha ver for linear models and stc for polynomial models.
for flow we use adaptive steps and tm orders for linear and for polynomial .
we use bmc for hycomp.
the experimental results are summarized in table ii with execution times in seconds.
the results for polynomial models do not include hycomp which does not support nonlinear polynomial dynamics.
for i the table shows the time taken to prove the absence of counterexamples.
for i the table shows the time taken to find a counterexample.
we observe that our algorithm with invariant simplification onew has comparable performance to the other tools for both invariant properties i andi .
the implementation without invariant simplification new often shows slower performance especially for i .
this problem is caused by stability conditions matchi pin h trj which can be avoided in onew when analyzing simple invariant properties.
d. threats to validity two major threats to internal validity are whether the performance improvements are due to the proposed partition construction and encoding methods and whether different notions of bounds have unintended effects on the evaluation of the performance.
to address these threats we applied exactly the same simplification methods in sec.
vi c for the experiments in sec.
vii a and sec.
vii b and evaluated the performance based on the smallest bound for which a counterexample is found for the experiment in sec.
vii a.one threat to external validity is the possible bias of the benchmark models and formulas used in the experiments.
we tried to reduce this threat by using various linear polynomial hybrid automata models and using a variety of stl properties with different sizes complexity truth values etc.
another threat is that our algorithm is compared only to the most related previous work for general stl formulas comparing with the other stl model checking algorithm is difficult because there is no implementation available.
viii.
r elated work the most closely related work is the paper which proposes the refutationally complete bounded stl model checking algorithm.
as discussed in sec.
iii c the algorithm does not take into account reducing the size of discrete signals and thus often produces a very complex encoding.
in contrast our method uses a precise condition for discretizing signals and produces a much simpler encoding.
another stl model checking method uses reachable set computation instead of smt solving.
unlike our method the algorithm is incomplete since only finite concrete sampled time points are considered and thus the correctness cannot be guaranteed.
in contrast our method symbolically encodes discrete signals without any loss of information.
there are a couple of methods for verifying ltl properties of hybrid systems using signal discretization proposes a deductive system for ltl and presents a requirement validation method for an extension of ltl.
only untimed temporal operators are considered in .
we address the challenge of optimally discretizing signals involving ui.
a discretization of signals with uihas been studied for mitl in the context of real time systems.
a refinement for ui can be built using multiples of i s endpoints .
a signal is further discretized using a unit duration based on a relative interval width .
these methods produce very fine refinements which are not scalable for hybrid systems.
our work is related to reachability analysis techniques for hybrid automata.
they can guarantee the correctness but only deal with invariant properties.
there are roughly two kinds of methods reachable set computation and smt based techniques .
ix.
c oncluding remarks we have presented a new smt based model checking algorithm for stl properties of hybrid systems.
our algorithm is based on a new theoretical result to build small but complete discretized signals for the bounded satisfiability of stl.
we have developed a modular translation method to encode the bounded satisfiability of stl in smt.
we have leveraged our translation technique to obtain an efficient smt based stl model checking algorithm that is still refutationally complete for bounded signals but that produces much simpler encodings and results in much better performance.
currently our method can only be applied to smt based approaches.
we should therefore investigate refutationally complete stl model checking algorithms that can be integrated with reachable set computation methods.
