in the linguistics literature and in reference to natural language these ideas have similar but not exact parallels.
for example embedded switching has parallels to intra sentential code switching a rapid switchbetweennaturallanguagesinconversation.filelevelswitchingmightbeconsideredaparallelto inter sententialcodeswitching whichistheprocessofswitchinglanguagesbetween utterances.

given that program comprehension and natural language comprehension may use the same areas of the brain thatthecostofhiringsoftwaredevelopersis per year and given polyglot programming is so commonplace itisimportantto betterunderstandthis practice.
in thispaper wepresent a double blindrandomized controlled trialfocusing onone aspectof polyglot programming i.e.

tomodeldifferent waysinwhichlanguage switching in an embedded context could occur three different versionsofqueryingapiswerecreatedandthesewereevaluatedwith freshman sophomores juniors and seniors at the university of nevada lasvegas inadditiontoprofessionalprogrammers.the results showed that the style of polyglot significantly impacts peopleofdifferentexperiencesindifferentwaysandthatthestyleof polyglot isalsoimpactedbyexperience.
specifically those that already knew both sql and java were abletouseapolyglotapproacheffectively butthatthiswasclearly a skill learned through experience.
interestingly we also found that by altering an embedded language to be closer to the host ourhybridcondition even thoseasinexperiencedasfreshmenin collegeweremuchmorelikelytobeabletocompletetasks.this impliesthatpolyglotprogrammingisacomplicatedtopicthatneeds more study and that semantic mismatch in polyglot may impact users.
we report this paper under an adapted consort format used for reporting randomized controlled trials which defines the structure of this paper.
as such our section headers match this externallyvettedapproachtoreportingonourmethodology.the purpose is to engage the community in standardizing or making a minimumbarforreportinginexperimentstherebymakingiteasier to replicate andcompare experiments.
related work the benefits and drawbacks of polyglot programming on a humanfactorslevelareunder exploredinthescientificliterature.themain argument in favor of polyglot programming is about choosing the right tool for the job a view that seems to drive the field ofdomainspecificlanguageresearchinregardtoproductivityor maintenance .claimshavebeenmadethattheuseofamore appropriate language for a task leads to better productivity and easier maintenanceby reducing the lines of code of a project .
in contrast learning more languages may create a strain on the developers or reduce the pool of developers able to maintain a project .
in other work researchers talk about several problems in multi language programming and guidelines for future research efforts .
this latter view that additional languages causes strain was recently explored by shrestha et al.
as part of a study examining professionaldevelopersandtheirquestionsonstackoverflow inaddition to interviews .
findings from that study showed that the mismatch between programming languages may be a barrier even for professionals and that this difference varies across language pairs e.g.
java to kotlin vs. other pairs .
we use a very different methodologyhere arandomizedcontrolledtrialonalargervariety ofexperiencelevelsasopposedtoamixed methodstudyononlyprofessionals but our results are complementary.
notably data gatheredinourstudyheresuggeststhatthesechallengesareimpactedbyexperiencelevelandthedetailsoftheparticularpolyglot approach.
programmer productivity is studied in a variety of aspects of programming.

to keep the tasks simple for participants this study focusesontheimplementationofrelativelystraightforwardqueries.
the null hypotheses are as follows h01 thereisnorelationshipbetweenpolyglotstyleandproductivity.
h02 programmersdonotnoticethattheyswitchbetweencomputer languages.
h03 there is no difference between the productivity of native and non nativeenglishspeakersin regard to productivity.
thealternativehypothesescanbederivedfromthenull hypotheses.
the first hypothesis is asking whether there is a cost to switching between two computer languages.
in this experiment it waschosentotestthiscostbycheckingfortimedifferencesbetween groups.answerstothishypothesismightgivemoreinsightintothe connectionbetweenhowhumansunderstandnaturallanguagetext and code assuggested in existingresearch by showing a similar switching cost as found when switching between natural languages .notethatproductivityismeasuredintermsof time taken to complete the task.
thesecondhypothesiswasanalyzedqualitativelybasedonan exit survey in the experiment.
the exit survey contains a question asking whether participants noticed that they switched between languages and whether they felt that this switching impacted their progress.forexample whilepreviousworklookedatprofessionals fortheyoungerendofourexperiencespectrum wewantedtoknow 411a randomizedcontrolledtrial onthe effects of embeddedcomputer languageswitching esec fse november8 13 virtualevent usa whether students even realized they were polyglot programming and if so whether their perceptions of their performance matchedwithour observations.
the aim of hypothesis three was to investigate the impact of natural languages on programming productivity.
we recorded participants primary language to be able to compare the performance ofprimaryenglishspeakersandotherparticipants.thisisagain motivated by wanting to test the intersection of natural languages andcoding .
.
design process we pilot tested our experiment in several ways.
first our research lab loosely follows a doubling rule when creating experiments.
this approach which is useful when an effect size is not known and thus a power test cannot be determined to estimate effect size in advance is to take small scale pilots and then approximately double the sample size on each iteration of the pilot while making evidence based adjustments to the methodology.
in this case we ran five preliminary pilot studies each evaluating a larger number of participants.
the results of each pilot study were analyzed to detect problems with the methodology.
specific focus of these iterations lay on general task design and on the design of the api.
the firstthree iterations had only the string basedandthe objectoriented group.
after these initial iterations were completed a hybrid between the groups was created for pilots and .
this extensive piloting process with iteration at each step provided us an evidence based way for us to critique our experiment over time getfeedbackfromourresearchteamandotherstakeholders and improve our reporting before submitting and reporting our results for publication.
during the experiment iterations we also received feedback on the tasks used in the experiment to make sure they were valid andrealistic tasksone mightfind insoftware projects.

we also recruited professional programmers on twitter and reddit.
a factor used to distinguish participants was level of education measure for programming experience for universitystudents and significantdifferencesbetween levels have been found in respect to time to solution .

when the survey was completed participantsweretheninformedaboutthedetailsofthestudyby being shownthe experimental protocol.
whentheparticipants weredonereadingthe protocol they had minutes to read a code sample and move on to a coding task.
participants were able to refer back to the code sampleduring the coding phase of the task.
the coding screen was a text box loaded with code to give the participant some scaffolding for the solution andatestingframeworkforevaluatingtheiranswer.thecoding screen also showed a timer with the remaining task time on it 412esec fse november8 13 virtualevent usa p. merlin uesbeck coles.peterson bonita sharif andandreas stefik as all tasks were limited to minutes per task.

when the participants felt that they had solved the task sufficiently theycouldclickthe checktask button.then thecode they had written was sent to a server.

all error checking forthisapproachisdonebythedatabaseandtheprogrammermust relyonthefeedbackofthedatabase serrorreporting fordetails on sql errors see .
further the sql dialect in use on the side of the server must be considered and matched completely.
this approach also enables the use of modularization in which the sqlqueriesarestoredinexternalfilesinsteadofwithinthecompiled sourcecode whichallowsreuse withoutrecompilation.

this approach avoids the useofobjectstobuildafilterstatementandsqlsyntax.thiscustom syntax is thus somewhere in between a switch from sql to java because the syntax is closer to the host language.
we can imagine manydifferentkindsofhybridconditionsbeinginterestingtostudy empirically but derived ours by looking at pilot data and trying to keep the language as close to the host as we could while also removingthe objectmapping requiredinthe monoglot condition.

alternatively if the participant did not finish the task the time stamp of the moment the time ran out was taken as the endpoint of the measurement.
the difference between the two time stamps was then used as the time to correct solution measure.

finally a question about switching computer languages was added to the end of the experiment to help gain insight about if participantsrealizedthattheywereworkingintwodifferentlanguages.
the exact wording of the question was did you feel like you had to switch betweenlanguages during the experiment and how do you think did this affectyour progress while solvingthe tasks?

limitations whilemuchcarewastakenincreatingthestudyinawaytoadhere to high standardsof reporting this experiment has limitations.
first the design of generalizable tasks is always a significant challengein anyexperiment.
the typical trade off isthat easy tocompleteandshorttasksaretractableinastudy whereasreal world or some definition of the term tasks might be longer harder or haveotherproperties.in ourcase wethreadedtheneedlebyfirst choosing tasks that were clearly relevant in the real world e.g.
inserting deletingrows joins whilepilottestingtoensureparticipantscouldactuallycompletetheminareasonabletimeframe.this natural limitation is one reason why it is important to cross tab acrossexperimentalmethodologiesinmultiplestudies.forexample in reviewing the work of shrestha et al.
our observations largely match despite very different methodologies.
despite this nomatterwhattasksweultimatelychoose variationsinthedesign ofthetaskscanchangetheresultsand assuch itisimportantthat our broader community replicate such findings in new and unique ways to know when they apply and when they do not.
finally our tasks used apis created in a specific way which may not apply everywhere.
for example in our tasks we pass code to the api via strings buttheimpactofalternativestrategiesshouldbeevaluated andcompared.
second the use of an automatic web platform to conduct the experiment simplified recruiting and removed certain kinds of experimentalbias e.g.
automaticgroupassignment .however while our system took extensive logs online users may not be in full compliance with the rules and have no direct oversight.
participants environment is therefore only controlled by the participants themselves making distractions and cheating possible.
this is one reason why we carefully analyzed logs after the fact and removed participantsthatclearlywerenotincompliance butitisimportant to consider that direct observation can mitigate these issues while alsoprovidingits ownprosandcons.
the experiment had a relatively small sample at each experiencelevel.despiteclearstatisticalfindings wewanttopointout that while the results show clear trends that seem worth further investigation moreworkisneededtoknowwhenandwherethese findings generalize.

relationship between language switching and productivity.
the results of the anova show that there was a significant difference between the productivity of the different groups at p .
which reflect different amount of code switching.
therefore we can reject h01 that there is no relationship between switching andproductivity.whenlookingatthedifferencesbetweengroupsin figure1and at the post hoc t test we can see that there are no significant differences between the hybrid and the string based groupswhilethereisasignificantdifferencebetweeneachofthose twogroupsandtheobject orientedgroup.boththestring based group and the hybrid group have lower average task times than the object oriented group indicating that switching to a second languagewhilesolvingprogrammingtasksmighthaveapositive impact on programming productivity.

this isinterestingbecause keepinmindthat those in our hybrid group could not have taken a course that included the programming language itwas one we generated only fortheexperiment.assuch languagedesignersthatsomelanguage designs might negatively impact younger programmers without providingreal benefitsto olderones as we foundhere.
two main explanations appear viable from these experimentalresults.forone codeswitchinginthestring basedgroupwas designed to be a more complete less frequent switch between 418esec fse november8 13 virtualevent usa p. merlin uesbeck coles.peterson bonita sharif andandreas stefik languages within the context of the experiment.
meaning that participantsswitchedfromjavatosqltowriteacompletesqlstring andthenswitchedbacktojava.codeswitchinginthehybridgroup on the other hand was a switch to a smaller section of sql like code that didn t fully require the understanding of a new language.

inexperienced programmers might be more flexible to changes between languages because they think less about the constraintsofthelanguagethey arecurrentlyusing andmightbe thinking about both languages being part of a whole than more experienceddevelopersasindicatedbysomeofthecommentsmade inthe exit survey.
the other explanation could be that more experienced programmersmightbemorefamiliarwithsqlthanthelessexperienced freshmenandsophomoresandthereforefeelmorefamiliarwiththe straight integrationof sql into a java instruction.
since freshmen and sophomores likely had no exposure to this practice and sql before confirmed by the fact that all participants that indicated experience with databases were juniors seniors and professionals they had a harder time understanding the syntax and could not adaptasquicklyasmoreexperienceddevelopers.acaveattothis explanationisthefactthatofthe109participants only14indicated theyhadanyexperiencerelatedtodatabasesandmostofthosewere professional developers making the analysis of the relationship between database experience and success in solving tasks difficult as itbecame more ofaproxyfor experienceddevelopers.

both the hybrid and the string based groups are on par regarding their average timeandacloserlookshowsthatthehybridgroupwaseasierthan thestring basedgroupforlessexperienceddeveloperswhilethe string based group was easier for more experienced developers that already had training in this approach coming in to the experiment.

withrespect to the measures used in this study we have to reject h03 but we have doubts about the validity of the measures as good representations of language skill.
participants that stated their primarylanguageis differentfromenglish solvedtasks significantly slower than participants that stated that their primary language is english.
however testing only experienced programmers there was no significant difference.
the survey did not track language history in sufficient detail and while we report this finding here for completeness we are doubtful it provides a sufficient look at hownaturallanguageimpactspolyglot.anattempttousetheproficiencyscoresgivenbytheparticipantstoanalyzethedifferencesin performance failed because the scores were inconsistent with their performance.
in fact some primary english speakers rated their ownproficiencyas8 outof10 .abetterassessmentoflanguage skill and language history of participants is necessary to make real conclusions from these data.
in the future other study techniques perhaps like the toefl test2 might give more or better insight.
