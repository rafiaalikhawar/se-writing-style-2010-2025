among others api recommendersystems have gained momentum in recent years as they becamemore successful at suggesting api calls or code snippets.
whilethese systems have proven to be effective in terms of predictionaccuracy there has been less attention for what concerns suchrecommenders resilience against adversarial attempts.
in fact by crafting the recommenders learning material e.g.

in this paper wepresent an empirical investigation of adversarial machine learn ing techniques and their possible influence on recommendersystems.

index t erms recommender systems api mining adversarial machine learning adversarial attacks i. i ntroduction in recent years several recommender systems for software engineering rsse have been conceptualized to support developers in their task and possibly reduce the increasinginformation overload originating from the availability of datafrom various sources .
arelevant example of rsse is represented by api recommendersystems which provide developers with function calls and orcode snippets being beneficial to their coding tasks .
such systems learn their recommendations of codesnippets or apis from external sources such as code bases e.g.
github or communication channels e.g.
stack overflow.since these sources are open for changes and contributionsby the crowd the recommenders learning material mightbe exposed to malicious attacks .
in other words thesesources can be exploited to fool api recommender systems.
adversarial attempts generate perturbations to deceive and disrupt systems by causing a malfunction compromising theirrecommendation capabilities.
for instance an adversarial at tack to recommender systems depending on the intent canfavor or defame an item thus creating a negative impact onthe final recommendations .
similarly by manipulatingtraining data available in oss platforms hostile users mayrender recommender systems vulnerable to harmful artifacts.if a recommender is trained to provide malicious apis orsnippets this can trigger disruptions to a software system.for example a recent work shows that there have beenattempts using toxic code to secretly force android apps toopen ports allowing for unauthorized access.
research on adversarial machine learning aml studies security issues in machine learning systemsas well as general purpose recommender systems .
so far aml has been investigated in different domains e.g.
onlinesystems image classification and addresses boththreats and countermeasures .
however to the best ofour knowledge the issue of aml in recommender systemsremains unexplored in software engineering.
in this paper we provide a first empirical investigation into the relevance and effects of aml in rsse.
first througha literature analysis on premier venues in software engi neering we show that there has been no work to study theissue of aml in rsse.
afterwards we present a qualitativeanalysis of state of the art api recommenders underliningtheir risk of being manipulated by adversarial techniques.then we perform an empirical evaluation on three apirecommenders using data seeded in real oss projects.
theresults reveal a worrisome outcome by crafting input datato feed the systems we can manipulate the recommendations successfully promoting fake toxic api calls.
last but not least we devise some possible countermeasures to cope with thistype of manipulations.
the preliminary idea of studying attacks to rsse has been outlined in our previous short paper which has beenthoroughly extended in this work under different dimensionsincluding the analysis of code snippet seeding scenario.
inparticular this paper makes the following contributions a literature review on major software engineering venues to show that the topic of aml in rsse has not beenproperly studied by existing research.

m otiv ations and background this section introduces basic definitions necessary to understand aml for api recommenders provides a motivatingexample for our work overviews the types of attacks that canaffect rsse and shows in particular how api code snippetrecommenders could be subject to aml attacks.
a. definitions in the following we introduce the concepts of apis declarations software projects libraries and usage patterns by referring to the code snippet in listing .
listing a snippet seen as harmless but actually harmful.
import java .
io .outputstream import java .
net .socket public class test public static void main string args throws exception test test new test test .debug hello public void debug string msg throws exception string s usr bin logger runtime r runtime.getruntime if system.
getproperty os.name .equals linux r .exec s msg else socket socket new socket loghost outputstream out socket .getoutputstream out .

write msg.getbytes an api is a source code unit that offers some reusable pieces of functionality which can be used according to aprecisely defined interface without the need to be aware ofits implementation details.
in this way an api works as ablack box favoring reuse and modularity .
amethod declaration comprises a name a list of parameter types a return type and a body.
a declaration may involveother method declarations as for instance the main string args declaration line that calls the method debug string msg inside its body.
asoftware project pincludes the outcome of software development activities which are performed to meet the re quirements of the wanted system.
different programming lan guages can be employed to develop the artifacts building up asoftware project.
by focusing on object oriented programminglanguages software artifacts mainly consist of classes definedin different declarations i.e.
d. the example in listing can be considered as an explanatory and straightforward projecteven though in practice software projects are much morecomplex with a significant number of declarations and apis.
alibrary is a software module project providing reusable pieces of functionality.each api consists of public methods mand fields fthat are available to client projects e.g.
see the getout putstream method of the type java.net.socket as used in listing .
an api method invocation is a call made from a declaration d d to another declaration m m. finally an api field access is an entry to a field f ffrom a declaration d d. the union of the set of api method invocations mi and the set of field accessesfa inpresults in the set of api usage pattern u mi fa.a n api usage pattern is a sequence u1 u2 ... un uk u. b. motivating example during the development process programmers may look for and embed relevant apis or code snippets useful for theirtasks .
while this is a common practice as it helps increaseproductivity it also poses security concerns.
let us consider a developer who is using a tailored tool to search for snippets relevant to her context.
such a typeof system has been chosen as it represents a typical scenarioin software development where the recommendation needs tobe learned from public repositories and the adoption of amalicious api or code snippet may put the software systemunder development at risk .
there exist quite a large numberof recommender systems that can provide apis or code snip pets.
among others xsnippet muse mapo up miner codekernel or focus to name afew are some of the most notable api recommenders.
in thisrespect we anticipate two scenarios in which the developer istrapped by hostile attempts as follows she is provided witheither i apis coming from legitimate libraries which may trigger disruptions fatal errors if being executed in certain con texts under some usage scenarios or ii intentionally harmful apis embedded in a fake library.
to illustrate the first scenario i.e.
normal apis causing fatal errors we refer to the example 1in listing .
the javawritten snippet looks harmless as first sight however oncebeing executed it has a severe consequence on the hostingclient.
to be concrete the bytecode 0x2a 0x2f ... 0x2f 0x2a line corresponds to the following string r.exe rm .
the implication of the out.write method with the string as parameter in the windows operating system is the deletionof random files.
2in this case while out.write is a native method which comes from java.io.outputstream a mainstream library it still induces a detrimental effect in thehosting platform.
the second scenario is when the developer is provided with intentionally harmful apis embedded in a fake third party library.
as an example listing depicts a third partylibrary with the filemanager class which wraps the malicious code in listing using the writelog declaration.
though the name has nothing to do with the code it makes the declarationappear more legitimate helping disguise the intent better .eventually the library is compiled and published as a jar file.
1this code originates from the following blog post 2the snippet is dangerous and thus we advise against running it.
detailed explanations can be found in the original blog post.
254listing a third party library to wrap malicious code.
package tools import java .
io .ioexception import java .
io .outputstream import java .
net .socket public class filemanager public void writelog string msg throws exception string s usr bin logger runtime r runtime.getruntime if system.
getproperty os.name .equals linux r .exec s msg else socket socket new socket loghost outputstream out socket .getoutputstream out .
write new byte 0x2a 0x2f 0x72 0x2e 0x65 0x78 0x65 0x22 0x72 0x6d 0x22 0x3b 0x2f 0x2a out .
write msg.getbytes listing is the new version of the project in listing however it is rewritten by means of the library which is embedded through the import tools.filemanager directive line .
the resulting snippet in listing is more compact and it offersthe same functionality as the project in listing however all the intent is hidden in the library.
the final usage patternconsists of only two api calls i.e.
filemanager fm new filemanager andfm.writelog .
in this way attackers render their attempt more practical by exposing the code in listing 3to the public waiting for the developer to take the bait.
listing the new snippet using the third party library.
import java .
io .outputstream import java .
net .socket import tools .filemanager public class test public static void main string args throws exception filemanager fm new filemanager fm.writelog kernel starting service such a type of attack is effective as it can be tailored for any specific purpose e.g.
creating a backdoor to render unautho rized access once being successfully invoked.
however it also requires additional effort to plant the malicious libraryin oss platforms and to trick the developer into calling it.
at the same time both scenarios may appear to be unrealistic as the possibility of encountering such snippets apisunder normal circumstances is low i.e.
the developer wouldnever come across the code when using recommender systems.however by manipulating the training data in oss platforms e.g.
github adversaries can boost up the snippets visibili ty popularity so that api recommenders will adopt and provideit to the developer.
as such the suggested snippet poses apotential danger to the software systems embedding it.
to reveal potential risks that maliciously handled training data might cause in this paper we start from the assump tion that some users have already adversarially manipulatedtraining sets.
it is out of our scope to develop mechanisms toinject malicious snippets on crowdsourced repositories e.g.
on stack overflow or make fake apis become popular e.g.
by boosting their stars forks and adding pages on q aforums.
for the sake of presentation in the rest of this paper we call an api causing negative effects or errors as a malicious api regardless of its origin i.e.
whether it comes from alegitimate or from a fake library.
c. types of attacks to recommender systems in a supervised learning task given a training dataset d with npairs of input sample and the corresponding label x y wherexis the input sample and yis the corresponding class label a classification is defined as seeking a candidate function that can predict the class label yaround the input sample x. adversarial attempts try to generate perturbed examples in theform of x p x by means of a non random perturbation which leads to an erroneous prediction e.g.
misclassification.
similarly attackers to rsse may try to craft the training data with their malicious examples which once being rec ommended can cause harm the target system.
adversarialattempts to recommender systems may belong to the followingtwo main categories in poisoning attacks adversaries manipulate a model by fabricating its input data.
meanwhile with evasion attacks hostile users dodge being detected by concealing bogus contents which thenwill be classified as legitimate by ml models.
two interventions are possible with poisoning attacks nuke attacks attempt to downgrade defame the targeted items forcing them to vanish from the recom mendation list.
in contrast push attacks promote the targeted items aiming to boost their visibility popularity.
this will increasethe possibility of being discovered and thus recommendedby search engines.
besides the aforementioned attacks there are malicious behaviors that can affect specific types of recommender systems.for instance memory based collaborative filtering techniquessuffer from average attacks in which fake users try toimpersonate real ones using ratings.
in the scope of this work we focus on push attacks as they fit well to the example insection ii b i.e.
promoting malicious apis so that they willbe recommended to developers.
we will cope with the othertypes of attacks in our future work.
d. push attacks to api and code snippet rsse as mentioned in section ii b although the code in listing is dangerous it is unlikely that developers encounter something similar under normal circumstances.
to exposethe code to recommenders attackers need to manipulate thetraining data by performing a push attack see section ii c .
in such a misdeed they forcefully favor the targeted itemsby boosting their popularity.
this increases the possibility ofbeing discovered and thus recommended by search engines.
we encounter the following challenge how should a fake api be planted so that it will be incorporated by recommen dation engines?
in fact recommender systems rely heavilyon similarity measures i.e.
they employ algorithms to search fig.
the process of manipulating github to promote malicious repositories.
for similar artifacts which are used to deduce recommendations .
this is the case not only for general purposerecommender systems but also for several rsse .
for instance library recommenderssearch for libraries from the most similar projects in thetraining data .
similarly various systems forproviding apis and code also exploit a similarity measure or a kernel to retrieve similar projects and snippets.more importantly to produce recommendations rsse needto rely on oss repositories such as github or maven whichare subject to changes from the public.
let us imagine a scenario in which one increases the popularity of malicious apis 3by planting them to oss projects as many as possible.
fig.
illustrates the processin which attackers may exploit to plant malicious data.
first well maintained repositories are forked from github e.g.
those that have good indicators in terms of stars forks orwatchers.
afterward the projects are injected with fake apis and then uploaded back to github.
malicious repositories ingithub are not scarce but dime a dozen .
to boost up the popularity of an api pattern the apis can be seeded into asignificant number of declarations for each training project.attackers may create fake accounts to star fork and watchmalicious repositories to increase their credibility visibility thus exposing them better to search engines.
iii.
s tudy design and planning the goal of this study is to investigate the relevance of aml attacks for rsse and in particular of api and code snippetrecommenders.
the quality focus is the resilience of rsse to aml attacks.
the perspective is of researchers interested to improve the rsse they develop.
the context consists of state of the art api and code snippet recommenders.
we aim to address the following research questions rq1 how well has the issue of aml in rsse been addressed by the existing literature?
we perform a literature analysis to investigate whether there is already anyeffort devoted to study and deal with threats to rsseoriginating from malicious data.
although our purpose is 3as stated in section ii b we consider an api malicious if it causes fatal errors no matter where it comes from i.e.
either a legitimate or a fake library.
4such manipulation has been recently revealed to perform a complete detailed systematic literaturereview we followed consolidated guidelines for this kindof study in software engineering .
rq2 to what extent are state of the art api and code snippet recommender systems susceptible to maliciousdata?
first we perform a qualitative analysis of the likely attack threats that could affect state of the art apiand code snippet recommenders.
then based on theiravailability we select three systems for our empiricalevaluation i.e.
up miner pam and fo cus .
these are among the state of the artapproaches for api recommendations as they emergefrom premier software engineering venues.
we conjecturethat an evaluation on these systems will help to shedlight on the resilience of the majority of existing apirecommenders.
a. addressing rq literature analysis to achieve a good trade off between the coverage of existing studies on aml in rsse and efficiency we defined the searchstrategy by answering the following four w questions w stands for which?
where?
what?
and when?
.
which?
both automatic and manual searches were performed to look for relevant papers from conferences andjournals.
where?
we conducted a literature analysis on premier venues in software engineering.
in particular there arenine conferences as follows icse esec fse ase icsme icst issta esem msr and saner.
mean while the following five journals were considered tse tosem emse jss and ist.
5the selection of conferences and journals was performed so to include main stream venues as well as specialized ones for whichrsse are relevant.
the automatic search was done on thescopus database.
6we fetched all the papers published by a given edition year of a given venue journal con ference using the advanced search and export features.
what?
for each paper collected its title and abstract were extracted using a set of predefined keywords.
to covermore possible results we used regular expressions forsearching e.g.
depending on the terms we may use casesensitive queries.
when?
since adversarial machine learning is a recent research topic we limit the search to the most five recentyears i.e.
from to .
the extraction process produced a corpus of articles.
then we performed various filtering steps to narrow downthe search and look for those that meet our requirements.in particular we are interested in studies dealing with rec ommender systems together with the relevant topics i.e.
adversarial machine learning api mining and maliciousattempts.
intermediate results e.g.
number of downloaded 5we report the full name of all the venues as well as their corresponding acronyms in an online appendix 256papers per venue number of candidate papers per venue are available in our online appendix .
b. addressing rq qualitative analysis and experiment on three rsse to address rq we looked at the same venues considered in rq1to identify over the period api recommender systems as well as rsse suggesting api code example snippets.
we then qualitatively discuss for each recommender the working mechanism and its potential risks.
then based on the tool availability as well as the characteristics of the tools we select three of them i.e.
up miner pam and focus .
to evaluate the resilience ofup miner pam and focus we use a dataset containingandroid apps source code.
we focused on android appsbecause they entail a typical scenario in which an infectioncan cause unwanted consequences such as data leaks.
we made use of a dataset which was curated through our recent work and the collection process is summarized asfollows.
first we searched for open source projects using theandroidtimemachine platform which retrieves apps and their source code from google play 7and github.
second apk files are fetched from the apkpure platform 8using a python script.
third the dex2jar tool is used to convert the apk files into the jar format.
the jar files were then fedas input for rascal to convert them into the m 3format .
we obtained a set of apps with full source code.
to simplifythe evaluation we inject apis at the metadata level i.e.
afterthe data that has been parsed to a processable format.
this isfor experimental purposes only since in reality attackers needto seed data directly to projects and upload them to githubas shown in fig.
.
however in our evaluation we refrainedfrom this to carefully follow ethical boundaries as wellas to avoid adversely impacting real world systems.
we then inserted fake apis into random projects and declarations attempting to simulate real world scenarios whereapis are dispersed across several declarations.
finally theresulting data is parsed in two formats i.e.
arff files tobe fed to up miner and pam and a special file format forproviding input to focus.
by an empirical evaluation werealized that up miner and pam suffer from scalability issues i.e.
they cannot work on large datasets.
thus for evaluatingthem we could only consider a subset consisting of apps.for focus the whole apps are used since the systemis capable of handling well a large amount of data.
there are the following parameters to consider when it comes to populating artificial projects.
is the ratio of projects injected with fake apis in percent .
is the ratio of methods in a project getting fake apis in percent .
is the number of fake apis injected to each declaration.
nis cut off value for the ranked list of recommended items returned by a recommender system.
fig.
frequency of apis in projects and declarations.
we experiment with the following sets of parameters .
the rationale behind the selection of these values is as follows.concerning though having popular apis is commonplace it is difficult to rack up projects with malicious apis thus is set a small percentage i.e.
.
in contrast within a project attackers have more freedom toembed apis to declarations therefore is varied from to .
finally as explained in section ii b the numberof fake apis should be kept low to make attacks more feasible i.e.
.
we study how the calibration of the parameters affects the final efficiency aiming to anticipate the extent towhich the attacks are successful in the field.
we inspected the dataset produced as explained above and counted unique apis in all the apps.
fig.
depicts thedistribution of apis in projects and declarations.
the x axisand the y axis specify the number of projects and the numberof declarations in which an invocation is seen respectively.the dense cluster of points on the lower left corner suggeststhat most of the apis appear in less than projects and200 declarations.
meanwhile a small fraction of them areinvoked by a large number of projects and declarations i.e.
more than and respectively.
such a distributionhas an impact on the and parameters.
the figure indicates that some apis are extremely frequent.
by looking inside the dataset we see that java lang string builder append java.l ang.string is the most popular api as it appears in .
of the projects.
other invocations specificto android apps such as android view view get right are also very common in the dataset.
the presence of very popularapis gives us some hints on how to inject malicious apishaving the same names.
we conjecture that even if we embedan artificial api on a large number of projects this can be seenas normal and thus does not arouse developers suspicion.
we conducted experiments using the ten fold crossvalidation methodology i.e.
the dataset with p projects is divided into ten equal parts and each experiment composedof ten train test tasks.
for each round of execution one part is 257used for testing while the other nine remaining parts are fed as training.
to measure the effectiveness of push attacks we employ hit ratio hr n which is defined as the ratio of projects being provided with a fake api t to the total number of testing projects p i.e.
hr n t p with n being the cut off value for the ranked list.
the metric is computedover the results of all the ten folds.
iv .
r esults this section reports the study results addressing the research questions formulated in section iii.
a. rq1 how well has the issue of aml in rsse been addressed by the existing literature?
following the process in section iii a we collected a corpus consisting of documents coming from the considered conferences and journals in the five most recent years i.e.
from to .
by inspecting the corpus we see that thenumber of papers varies among different venues ranging fromless than to around papers.
table i keywords acronym set of terms case sensitive rec recommendation recommender recommendation systems api api advadversarial aml mlmachine learning machine learning ml mal malicious we are interested in studies about recommender systems and the related topics i.e.
adversarial machine learning api mining and malicious attempts.
from the collected corpus wenarrowed down the scope by using five sets of keywords asshown in table i. for instance for the rec set there arethe following keywords recommendation recommender or recommender systems which are popular terms used torefer to a system for providing recommendations.
rec adv ml api mal rec adv ml api mal fig.
number of papers for the related topics.
fig.
depicts a matrix whose each cell reports the number of papers that contain both the keywords in the corresponding column and row.
since it is a symmetric matrix we list thenumbers on the lower left part and leave the upper rightpart blank for the sake of clarity.
our search targets paperscontaining one of the following five combinations either i rec and adv or ii adv and ml or iii adv and api or iv rec and mal or v api and mal.
we mark the associated cells using the green color and carefullyexamine these papers.
none of them matches with both setsof keywords rec and adv or rec and mal.
for thecombinations rec and ml adv and api api and mal we found six three and nine articles respectively.
by readingthe abstract we filtered out the ones being completely out ofour interest.
we ended up with only seven papers discussed as follows.
most of the resulting studies investigate api based malware detection in the context of android applications.
for instance wu et al.
proposed an approach that relies on dataflowrelated api level features to detect malicious samples.
sim ilarly r eveal droid exploits a scalable light weight classification and regression tree classifiers cart to dis cover android malware.
api features are extracted directlyfrom source code i.e.
by mining security sensitive api calls.
mkld roid is a framework for detecting malware and malicious code localization and it integrates different semanticperspectives of apps e.g.
security sensitive apis system calls control flow structures information flows in conjunction withml classifiers.
a recent work analyzes vulnerabilitiescaused by the usage of advertising platform sdks.
moreover a static analysis tool named a dlib has been developed to analyze advertising platform sdks and detect vulnerablepatterns that can be abused by advertisements.
bao et al.
proposed a study for detecting malicious behavior of malwarethat infects benign apps by mining sandboxes.
singh et al.
proposed an approach to detection of behavior based malware.
cuckoo sandboxes are inspected toextract three different primary features.
after dedicated pre processing steps e.g.
nlp or decomposition all the resultingfeatures are integrated in the training set to develop malwareclassifiers using different machine learning algorithms e.g.
random forest decision tree or support vector machines.being conceived to automatically identify server based infor mation oversharing sifon vulnerabilities the hush tool employs a heuristic to analyze sensitive information ex cerpted from server side mobile apis.
as a preliminary study the system makes use of static program analysis to discoverpotential software vulnerabilities in the analyzed applications.
in summary by thoroughly investigating the papers that match the keywords used to filter out irrelevant studies werealize that all of them deal with malware detection in androidapps.
instead we did not find any work related to potentialthreats and implications of adversarial attacks to api rsse.
answer to rq .so far the issue of adversarial attacks to apis and code snippet recommenders has not beenadequately studied in major software engineering venues.
258table ii notable rsse for mining apis and or code snippets listed in chronological order .
system venue y ear data sourceworking mechanism potential risks avail.
up miner msr microsoftcodebase up miner works on the basis of clustering comput ing similarity at the sequence level i.e.
apis thatare usually found together using bide .
finally it clusters to group frequent sequences into patterns.
scsimilar to mapo as up miner depends on bide an attacker can inject malicious code in the trainingin projects disguised as similar to trick up miner.
inthis way it may recommend to developers harmfulsnippets.
muse icse javaprojects muse automatically retrieves relevant api usagesusing static analysis techniques.
it then ranks theresulting snippets employing code cloning detectionas the similarity measure.
sas it works by means of similarity among snippets muse can be affected by malicious code embeddedin similar projects planted in public platforms e.g.
github.
salad icse googleplay salad learns api usages directly from bytecodeextracted from android apps.
it relies on a hiddenmarkov model that predicts relevant api patternsaccording to their probabilities.
ssince the most probable usages are retrieved asrecommendations a hostile user may plant maliciousbytecode in google play to trick salad into rec ommending to developers.
deepapi esec fse github deepapi generates relevant api sequences start ing from a natural language query.
it employs anencoder decoder rnn to encode words in con text vectors.
deepapi trains a model that encodesnatural language annotations and api sequences.afterwards it uses the model to compute a list ofapi sequences.
san rnn bases also upon the notation of similarity thus a malicious user can forge api sequence andtextual annotation pairs to spoil the recommenda tions.
first she can remove or change part of thetextual annotation or even worst mix annotationsand api sequences.
second she may inject mali cious apis into sequences.
pam esec fse github pam defines a distribution over all possible apipatterns in client code based on a set of patterns.
ituses a generative model to infer the most probablepatterns.
the system generates candidates by relyingon the highest support first rule.
spam recommends api calls that commonly appearin different code snippets.
thus push and nukeattacks could modify the final ranking obtained bythe tool i.e.
operating on terms occurrences tofavor or defame a certain api pattern.
fine grape emse github relying on the history of the related files fine grape parses github projects discovers and ranks the relevant api calls according to their his tory from every api version.
smanipulations that forge history of api calls inprojects can pose a threat to the system.
anotherpitfall can be represented by the java code that thetool parses to get relevant api patterns.
focus icse github maven googleplayfocus suggests apis by encoding projects in atensor and using a collaborative filtering techniqueto deliver the list of apis.
eventually it mines apisand snippets from similar projects with a graphrepresentation.
sthe system is susceptible to poisoning attacks i.e.
an adversary can create fake similar projects con taining toxic apis and pose them as legitimate todeceiving focus into recommending these calls s nippets.
codekernel ase javaprojects a graph based representation is used to cluster sim ilar api calls.
then the system computes graphsimilarity by means of kernel functions.
code isselected according to designed ranking metrics i.e.
specificity and centrality.
ssince its kernel functions work on graph structure codekernel can be fooled by copycat java apisthat closely resemble normal ones.
attackers caninsert fake code in the graph embedding process todisguise them as similar.
ausearch saner github maven ausearch discovers api usages from github byconverting the input query into a github query andsearches for types of parameters that match with theones contained in the query.
it also relies on themaven package search api algorithm to look forsimilar packages.
sthe tool is prone to poisoning attack with projectcontaining malicious packages.
furthermore an at tacker can use jar files obtained from fake projectsto spoil the package analyzer module which workson top of the maven package search api algorithm.
b. rq2 to what extent are state of the art api and code snippet recommender systems susceptible to malicious data?
we answer rq2by discussing a qualitative analysis of existing api recommender systems and by presenting the results of the empirical evaluation which has been performedby analyzing notable rsse for mining apis and code snippets.
qualitative analysis from the premier software engineering venues considered in rq 1we selected work presenting techniques and tools recommending apis and code snip pets.
table ii lists in chronological order the set of analyzedapproaches.
for each system by studying the used approach working mechanism column we discuss its possible vulnerabilities potential risks column .
the last column namely avail.
specifies the availability of the replication package byeach tool i.e.
either available or not available .
besides what is reported in the potential risks column of table ii this section summarizes their main characteristicsto highlight the risk of being exploited.
two features thatmake a system vulnerable to malicious attempts are namely i relying on data from the open source for training e.g.
githubor android markets and ii the application of a similaritymeasure marked with s or a clustering technique marked with c to recommend apis or code as we detail below.
all the systems leverage public data sources to function.while in principle rsse can also be trained on closed source trusted repositories in all those cases a realistic broad learning makes it unavoidable to leverage large open source forges.
most of the considered rsse aretrained with repositories from github maven or themicrosoft code base including up miner deep api pam fine grape ausearch .
since these sources are freely open for changes by thecrowd they are also exposed to malicious purposes.other systems supporting android apps such as salad or focus normally obtain data from googleplay which enforces mechanisms to control submissions.nevertheless such a platform is not immune from ma nipulation as this has been previously reported .
most of the approaches are based on a similarity mea sure kernel to mine apis and or code snippets.
in thisway an adversary can insert malicious apis into sim ilar projects and pose them as legitimate to trick the 259systems into using the disguised project and eventually recommending api calls.
in particular the followingsystems work on the basis of a similarity algorithm muse fine grape focus and codekernel .
up miner is not directly based onsimilarity however it relies on the bide algorithm which works by mining from common patterns.
thus it isprone to malicious code concealed in popular sequences.
similarly the other systems that work on clusteringtechniques are also susceptible to adversarial attacks.
infact besides the bide algorithm mapo and up miner additionally employ clustering to group similarcode sequences.
in this way attackers may populate fakeprojects to favor a particular code pattern containingmalicious apis.
lastly approaches like fine grape are prone to manipulations forging an artificial historyof api calls in github projects.
altogether it is evident that all the systems in table ii are potentially exposed to push attacks.
they can be manipulatedto favor a malicious api or snippet so that it will be suggestedby the recommendation engine.
as such the systems in whichthe recommended code is embedded will suffer.
empirical evaluation to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the threats outlined in the previous quali tative analysis can actually occur we perform an empiricalevaluation on three among the systems in table ii i.e.
up miner pam and focus using the collecteddataset see section iii b .
we selected these tools due to the following reasons.
first up miner is a well established recommender system which has shown to outperform mapo one of thefirst systems for suggesting apis.
pam has been proven tobe more effective compared to mapo and up miner .meanwhile focus is the most recent approach and it obtainsthe best prediction performance if compared to both up miner and pam .
second the considered systems are also representative in terms of working mechanism see table ii .up miner works based on clustering while pam mines apipatterns that commonly appear in different snippets and finallyfocus exploits a collaborative filtering technique i.e.
alsobased on a similarity algorithm to retrieve apis from similarprojects.
in this respect we conjecture that an evaluation onthe three systems could be generalizable to the remaining onesin table ii.
third the three tools have evaluation replication package available i.e.
being specified with in the avail.
column of table ii.
such implementations enable us to runthe experiments according to our needs.
the number of ranked items nis internal i.e.
it can be customized by developers.
in contrast and are external since they can be tuned by adversaries to make their attacksmore effective.
the increase of and is related to the extent to which attackers add fake apis to more projects.
inthe evaluation we experiment with different configurations byvarying these parameters to analyze which settings bring moreperturbed outcomes.table iii hit ratio for the recommendations by up miner.

table iii shows the hit ratio hr n obtained by the recommendation results of up miner.
it is evident that thesystem is considerably affected by the crafted training data i.e.
it recommends the fake apis to several projects depend ing on the input parameters and .
even with a small ratio of infected projects e.g.
up miner recommends the artificial apis to hundreds of projects.
for instance considering the hit ratio hr is .
and it increases to0.
when n .
when the fake api is injected to more declarations increasing the hit ratio gradually improves given that we get hr .
while with hr is .
.
the same trend can be seen with other values of and .
the hit ratio is proportional to the ratio of infected projects.
in particular the attacks become mostsuccessful when and i.e.
hr .
.
given that we obtain a comparable outcome to that with .
to summarize we conclude that up miner is prone to adversarial attacks since it suggests malicious apis todevelopers.
260results for pam are reported in table iv.
similar to upminer pam is also not immune from attacks as it recommends to developers the fake apis.
however pam is less susceptibleto manipulations compared to up miner since we get lowerhit ratios.
the maximum hr n is .
obtained when and .
varying nas well as seems to have a negligible impact on the final results.
this can be explained byconsidering the underlying algorithm of pam which retrievesapis that appear more frequently.
as the two apis are plantedtogether they will be recommended commonly as a pattern.therefore adding one api does not significantly affect thefinal hit ratio.
overall the results in table iv suggest thatthe use of pam may be threatened by malicious attemptsconcealed in training data.
finally we investigate how negative the effect might be for developers using focus as their recommender given that thetraining data has been manipulated.
note that for evaluatingthe system we use the whole dataset with android apps.the maximum hit ratio is .
and obtained when .
in other words users of the system are likely to be recommended with the manipulated code.
the hit ratios forfocus recommendations are comparable to pam although i in this case the training set is larger and hence comparable values of and mean a larger effort by the attacker ii since focus provides to developers both apis and snippets the recommendation of a malicious api pattern may induce aserious consequence on the receiving client.
in summary alsofor focus the seeded data has an adverse effect i.e.
the tool is tricked into providing developers with the fake toxic apis as well as code snippets.
overall rsse could recommend malicious apis or code snippets if being trained with malicious data.
all three apirsse are affected by adversarial attacks.
understanding thetechnical motivations behind such results is not in the scope ofthis paper.
however according to the performed analysis up miner and pam provide fake apis for a considerably largenumber of projects even when only of the training ismanipulated.
though focus is less prone than up miner the consequences caused by its recommendations can bedevastating as the tool supplies also code snippets.
answer to rq .toxic training data can pose a prominent threat to the resilience of state of the art rsse includingup miner pam and focus.
c. threats to validity threats to construct validity concern the relationship between theory and observation.
in particular they are relatedto the extent to which the simulated feeding of fake apis ormalicious snippets reflects a realistic aml attack scenario.
inour paper we simply wanted to experiment with how a givenpercentage of projects with malicious snippets or apis wouldaffect the recommender s result.
evaluating the feasibility ofa real attack is beyond the scope of this paper.
threats to internal validity are the confounding factors internal to our study that might have an impact on the results.one possible threat is the choice of venues i.e.
there maybe aml related research as well as relevant rsse to study published in venues that we did not consider for instance security conferences such as the usenix security sympo sium.
9nevertheless as shown in section iii a we selected all major and topic relevant software engineering journals andconferences where rsse are more likely to be found.
to evaluate the three api recommender systems we used the original implementations of pam 10and focus11made available by their authors.
since the original replication pack age of up miner is no longer in use we exploited the remakedone by the authors of pam.
to minimize the threats that mayaffect the internal validity we adopted the same experimentalsettings used in the original papers .
also weran our experiments with different systems configurations toevaluate their impact on the effects of aml attacks.
threats to external validity are related to the generalizability of our results.
such generalizability concerns i on the one hand the recommenders on which the experimentation hasbeen carried out conclusions may or may not apply to otherrecommenders and ii on the other hand the considered dataset.
for the former in principle at least all the recom menders in table ii are likely to treat legitimate and maliciousapis and snippets similarly.
for the latter both the pushattacks and our evaluation are generalizable also to otherlanguages such as python.
v. d iscussion in the following we first discuss the feasibility of the rsse attacks.
afterward we overview possible defense mechanismsbased on existing techniques which are expected to be appli cable for protecting rsse against aml attacks.
a. feasibility of the attacks rsse rely on third party data sources i.e.
they are usually fed with data from oss repositories which are open for changes including the phony ones.
the probability that rssecome across toxic sources cannot be ruled out.
there areprecedents where thousands of repositories with malware appshave been unearthed in github and they might be onlythe tip of the iceberg.
though rsse attempt to crawl training data from repositories considered to be credible e.g.
having a significant number of stars forks or watchers unfortunately this cannothelp them completely evade toxic repositories.
these metrics however can be falsified as attackers use fake accounts to star fork and watch the malicious repositories making them ap pear more legitimate.
such a trick has been recently revealed where several fake accounts are used to reciprocally endowtheir malicious repositories.
12to our knowledge research conducted to fight this type of abuse is still in its initialphase .
thus techniques to conduct attacks are known and 261there are at least examples of fake repositories albeit being created for other purposes rather than for attacking rsse.
adversaries may also have different ways to camouflage their hostile intent.
apart from wrapping malicious code ina single api call see section ii b they might disguiseit with a typosquatting name i.e.
one that closelyresembles a popular api.
in this case developers would adoptthe disguised api snippet without the least delay once it isprovided by the recommendation engine.
finally the results obtained in rq 2suggest that even with a small amount of artificial training data hit ratios are alwayslarger than implying that clients are being provided with thefake apis.
altogether we see that api recommender systemsare likely to be exploited and in this way they inadvertentlybecome a trojan horse causing havoc to software systems.
b. on the quest for potential countermeasures while the topic of aml has been studied in different domains there is no work dealing with adversarial attacksto rsse see section iv a .
also there exist no concretecountermeasures that can be instantly applied to protect rsseagainst attacks.
in the following we discuss possible defense mechanisms from two perspectives namely i internal view i.e.
design of recommender systems and ii external view i.e.
techniques to detect and protect against hostile attempts.
concerningthe former we study counteractions proposed for genericrecommender systems in the hope of customizing them forrsse.
concerning the latter we look for feasible ways torecognize and seize malicious apis.
tominimize the effect of manipulated profiles modelbased algorithms are of great use as they can be appliedto cluster similar profiles oss projects into aggregate segments .
though these techniques cannot entirely isolate malicious projects this aims to lessen the prevalence ofprojects with abnormal behaviors i.e.
they will not be seen assimilar to any active projects i.e.
the ones under development.in this way such a method reduces the possibility that rsseselect and incorporate bogus data thereby avoiding attacks.the method can be applied to defend rsse that work basedon a similarity or collaborative filtering technique such as up miner muse focus or codekernel .nevertheless it requires the redesign of the whole systems underpinning building blocks and thus it is not easy toconduct.
adversarial attacks can be counteracted using anomaly detection techniques i.e.
recognizing malicious api patternsbefore they are recommended to developers.
for instance astatistical process control strategy has been used to iden tify suspicious items by examining two parameters namelyitems distribution density and average ratings.
by referringto rsse we can think of detecting anomalies from the dis tributions of apis in projects and declarations.
this however necessitates careful analyses to avoid false positives and falsenegatives.
as shown in section iii b the distributions of apismay span in a wide range i.e.
there are not only extremelypopular apis but also rare ones.
thus being based on a radicalpattern e.g.
a too popular or too rare one the detectionof malicious apis may not succeed in every case.
a moretailored approach is to tell malicious benign api sequencesapart by monitoring a certain set of third party libraries usingsupervised classifiers .
such an approach however has itslimitation as follows.
though it can detect malicious sequencesconsisting of apis from a specific set of libraries it may notbe applicable to patterns with a few apis coming from a lesspopular library.
profile classification can also help increase the resilience of rsse against malicious attacks .
first it is necessary tobuild a training set consisting of both authentic projects andfake projects that are generated following an attack model.attribute reduction techniques may be used to reduce thenumber of features needed to represent the dataset.
afterward supervised classifiers are trained on the resulting dataset toclassify real and fake projects aiming to detect the injectionof malicious data.
this technique works more effectively whenwe have enough training data by taking into considerationdifferent ways of populating fake projects.
in conclusion we believe that a hybrid security model consisting of countermeasures pertaining to both an internal design and external view is likely to contribute to therobustness and resilience of rsse towards adversarial attacks.while internal countermeasures allow rsse to avoid falsifiedor suspicious data sources defense mechanisms based onexternal view help rsse detect malicious intent hidden inapi patterns before recommending them to developers.
vi.
r elated work this section describes i a case of rsse robust to aml ii applications of aml in se and iii studies about aml attacks to recommender systems belonging to other domains.
pyart is a recommender system for python developers.
it mines developers context to suggest the next apisto be included.
pyart uses a lightweight analysis to derivean optimistic data flow and infer an element s type.
if thetype inference is successful all the callable methods of theinferred type are possible api candidates.
otherwise apicandidates are extracted from libraries and all the callablemethods declared in the current context.
for this reason pyart is less prone to manipulation of training data butthis comes at a price since at the same time it is unable torecommend apis from unseen libraries code.
chen et al.
explored the impact of aml on malware detection and implemented two techniques to detect and de fend against attacks.
evnattack is an evasion attack model to assess the security of classifiers and secdefender is a securelearning paradigm against evasion attacks in malware detec tion.
bielik and vechev proposed a similar approach thatuses adversarial training techniques to achieve both robust andaccurate models of code.
shriver et al.
explored the use of existing adversarial attack techniques for the falsification ofdeep neural networks dnn safety properties.
they transforma correctness problem into a set of robustness problems property reduction that employ a set of falsifiers adversarial attacks .
their work focuses on how aml can hinder a dnncorrectness and not on rsse recommendations.
there are various studies about aml for general purpose recommender systems .
anelli et al.
introduced an attempt to use a shilling attack to manipulatea collaborative filtering recommender system operated withlinked data.
however they do not propose any concretecountermeasures to fight against this type of attack.
deldjooet al.
reported a comprehensive survey on recent developments on aml for the security of recommender sys tems.
among others their work reviews various attackingand defense models for generic recommender systems.
suchtechniques could be possibly adapted to rsse that follow thesame design methodology of generic recommender systems.
cao et al.
proposed an attack agnostic detection model to support recommender systems using reinforcement learning rl .
the model is based on an attention classifier thatdistinguishes adversarial examples from legitimate ones bymeasuring the probability that input data suffer from pertur bations.
we assume that this technique can be customized toprotect rsse as it is able not only to learn from good samplesbut also to learn to avoid hostile patterns.
vii.
c onclusion and future work this paper shows that while api recommender systems become more effective at providing relevant recommendations little attention has been paid to make them robust and re silient to adversarial attempts concealed in training data.
first through literature analysis we realized that no studies havebeen conducted to investigate the abuse of deliberately forgeddata to spoil api recommenders outcomes and conceivesuitable counteractions.
an investigation into the working mechanism of existing api code snippet recommender systems reveals their vulner ability to hostile attempts.
then an empirical evaluation onthree state of the art api code snippet recommenders furtherconfirms our conjecture all of them are exposed to maliciousdata paving the way for unscrupulous exploitation.
our study suggests that while the research community either underestimates or ignores it the possibility of using falsifieddata to trick rsse is always present leaving a potential danger to software systems.
in this respect we see an urgentneed to thoroughly perceive the likely threats to conceptualizeeffective defense mechanisms thus increasing the resilienceand robustness of rsse.
we consider this as part of our futureresearch agenda.
