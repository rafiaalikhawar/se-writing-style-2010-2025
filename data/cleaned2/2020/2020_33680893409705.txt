how do these automation best practices spread?

in this paper we rely on a recent innovation in transparency on code hosting platforms like github the use of repository badges to track how automation tools spread in open source ecosystems through different social and technical mechanisms over time.
using a large longitudinal data set network science techniques and survival analysis we study which socio technical factors can best explain the observed diffusion process of a number of popular automation tools.

introduction tools from mundane ones like email to more specialized ones like build managers continuous integration services and static analyzers are so integral to software engineering that for many it is unimaginable to live and develop software without them.
this is especially the case nowadays with the growing popularity of the devops movement centered around automation of processes and practices and the myriad of tools implementing this automation.
most software tools are useful enabling improvements in developer productivity and software quality.
but not even the most handy of tools are used universally or spread equally fast among practitioners once released.
for example in the npm open source ecosystem we have observed variance even among popular quality assurance tools in how contagious the different tools are i.e.
how quickly they spread and get adopted by different projects.
prior software engineering work offers one possible explanation why some tools are less adopted simply becoming aware of tools that might be useful is a challenge .
more broadly rogers well established theory of innovation diffusion identifies five principal attributes of innovations e.g.
tools that influence their adoption their observability relative advantage compatibility complexity and trialability.
for example the theory predicts that the more observable i.e.
visible and the more trialable i.e.
available for experimentation the innovation is the more likely an individual becomes to adopt it more details in sec.

on social coding platforms like github gitlab and bitbucket observability is high.

what s the tipping point?
how many developers must be exposed to a new tool or technology and under what conditions before it catches on and is adopted en masse?
what channels or other means of signaling adoption influence tool diffusion the most?
and what explains why some people become early adopters while others adopt late or not at all?
while there is prior software engineering literature on the diffusion of software development methodologies object orientation programming languages and security tools quantitative datadriven answers to the questions above are hard to come by.
quantitatively understanding and modeling the complex mechanisms through which software tools diffuse within practitioner communities can be beneficial for example one can begin to design interventions to promote adoption of beneficial tools and practices based on empirical evidence rather than just intuition perceptions or beliefs the former don t always agree with the latter .
in this paper we present a novel methodology to begin to quantitatively answer the questions above that combines the creation of a large scale longitudinal network dataset of tool adoptions sec.
with statistical hazard modeling techniques sec.
.
our key insight that allows us to study data on adoption at scale across many tools and projects is that repository badges i.e.
those images such as and embedded into a project s readme file are readily observable and consistent across many tools thus they can be used as proxies indicating usage of the underlying software tools i.e.
continuous integration dependency management and code coverage in these specific examples.
moreover since the readme file is part of a project s version control system one can also precisely infer when a project adopted each tool.
using this methodology and grounded in sociological theory sec.
we report on a multiple case study on the diffusion of the most popular cloud based automated testing and continuous integration services code coverage reporters and dependency managers used within the npm ecosystem on github .
specifically we test hypotheses about factors theorized to impact how rapidly the software quality assurance tools spread through a heterogeneous network focusing on the tools observability relative advantage compatibility and complexity sec.
.
notably our methodology enables two refinements not typically present in prior work.
first we provide estimates of the relative strength of the effects of different social and technical network ties between projects through which developers can observe each other s practices and tools.
second we estimate the effects of these observability related factors while accounting for theorized covariates such as competition between tools and degree of context fit between tools and project environments.
at a high level our results sec.
confirm the extent to which observability plays a key role in software tool adoption as the theory predicts and reveal that both social and technical network ties between projects contribute to explaining tool adoption in additiontable overview of the software quality assurance tools in our study organized by task equivalence class see sec.

for researchers studying tool adoption we provide a robust and theoretically grounded framework to study the diffusion of other tools and practices including the dataset compiled as part of our study as a possible starting point.
for tool builders and platform designers we provide evidence based suggestions on where investments to catalyze the adoption of software engineering tools and best practices might pay off the most given similar networks.
in summary we contribute a longitudinal dataset of tool adoptions for quality assurance tools across a heterogeneous network of npm open source packages a methodology and indepth analysis using hazard modeling of the effects of multiple socio technical factors on the adoption of each tool testing hypotheses grounded in sociological theory a characterization of early tool adopters and a discussion of results with implications for researchers and tool builders.
theory and related work our work connects general social science theories of adoption of innovations to software engineering practice in transparent social coding environments like github gitlab and bitbucket where the potential to become exposed to new tools and practices is particularly high as we will argue.
in this section we review prior work and relevant theories before we derive testable hypotheses in section .
adoption of software tools.
software engineering researchers and practitioners are often frustrated by the low adoption of practices and tools such as static analysis refactoring tools program comprehension or security testing even though many of them are generally perceived to be beneficial.
researchers have found a wide range of technical and social pain points in tool adoption such as false positives in static analysis tools missing trust in correctness crypting tool messages slow response times lack of workflow integration e.g.
lack of collaboration support lack of management buy in overwhelming configuration effort e.g.
and simply a lack of knowledge about tools e.g.
.
in response most software engineering research has focused on technical solutions such as improving functionality accuracy and performance improving usability e.g.
and improving discoverability through recommendation mechanisms or process integration .
in 506heard it through the gitvine an empirical study of tool diffusion across the npm ecosystem esec fse november virtual event usa this work we explore an orthogonal question that does not focus on a tool s functionality but on how developers learn about it and adopt it that is how it diffuses in a community.
diffusion of innovations.
our main theoretical framework is rogers well established diffusion of innovations theory consisting of five main elements a the innovation itself b the adopters c the communication channel d time and e the social system.
the innovation can be any idea or practice that is novel to a group or individual.
adopters are any individuals or entities that make the decision to adopt the innovation or not.
the communication channels are the media through which innovations diffuse.
time is inherently necessary for innovations to spread not all individuals will adopt the innovation at the same rate.
the social system can be considered as a combination of contextual cultural and environment influences e.g.
external influences such as mass media and internal influences such as opinion leaders.
the theory also describes five attributes of innovations that influence their adoption observability relative advantage compatibility congruence with the individual s context complexity and trialability availability for experimentation .
in short the more observable advantageous compatible and trialable and the less complex an innovation is the more likely it is to get adopted.
roger s theory has been applied to a diversity of innovations across a variety of domains e.g.
new types of corn by iowa farmers family planning practices mathematics in schools new medical technology and language .
diffusion of software innovations.
rogers theory has also been used in the software engineering and programming languages communities to inspire or inform the design of adoption studies of software development methodologies object orientation programming languages and security tools .
while most software engineering research on tool adoption has focused on technical and social issues as discussed above most factors identified by prior studies to influence the adoption of software related innovations can generally be traced back to the elements of rogers theory.
let us highlight three examples closest to our work xiao et al.
studied how security tools the innovation spread within commercial software companies the social system .
based on an interview study with professional software developers the authors found that developers are more likely to adopt tools they learn about from their peers than ones they learn about elsewhere and that developers who interact with security teams as part of the auditing process are more likely to adopt security tools two findings which can be traced back to observability andtrialability .
in a follow up study witschey et al.
surveyed developers from companies and mailing lists about their use of security tools and quantified the relative importance of self reported tool adoption factors.
the authors found that the strongest predictor of security tool use in a multiple logistic regression was developers ability to observe their peers using security tools further validating empirically the importance of observability .
finally rahman et al.
surveyed software professionals about their adoption of another innovation build automation tools finding that compatibility with the practitioners existing tools and workflows is the strongest predictors of tool use among the different self reported factors.framing of our work.
we consider open source software development on social coding platforms like github as the social systems in which the innovations spread and open source projects part of thenpm ecosystem as the adopters .
the specific innovations we consider are a range of popular github integrated quality assurance tools .
by design all the innovations we consider are expected to have similar trialability they are all freely available online and tightly integrated with github .
our study investigates how the other four important attributes of innovations impact their diffusion their observability through different communication channelsongithub their relative advantage their compatibility with the adopter s context and their relative complexity compared to other practices with lower expected adoption cost.
according to rogers theory the decision to adopt an innovation proceeds in stages starting with becoming aware of the innovation building familiarity making a decision and acting on it and finally re evaluating whether to continue using the innovation or not .
our work addresses primarily the earlier stages of gathering and processing information about the innovation to form perceptions which later inform a decision to adopt or reject .
this is when theobservability of an innovation is expected to have most impact.
while the three related studies discussed above and our current work all share the same goal providing stakeholders with empirically validated evidence based recommendations to promote the adoption of beneficial software tools and practices our work is novel in several key ways.
first we adopt a network science perspective and dive deep into the different channels through which practitioners in github like transparent environments can become aware of new tools and practices quantifying the relative impact of each channel on adoption.
second we use sound hazard modeling techniques to analyze multidimensional longitudinal trace data mined from thousands of open source projects therefore our work provides robust triangulation for results from prior qualitative studies our observational study is robust to the response biases recall errors and self serving biases typical of surveys and interviews.
as a side effect our work also helps to generalize prior findings to developers outside of industry.
development of hypotheses building awareness of potentially useful tools is a known challenge for software developers .
social coding platforms like github provide opportunities for tool use to be observed among projects hosted there due to high levels of transparency .
a wealth of signals such as traces in log files status checks for commits 1and repository badges are all publicly and prominently visible in the user interface providing high levels of transparency into the tools and practices used in those projects.
there is a diversity of channels through which open source developers can be exposed to these signals.
channels through which influence can flow on platforms like github include collaboration in the same repositories pull requests and follower relationships all of which introduce links between adopters.
if heightened visibility is a crucial condition to diffusion then what drives an individual s limited attention towards new tools and technologies is a crucial factor to adoption .
the sociology 507esec fse november virtual event usa h. lamba a. trockman d. armanios c. k stner h. miller and b. vasilescu literature offers mechanisms that compete to prompt the attention needed for an innovation s adoption and describe which groups of users are more susceptible to adopt.
from the literature we select hypotheses that can be operationalized using empirical data that is available and only comment on them.
the following hypotheses in one way or another all help in understanding the mechanisms through which tools diffuse through a highly transparent and networked environment like the npm ecosystem on github early adopters as a driver of diffusion.
the early adopters of an innovation have arguably the highest impact on the eventual spread of the innovation.
according to rogers theory early adopters are more socially forward than other groups and they enjoy higher social status and influence in our context they may also be more willing to experiment with new technologies and to take risks.
due to their openness opinion leadership and high social status early adopters would be the ideal target for interventions to increase tool use.
it is they who should be targeted first by change agents since they set the adoption pace.
we hypothesize h1.the higher the social standing and technological openness of a project maintainer the more likely the project is to adopt a new tool.
network ties as a driver of diffusion.
from a network theory perspective ties between individuals in a network are what drives diffusion ties to peers can help individuals identify the most promising ideas as well as help build the necessary knowledge to execute these ideas .
while there is a debate as to whether such influence is indirect through shared common affiliations that attract individuals together e.g.
homophily or more direct learning between individuals that are idiosyncratic to the relationship and not solely based on shared affiliations e.g.
peer influence the network perspective argues that diffusion and adoption occur through interaction amongst tied individuals network ties are what influences an individual s limited attention towards which practices they should adopt or not.
to the case here network theorists could argue that the diffusion of a specific tool is based on the prior experiences that developers bring to their current software project.
if a developer on a project has worked on a prior project that adopted a tool that coder is likely to bring that practice to their current project through this social connection .
we hypothesize h2.the stronger the social connection of a project to other projects that adopted a tool the more likely the project is to adopt that tool.
resource dependencies as a driver of diffusion.
the resource dependency perspective argues that adoption of a practice is driven by power asymmetries between those who hold a critical resource and those who depend on it the former can dictate the activities and operations of their dependents and the latter must continuously gather information so as to be attuned to what that key resource holder does and maintain or adapt their operations accordingly .
this perspective argues that critical resource holders are what influences an individual s limited attention towards which practices they should adopt or not.
resource dependency theorists could argue that the diffusion of a specific tool will depend upon what critical resource holders adopt.
thus if a project has key technical connections to other projects e.g.
through library reuse it is likely to pay attention to those who manage these key dependencies and what they do to adapt accordingly if needed.
we hypothesize h3.the stronger the technical connection of a project to other projects that adopted a tool the more likely the project is to adopt that tool.
legitimacy as a driver of diffusion.
the institutional theory perspective argues that what drives diffusion of a best practice is whether it is deemed as legitimate.
legitimacy is defined as a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable proper or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms values beliefs and definitions .
from this perspective adopting a practice happens through mimicry copying what others seem to already accept as legitimate .
in this process the individual first looks to their environment for legitimate models of how they ought to understand their social world of interest and then adopt practices conforming to that model .
in our case institutionalists could argue that the more some tools become widely adopted by other projects in the social system i.e.
all of github the more legitimate one s project will be seen by other developers if it were to also adopt those tools.
we hypothesize h4.the more widely adopted tools are globally the more likely a project is to also adopt those tools.
functional need as a driver of diffusion.
while the previous hypotheses all describe plausible tool diffusion mechanisms it is important to acknowledge that software projects span a diversity of sizes application domains lifecycle stages etcand as a result their tool needs are likely to differ.
for example a continuous integration service and a code coverage reporter would be an unusual choice for projects without an automated test suite.
therefore one has to study tool adoption behavior considering the software projects underlying need for and compatibility with different tools.
in line with rogers theory we hypothesize that tool compatibility or congruence with the adopter s context is a main driver of diffusion.
stated differently if past adopters of a tool reflect some underlying need for that tool among projects of that type h5.the more functionally similar a project is to other projects that adopted a tool the more likely the project is to adopt that tool.
market forces as a driver of diffusion.
software developers nowadays often have a range of competing tools to choose from for any given task.
for example one could choose between travis circle and appveyor for their continuous integration needs on github just to name a few.
at the same time developers rarely choose more than one competing tool for a given task and rarely switch tools once they have made a choice .
institutionalists also note that getting an additional signal for the same source is seen as redundant and has diminishing returns .
we hypothesize h6.adopting a tool from an equivalence class makes it less likely to adopt a competing tool from the same class.
complexity as a hindrance of diffusion.
all the quality assurance tools we consider in this study cloud based automated testing and continuous integration services code coverage reporters and dependency managers involve some kind of underlying analyses e.g.
of builds and tests failing or of dependencies being up todate .
they have relatively higher complexity and require relatively more effort to adopt than other types of tools e.g.
communication tools like slack andgitter .
for example adopting continuous integration requires at the very least setting up a build system and 508heard it through the gitvine an empirical study of tool diffusion across the npm ecosystem esec fse november virtual event usa an automated test suite which is non trivial.
therefore we hypothesize that quality assurance tools are slower to diffuse and require more social influence to spread because of the extra effort to adopt h7.quality assurance tools require more social influence to diffuse than tools without underlying analyses.
study overview we first describe our study design at a high level before diving into the details of each step.
our key idea inspired by trockman et al .
is to estimate the adoption of the different cloud based automated testing and continuous integration services code coverage reporters and dependency managers across all npm package repositories on github over half a million at the time of data collection by tracking the spread of the corresponding repository badges e.g.
and using the badges implies using the underlying tools.
we chose github as it is currently the most popular software development platform with a broad range of tightly integrated and widely used software quality assurance tools.
we chose npm as it is currently one of the largest and most popular open source ecosystems by studying the diffusion of different tools within a fixed software ecosystem we can reduce the influence of external environmental and contextual confounding factors.
there are multiple reasons for studying badges as proxies for tool use instead of artifacts such as configuration files.
most importantly badges are easily observable signals often more readily observable and easier to interpret than changes to configuration files.
a developer interacting with a project on a platform like github would likely notice badges first before noticing tool specific configuration files.
this makes badges more relevant than configuration files for studying social influence in tool adoption.
second from a pragmatic study design perspective we use badges as a uniform proxy for tool use.
that is we can detect with high precision and given current practices often reasonably high recall when projects use certain tools.
the detection is much easier scales much better analyzing readme files rather than all files in a repository and is much more uniform across tools which may be configured in one of many different files e.g.
depending on which build tool or ci service is used and sometimes without leaving any publicly visible traces in the repository itself .
note that some developers may perceive badges as increasingly noisy 3possibly diminishing their value as signals somewhat.
our study is neutral on this issue but we do acknowledge this fundamental limitation of our design.
next to track how badges tools spread we construct a heterogeneous longitudinal network in which nodes represent npm repositories and edges represent different interconnections between repositories corresponding to our hypotheses e.g.
dependency relation joint contributors project similarity .
for each node we track when they adopt each badge for each edge we track when the edge was introduced.
we then operationalize various characteristics of projects and developers and use multivariate statistical modeling on this network to test our hypotheses.
specifically we use logistic regression 2the converse is not true one can use these tools without displaying badges.
therefore badge adoptions represent a lower bound on the adoption of the underlying tools.
3for example overview statistics for our dataset.
repositories commits developers committers pull req.
submitters watchers repositories that adopted at least one badge to model the characteristics of early badge adopters to test h1 recall this is the only developer level hypothesis in our study the others are project level .
for hypotheses h2 h6 we analyze the network s adoption history using survival analysis to model and compare which of the different diffusion mechanisms above associate with faster adoption through the network.
in this step we build separate survival models for each of the tools we consider.
finally for h7we qualitatively4compare the coefficient estimates for the social diffusion related variables in our models between the quality assurance tools and the control group tools badges.
the quality assurance tools we consider all have nontrivial underlying analyses executions and all require non trivial setup i.e.
they are at least somewhat complex to use.
per the theory this complexity should act as a hindrance to adoption.
therefore when compared to a control group of tools with relatively much simpler setup usage and no underlying analyses we expect the quality assurance tools to require more social influence to diffuse.
in our models if the distribution of estimated social influence model coefficients for the experimental group appears higher than for the control group we would consider h7supported.
data collection we start from the longitudinal dataset collected by trockman et al .
containing 92badges adopted by different packages across npm.
this dataset was collected from ghtorrent the github api and gitlogs it contains all npm packages which could be cross linked to their corresponding github repositories at the time of data collection in mid .
we then focus on a subset of tools perform several data cleaning steps and compute additional network data to test our hypotheses.
this section describes our data collection steps.
.
tool selection from the original dataset we select the badges corresponding to the most popular quality assurance tools ranging from the continuous integration tool travis as the most popular 350adopters to another continuous integration tool codeship as the least popular 430adopters see table for the complete list.
for comparison when testing h7 we also select popular badges without underlying analyses i.e.
with relatively lower adoption cost as a control group also listed in table .
note that the decision to focus on the most widely adopted tools driven by the computational requirements of our data analysis technique section may limit the generalizability of our results to relatively unpopular and newly released tools with few users.
however there is still high variance in adoption between the most popular travis and least popular codeship tools in our sample and our results are generally robust to this variance as we will show below.
4the relatively small size of our two samples experimental tools and control group tools badges precludes sound statistical comparison.

.
preprocessing data cleaning.
we take several steps to further clean the original badge adoption dataset by trockman et al .
.
first we filtered out small inactive repositories which add unnecessary effort to our network data collection effort section .
without carrying much information.
as a proxy for small and inactive we removed repositories with fewer than commits recorded in ghtorrent .
second we removed obvious bots which would introduce artificial links between repositories biasing our network measures.
based on the intuition that bots are likely to have contributed to many repositories or authored many commits we manually inspected the top 30most active github user accounts in our dataset along these two dimensions.
this way we found and subsequently removed many instances of bots e.g.
web flow renovate bot .
third we cleaned tool adoption dates in our dataset since they are important for our analyses.
by plotting and inspecting the histograms of adoption dates per badge we discovered sets of highly synchronized repositories typically all owned by the same account e.g.
the prefixes npmdoc node npmdoc npmtest node npmtest .
badges in these repositories appeared automatically introduced perhaps by a bot because they had identical timestamps.
we removed these clusters completely.
fourth when inspecting the data we also discovered a few repositories with identical name and creation date that had multiple entries in ghtorrent .
we combined all such repositories into one single instance and aggregated their metrics e.g.
we computed the union of their respective sets of commits .
finally we performed de aliasing on the developers in our sample.
multiple aliases belonging to the same individual are a wellknown type of noise when mining software repositories which can also directly impact our network measures and downstream analyses.
to merge aliases we refine an existing heuristic approach matching on name email address and other similar heuristics used in different variations in prior work .
our flavor of the algorithm see supplementary material makes two passes over the input data with separate de aliasing at projectand global level.
at project level we tune the heuristics for high recall since the risk of collisions false positive matches is smallerbecause the size of the input is smaller.
at global level we use only high precision heuristics since the risk of collisions increases.
to combine the results of the two steps we then find connected components on the graph formed out of the merges discovered earlier nodes are aliases edges are links discovered during either pass .
this way each connected component represents all of a user s aliases summarizing the distribution of the number of aliases per cluster we observe a minimum of maximum of mean of .
and median of .
we validated our approach by manually analyzing a random sample of 100alias clusters with at least two aliases.
one author checked github user and project contributor pages repository git logs and google search results discovering no obvious false positives note however that there may still be false negatives.
our final dataset a strict subset of the one by trockman et al .
in terms of projects contains 510repositories.
all the network data and other variables included in our analysis are computed after de aliasing users and where applicable they represent aggregations of data from individual aliases.
.
network construction the central part of our study is the analysis of diffusion mechanisms through a network of projects new projects becoming aware of and adopting tools already in use in other related projects.
to this end we first build graphs where nodes are repositories and edges capture different socio technical relationships between them.
then we combine all these graphs into a unified heterogeneous network.
finally to enable longitudinal analysis we update these graphs in week intervals to reflect additional relationships e.g.
a dependency is introduced or a developer joins a second project and we track based on the badges dataset above which repositories have adopted which tool by the end of that interval.
this section describes the network construction process see also figure .
note that we assume that once a link between two projects is formed e.g.
through a shared contributor that connection persists e.g.
we assume that a developer leaving a project may return in the future.
this means that we only add edges to our network over time not remove them.
other operationalizations e.g.
to decay edges over time are beyond the scope here but may increase precision.

committer graph social .
developers committing to multiple repositories can create strong social connections between the repositories through which practices can spread recall h2above .
for our committer graph gcn we add edges to represent links through developers that authored commits to both repositories either directly or through pull requests.
to accurately reflect the temporal order of commit events and to capture the direction of the possible influence flow these edges are directed from the repository to which the developer committed first.
furthermore the edge is added in the time interval in which the developer has first committed to both projects.
in figure we show an example where alice commits to r1at time t1and then to r2at time t5 resulting in an edge r1 r2 available att5and later.
we then compute and model in our regressions below the variable num activated gcn neighbors counting the number of a node s neighbors in gcnthat have already adopted a given tool by a particular time window.
watcher graph social .
another potential information flow channel is the watcher committer relationship a user subscribed to a particular repository watching in github lingo may observe that repository using a tool and may take that practice with them h2 .
we add an edge in the watcher graph gw n when a commit author in a repository has been watching another repository again directed from the watched repository to the one contributed to.
in our example carl starts watching r2at time t3 and then starts committing to r3at time t6 thus creating the edge r2 r3 starting t6.
the corresponding variable in our models computed analogously is num activated gw n neighbors .
note how the two social graphs gcnandgw n capture different ends of the social connection spectrum gcnis expected to indicate the strongest connection between repositories and gw n the weakest because of the relatively high bar to committing as opposed to watching.
table summarizes the two graphs.
dependency graph technical .
to capture library reuse as a technical channel of potential information diffusion h3 i.e.
npm packages reusing other npm packages as libraries we also extract a repository repository dependency graph gdepfrom the corresponding package.json files.
for example in figure r6is directly dependent on both r3andr4.
the corresponding variable in our models is num activated gdep neighbors .
note that to reduce the data collection effort our dependency graph is static reflecting the dependencies at the time of data collection.
by manually inspecting a small sample of projects we observed that dependency changes typically occur when new libraries get added while existing libraries rarely get removed therefore our static graph can be considered as an over approximation of the true dependencies.
.
other operationalizations next we describe how we operationalized the other concepts involved in the hypotheses in section and several control variables.we discuss operationalizations related to early adopters people first corresponding to h1 recall the difference in study design for testing this hypothesis discussed in section followed by operationalizations related to repositories corresponding to h4 h6.
early adopters.
we used the gitlogs to identify the developers project maintainers who introduced each badge in each repository recall badges are embedded into readme files which are part of the version control system .
we then collected data using ghtorrent to characterize the developers social standing and technological openness h1 .
we operationalize social standing with two variables for each developer the total number of stars on all their projects and the number of users that follow them.
we operationalize technological openness in terms of programming language diversity i.e.
the number of distinct languages as determined by github slinguist library used across all repositories contributed to by that developer.
early adopters may also be more experienced and embedded in the open source community so we include a developer s total commit count and days of membership on github as control variables.
but what constitutes an early adopter ?
the theory section predicts that adopters fall into one of five categories innovators early adopters early majority late majority and laggards.
since thediffusion effect typically results in a bell shaped curve of new adopters per unit time rogers argued that these adopter categories should be defined by the standard deviations of the normal adoption curve and that it is useful for empirical frameworks to define these so called ideal types .
therefore to categorize each developer in our sample we found the date of their first badge adoption of any kind across all repositories and labeled the first 5of developers as innovators and early adopters.
we will later compare the characteristics of this group to the group of early majority late majority and laggards the remaining .
dependency similarity.
as a proxy for functional similarity between two repositories h5 we compute the degree to which their sets of dependencies are similar .
specifically we consider each set of dependencies as a document and compute the tf idf correlation matrix similarity score of the two documents .
we then record an undirected edge between two repositories in the gdepsim graph e.g.
r2 r7in figure if each repository has three or more dependencies to avoid spurious links and if their tf idf similarity score is .9or greater we determined the threshold empirically after manually reviewing a random sample of pairs of repositories and their similarity scores.
table shows examples of pairs of repositories we discovered to be similar this way.
the corresponding variable in our models num activated gdepsim neighbors captures the number of neighboring repositories that adopted the tool in a previous time window.
description similarity.
as another proxy for functional similarity between two repositories h5 we compute the degree to which their readme files are similar.
specifically we consider each readme as a document and compute the tf idf similarity scores of the two documents.
if the score is .7or greater threshold chosen empirically as above we record an undirected edge between the two repositories in the network above e.g.

the corresponding variable in our models is num activated gdescsim neighbors .
competition.
for every node in our network we operationalize the presence of competing tools h6 as has competitor badge a binary variable capturing whether or not the repository has already adopted any competing tool from the same equivalence class as classified in table .
global tool adoption.
to measure the overall popularity of tools h4 we compute num badges adopted globally as the total number of badges that have been adopted by any repository in our dataset up until the current time window.
control variables.
in addition to the concepts directly involved in the hypotheses in section we operationalize as control variables the following constructs a repository s proclivity to adopt a badge binary variable has other badges set as true if the repository has adopted any badge before.
a repository s overall level ofproject activity numeric variable num commits since badges are added to a repository through a commit the more commits in a repository the higher the chances to adopt a badge.
a repository s popularity numeric variable num stars .
analysis a variety of computational approaches exist for analyzing diffusion processes and how innovations spread.
some models are macroscopic e.g.
sir susceptible infected recovered and sis susceptibleinfected susceptible in epidemiology and the bass model .
for example we fit a standard bass diffusion model to our longitudinal adoption data for each of the quality assurance tools in our sample.
that is we model the total number of projects having adopted a badge until time tas a function of two parameters f t e p q t q pe p q t where pis interpreted as the coefficient of innovation capturing the rate at which new adopters that have not been influenced by previous adopters adopt the innovation and qis interpreted as the imitation rate capturing the rate at which new adopters adopt the innovation after coming incontact with the previous adopters .
fitting the model reveals generally low values and little difference between the estimates of p i.e.
little innovation and generally high values with variance between the estimates of q i.e.
high imitation or contagion figure .
while such models can offer a macroscopic picture of the adoption of a tool over time they are quite limited no network no project characteristics etc.
there are also more powerful longitudinal event history analysis models that estimate the relative impact of multiple time constant and time varying factors on the likelihood of a person adopting a particular innovation at a given time .
moreover such models can also be combined with social network analysis techniques to study how innovations spread through a network e.g.
by modeling the network exposure as one of the effects.
two types of network exposure modeling approaches are common among social network analysis researchers independent cascade models assume that each node has a fixed probability of adopting a particular innovation or behavior and threshold models assume that a node in the network adopts a particular innovation only if the fraction of neighbors who have already adopted is greater than a certain threshold.
both models have generally been used in conjunction with viral marketing or influence maximization applications that is given limited budget to promote a certain product the goal is to find which people to infect first such that the overall adoption of the product in the network is maximized.
in our case the network data is continuous therefore we can model exposure continuously rather than as a threshold i.e.
for any repository node at a given point in time we can observe the number of neighboring repositories in a given graph section .
that have previously adopted the tool.
based on these measures and the operationalizations in section .
above we use survival analysis a popular multivariate event history modeling technique to estimate the average hazard rate of a repository adopting a particular tool at a given time and the relative strength of the effects of the different factors considered.
we are not aware of other software engineering research combining social network analysis with survival analysis this way however in other domains interested readers can refer to studies of the spread of obesity happiness new products memes or health related interventions through social networks for more examples of comparable computational approaches.
survival analysis specifics.
in our case an event is the adoption of a tool for which we can observe the adoption time.
however if the event has not occured for a particular repository until the end of the observation period we cannot infer anything about the chances of it occurring in the future.
survival analysis techniques are designed to handle such right censored data effectively .
to make the problem more tractable rather than updating our variables after every new event we compute feature values only in monthly week windows e.g.
the number of commits variable for a given window is the cumulative number of commits in the repository by the end of this window.
the observation period ends at the window in which the tool is adopted for adopters or at the time of the repository s last commit for repositories yet to adopt.
we model jointly the effects of the different factors above on the time to adoption of a tool by a given repository while controlling for 512heard it through the gitvine an empirical study of tool diffusion across the npm ecosystem esec fse november virtual event usa covariates.
for each repository we have a survival time ton record number of months until the binary dependent variable adoption becomes true .
the probability of reaching a given survival time tis given by the hazard rate h t p t t t t t t. we use cox proportional hazard models to estimate this probability and the coefficients of the regression h t x t exp tx using partial likelihood without making any assumptions about the baseline hazard rate .
as validation we tested our models for multicollinearity and removed predictors if they had a variance inflation factor vif above .
two variables consistently exceeded this threshold the number of other repositories in the same organization as the focal repository that have adopted the same tool before a control for organization structure we considered including was collinear with num activated gcn neighbors and the overall popularity of a given tool itself another control we considered including was collinear with num badges adopted globally .
in other cases some variables exceeded this threshold only in some models these collinear variables are the ones omitted from tables and .
early adopters.
we use the survival models described above to test hypotheses h2 h7.
for the remaining h1 characteristics of early adopters we estimate a logistic regression model with a binary dependent variable is early adopter and the variables described above in section .
as independent variables.
results overall we built survival models for each of the quality assurance tools and control group badges in table .
given limited space we only present the survival modeling summaries for six representative tools and two representative non tool badges for comparison in tables and but summarize and discuss the patterns we observe across all models.
we also report separately on the logistic regression model for early adopters.
our replication package6contains all the modeling results discussed but not included here.

while holding all the other variables fixed .7we also report in the lr chisq column the amount of variance explained by each variable as derived from an anova analysis.
one can interpret these as a measure of a variable s effect size by computing the fraction of variance explained by that variable relative to the total amount of variance explained by the model i.e.
the sum of lr chisq values.

among the control variables older users are more likely to be early adopters .
increase per month the number of commits does not have a significant effect.
h2 social network ties .for most tools both social diffusion channels the committer and watcher networks after controlling for other factors had a significant effect on whether the tool was adopted.
the more projects that a particular repository is socially connected to that have already adopted the tool the greater the probability it will also adopt the tool.
as hypothesized the committer network has the strongest effects.
in all the models in tables and the num activated gcn neighbors variable is always significant and has much larger effects than num activated gw n neighbors .
h3 technical network ties .we found that if a repository includes as a dependency any other repository that has already adopted the tool then there is a higher probability for the repository to adopt that tool as well holding other variables fixed.
for example this can be clearly seen in table for coveralls the adoption hazard increases by a factor .
for every factor eincrease in the number of direct dependencies note the log transformed num activated gdep neighbors .
h4 global tool adoption .for all tools but travis the more widely adopted other tools and badges are globally the more likely a repository is to also adopt the tool in line with the hypothesis.
the travis exception can perhaps be explained by the tool s absolutely highest popularity among all the tools we considered.
we also observe that if a repository has adopted a tool badge before then it was highly probable that the repository will go on and adopt other tools badges note the hazard ratios above for has other badges across all models.
h5 functional similarity .in our models we discover that although functional similarity as captured by similar dependencies num activated gdepsim neighbors does not have a strong effect on adoption for most tools user defined similarity as captured by similar readmes num activated gdescsim neighbors is highly significant in almost all adoption scenarios with sizable positive effects higher likelihood of adoption when similar repositories have already adopted .
the exceptions are codeship andcodeclimate which may not have sufficient data to detect these effects.
h6 competition .competition has significant effects in most applicable cases.
in our models has competitor badge is significant and typically negatively correlated with the outcome i.e.
if a repository has adopted a competing tool then the likelihood of the repository adopting the focal tool decreases significantly.
continuous integration tools are most illustrative given the strong competition among travis circle and codeship repositories are less likely to adopt any one of these tools if they have already adopted another of one of these tools.
appveyor is the exception with no significant effect.
we expect that since appveyor is a windowsspecific tool maintainers may adopt it in addition to other ci tools not in place of but there is insufficient evidence in our model to conclude either way.
the appveyor model also shows strong userdefined similarity effects num activated gdescsim neighbors further suggesting windows specificity.

additionally for coverage tools we found that there is no competition effect.
the only notable exception is codeclimate where the effect is reversed i.e.
if a repository has adopted a competing tool then it is highly likely to also adopt codeclimate .
one explanation could be that codeclimate has more features than codecov and coveralls .
in addition badges for codecov andcoveralls look the same while the badge for codeclimate is visually distinct.
h7 tools vs badges .surprisingly the two sets of hazard ratios corresponding to num activated gcn neighbors one for the quality assurance tools we consider and one for the control group tools badges appear qualitatively similar see the models for license andnpm downloads in table and the rest in the online replication package.
that is there does not appear to be much difference between the factors affecting the diffusion of quality assurance tools and those affecting the spread of non tool badges contrary to our hypothesis.
discussion and implications there is strong empirical evidence in the software engineering literature for the effectiveness of many tools and practices e.g.
continuous integration dependency management .
that is in addition to individual companies that may want to promotetheir tools it may be beneficial for an entire community or ecosystem to encourage the adoption of tools and practices to improve productivity sustainability code quality documentation quality security and many other qualities.
similarly it may be in the best practice of a company to spread tools and best practices among all its teams .
our results provide strong empirical support that social science theories of adoption of innovations including rogers with many theorized relationships also hold for software engineering tools used throughout the npm ecosystem.
concretely we find supporting evidence for multiple factors that impact adoption the increased social standing of early adopters h1 the legitimacy that comes from using popular tools h4 network ties both social and technical h2 h3 good context fit h5 and the absence of competitors h6 .
practically these results have potentially far reaching implications for open source and industrial developers as well as academic and commercial tool builders all of which could benefit from evidencebased insights into how to speed up tool adoptions.
one mechanism stands out as having particularly strong empirical evidence in our models of tool adoption across npm repositories the network ties through which projects may pick up toolingrelated cues from each other especially the social dependencies via joint contributors.
these networks taken together with visible indicators of a tool s existence in an open source project e.g.
514heard it through the gitvine an empirical study of tool diffusion across the npm ecosystem esec fse november virtual event usa badges begets exposure to these tools in the absence of competition the probability of a tool s adoption is proportional to the amount of exposure the tool has through social network ties.
this answers a question from the introduction how many developers must be exposed to a new tool or technology and under what conditions before it catches on and is adopted en masse?
there is no threshold the more developers get exposed the higher the chances of adoption.
a practical recommendation that follows is that if you want to enable more adoption one way is to make the tool in question more visible .
likewise the converse seems to be true if potentially meaningful tools and best practices aren t visible they might not be uptaken and used leading to a missed opportunity for adoption.
there are many ways to increase visibility.
for example other means for tools to be made visible beyond badges include github integrations and webhooks.
there are also other latent sources of information and social influence beyond github e.g.
social media websites like twitter other online communities the user s workplace or friends.
all of these factors can increase the visibility and exposure of developers to tools and should be considered.
another practical recommendation to increase adoption beyond making the tool more visible to any particular potential user is to expose more potential users to the tool in question.
for example to do this efficiently stakeholders looking to promote tool adoption can consider strategies not far from viral marketing campaigns in advertising.
this means targeting a select few nodes in the network focusing on them for adoption of a tool or technique first and due to natural diffusion an increased rate of adoption may follow.
another potentially actionable finding of this work is the apparent similarity in the diffusion processes between quality assurance tools and other non tool badges h7 .
that is analysis tools and ci seem to be adopted and uptaken as quickly as simple textual badges with no underlying automated validation or analysis.
while we remain cautious of replication and confirmation on more data and on data from other ecosystems the implication if the result holds we believe is quite significant for tool builders and policy makers the relatively higher complexity of the quality assurance tools and relatively higher effort to adopt which are largely intrinsic to the task and unavoidable do not appear to be what s holding back adoption instead the factors driving adoption seem much more within one s control.
therefore toolsmiths should be able to get complex tools as widely adopted as possible if promoted appropriately tool complexity does not appear to be as much of a barrier to adoption as the theory predicts .
practically the recommendation is to invest in promotion and increased visibility.
our results while a promising first step also have implications for future academic research .
in particular recalling rogers s five attributes of innovations that influence their adoption this work did not address trialability which could also meaningfully affect diffusion.
for example cloud based ci tools such as travis or circle could be considered more trialable than ci tools initially offered for standalone installation on a local server such as drone andjenkins .
in this case the increased effort required to experiment with the non cloud based ci tools could hinder their spread.
another potential future work direction is exploring the observability attribute of tools beyond badges.
more research is needed to work out which factors contribute the most to increased visibility both among the ones afforded by the platform e.g.
integrations and webhooks as well as the latent ones e.g.
social media .
all of these are worthwhile directions.
our study is limited to a single ecosystem npm which has a unique culture and community that is particularly open to innovations .
however other software ecosystems can have vastly different cultures and practices .
future studies could investigate differences in diffusion patterns in different software ecosystems in comparison to their unique cultures and communities.
moreover while we investigated whether quality assurance tools spread differently than non tool badges in reality even tools within the same task class may vary in terms of configuration overhead and features from the perspective of toolsmiths it would worth studying which usability features allow more effective diffusion.
finally while we saw differences in social standing between adopter categories e.g.
early and late adopters this was also only a beginning.
future work may design e.g.
case studies of particularly influential users who are effective in spreading new practices however influential users remain hard to define.
conclusion we performed a large scale longitudinal analysis of diffusion of quality assurance tools in the npm ecosystem.
grounded in diffusions of innovation theory our results confirm the extent to which observability plays a key role in software tool adoption as per the theory.
we also provide an in depth analysis using survival analysis based regression models on the effect of multiple social technical factors on the adoption of tools.
we found that social factors such as exposure to repositories that have already accepted a tool contribute significantly the probability of tool adoption.
we additionally provide a characterization to differentiate between early and late adopters.
there we found characteristic differences between early adopters and late adopters for example early adopters tend to have more experience with more programming languages and programming paradigms and they tend to have more stars and followers on github .
we also explored the effect of competition between tools and how that impacted diffusion.
we found in the context of ci tools that once a repository chose a ci tool it rarely adopted another one.
besides many concrete results our study provides a robust and theoretically grounded framework to study the diffusion of other software engineering tools and practices through social networks.
