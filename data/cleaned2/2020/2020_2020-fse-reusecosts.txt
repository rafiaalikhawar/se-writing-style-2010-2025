the latter scales but imposes high upfront investments for building the platform and reduces flexibility.
as such each strategy has distinctive advantages and disadvantages imposingdifferent development activitiesand software architectures.
deciding for one strategy is a core decision with long term impact on an organization s software development.

however with an increasing number of cloned variants maintenance easily becomes a challenge for instance when developersneedtopropagatechanges bugfixes orfeatures.developers easilyloosetheiroverviewunderstandingofthevariantsandare challengedbysubstantial maintenanceoverheads .
intheplatform oriented strategy developersimplementasinglecodebasefromwhichtheycanderiveindividualvariants typicallyusingmethodsandtoolsknownfromsoftwareproduct line engineering sple .
a platform employs variability mechanisms techniques to implement variation points e.g.
preprocessors components or runtime parameters typically controlled by features.
the features abstractly represent the variability and are typically organized ina feature model a treelike structure of features and their constraints.
using for instance configurator tools or dedicated build systems developers derive individual variants i.e.
reuse software by enabling or disabling 432esec fse november8 13 virtualevent usa jacob kr gerandthorstenberger features.
this strategy is usually advocated for systems with many variants including highly configurable systems such as the linux kernel which boasts over configuration options today allowing it to run on a range of hardware environments from small embedded devices to large super computer clusters.
unfortunately adopting a platform requires large initial investments into architectingandcreatingtheplatform adoptingsplemethodsandtools e.g.
variabilitymechanisms featuremodels configurators aswell as training and re organizing development teams before benefits can be achieved such as substantiallyreduced time to market through the automated derivation of new variants as well as reducedmaintenanceefforts .incaseofmigrating fromclone own anorganizationneedstore engineersoftware notintendedforreuseintoreusablefeatures impactingnotonlythe softwarearchitecture butalsothebusinessstrategy organizational structure anddevelopmentprocess .
over the last decades numerous studies focused on software reuse 19 25 33 37 81 84 many of which also describe the migration from clone own towards a software platform as the most common way to adopt platformsinpractice .suchstudiesindicatethatthemaintenance burden of clone own becomes the main problem leading organizations to adopt a platform strategy.
still to the best of our knowledge most studies discuss the advantages and disadvantages of either strategy based on personal experiences and educated guesses.
the fundamental question remains whatcosts areassociatedwitheitherreusestrategy andunderwhatcircumstancesiswhichstrategypreferable?
answeringthisquestion based on empirical data provides a means for organizations to reason more reliably on several practical decisions for instance whethertoadoptaplatformforaneworexistingsetofvariants.
ourlong termgoalistoestablishqualitativecriteria measurement techniques and decision models to support the decision making of organizationsdevelopingmanyvariantsofasoftwaresystem as well as to enhance theirconfidence intheirdecisions.
wepresentastudyoftheactivities e.g.
bugfixing costs i.e.
money or developers efforts spent cost factors i.e.
project propertiesimpactingcosts andbenefits i.e.
savings thatareassociatedwiththedevelopmentprocessofnewvariantsusingeither strategy clone own and platform oriented reuse.
specifically we conducted an interview study with practitioners from a large organization i.e.
axis that employs both strategies and a systematic literature review slr .
the slr complements our interview data with an analysis of the insights and data providedincasestudiesandexperiencereports.bytriangulating from both sources we provide consolidated quantitative data distributions e.g.
costs in per cent and qualitative arguments on developmentcosts costfactors andbenefits.wecombinedthetwo sourcestoaddresstheproblemthatcostsinsoftwareengineering arehardtoquantifyandassigntospecificactivities .
in fact few studies report quantitative data and often only on a subset ofthe relevant costs.since expertestimationsare a widely used reliable estimation method perform comparable to or better than other cost estimation methods e.g.
cost models and can be improved based on analogies to historical data our two sources provide a reasonablebasis for eliciting data.
based on that data we also discuss the evidencewefindforconfirmingorrefutingcommonhypothesesabout software reuse.our study is ofthe rare breed thataddresses this problembyprovidingevidencebasedonempiricaldatareported forover100organizations.asaconsequence ourstudyprovides novel insights on processes and costs as well as a synthesis of existingstudiestoconfirmorrefutecommonhypotheses.bothof these aspects are novel and important seeing that axis spent a significantamountoftimeandeffortsupportingourstudy.moreover other companies e.g.

that ends with the delivery of the specified variant.
a development process comprises a number of activities such as scoping the variant or bug fixing performed by the organization s developers .
each activity involves costs for which we consider monetary spendings as wellas developers effort e.g.
person hours .
finally cost factors a.k.a.
cost drivers represent any project property that impactsthe costsofimplementing the variant.thesefactors maybe relatedto forexample thereusestrategy specificactivities and developers andcanimpacteachother e.g.

this information can help to decide for a reuse strategy and to determineactivities that are more challenging to perform.
ro3analyzethecost factorsthat impact eitherreusestrategy.
finally we aimed to understand the cost factors impacting the reuse strategies which helps to identify those that are importanttoconsiderforcostestimationsandcanpotentially be altered e.g.
involvingmore developers to reduce costs.
so we analyze cost factors also based on economical benefits i.e.
reducedcosts that we identified.
next we describe how we elicited data to address these objectives.
