.partofthereasonforthishasbeenthe popularity of the devops software development movement which seeks to bring changes into production as quickly as possible withoutcompromisingsoftwarequality primarilybyautomatingthe processes of building testing and deploying software.
in practice devops is supported by a multitude of configuration management cloud based continuous integration and automated deployment tools short circuiting the need for coding from scratch .
usingpre madetoolscanshortenthedevelopmentprocess solongasanappropriatesetoftoolsisusedandproperlyintegratedintoa development pipeline.
tooladoptiondecisions however areoftennotwellinformed.

while they likelyconsiderthatscatteredknowledge teamsseemtoleverage their strengths and experiences in making tool adoption decisions.
some tool adoption events in projects are preceded by a discussion amongteammembersontheissuesinvolved butitisnotclear what is discussed in them among team members and how those discussions correlate with adoption decisions.
moreover instituting a project wide change is a complex social process when there are many stakeholders .

and in what proportion?
inspired by the availability of large comprehensive data sets on tool adoptions from diverse github projects here we undertakeboth qualitative and quantitative methods to uncover the socialdeterminants of team discussions and dynamics leading to tooladoption events in oss projects.
we operationalize our study atthe team level instead of at the individual level.

moreover surveys by their nature are based on individual experience and feedback.

background and theories herewepositionourcurrentworkinthespaceofrepresentative prior work on tools tool adoptions and oss teams as well as present two most relevant sociological theories that will guide our hypotheses and research questions.
.
tools teams and adoptions softwaredevelopersusevarioustechniquestoimplementandmaintain software including attimes adopting new technology .

our paper extends such implications to tool adoptions in oss projects.
marlowetal.
findthatlengthoftenuremaybeassociated withattitudestowardnewtools.moreseniordevelopersmayget moreattachedtoaworkingstyle thusmakingthemlessflexibleto adopt new tools.
new developers in contrast need lesstime to adapt to a new working style due to lack of history in the project and eagerness to learn follow technology trends.
xiao et al.
find developers are more likely to adopt a tool if their peers or co workers are using or have used it.
also if experienced individuals join a project their knowledge and social ties move withthemtotheproject .thus thesum knowledgeofthe wholeteamisconstantlychangingastheprojectevolves.likewise previous research has found that emotional contagion from coworkerscanpercolatewithintheteam causingaslowdown in communication and productivity.
with publicly available traces of working records and discussions it is possible for researchers to study team dynamics before during and after a change .
however studying tool adoptions is complex because of the variety of contributing factors.
previous work has found that changing previous practices can force software developers out of their safe zone resulting in nonconformity with the methodology.
zelkowitz et al.
find that many softwareprofessionalsareresistanttochange andthattimingisofimportancewhenadoptingnewtechnology.johnsonetal.
considerthathavingintuitivedefectpresentationmaycontributetothe willingness of using static analysis tools.
related literature showsthatdevelopers socialnetworks e.g.

pointed out correlations between organizational factors and the success of security practices.
.
diffusion of innovations theory diffusionofinnovations andhassincebecomepopularinsocio technicalfields.
rogers considered diffusion as the process by which an innova tion unfolds over time through communication channels among thepopulation andfoundthatsomepropertiesofinnovationare crucial to an adoption perceived usefulness perceived complexity peer pressure etc.
the innovation diffusion process at an organizationallevelcanbesummarizedashavingtwostages initiation perceivingtheissues andknowingtheycanbeaddressedbyadoptingcertaininnovations andimplementation adoptingthe innovation and customizing it to fit own culture if necessary then theteam collectedinformationreinforces devitalizetheadoption until the innovation becomes a part of the organization .
in the context of software engineering can be of vital value to offer understandings of the phenomenology and consequences.
e.g.
toolbuilders want to know ifanyone will use the tooltheybuilt andhowtopersuadethecommunitytouseit.for generaldevelopers theywanttoknowifthereexisttoolstohelp them be more efficient.
however even if a tool can be beneficial individualresistancemaystillexist.toreducesuchindividualresis tance organizationalmandatehasbeenshowntohaveinfluenceon adoptions .
however those authors also find that the organizational mandate is not sustainable compared to other factors.
a catalog of non coercive adoption patterns has been proposed tohelporganizationsachievesuccessfulsoftwareengineeringpractices in a more persuasive manner.
in github oss projects bertram et al.
found that communication and knowledge sharing exist for coordinating work in issue 698trackers.
this suggests that developers within a project communicate and learn from each other .
moreover knowledge sharing exists even across projects.
singer et al.
noted that some developers use github to learn how other projects use the same tools in theirprojects.thus developersinthegithubecosystem andinitstightersub ecosystems shareanddistributeknowledgeabouttoolsthroughparticipationindifferentprojects thuscreatingadiffusion process.
.
social judgment theory socialjudgmenttheory sjt wasproposedtostudyhowpeople self persuade to adopt a new idea when they encounter it.
according to sjt when people are exposed to new information or a newenvironment they tendto consider three things.
first is theirpreviously formed attitude or anchorto which they compare the new idea .thentheylookatavailable alternatives.inthisprocess peoplerecognizethemselves formtheirviews andexpresstheir ideas.finally thereisthe egoinvolvement orthecentralityofthe issue being considered to a person s life which can explain whypeople can accept some ideas and novelty easier than others.

thereareseveralwaystoaggregatethejudgmentsofindividuals fromagroupintoa groupjudgment .mathematicalaggregationamounts to simple counting averaging of individual judgment.
on the other hand behavioral aggregation is the outcome of group members agreeing after discussing the matter.
experimental ev idence suggests that group judgment is generally more accurate thanindividualjudgment andhowitismeasuredcanbesignificant to the outcome .
however others found that the superiority of group judgment is due to reliability produced by larger samples .
in the context of oss projects team discussions on tool adoptions transpire during which possible options are proposed.
these discussions can be considered a form of behavioral aggregation of individual opinions.
however group judgment may get biased as high egoindividualswith strongopinionscanpotentiallyswaya group decision in their direction even if it offers no overall benefit.
hypotheses and research questions central to this paper is the analogy that adopting a tool is akinto adopting an idea.
an oss project involves a social organiza tion in which activities are coordinated through communicationto achieve both individual and collective goals.
by coordinatingactivities the organizational structure has to be created to assist individualstocommunicate.ingithubprojects inparticular the twomaincommunicationchannelsarethroughcodecommitting andissueposting.moreover contributingcodechangesandapproving others pull requests suggests that the developers are mutually awareofeachother andthisformsthebasisforcommunications and discussions.the suggests that innovations and new technologies can be spread to teams through diffusion.
for tool adoptionin github projects this diffusion happens through information exchangewithinandbetweenprojects throughtheirdevelopers.
one mechanism is through reading participating in discussions thatareaccessibletoallteammembersinaproject.thepublicly available traces of commits and comments allow us to study discussiondynamics ofhow tools areperceived discussed andthen finally adopted.thus ahypothesis arisingfrom thatdevelopers who have previously had exposure to certain tools will be moreknowledgeableofthemandcontributetoadiscussiononit to make the adoption process smoother and faster.
ontheotherhand sjtsuggeststhatsinceitislikelysomedeveloperspreferadoptingatoolmorestronglythanotherdevelopersdo theformernaturallywillhavehigh egoonadoptions.ahypothesis arisingisthatdeveloperswhopostmorecommentsontoolsthan others will be the influencers in the discussions and will affect the direction of the adoption.
moreover contributing to cognitive dissonance peoplewillreactmorestronglytonegativeinformation than positive information .
therefore another hypothesis is thatthepeople sdiscussionsentiment positiveornegative may correlate with eventual tool adoption.
weformalizetheaboveintoourresearchquestions rqs asfollows.first weseektouncoverthepatternsandchangeshappening at team level in the period surrounding tool adoption events.

namely rq3 aretooladoptioneventsassociatedwithinfluencers?how much does their opinion weigh in on others?
inthefinalthrust tocomprehensivelyunderstandtooladoption and discussions we quantitatively model adoptions and discussion length in terms of our chosen variables using multiple regression.
rq4 what are the quantitative determinants of project wide tool adoption and the preceding discussion length?
4d a t a we start from a data set by trockman et al.
of github npm projects that have adopted any of different devops tools1.
they were collected by gathering tool badges from the projects readme.mdfiles.someprojectsusebadgestosignalimportant information e g code coverage percentage number of downloads per month package dependencies and continuous integration status .
the tooladoptiondataiscurrentasofjan2019.thedatasetconsistsof 923distinctgithubprojects theadoptedtools andtheadoption dates.
in total tool adoptions are identified or about tool adoptions per project on average.
among them projects 1data and code is available at 699table tool adoption event summary tool task class per tool per tool category karma browser4116 sauce selenium coveralls coverage14430 21626codecov codeclimate codacy coverity uglify minifier2018 minimist minifier mocha testing33280 istanbul jasmine eslint linter10978 standard jshint snykdependence manager179181gemnasium adopted only one tool projects adopted two tools projects adopted three tools and projects adopted four tools.
projectswhichhaveadoptedmorethanfourtoolsarefewerthan of the total.
the collectedtools can beclassified into the followingsix categories according to their functionality.
we illustrate each category with an example tool.

selenium is an automatedtestingframeworkforautomatedtestingofwebapplications and user interfaces uis .testcoverage e.g.

linters e.g.

dependency managers e.g.
snykhelpsdevelopers track the dependency tree to find which module introduces the vulnerability .
the categories and the summary statistics of adoption data is given in table .
.
data collection and cleaning we use the github api v3 to collect and extract historical recordsofthecommitsanddiscussionsfromthegithubprojects.
for commits data the author is the one who made the changes while the committer is the one who committed the changes to github.
thus we align the author with each commit.
for discussions since the commit messages are usually not meaningful we only collect and use issues and comments as their discussions.
someprojectshaveverylowlevelsofactivity whileothershave team sizes that may be too small to study their dynamics.
to avoid those in this paper commits and comments of only the durable andpersistentprojectsarecollected.wesetthreerequirements durable theprojectsthathavecommitrecordsspanningatleasttwoyears.
persistent theprojectshavingatleast 6monthsof commit history before and after the tool adoption event and have atleast50totalcommits.
related theprojectshavingatleast one comment related to the adopted tools.
after filtering the final data set consists of distinct github projects.
since we focus on discussion comments which specifically associate with tools we filter out all discussion comments which do not explicitly mention a tool name of the tool names with the following exception.
if an issue starts a thread and mentions a tool name therepliestothatthreadarelikelyapartofthediscussion therefore all comments following the tread are also included even if they do not contain a tool name.
on the other hand some issues are automatically posted e.g.
by continuous integration ci tools we identify the comments by checking the title of the comments e.g.
and exclude the comments from the data set.
weidentifyandremovethefollowingstringsfromcomments that do not comprise text as they would bias downstream analysis non asciicharacters bycheckingifallcharactersarefrom u4e00 to u9fff codesnippets bycheckingifthecommentsareenclosed with single or triple backticks urls by using the regular expression from the remodule in python .
with pattern https?
s andemojisbycheckingtheencodingofthecharacters.finally since somecommentsmentionmultipletoolsatthesametime therefore theyarecountedmultipletimes.toavoidsuchduplicationbythose comments about .
of the total we manually re label these comments with only one tool we achieve this mainly by referring the outcome of the adoption which one is finally adopted and context of the discussion.
.
variables used the variables that we use in this study have been identified based on our discussion and consideration of the underlying theories.
they include the following.
outcomes adoption success and discussion length.
adoption success adoption success isabinaryvariable no or1 yes indicating whether a tool was adopted in a project.
a successful adoptionisifatoolisbeingusedinaproject regardlessofwhether discussionsoniteverhappened.anunsuccessfuladoptionisifa project s team had a discussion on a tool yet they never adoptedit.discussion length discussion length for a project and a tool is calculated as the number of months from the first day the tool was mentionedintheprojectdiscussion untilthetoolwasadopted.the discussion length suggests how long it takes for teams to reach an agreement and eventually adopt the tool although in practice can be much longer if the team keeps coming back to discussing a tool afterlongerbreakswithoutmentioningit.toaddressthosecases we introduce a control variable num mentions see below which measures the volume of tool mentions in a discussion.

teammetrics we calculate team measures for each project for eachtooldiscussion.
newdevelopers num new dev attimetin the project are those developers who have made their first con tribution either by committing code changes or participating indiscussions within the 3months prior to t. for convenience we refer to all other developers who are not new developers as senior developers.
developers with prior tool exposure num w tool expos are the developers who had already been in a project before time t thathadusedthattool andhavecommittedcodechangesbefore timetto current project but after their contributions to the other tool using project .
in contrast the developers without prior exposurearetheoneswhodidnotparticipateinaprojectthathadusedthetoolbeforetime t.involveddevelopers num involved dev are thedeveloperswhohavebeeninvolved i.e.
participated inthetool discussion.
positive developers num pos dev are the developers whohavepostedoverallmorecommentswithpositivesentiment than negative sentiment in the tool discussion.
while negative developers num ne dev are the opposite.
the descriptive statistics for the metrics are shown in table .
methods .
topics identification we use latent dirichlet allocation lda to study topics in discussions.ldaisastatisticaltechniqueusedtoidentifytopics in large documents and high frequency words associated with the topics.
lda yields a topic probability distribution for each document enabling topic clustering and or text classification across all documents in a set.
before training the lda model we pre processed the github commentsbytokenizingwiththeapacheopennlplibrary andstemmingwiththeporterstemmer thisremovedallstop words from the comments .
due to the large number of discussions we have many high frequency words are not very meaningful.
to get a corpus with a higher concentration of topics we removedboththe5 wordswiththelowestfrequency e.g.
usernames and the5 wordswiththehighestfrequency e.g.
bugs .afterthis the lda model is more able to distinguish topics from each other.
.
sentiment analysis a sentiment analysis tool identifies the emotional characteristic of a text typically in terms of its aggregate positivity or negativity.many sentiment analysis tools used in software engineering are trained solely on social media corpora e.g.
twitter facebook and yelp.
however some words in the context of software engineering can represent a different meaning compared to social mediacorpus .
for example to kill a process is neutral in the context of programming while some sentiment analysis predictors trained on other media corpus treat it as a strong indicator fornegative emotion.
to avoid such issue we use senti4sd to pre dict the sentiment of the github comments.
it has been trainedon stack overflow annotated comments and it has been shownto be more accurate in the software engineering domain .
senti4sd yields ternary sentiment for each comment i.e.
positive neutral ornegative.thefollowingareexamplesfromourdataof positive neutral andnegativecomments aspersenti4sd sensitive words are anonymized and replaced by notation .
positive sure user !
appreciate your point thanks for the suggestion.
neutral let s have this project actually be tool and not try to duplicate onourownwhat tool doesinternally.let sjustlet tool handleallmergingitself.
negative btw tool failedbecauseyouadded a function without tests.
githubdiscussioncommentscanstillbedifferentfromthestack overflowcomments.toverifythatsenti4sdcaneffectivelyidentify sentiment in comments on github we selected a random set of 50commentsandviaobservationdeterminedthemtocontain25 commentsof neutral commentsof negative and 12comments of positive sentiment.
then we ran them through senti4sd and found that were mispredicted by senti4sd showing the accuracyof88 2neutralcommentsweredeemednegative while1positive and negative comments were deemed neutral .
we aligned each post with their senti4sd derived ternary sentiment i.e.
positive neutral andnegative .wefindthat23.
ofthe discussions are positive .
of the comments are neutral and .
of them are negative.
the average length of the comments is 194charactersforneutral 242charactersforpositive and422characters forthe negative.
this suggeststhat the negativecomments may carry more information than other two types.
.
linear mixed effect regression we use generalized linear mixed effect regression glmer models glmer packagein r tostudythecontributionofourindependent variables to explain the variability in the outcome variable while mixing fixed and random effects.
the toolis used as the random effect in the models.

we use the variance inflation factor vif to check whether multicollinearity exists between the independent variables in the regression models which can lead to regression coefficients that are difficult to interpret.

results and discussion .
rq1 tool adoption and team dynamics first to study tool adoption events over time we align all projects around their adoption dates and plot those adoptions for each tool.
theresults pertoolcategoryandpertoolareshowninfigure1.
the figures suggest that adoptions in oss projects spread in a nonconstant speed some group of people adopt a tool much sooner thantheaverageadoptiontime whileothersadoptitonlyifthey are fully convinced i.e.
have an adoption lag.
this fits well within thepredictionsofthe dependence manager is not included because of lacking enough data points.
second to study the team dynamics around adoption events weexaminethetemporaldataofourfiveteam levelmetrics the number of developers with prior exposure new developers involveddevelopers commentsassociatedwithtools andcommits at monthly intervals as illustrated in figure .
we see from figure that the average number of involved developers isalmost linearlyincreasing over time likely correlatingtable topics discovered in discussions topic sample vocabulary testing run test use report case mocha development js setup window browser npm3 debugging fail stack error timeout check4 general ideas work support dependency need5 integration ci function module nodejs client withthegeneralgithubtrend.thisimpliesthatmoredevelopers participate in the discussions of adopting tools.

also notable is that the number of developers with prior exposure to the tool is steadilygrowing inthe periodbeforethe adoption thereby likely increasing the diffusion probabilities and the adoption chances.
answertorq1 successfuladoptiondistributionsareinline with late.
we observe that new developer numbers increase slower than involved developer numbers but significantly more so after the tool adoption.

therefore the number ofdifferentdiscussiontopicsongithubismuchfewercompared to social media corpus.

to understand and identify topics and emerging patterns in the discussions we go through discussion comments within the months prior to the adoption date.

among them adoptions are successful and adoptions are unsuccessful.
we define the successful adoption rate sar as the ratio of the successful adoptions to the total i.e.

a very common situation is that a project member wants to haveatestingtoolfortheirproject andthedeveloperscreatean issue to query other s opinions on whether to adopt this tool.

in contrast and as predictedby sjt without an influencer integrating the democratic opinions into a consensus decision may be moredifficultandtakelonger while theinfluencercan speedupthe adoption process.wefind thatwithout aninfluencer the average discussion length is about months while with an influencer the length decreases to months on average.
answer to rq3 we identify strong influencers in the projects and show that projects having strong influencershave more successful adoptions and shorter adoption dis cussions.
moreover the sentiment of the strong influencer correlates with the adoptions.

the two decisions are in contrast.

in the second multiple projectmembers are involved andthe project adopteda different tool than the one discussed.

rq4 adoption discussion determinants in the previous rqs we conducted exploratory and qualitative studiesofteamdiscussionanddynamicsbeforeandfollowingan adoptionevent.herewetriangulatethosewithquantitativestudies to understand the determinants as well as the direction of their effects on adoption success and discussion length.
our data is naturally hierarchically organized based on the tool being discussed.
we use toolas a random effect in our models allowing all projects adopting a specific tool to have the samerandom intercept.
all other variables are used as fixed effects in our mixed effect models.
we model each of the two outcomes with a base model comprised of the control variables and a full model which adds to the base the complement of team variables.
we perform the likelihood ratio test between the base and full models using the anova function and present both models for each outcome variable.
modeling adoption success.the results are shown in table .

of the controls the variables discussion length num comments andnum commits have significant sizeable negative effect on tool adoptions holding all else constant.
this is consistent with the sjt prediction that group judgment needs more time to form in larger teams and that an adoption may be more difficult to succeed since anagreementisneededfrommorepeople.
num mentions onthe other hand shows a sizeable positive effect which makes sense froma succeed.table adoption successglmer model toolas random effect.

takeaways for practitioners here we distill from our findings some practical takeaways and suggestions.
generally oss project team discussions are helpfulfor community building.
but they are sorely lacking during tooladoptions and since we also found that the discussions tend to be goal oriented and rational we recommend that they should be encouraged in the oss community.
ourfindingthathavingmorepeopleontheprojectwithprior exposure to a tool is associated with successful adoption is evidence toward proceeding with adoptions after a team has multiple members with prior exposure.
however longer discussions can bedistracting to a team and we found they are not associated with better adoption outcomes on the other hand having an influencer as a champion for the adoption may help.
we also found that some tools are associated with longer discussionsthanothers perhapsbecausetheydemandcertainprior exposure and further research.
setting expectations for the team aheadoftimecanlimitfeelingsoffrustrationsarisingoutoflengthy discussions.
and while we found no association between negative orpositive developersandadoptionsuccess discussionstendto be shorter as the number of positive developers increases.
thus being more positive than negative may help keep things shorter.
further morenewdevelopersareassociatedwithloweradoption andlongerdiscussions.whilethenumberofnewdeveloperscannot be modulated much perhaps timing tool adoptions during periods oflowinfluxofnewpeoplemayhelptheproposedtooladoption.
finally morecommitsandcommentsareassociatedwithlowered success of adoption thus planning tool adoptions away from busy project times may result in more successful adoptions.

in terms ofthe relative timing of tool adoptions wefound that thereisasignificantdifferencebetweenthedistributionofadoption timesfortoolsinthesameusecategory makingitchallengingto choose which tool to adopt for projects that are laggards.
we considered tool adoption as a project wide phenomenon affecting every member in the group.
but also depending on the opinionofmanyofthem includingtheirpriorimpressionsoftools and linguistic sentiment we demonstrated that the involvement tenure andmoreimportantly priorexposuretothetoolplaysignificantrolesinthediscussion.wealsofindthatstronginfluencers are associated with more successful adoptions.
