smart contract security a practitioners perspective zhiyuan wan xin xia david lo jiachi chen xiapu luo xiaohu yang college of computer science and technology zhejiang university faculty of information technology monash university school of information systems singapore management university department of computing hong kong polytechnic university wanzhiyuan yangxh zju.edu.cn xin.xia jiachi.chen monash.edu davidlo smu.edu.sg csxluo comp.polyu.edu.hk abstract smart contracts have been plagued by security incidents which resulted in substantial financial losses.
given numerous research efforts in addressing the security issues ofsmart contracts we wondered how software practitioners buildsecurity into smart contracts in practice.
we performed a mixtureof qualitative and quantitative studies with interviewees and156 survey respondents from countries across six continentsto understand practitioners perceptions and practices on smartcontract security.
our study uncovers practitioners motivationsand deterrents of smart contract security as well as how securityefforts and strategies fit into the development lifecycle.
we alsofind that blockchain platforms have a statistically significantimpact on practitioners security perceptions and practices ofsmart contract development.
based on our findings we highlightfuture research directions and provide recommendations forpractitioners.
index terms security empirical study smart contract practitioner i. i ntroduction blockchain is a distributed ledger that provides an open decentralized and fault tolerant transaction mechanism.
blockchain technology has attracted considerable attentionfrom both industry and academia since it is originally intro duced for bitcoin to support the exchange of cryptocur rency.
blockchain technology evolves to facilitate general purpose computations with a wide range of decentralizedapplications.
the smart contract technology is one appealing decentralized application that enables the computations on topof a blockchain.
a smart contract is a piece of executable code that runs on a blockchain to enforce the terms of an agreement betweenuntrusted parties.
blockchain technology assures that a smartcontract is immutable and contract initiated transactions areautonomously and truthfully executed.
there are multipleblockchain platforms that support smart contracts e.g.
ethereum hyperledger fabric and corda with ethereumbeing the most prominent platform .
during the last decade smart contracts have been plagued by security incidents which led to losses reaching millions ofdollars .
in june an attacker exploited vulnerabilitiesin the dao smart contract to empty out around millionethers worth around million dollars .
in july over150 thousand ethers worth over million dollars had been also with pengcheng laboratory.
corresponding author.stolen due to an exploit in widely used parity wallet .
innovember over thousand ethers worth over 150million dollars were frozen due to a vulnerability in the verysame wallet .
to address the security issues of smart contracts researchers have proposed a broad range of defense solutions includinglanguage based security e.g.
static anal ysis e.g.
and runtime verification e.g.
.
vyper removes some of the language function alities in solidity to eliminate vulnerabilities and adds newfeatures to support security and readability.
in terms of staticanalysis oyente leverages symbolic execution to tra verse feasible execution paths on control flow graphs anddetect vulnerabilities in smart contracts securify definescompliance and violation patterns based on known vulnera bilities smartcheck translates smart contract code intoan xml based parse tree and check the parse tree againstspecific xpath patterns.
with respect to runtime verification sereum uses taint analysis to monitor runtime data flowsduring the execution of smart contracts for preventing re entrancy attacks.
despite numerous efforts in assuring the security of smart contracts little is known about how software practitionersbuild security into smart contracts in practice.
thus wefollowed a mixed methods approach to investigate the practi tioners perceptions and practices with respect to smart con tract security.
we started with semi structured interviews with13 software practitioners with experience in smart contractdevelopment who have an average of .
years of softwareprofessional experience.
through the interviews we qualita tively investigated the security awareness and practices that ourinterviewees experienced in smart contract development.
wederived competing priorities in smart contract development a list of security motivators 1and security deterrents for smart contract practitioners sources where practitionersacquire security knowledge security strategies and 11factors that affect the adoption of security tools.
we furtherperformed an exploratory survey with smart contractpractitioners from countries across six continents to quan titatively validate the security perceptions and practices thatare uncovered in our interviews.
the survey respondents work 1security motivators are the factors that motivate practitioners to address security on the contrary security deterrents are the factors that deter practitioners from devoting efforts to security .
ieee acm 43rd international conference on software engineering icse .
ieee on multiple blockchain platforms i.e.
public blockchains consortium blockchains and private blockchains andhold various job roles i.e.
development testing and project management .
we investigated the followingresearch questions rq1.
what are practitioners perceptions regarding smart contract security?
and of the survey respondents perceive the importance of security and privacy in smart contracts respectively.the security motivators include practitioners awareness ofimportance workplace environment and perceived negativeconsequences of security issues.
meanwhile the security de terrents include competing priorities in smart contract develop ment and no formal process to address smart contract security.
rq2.
how does security fit into the development lifecycle of smart contracts?
this research question investigates security efforts security strategies and the adoption of security tools in smart contractdevelopment.
on average security efforts account for of the overall efforts during the development process ofsmart contracts.
to ensure smart contract security practitionersdistribute efforts across different stages in the developmentlifecycle.
they tend to spend significantly more effort towardssecurity at the construction and testing stages than at otherstages.
in terms of security strategies and tool adoption of the respondents frequently leverage more than onesecurity strategy.
of the respondents frequently used thecode reuse strategy.
of the respondents frequently adoptsecurity tools especially the security plugins in integrateddevelopment environments.
rq3.
do blockchain platforms influence practitioners perceptions and practices on smart contract security?
blockchain platforms significantly impact security perceptions and practices of practitioners in smart contract devel opment including security motivators e.g.
the immutabilityof smart contracts security deterrents e.g.
the pressure offeature delivery the amount of security efforts across stagesin the development lifecycle e.g.
security efforts at theconstruction stage and strategies to address smart contractsecurity e.g.
code review .
based on the findings we discuss the disconnect between the high awareness of smart contract security of practitionersand the frequent occurrence of security problems in smart con tracts.
we also provide practical lessons about code reuse toolimplications and proactive defense to ensure smart contractsecurity.
in addition we highlight several research avenuesacross blockchain platforms.
this paper makes the following contributions we perform a mixture of qualitative and quantitative stud ies to investigate the security perceptions and practices insmart contract development we provide practical implications for practitioners andoutlined future avenues of research.
we provide the interview guide questionnaire and surveyresponses publicly accessible for future investigation byothers .
the remainder of the paper is structured as follows.
section ii briefly reviews related work.
in section iii we describethe methodology of our study in detail.
in section iv wepresent the results of our study.
we discuss the implicationsof our results in section v and threats to the validity of ourfindings in section vi.
section vii draws conclusions andoutlines avenues for future work.
ii.
r ela ted work a. security practices in software development practitioners work within organizations teams communities and cultures.
previous studies investigated the socialfactors that could impact various aspects of security practices e.g.
security tool adoption .
organization andteam policies are a driving factor to tool adoption thoughmany organizations do not encourage the adoption of securitytools.
large organizations make more use of security tools thansmall ones .
existing tools fail to meet the expectations ofpractitioners by generating low quality warning messages interrupting work flow producing excessivefalse positives and integrating poorly with inte grated development environments ides .
in this work we investigated the factors that impact security practices insmart contract development.
security is expected to be included in developing highquality software systems but is rarely listed as an explicitrequirement .
practitioners prioritize functional require ments over security and focus on tasks for which outcomesare easy to measure .
pressures from budget anddeadlines can also lead to lowering the priority of securitypractices .
some organizations attempt to use penetrationtesting to motivate practitioners but the motivation is hardto sustain without continuous support .
in this work we investigated how practitioners prioritize security in smartcontract development.
building security in from the start requires a large amount of knowledge.
weir et al.
found that enthusiasm about securityand motivation to learn are more likely to drive the acquisitionof security knowledge for developers than task driven .alternatively security experts could act as a roving source ofsecurity knowledge but face challenges to convince others ofthe importance of security and examine all generated codewith limited resources .
practitioners leverage variousinformation sources to gain knowledge on code security e.g.
documentation and stack overflow .
acar etal.
conducted an empirical study to investigate how theuse of information sources impacts code security.
they foundthat developers who use stack overflow are more likely toproduce functional code but less likely to write secure code.this paper investigates the involvement of security experts insmart contract development and information sources of smartcontract security.

.
research methodology.
in the course of software design and construction misuse of application programming interfaces apis can introduce security vulnerabilities .
developers incorrectlyuse an api because they do not conduct an additional checkbut trust the api to do the right thing .
acar et al.compared the usability of five python cryptographic apis andsuggested that documentation with examples is more helpfulthan a simple api .
nadi et al.
performed an empiricalstudy on how developers use java cryptography apis.
theyfound that developers struggle with java cryptography apisand prefer task based solutions.
in addition developers havedifficulty in using security related apis for instance apis intransport layer security tls and security sockets layer ssl .
this paper investigates whether the use ofsmart contract related apis may introduce security risks.
b. smart contract security security vulnerabilities spread across smart contracts of various blockchain platforms e.g.
ethereum hyperledger frabric and eos .
security vulnerabili ties result from multiple causes e.g.
reentrancy delegate call injection and integer overflow and underflow .different programming languages of smart contracts andblockchain architectures lead to different vulnerabilities .
inthis work we investigate practitioners awareness of securityvulnerabilities in their smart contracts.
previous studies proposed a wide range of approaches and tools for securing smart contracts including recommendingbest practices in programming smart contracts implementingspecific programming languages static analysis and runtimemonitoring.
for instance consensys provides extensivebest practices for ethereum smart contract security includingcode patterns to learn and pitfalls to avoid.
vyper and bamboo provide language based support to eliminate smart contract vulnerabilities.
static analysis tools leveragesymbolic execution abstractinterpretation formal verifica tion fuzzing and model checking to identify smart contract vulnerabil ities.
dappguard and sereum monitor the runtimeexecution of a smart contract to prevent potential exploitationsof vulnerabilities.
in this work we investigate the adoption ofsecurity strategies and tools of smart contracts in practice andexplore the expectations of practitioners.iii.
m ethodology our research methodology followed a mixed methods approach as depicted in fig.
.
the approach followsa sequential explanatory strategy involving two phases afirst qualitative phase of interviews followed by a secondquantitative phase of an exploratory survey .
the survey builds on the results of the interviews.
specifically we collecteddata from two sources we interviewed software prac titioners with experience in smart contract development andderived a list of statements and potential answers for surveyquestions from the results of interviews we surveyed 156respondents with experience in smart contract development.to preserve the anonymity of participants we anonymizedall items that constitute of personally identifiable information pii before analyzing the data and further considered aliasesas pii throughout our study e.g.
refer to the interviewees asp1 p13 .
a. interviews the left part of fig.
describes the process of interviews.
protocol the first author conducted a series of face toface interviews with software practitioners with experience in smart contract development.
each interview took min utes.
the interviews were semi structured and made use of aninterview guide .
to develop the interview guide we obtained an initial set of open ended questions through brainstormingwithin the authors of this paper focusing on practitioners perceptions and practices concerning smart contract security.
the interview comprised three parts.
in the first part we asked some demographic questions about the experience ofthe interviewees in smart contract development.
the questionscovered various aspects of experience including programming design testing and project management.
in the second part we asked open ended questions about the security awareness and practices of smart contract devel opment.
the purpose of this part was to allow the intervieweesto speak freely about their opinions and experience without theinterviewer biasing their responses.
in the third part we asked the interviewees to discuss the sources where they obtain security related knowledge aswell as strategies and tools that they have used for securityassurance of smart contracts in the practices.
3the interviews and survey were approved by the relevant institutional review board irb .
participants were instructed that we wanted their opinions privacy and sensitive resources were not explicitly mentioned 4interview guide online 1412at the end of each interview we thanked the interviewee and briefly informed her of our next plans.
participant selection we recruited full time software practitioners with experience in smart contract development from blockchain companies e.g.
hyperchain5 it companies e.g.
alibaba and open source smart contract projects.interviewees were recruited by emailing our contact in eachcompany or project who disseminated the news of our studyto their colleagues.
v olunteers would inform us if they werewilling to participate in the study with no compensation.
withthis approach volunteers with varied experience in yearscontacted us interviewees from four companies and 6interviewees from three open source projects.
in the remainderof this paper we denote these interviewees as p1 top13.
these interviewees have an average of .
years ofprofessional experience in software development min max median .
sd .
and an average of .
years in smartcontract development min max median sd .
.table i summarizes the number of interviewees who perceivedthemselves as having extensive experience in comparisonto none and some experience in a particular role.
data analysis we conducted a thematic analysis to process the recorded interviews by following the steps below transcribing and coding.
after the last interview was completed we transcribed the recordings of the interviews and developed a thorough understanding by reviewing thetranscripts.
the first author read the transcripts and coded theinterviews using nvivo qualitative analysis software .
to ensure the quality of codes the second author verified initial codes created by the first author and provided sugges tions for improvement.
after incorporating these suggestions we generated a total of cards that contain the codes 30to cards for each coded interview.
after merging the codeswith the same words or meanings we have a total of 133unique codes.
open card sorting.
two of the authors then separately analyzed the codes and sorted the generated cards into potential themes for thematic similarity as illustrated in latoza etal.
s study .
the themes that emerged during the sortingwere not chosen beforehand.
we then use the cohen s kappameasure to examine the agreement between the twolabelers.
the overall kappa value between the two labelersis .
which indicates substantial agreement between the la belers.
after completing the labeling process the two labelersdiscussed their disagreements to reach a common decision.to reduce bias from the two authors sorting the cards to forminitial themes they both reviewed and agreed on the final set ofthemes.
eventually we derived competing priorities a list of11 security motivators and security deterrents sources ofsecurity knowledge and security strategies and factorsthat affect the adoption of security tools.
b. survey the right part of fig.
describes the process of our online survey.
i number of interviewees with extensive experience in a particular role .
role smart contract non smart contract programming design management testing protocol we conducted an irb approved anonymous online survey with professional smart contract practitioners.
the survey aims to validate and quantify the observations fromour interviews.
we followed kitchenham and pfleeger s guide lines for personal opinion surveys and used an anonymoussurvey to increase response rates .
a respondent has theoption to specify that she prefers not to answer or does notunderstand the description of a particular question.
we includethis option to reduce the possibility of respondents providingarbitrary answers.recruitment of respondents.
to recruit respondents from the population of smart contract practitioners we spread thesurvey to a broad range of companies from various loca tions worldwide.
no identifying information was required orgathered from our respondents.
to get a sufficient number ofrespondents from diverse backgrounds we followed a multi pronged strategy to recruit respondents we contacted professionals from blockchain companiesand it companies that launch blockchain projects aroundthe world and asked their help to disseminate our surveywithin their organizations.
specifically we sent emailsto our contacts in alibaba baidu hengtian hyperchain ibm morgan stanley and other companies encourag ing them to disseminate our survey to some of theircolleagues who have experience in smart contract devel opment.
by following this strategy we aimed to recruitrespondents working with smart contracts in the industryfrom diverse organizations.
we sent an email with a link to the survey to 986practitioners who contributed to blockchain repos itories that support smart contracts e.g.
ethereum goethereum eosio eos and hyperledger fabric and smart contract repositories e.g.
ethereum solidity and eosio eosio.contracts hosted on github and solicitedtheir participation.
we aimed to recruit open source prac titioners who have smart contract experience in additionto professionals working in the industry.out of these emails eight emails received automaticreplies notifying us of the absence of the receiver twoemails indicated the receivers left the original organiza tions four receivers replied that they only have experi ence in blockchain but not smart contract development.
survey design the survey includes different types of questions e.g.
multiple choice and free text answer questions.the potential answers and statements of multiple choice ques tions were derived from the results of our interviews.
for thesequestions we include an i don t know option in case somestatements are not applicable to the experience of respondents 1413or respondents had a poor understanding of the statements.
the survey consists of four sections grouping questions by topic to minimize the cognitive load on participants and allow them to consider the topic more deeply .
specifically the following four sections have been captured in the survey the complete questionnaire is available online as supplementalmaterial demographics.
we collected demographic information about the respondents to allow us to filter respondents whomay not understand our survey i.e.
respondents without anyexperience in smart contracts breakdown the results bygroups e.g.
public consortium and private blockchains .specifically we asked two questions do you have experience with smart contracts?
what best describes the primary blockchain platform that you currently work on?
in terms the second question we provided four options forprimary blockchain platforms including public blockchain consortium blockchain private blockchain and other.
based on the selections of respondents we could exclude invalid responses and divide the survey respondents into threegroups.
to focus the respondents attention on a particularblockchain platform in the survey they were explicitly askedto answer each following question with respect to their expe rience with the primary blockchain platform they specified.
we received a total of responses and further excluded responses made by respondents who claimed that they donot have experience in smart contract development.
we alsoexcluded one response made by a respondent who describedher job role as sales.
in the end we had a set of validresponses.
the respondents reside in countries acrosssix continents as shown in fig.

more details about the questions and format are available in section iv along with the corresponding results.
we piloted the preliminary survey with a small set of smart contract practitioners who were different from our interviewees and survey takers.
we obtained feedback on whetherthe length of the survey was appropriate and the clarity andunderstandability of the terms.
we made minor modificationsto the preliminary survey based on the received feedback andproduced a final version.
note that the collected responsesfrom the pilot survey are excluded from the presented resultsin this paper.
to support respondents from china we translated our survey to chinese before publishing the survey.
we chose tomake our survey available both in english on google forms and in chinese on a popular survey website in china .
the reason is that english is an international lingua franca andchinese is the most spoken language.
we expected that a largenumber of our survey recipients are fluent in one of these twolanguages.
we carefully translated our survey to make surethere exists no ambiguity between english and chinese termsin our survey.
also we polished the translation by improvingclarity and understandability according to the feedback fromour pilot survey.
data analysis we analyzed the survey results based on the question types.
for multiple choice questions we reportedthe percentage each option is selected.
in terms of open endedquestions we followed an inductive approach in which twoauthors separately performed open card sorting and regularlydiscussed emerging themes until an agreement was reached.
factor analysis.
to identify meaningful clusters of closely related information we used factor analysis to analyze the likert scale ratings of the statements with respect to thesecurity motivators and security deterrents in smart contract of valid responses number of valid responsessupporting many featurescosting less gaseasy to useprotecting privacysecuring against malicious attacksavoiding bugs not at all slightly moderately very extremely fig.

specifically we used principal axis factor analysis in the psych r library to group related information with a cut off point of .
for factor loading.
we used the fa.parallel function in the psych r library to select the optimal number of factors for factor analysis.
thus wereduced a large set of variables into a smaller set factors while retaining the majority of original information .
comparison.
we classified our respondents into different groups based on their primary blockchain platforms i.e.
public consortium and private blockchains and compared thesurvey results of different groups of respondents.
for instance we used the wilcoxon rank sum test for likert scale answersto perform the comparison.
all statistical tests assumed a p value .05as a significant level.
bonferroni correction was applied to adjust p values in multiple comparisons.

r esults we explain the results of three research questions that investigate smart contract security from the perspective ofpractitioners.
a. rq1 perceptions of smart contract security in rq1 we explored practitioners priorities in smart contract development what motivates them and deters them to address smart contract security and their experience of secu rity problems.
to understand practitioners priorities in smartcontract development we presented our respondents with sixstatements that describe the requirements of smart contracts.respondents ranked the importance of each requirement ona point likert scale not at all slightly moderately very extremely .
to explore what drives practitioners to addresssmart contract security we presented our respondents with alist of statements that describe potential security motivatorsand statements that explain potential security deterrents.respondents indicated their level of agreement with each state ment on a point likert scale strongly disagree disagree neutral agree strongly agree .
in addition we asked the respondents to report whether their smart contracts have everexperienced a security problem as well as the sources wherethey gain security knowledge.

we asked the respondents i care about smart contract security because ... and presented the potential motivators for smart contract security.
as shown in fig.
the top two security motivators are respondents internalmotivations i.e.
to protect their users and the reputation of their companies.
meanwhile external motivations9are reportedly less motivating i.e.

we used factor analysis to cluster the motivators into three factors as shown in table ii.
two motivators did notconform to any particular factor.
we named the factors asawareness of importance workplace environment and perceived negative consequences.
out of the three factors workplace environment is the only external motivation.
security deterrents.
respondents generally opposed statements that imply deferring or ignoring security as suggestedby the longer red bars in comparison with blue bars .the top two deterrents of smart contract security are a lack ofawareness of security attacks followed by a formal process.

between two sample distributions ranging from 1to .
the extreme value 1occurs when the intersection between both groups is an empty set.
when the compared groups tend to overlap cliff s delta approaches zero.
the magnitudes can beassessed with the thresholds as specified in if .
the effect size is negligible if .
.
the effect size is small if .
.
the effect size is medium and otherwise the effect size is large.
effect sizes areadditionally colored on a gradient from blue to orange basedon the magnitudes of difference blue color means the formergroup is more positive about the statement and orange colormeans the latter group is more positive about the statement.
the p value column indicates whether the differences for each statement are statistically significant between public blockchain and consortium blockchain in the first subcolumn public blockchain and private blockchain in the second subcolumn and consortium blockchain and private blockchain in the third subcolumn.
statistically significant differences ata confidence level bonferroni corrected p value .
are highlighted in green.
based on the observed statistically significant differences and effect sizes we can say with some certainty that security motivators the blockchain platforms significantly impact the security motivator in terms of the im mutability of smart contracts.
the immutability of smartcontracts drives practitioners of public blockchains moreintensively than practitioners of consortium blockchains.in addition the practitioners of public blockchains tendto be more motivated to address smart contract securitythan those of consortium and private blockchains.
security deterrents the blockchain platforms significantly affect the deterrents to security with respect tocompeting priorities in smart contract development.
prac titioners of public blockchains tend to be more willingto prioritize security tasks over feature delivery and takethe responsibility of addressing smart contract security in comparison with those of consortium and privateblockchains.
security efforts across stages the blockchain platforms statistically significantly impact the security effortsat the construction stage in the development lifecycle.practitioners of public blockchains spend more effortstowards security throughout the six stages in the devel opment lifecycle especially at the construction stage incomparison with practitioners of consortium blockchains.in addition practitioners of consortium blockchains tendto put less emphasis on security at the requirement construction deployment and maintenance stages incomparison with practitioners of private blockchains.
security strategies the blockchain platforms significantly affect the code review strategy that practitionersuse to address smart contract security.
practitioners ofpublic blockchains tend to perform code review morefrequently than practitioners of consortium and privateblockchains.
aside from code review we observed no sig nificant difference in the frequency of use of other secu1418rity strategies between public and consortium blockchain practitioners.
private blockchain practitioners tend to usesecurity strategies less frequently than public and consor tium blockchain practitioners.
v. d iscussion we reflect on our findings of research questions delving into security awareness and risks of smart contracts as wellas code reuse and tool implications in smart contracts.
wealso highlight the avenues of future research across blockchainplatforms.
a. security awareness and risks of smart contracts the vast majority of our respondents acknowledge the importance of smart contract security rq1 .
they prioritize security over the reduction of execution cost e.g.
gas con sumption in smart contract development.
our respondentsspend of overall efforts on average in conducting security related tasks.
previous studies found that developers generallyexhibit a security is not my responsibility attitude .
onthe contrary of our respondents see smart contract secu rity as their responsibility.
smart contract practitioners tend to have a higher awareness of security than practitionersin other software areas.
despite the high awareness of security among smart contract practitioners of our survey respondents indicatedthat their smart contracts suffered from security problems including security breaches rq1 .
the percentage is higherthan that of software in general as reported in a recentsurvey .
the frequent occurrence of security problems insmart contracts may stem from the optimism bias and lack of a formal security process as suggested inrq1.
in addition smart contracts on public blockchains arevisible and accessible to all users even malicious attackers.the inherent features of smart contracts make them moreprone to security attacks than traditional software.
futurework may focus on standardizing and operationalizing the process of building security in smart contracts.
b. code reuse and tool implications in smart contracts of the respondents frequently reuse code from reliable sources in smart contract development rq2 .
for instance openzeppelin proposes the safemath libraries to help developers of ethereum smart contracts perform proper val idation on numeric inputs and prevent integer overflow andunderflow vulnerabilities.
only two respondents in our sur vey mentioned that they use dependency management as asecurity strategy.
previous studies found that improper useof libraries including security related apis can introducesecurity vulnerabilities .
future studiescould put more effort into providing documentations of smart contract libraries with helpful examples and tools to facilitate library updates for smart contract development.
to facilitate code reuse ethereum virtual machine provides an opcode delegatecall for dynamically loading the bytecode of a callee contract into the caller contract atruntime.
a dos attack against the parity wallet leveraged thevulnerability due to improper use of delegatecall.
thus code reuse in smart contracts can impose a higher risk than itscounterpart in traditional software highlighting the importanceofsecurity auditing on broadly used smart contracts and libraries.
active maintenance ranks on top of the factors that affect the adoption of security tools for smart contracts rq2 .
amongthe four tools we investigated the most frequently used tool mythril has released versions since its first release on october an average of releases per month.
theactive maintenance would enable security tools to uncover thelatest emerging security issues.
as suggested in our survey the practitioners tend to rely on security plugins in ides andprefer tools that cover a broad range of security issues.
thus the future work could focus on automatically incorporating emerging security issues into security tools and integrating various security tools into the ides.
in addition the strategy of chasing behind the attackers is not adequate to addresssmart contract security.
practitioners could proactively defense smart contracts against security attacks via externalauditing and fuzzing.
c. studies across blockchain platforms the results of rq3 indicates that blockchain platforms impact practitioners perceptions and practices on smart contract security.
nonetheless previous studies usually focus onone blockchain platform.
it could be interesting to inves tigate the difference in security issues across different blockchains and whether and how existing tools can be used across different blockchains.
in addition practitionersof public blockchains tend to be more motivated to addresssmart contract security than those of consortium and privateblockchains.
the potential reason could be the accessibilityof public blockchains to any users even malicious attackers.future research could investigate whether the practitioners of consortium and private blockchains make an economicdecision of security strategies based on risk assessment.

t hrea ts to validity internal validity.
in our study the interviewees were selected by a contact at each company or open source projectwho identified the practitioners to be interviewed.
the pro cedure partially alleviates the threat of selection bias sincethe interviewer has no contact with interviewees before theinterviews.
the threat of selection bias would always bepresent when the interviewees were not fully randomly sam pled.
however given that our interviews include practitionerswith various job roles and from different companies and open source projects the threat has limited effect.
as for the survey it is possible that some of our respondents had a poor understanding of the statements for rating.
theirresponses may introduce noise to the data that we collected.
toreduce the impact of this issue we included an i don t know option in the survey and ignored responses marked as such.
wealso dropped responses that were submitted by people whose 1419job roles are none of these software development testing and project management.
two of the authors translated oursurvey to chinese to ensure that respondents from china couldunderstand our survey well.
to reduce the bias of presentingthe survey bilingually we carefully translated our survey toensure there is no ambiguity between english and chineseterms.
we polished the translation by improving clarity andunderstandability according to the feedback from our pilotsurvey.construct validity.
in our interviews the evaluation apprehension was ameliorated by the anonymity of the interviewees as well as the guaranty that all the information obtainedduring the interviews would be used only by the researchers.the interviewer might have influenced the interviewees byasking specific questions.
to mitigate this risk we used open ended questions to elicit as much information as possiblefrom practitioners.
the interviewees may have had a differentunderstanding of the questions than what we had intended.
tominimize this aspect we encouraged the interviewees to askquestions at all times.
in our survey the results are based on respondents self reported responses which may be subject to bias andnot exactly represent reality.
we followed recommendationsto reduce social desirability bias by ensuring respondents anonymity .
the questionnaire in our survey is based oninterview results instead of validated scales.
although we usefactor analysis to analyze the results it may be insufficient tovalidate the scales.conclusion validity.
the interviews were conducted at different locations and each interview was done in one work session.thus answers were not influenced by internal discussions.
toensure that the interview instrument is of high quality to obtainreliable measures we conducted several pilots to improve thequestions and layout of the interview guide prior to conductingthe interviews.
in addition we did our best to randomly select survey respondents from both companies and open source projects.our survey respondents come from countries across sixcontinents who are work in various job roles with a wide rangeof experience.external validity.
to improve the generalizability of our findings regarding smart contract development we interviewed13 interviewees from blockchain companies and open sourceblockchain projects.
we further surveyed respondentsfrom countries across six continents who are work ing for various companies or contributing to open sourceblockchain smart contract projects that are hosted on github in various job roles.
vii.
c onclusion this work proposed a mixed qualitative and quantitative approach to explore practitioners perceptions and practiceson smart contract security.
we recognized the disconnectbetween the security awareness of smart contract practitionersand the occurrence of security problems in smart contracts.we also provided practical lessons about code reuse toolimplications and proactive defense to ensure smart contractsecurity.
besides we observed several differences betweensmart contract security and regular security smart contractpractitioners tend to have a higher security awareness thanregular practitioners smart contracts are more prone tosecurity attacks than regular software more frequent codereuse in smart contract development imposes higher securityrisk than regular software development.
future studies couldput more effort into investigating the differences in variousaspects of smart contracts on top of different blockchain plat forms and generalize existing tools across different blockchainplatforms.
