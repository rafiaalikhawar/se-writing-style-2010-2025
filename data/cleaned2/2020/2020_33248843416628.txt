our evaluation shows that the quality of different kinds of extracted knowledge in the api knowledge graph is generally high.
furthermore the comparison results generated by apicomp are significantly better than those generated by a baseline approach based on heuristic rulesandtextsimilarity andourgeneratedapicomparisonresults are useful for helping developers in api selection tasks.

usingjava.lang.stringbuilder in a multithread context.
therefore developers are often concerned with the comparison of similar apis.
in fact api comparison questions arecommononso stackoverflow .forexample asofmarch3 questions tagged with java have either the strings difference between or vs intheirtitle.
amongthesequestions of questions do not have an accepted answer.
api reference documentation contains rich knowledge of a variety of aspects of an api such as functionalities constraints directives caveats and resource specifications .
in anempiricalstudywith100jdkapicomparisonquestionsfromso we found that the jdk api reference documentation covers of the points made in the answers to these questions covering different aspects of api knowledge.
we also found that knowledge is scattered within the document of one api element e.g.
