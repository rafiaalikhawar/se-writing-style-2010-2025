automated handling of anaphoric ambiguity in requirements a multi solution study saad ezzini university of luxembourg luxembourg saad.ezzini uni.lusallam abualhaija university of luxembourg luxembourg sallam.abualhaija uni.lu chetan arora deakin university australia chetan.arora deakin.edu.aumehrdad sabetzadeh university of ottawa canada m.sabetzadeh uottawa.ca abstract ambiguity is a pervasive issue in natural language requirements.
a common source of ambiguity in requirements is when a pronoun is anaphoric.
in requirements engineering anaphoric ambiguity occurs when a pronoun can plausibly refer to di erent entities and thus be interpreted di erently by di erent readers.
in this paper we develop an accurate and practical automated approach for handling anaphoric ambiguity in requirements addressing both ambiguity detection and anaphora interpretation.
in view of the multiple competing natural language processing nlp and machine learning ml technologies that one can utilize we simultaneously pursue six alternative solutions empirically assessing each using a collection of industrial requirements.
the alternative solution strategies that we consider are natural choices induced by the existing technologies these choices frequently arise in other automation tasks involving natural language requirements.
a side by side empirical examination of these choices helps develop insights about the usefulness of di erent state of the art nlp and ml technologies for addressing requirements engineering problems.
for the ambiguity detection task we observe that supervised ml outperforms both a large scale language model spanbert a variant of bert as well as a solution assembled from o the shelf nlp coreference resolvers.
in contrast for anaphora interpretation spanbert yields the most accurate solution.
in our evaluation the best solution for anaphoric ambiguity detection has an average precision of and a recall of and the best solution for anaphora interpretation resolution has an average success rate of .

introduction natural language nl is the most common medium for specifying systems and software requirements.
nl enables communication between stakeholders who may have different backgrounds often requiring little or no additional training .
nl requirements are nonetheless prone to defects such as ambiguity .
ambiguity occurs when a word phrase or sentence is open to multipleinterpretations .ambiguitycanhaveanegativeimpact onthequality ofrequirementsandalsopotentiallyjeopardize the success of a project .
a common cause of ambiguity in requirements is anaphora .
anaphora means repetition in greek and is defined as
