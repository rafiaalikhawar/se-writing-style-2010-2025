traditional whiteboard interviews.
to investigate how supervised think aloud impacts communication ability we compared students submitted screencast recordings to data collected from behroozi et al.
s public whiteboard setting .
the whiteboard setting resembled a traditional technical interview where student participants stood at a whiteboard to complete a programming challenge q5 without knowledge of the problem beforehand and performed a supervised think aloud in front of an observing researcher see figure b .
participants were similarly given sample test cases prohibited from using external resources and permitted to use any coding language.
they had to complete the task within a minute time limit and were encouraged to verbalize their thoughtprocesses as if participatinginareal jobinterview.

think aloudprovidesinsightintocandidates thoughtprocessesthroughcommunicationbetweeninterviewees and interviewers.
yet not all vocalized thoughts associated with problem solving are worthy of communication and verbalizing all thoughts is not the same as communicating the thought process.

to understand the impact ofthetechnicalinterviewsettingsonspeech weanalyzedspeech patterns such as speechrateandthe presenceofstresscues.
speech rate.
according to the national center of voice and speech ncvs 7theaverageconversation ratefor english speakers in the united states is approximately words per minute.
however stressfulconditionshavebeenshowntoimpacthuman speech rate.
for instance stress can increase speech rate and word productivity inhumans .
onthe otherhand humansmay slow their talking speed by adding pauses or increasing usage of filler words during stress inducing activities such as public speaking .
research suggests secondary tasks such as a technical interviewproblem solvingtasks require attentionalresources that impact the spatiotemporality of vocal systems and can reduce speechrateandfluency .

problem solving strategies.
to study problem solving strategies we analyzed participants adoption of beneficial technical interviewactivitiesbeforeandafterprogramming.thesebestpractices were derived from hiring teams programming blogs and resourcesto helpusersprepare for interviews.
defining approach before coding.
this strategy refers to technical interview candidates outlining their approach to solving a programming challenge question before starting to write code.
duringtechnicalinterviews planningandexplainingtheapproach to solve a coding problem before starting to code provides benefits forparticipants.forexample freecodecamprecommendsinterviewees should communicate your approach to the interviewer even before you start to code to validate the approach with hiring managers fullstack academy notes describing approaches before coding provides insight into your thought process and increases understanding for interviewers and scaler suggests large tech companieslikegoogle amazon andfacebook arelookingforcandidateswith thepatienceandintellecttoanalyzetheproblemat handthoroughlybefore jumping intoprovidingasolution .
to analyze this in our study we observed recordings to determine whether participants clearly explained their approach before startingtheproblem solvingprocesswithcodeorpseudocodein each setting.
we investigated participant recordings to analyze theirthink aloudanddeterminewhentheybegantowritecodefor theirassignedproblem.participantswhoprovidedapreliminary algorithm to approach the problem before starting to write the program even if their algorithm changed during the actual coding were indicatedto have adoptedthis problem solvingstrategy.
checking code against test cases.
after completing the code for technical interview programming questions resources indicate interviewees should test their solution to validate their approach.ingeneral testingisvitalforensuringsoftwareworks 298esec fse november14 18 singapore singapore mahnazbehroozi chrisparnin andchrisbrown correctly .
testing is also an important step for validating solutionsduringintechnicalinterviews.forexample techinterview coachandgooglesoftwareengineeranthonyd.maysarguestestingissomethingintervieweesshould always and absolutelyneed to do during technical interviews .
similarly ibrahim irfan a former developer at google and facebook and co founder of the superpowered app8 emphasizes the importance of testing your codeduringinterviewsstating thebiggestpieceofadviceican give you here is to test your code not your algorithm.

code quality.
to evaluate code quality we used industry standards for evaluating candidates.
specifically we measured the correctnessandcomplexityofparticipants solutiontoensureasynchronous technical interviewssustaintechnical performance.
correctness.
weevaluatedparticipantcodesolutionsineach setting with the specific test cases provided to participants.
table summarizes the coding questions along with the test cases used to evaluate solutions.
the screencast participant solutions were evaluated on test cases based on their randomly assigned question fromq1 q4 whilethewhiteboardparticipantsfrombehroozietal.
s study were evaluated against q5 see table .
to analyze program correctness we manually translated all of the solutions from each setting into program code filling in incomplete or incorrect syntax whennecessary.then weexecutedtheprogramswiththegiven input values to determine if the output of the code matched the expected output of the test cases provided.
we scored participants in each setting based on the percentage of test cases passed out of the total number of test cases to indicate how well completed solutions metthe requirements ofthe originalproblem.
optimality.

in general employers expect efficient code with low complexity during technical interviews .
thus we evaluate optimality as a metric to determine the number of participantswhoprovidedthe mostoptimal solution ineachsetting.

guidelines.
toincorporatesoftskillsandcompanyevaluations with asynchronous technical interviews we suggest employers vary interview types throughout the software engineering hiringpipeline.think aloudisoftenusedtogaugecandidates abilitytoclearlycommunicateandperformaproblem solvingwalkthrough however this is often wrongly conflated with evaluating soft skills.instead we argue thatan asynchronous approach would allow for assessment of a problem solving walk through whileseparatetraditionalbehavioralinterviewsorhigh leveldesign questions would be more appropriate for assessingsoftskills andteamfit.forexample atnetflix someinterviewersincorporate a short technical presentation on any topic as part of the interview process.
further separate sessions could be used for candidates to learn about the culture of organizations and expectations for roles.
thus by including various types of interview formats in a hiring pipeline a morecomplete accurate and fairassessment of candidates can be obtained.

ethical trade offs incorporating privacy and asynchronicity into technical interview processes could also introduce ethical dilemmas.
we introduce several moral predicaments for both employers and candidates and provide guidelines to prevent dishonesty and corruption from implementing asynchronous technical interviews in software engineeringhiring processes.

cheating.
onecomplicationofintegratingasynchronicity into technical interviews is the potential for candidates to cheat.
we found that removing evaluator presence significantly improved candidates technicalperformance leadingparticipantstoproduce more precise and optimal code.
however without synchronous interviewer supervision it would be difficult to prevent interviewees from potentially looking up answers or using external resources while solving programming challenges.
cheating ultimately inhibitsemployersfromgettinganaccurateevaluationofcandidates knowledge skills andabilitiesto make hiring decisions.
guidelines.
to prevent cheating in asynchronous technical interviews we suggest formatting hiring evaluations to better reflect realisticjob settings.forinstance onesoftwareengineer declares ihaveaconfessiontomake.icheatatmyjob.icheatallday every day...ifoundthiswebsitecalledstackoverflowthathassomany answerstoproblemsiruninto.sometimesi lljustcopythecode directly from the site without typing it out again myself!
sometimes i even just walk up to colleagues and straight up ask them for help with a problem .
with screencast recordings employershavetheabilitytoviewallresourcesutilizedbyinterviewees duringcodingtasks inadditiontoobservingtheirproblem solving abilities.
thus we posit incorporating actual software engineering affordances into technical interviews including permitting the use ofexternalresources canmitigatetheimpactofcheatingintechnical interviews and enhance how candidates are evaluated and assessedfor software engineeringpositions.

asynchronoustechnicalinterviewsofferauniqueopportunitytoreduceeffortandtimeinvolvedintechnicalinterviews.
if support for asynchronous technical interviews is integrated into online platforms such as coderpad then several opportunities for automation and time saving could be gained.
first automated testing of code could filter out low performing candidates allowing for manual effort to be focused on more promising candidates.
second automated annotation of the recording e.g.
marking audio hotspots could guide interviewers to salient parts of the interview to review or revisit.
finally for candidates a few recorded asynchronous technicalinterviewsinacentralizedplatformcould be used to apply to multiple positions rather than performing each interview manually.

finally itisworthconsidering how asynchronous technical interviews fit in relationship to other common interview formats.
in addition to traditional whiteboard interviews other hiring assessment formats such take home tests andcoding quizzes alsoexist.
theclosestassessmentstoasynchronoustechnicalinterviews are take home tests with a few critical differences.

similarly autoiterative12offerstake home tests where candidates have two weeks to develop a feature in a production environment correct against edge cases and optimize their solution and performance score.
take home tests are often laudedfortheirrealistictasksettings andcompaniesimplementing similar practices are praised for hiring without whiteboards however common complaintsfromcandidatesinclude the longer time commitment required and interviewers are unable to assess communication skills via think aloud.
further quizzes remove interactionsbetweeninterviewersandintervieweeswhileassessing candidates knowledge and abilities in unrealistic software engineeringenvironments.asynchronous technicalinterviewsoffera mechanism for candidates to demonstrate their problem solving andcommunicationskillswithin ashortertime period.
