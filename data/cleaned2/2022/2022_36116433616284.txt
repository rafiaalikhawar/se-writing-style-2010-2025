these systems allow users to customize their functionality by choosing different con f igurations of options.
however this f lexibility also poses challenges forsoftware testing as the number of possiblecon f igurationscangrowexponentiallywiththenumberof options.
in practice many real world highly con f igurable systems provide users with thousands of options to con f igure .
givenahighlycon f igurable systemwith1 000options where each option has possible values there could be 21000possible con f igurations which is a huge number to test.
hence in practice testing allpossible con f igurationsisusually infeasible.
combinatorialinteractiontesting cit isapracticalandeffectivemethodforidentifyingfaultsinhighlycon f igurablesystems .
citinvolvesconstructing atestsuite i.e.
asetof con f igurations of a reasonable size and then using it to detect faults triggered by interactions of any u1d461options where u1d461is the testing strength .
in particular pairwise testing i.e.
cit with u1d461 is the most common cit technique which is less costly than cit with larger u1d461values while still preserving high fault detecting ability in practice .
for a con f igurable system apairwisetuplerepresentstheinteractionoftwooptions andpairwisetestingaimstobuildapairwisecoveringarray pca ofthe givensystem whichisatestsuitecoveringallpairwisetuples.itis crucial to use small sized pcas in real world applications so that a large amount oftestingeffortcould be saved.
esec fse december3 san francisco ca usa qiyuan zhao chuan luo shaoweicai weiwu jinkunlin hongyu zhang andchunminghu in most real world scenarios there are also constraints e.g.
mutual dependencies and exclusiveness over con f igurable options.
testcases i.e.
con f igurations inapcamustsatisfyallconstraints to guarantee the efficiency and accuracy of testing .
this requirement gives rise to the pairwise covering array generation pcag problem which aims to generate a minimum sized pca that satis f ies all constraints and remains a challenging problem in pairwise testing.
actually highly con f igurable systems correspond tolarge scaleinstancesofthepcagproblem.sincethepcagproblem is recognized as a hard combinatorial optimization problem it is challenging to solve the pcag problem for highly con f igurable systems whichurgentlycalls for practical solutions.

constraint encoding algorithms e.g.

and meta heuristic algorithms e.g.
.although constraint encoding algorithms can generate pcas for small scale pcaginstances theycannot handlelarge scaleinstances.
greedy algorithms can efficiently generate pcas for medium scale pcag instances butthegenerated pcasareusuallyoflargesizes.thus greedy algorithms are impractical in those application scenarios with limited testing budget.
compared to constraint encoding and greedy algorithms meta heuristic algorithms can generate smallersizedpcas atthe expenseoflong executiontime.
however existingpcagalgorithmssufferfromtheseverescalabilitychallenge .whenhandlinghighlycon f igurablesystemswiththousands of options a recent study demonstrates that these pcag algorithms require a fairly long timeto generatelarge sized pcas i.e.

is activated to construct an initial pca in a short time.
then the optimization phase begins where the initial pca gets compacted i.e.
its size gets reduced .

in this work we propose campactor a novel and effective local searchalgorithmdedicatedforcompactingpcasintheoptimization phase.
campactor adopts a two mode local search framework to optimize the sizes of input pcas iteratively and works between theexploitationmodeandtheexplorationmode.intheexploitation mode campactor conducts optimization to search for a smallersized pca while in the exploration mode campactor tends to explore promising search space.
given a pca of size u1d706 campactor attempts to f ind a pca of size u1d706 .

furthermore thepcaginstancesadoptedinthisworkareofbinaryscenario and all of them are transformed from the general scenario and encoded frompractical highlycon f igurablesystems.hence itiscrucialto study the binary scenario inpcag solving.
.
boolean formulae followingrecentwork inthisworkhighly con f igurable systems are modeled as boolean formulae whose necessary notations are introducedas follows.
boolean variables are atoms of boolean formulae.
for a boolean variable u1d465 aliteralof u1d465iseither u1d465itselforitsnegation u1d465.aboolean formulacanbeexpressedin conjunctivenormalform cnf i.e.
a conjunction of clauses where a clauseis a disjunction of literals.
for a formula u1d439in cnf we use v f andc f to denote the set of allboolean variables andthe setofallclauses in u1d439 respectively.
givenabooleanvariable u1d465 u1d456 itsvalue u1d463 u1d456iseither0or1.thevalues of literals u1d465 u1d456and u1d465 u1d456are u1d463 u1d456and1 u1d463 u1d456 respectively.
an assignment of a formula u1d439is a mapping u1d6fc u1d449 u1d439 which assigns aboolean value to each variable.
given an assignment u1d6fc a clause u1d450issatis f iedif at least one literal in u1d450evaluates to be under u1d6fc otherwise u1d450isunsatis f ied .
given an assignment u1d6fc if all clauses are satis f ied under u1d6fc then u1d6fcis asolution i.e.
a satisfying assignment otherwise u1d6fcisan unsatisfying assignment.
givenansut u1d446 u1d442 u1d43b wecantransform u1d446intoaformula u1d439in cnf such that u1d442and u1d43bcorrespond to v f andc f respectively.
throughthisway avalid testcaseof u1d446isindeedasolution i.e.
a satisfyingassignment of u1d439 andapairwisetupleof u1d446isasetoftwo literalsof u1d439 e.g.
thepairwisetuple u1d45c1 u1d45c2 correspondsto the setoftwoliterals u1d4651 u1d4652 .
given an sut u1d446and its corresponding formula u1d439 the pcag problemaimsto f indasetof u1d439 ssolutionssuchthatallvalidpairwise tuples of u1d446are covered.
in fact seeking one solution for a formula in cnf is known as the in f luential propositional satis f iablity sat problem which is a challenging problem in theory.
hence tosolvethepcagproblemeffectively apracticalsatsolver isindispensable.
a recently proposed sat algorithm dubbed contextsat showsitshighperformanceineffectivelygeneratingvalidtestcases forhighlycon f igurablesystems.

in this work the variable order of contextsat is the one determined by minisat .
in this setting contextsat targets to seek a solution of u1d439 which is similar to u1d6fc i.e.
many variables take the same values in contextsat s solution and u1d6fc and guarantees that all literals in u1d43fevaluate to be .
we use contextsat u1d439 u1d43f u1d6fc todenote contextsat soutputsolution.particularly givenavalidpairwisetuple u1d70f contextsat u1d439 u1d70f u1d6fc denotesa satisfyingassignment of u1d439that covers u1d70fandissimilar to u1d6fc.
local searchpcag algorithms in thissection we describethegeneral frameworkoflocal search pcag algorithms anddiscuss their limitations.

state of the artlocalsearchpcagalgorithms e.g.
autoccag fastcaandtca consistoftwophases i.e.
initializationphaseand optimizationphase.intheinitializationphase anefficientpcag algorithm is activated e.g.
to construct an initial pca.
then local search switches to the optimization phase that takes the initial pca as inputand optimizes the input pca i.e.
reduces the size ofpca .

.
limitationsofexistinglocalsearch as introduced in section existing pcag algorithms including local search ones suffer from the severe scalability challenge.
in particular when dealing with highly con f igurable systems with thousandsofoptions arecentempiricalstudypresentsthatexisting state of the art local search algorithms fail to generate pcas of small sizes .
hence before introducing campactor we identify twoissuesthatmakeexistinglocalsearchalgorithmssufferfrom the scalability challenge anddiscuss theirpossible solutions.
.
.
cyclingissue.
inthecontextoflocalsearchforcombinatorial optimizationproblems the cyclingissue referringto the circumstance where local search stagnates in a local part of search space isamajorweaknessoflocalsearch andseverelydegrades the performance oflocal search .
to handle the cycling issue it is advisable to equip local search witheffectiveforbiddenmechanisms.actually state of the artlocal search pcag algorithms adopt the well known forbiddenmechanism i.e.
cell leveltabumechanism tohandlethecyclingissue.inparticular thecell leveltabumechanism 1in thiswork performing oneoperationon u1d434meansmodifyinganassignment u1d6fc u1d434 viachanging the values of cells in u1d6fc.prohibitssuchoperationsaimingtomodifycellswhosevalueshave been changed recently .
when solving large scale pcag instances since there are a large number of candidate operations suchcell leveltabumechanismcanonlyprohibitfewofthem so itsforbiddenstrengthisrelativelyweak.however itisknownthat for a forbidden mechanism weak forbidden strength i.e.
only few operationsareimpermissible wouldstillmakelocalsearchsuffer from the cycling issue .
unfortunately in the context of pcagsolving littleattentionhasbeenpaidonenhancingforbidden strategies.
thus an effective solution to the cycling issue is to strengthenforbidden mechanisms.
.
.
hinderingissue.

however recent studies presentthat practical suts have many constraintsoveroptions e.g.

4our proposed campactor algorithm in thissection we propose campactor a novel and effective local searchalgorithm for reducing the size of given pca.
.
overalldesign of campactor based on the general framework of local search pcag algorithms outlinedinalgorithm wepropose campactor thatisdedicatedto reducingthesizeofthegivenpca.theoveralldesignof campactor ispresentedinalgorithm .campactor requirestwoinputs a u1d439 a boolean formula in cnf that is transformed from an sut and b u1d434 the initial pca of u1d439generated in the initialization phase.
the outputof campactor is u1d434 an optimizedpca of u1d439.
accordingtothegeneralframeworkinalgorithm thereare three essential components a the termination criterion b the strategy to select the assignment to be removed from u1d434when u1d434is a pca and c the mechanism to determine what operation to be performed on u1d434.
we specify and introduce these components in campactor as follows.

removalstrategy.
beforedescribingtheremovalstrategy we f irstde f inethe lossofassignment akeyconceptin campactor .for a pca u1d434 the loss of anassignment u1d6fc u1d434is the numberof covered pairwisetuplesthatwouldbecomeuncovered i.e.
theincrement of u a if u1d6fcisremovedfrom u1d434.
intuitively inthesearchprocess ifthere existmoreuncovered tuples thenmoreoperationsneedtobeperformedon u1d434tomake u1d434 becomeapca.hence campactor adoptsagreedyremovalstrategy whichworksasfollows once u1d434becomesapca campactor selectsthe assignment u1d6fc u1d434with the smallest loss to be removed from u1d434 line6inalgorithm .
.
.
operation determination method.
the operation determination method is the most important component in campactor since itdirectlyguides campactor ssearchdirectionandthusitseffectivenessgreatlyaffectsthesizeofoutputpca.infact two mode localsearchalgorithms whichworkbetweentheexploitationmode andtheexplorationmode haveachievedgreatsuccessinsolving various combinatorial optimization problems .
therefore campactor follows the two mode design.
generally in the exploitation mode local search tends to optimize the objective while in the exploration mode local search targets to diversify thesearch direction.
more precisely intheexploitation mode campactor prefers to conduct those operations that can reduce the number of uncovered pairwise tuples i.e.
trying to make u1d434become a pca lines 18in algorithm .
in the exploration mode campactor aimstoperformsuchoperationsthatcanbetterexplore the promising search space lines 25in algorithm .
in this way campactor canachieve agood balance between exploitation and exploration.
the technical details of both exploitation mode andexplorationmode are describedinthe following subsections.
.
exploitationmode asaforementioned intheexploitation mode campactor conducts operations to reduce the number of uncovered pairwise tuples i.e.
decreasing u a .
it is advisable to design the exploitation mode asfollows f irst anuncoveredpairwisetuple u1d70f u a israndomly selected and then an operation which modi f ies an assignment u1d6fc u1d434toanothervalidassignment u1d6fc thatcovers u1d70f isperformed.
thus inthisworkanoperationcanbe expressedbya combination of two assignments u1d6fc u1d6fc which means modifying u1d6fcto u1d6fc in u1d434.
based on this design at least one uncovered tuple i.e.
u1d70f is ensuredtobecovered soitispossiblethat u a i.e.
thenumber ofuncoveredpairwisetuples could be reduced.
since there usually exist more than one candidate operation covering u1d70f itisnecessarytoutilizeametrictoassessthebene f itof anoperation suchthatthebestcandidateoperationcanbeselected.

assignment level forbidden mechanism.
it is recognized that the cycling issue greatlydegrades the performance of local search andadoptingforbiddenstrategiescanreducethenegativeconsequence.infact existingstate of the artpcagalgorithms adoptacell leveltabumechanism whichpreventsmodifyingseveralcellsthathavebeenchangedrecently.asdiscussed in section .

85esec fse december3 san francisco ca usa qiyuan zhao chuan luo shaoweicai weiwu jinkunlin hongyu zhang andchunminghu forcampactor we propose a novel assignment level forbiddenmechanismwithstrongforbiddenstrength.beforeintroducing our new forbidden mechanism we de f ine an important notion i.e.
the age of assignment.
given an assignment u1d6fc u1d434 the age of u1d6fc denoted by age u1d6fc is the number of search steps that have been conducted since the last modi f ication of u1d6fc.
particularly our assignment level forbidden mechanism is designed to strictly prohibit such an operation which aims to modify an assignment u1d6fcthat has been changed in the last u1d6ffsearch steps i.e.
u1d44e u1d454 u1d452 u1d6fc u1d6ff where u1d6ffisapositiveinteger.followingournewforbidden mechanism once the uncovered pairwise tuple u1d70f u a is selected campactor constructsacandidateset u1d445ofoperationsas u1d445 u1d6fc u1d6fc u1d70f u1d6fc u1d434 age u1d6fc u1d6ff u1d6fc u1d70fisvalid recalling that theoperator isde f inedinsection .
and u1d6fc u1d70fcanbeunderstood as an assignment that overrides u1d6fcby u1d70f.
thencampactor adopts agreedyoperationdeterminationmethod afterthecandidateset u1d445is constructed campactor selects and performs the operation u1d6fc u1d6fc u1d70f withthe largestpro f it in u1d445.

in addition u1d6ffis a hyper parameter in campactor that controlstheforbiddenstrength anditseffectwillbeanalyzedin section6.

forced patching technique.
in fact the operation selected by our forbidden mechanism is a minor operation where an assignment u1d6fc is modi f ied to u1d6fc u1d70f.
however as described in section .
.
due to the existence of complex constraints the hindering issue frequently causes that no feasible minor operation can be performedtocovertheselected uncoveredpairwisetuple u1d70f which is a crucial problem that prevents existing local search pcag algorithmsfrombeingeffective.thus thecandidateset u1d445canbeempty as afrequent scenario.
once u1d445is empty a natural solution is to abandon covering u1d70f and instead to take a minor operation that does not violate any constraint soastocontinuethesearchprocess.thatis thenatural solutiondirectlyignoressuchcrucialprobleminthecurrentsearch step.
however since u1d70fcannot be covered by any minoroperation thesameproblemwouldthereforeoccurinsubsequentsearchsteps.
hence an advisable solution is to perform a major operation to make u1d434cover u1d70fbyforce.hereweneedtoaddressthecoretechnical challenge i.e.
how to f ind appropriate operations that cover u1d70fand meanwhilemake allconstraintssatis f ied.
to address this challenge we propose an effective forced patching technique which leverages the power of a sat solver since asatsolvercan f indasatisfyingassignmentthatcoversagiven pairwise tuple for a given formula.
as described in section .
contextsat is an effective sat solver also given a formula u1d439 incnf avalidpairwisetuple u1d70fandanassignment u1d6fcof u1d439asinputs contextsat canreturnasatisfyingassignmentof u1d439thatcovers u1d70f and is similar to u1d6fc denoted by contextsat u1d439 u1d70f u1d6fc .
since we aim to f indsuchoperationsthatmodifyanassignment u1d6fc u1d434tocover u1d70f andmeanwhiletosatisfyallconstraintsappearingin u1d439 anadvisable solution isas follows for eachassignment u1d6fc u1d434withage u1d6fc u1d6ff acandidateoperation u1d6fc contextsat u1d439 u1d70f u1d6fc canbeconstructed.actually apartfrommaking u1d434cover u1d70f anotherimportantobjective istomake u1d434covermorepairwisetuples.thankstotheproperty that both assignments u1d6fcandcontextsat u1d439 u1d70f u1d6fc are similar it is clear that many pairwise tuples exclusively covered by u1d6fccan be preservedifthe operation u1d6fc contextsat u1d439 u1d70f u1d6fc is performed.in a nutshell we can construct a candidate set u1d440of major operations i.e.
u1d440 u1d6fc contextsat u1d439 u1d70f u1d6fc u1d6fc u1d434 age u1d6fc u1d6ff .
once the candidate set u1d440of major operations is constructed from the candidate set u1d440 campactor selects and performs the bestoperation u1d6fc contextsat u1d439 u1d70f u1d6fc with the largestpro f it.it is clear that activating the forced patching technique would call thecontextsat solver multiple times.
since calling contextsat requires a certain amount of computation time in order to keep theefficiencyof campactor we activatetheforced patchingtechnique with a f ixed probability u1d713.
that is with a f ixed probability u1d713 campactor callstheforcedpatchingtechnique otherwise i.e.
with a probability u1d713 campactor works in the exploration mode which will be introducedin the nextsubsection.here u1d713isa realvaluedhyper parameterof campactor anditsvaluedomainranges from0to .since u1d713plays a key roleinbalancing theeffectiveness andefficiencyof campactor itseffectwillbestudiedinsection .
.
.
exploration mode it is clear that the exploitation mode of campactor aims to modify the test suite u1d434in a greedy manner.
however existing studies presentthatonlyadoptinggreedystrategiescouldmakelocalsearch get stuck in a small part of search space .
thus it is desirable to incorporateexplorationmode intolocal search.
the task of campactor s exploration mode is to explore the promising part of search space.
also in the context of local search for solving combinatorial optimization problems applying randomizedstrategiesintheexplorationmodecanhelplocalsearch better explore promising search space .
based on thisdesign intheexplorationmode campactor worksasfollows.
campactor tries to traverse all cells of u1d434with a random order.
for eachcell u1d452of u1d434 campactor selectstheassignment u1d6fcwherecell u1d452 locates andtriestomodifycell u1d452in u1d6fc resultinginanewassignment u1d6fc .
once u1d6fc is a satisfying assignment campactor performs the minoroperation u1d6fc u1d6fc on u1d434 andthenterminatesitsexploration mode.
through this way campactor is able to generally perform a random minoroperation.

setting of initialization algorithm according to section campactor aims to reduce the sizes of pcas.
hence a pcag algorithm is f irst used to initialize a pca as campactor s input then campactor isactivatedtooptimizesuchinitializedpca andthe output of campactor is reported as the f inal optimized pca.
since a recent study demonstrates that samplingca is able to generatesmaller sizedpcasthan autoccag fastcaandtca inthis workcampactor adoptssamplingca as its initialization algorithm.
for simplicity in our experiments we use campactor to directly represent campactor s instantiationthat generates its initial pca throughsamplingca .
in fact campactor treats the initialization algorithm as a black box so campactor is able to integrate any other pcag algorithms as its initialization algorithm.
to study thegenerality of campactor i.e.

threatsto validity there are twopotentialthreatsto validity ofthis work.
representativeness of adopted instances our evaluation adopts a diverse collection of public pcag instances where each instance is collected from a real world highly con f igurable system.accordingtosection .
theseadoptedinstancescovera broad range of numbers of options and constraints and they have been extensively studied in plenty of recent work .
therefore this threatcan be mitigated.
randomnessofcompetingapproachesinourexperiments there are pcag algorithms evaluated in our experiments i.e.
campactor samplingca autoccag fastcaandtca allofwhich are randomized algorithms.
for a randomized algorithm conducting one single run per instance might not precisely evaluate its performance.
following recent studies for each algorithm we perform independent runs per instance.
moreover as described in section .
we conduct the signi f icance test and calculate the effect size to examine the comparative results.

given a pcag instance constraint encoding pcag algorithms f irst encode itintoaninstanceofothercombinatorialoptimizationproblems and then existing optimization solvers are used to solve the encoded instance .
in practice constraint encoding algorithms can only generate pcas for small scale instances.
however they cannothandle large scale pcag instanceseffectively.
greedyalgorithms subdividedintoone test at a time otat and in parameter order ipo types are suited for medium scale instances but may generate large pcas which makes them not applicableinsuchapplicationscenarioswithlimitedtimebudget.
the otat category was pioneered by the aetgalgorithm while the ipo strategy was initially introduced by lei and tai .
both have numerous improved variants and are widely used includingthefamous actstoolthat has been widely utilizedinboth academiaandindustry .comparedtoconstraint encodingalgorithmsandgreedyalgorithms meta heuristic pcag algorithms can generate pcas of signi f icantly smaller sizesyet require much longerrunning time.

unfortunately existing pcag algorithms including thethree classes ofalgorithmsintroducedabove sufferfromtheseverescalability challenge whendealingwithhighlycon f igurablesystems with thousands of options existing pcag algorithms require much running time to construct large sized pcas which would maketestinghighlycon f igurablesystemsconsiderablyinefficient.
to alleviate the scalability challenge luo et al.proposed a stateof the art pcag algorithm dubbed samplingca which can generate pcas for large scale instances fast via effective sampling techniques.however samplingca doesnotexplicitlyincorporate anyoptimizationtechniquetoreducethesizeofitsgeneratedpca so the size can be further reduced.
this work proposes campactor whichcancompactpcasoflarge scaleinstancesintomuchsmallersizedefficientlyinexperimentalevaluationsandthereforewould nicely complement samplingca .
since constructing small sized pcas is important in practice we believe that the proposal of campactor can alleviate the scalability challenge more effectively andsigni f icantly advancethe state of the art inpcag solving.
