this search yielded candidate papers.

we analyzed the data extracted andidentifiedthe flawsdiscussedinthe nextsubsection.
to ensure the quality of our results we had multiple authors independently perform data extraction on a sample of papers.

this is usually because open source software has publicly available code documentation and complete evolutionhistory.unfortunately focusingononlyopen sourcesoftwaremaybeinconsistentwiththeinvestigator sgoal ultimately aidingsoftware engineeringpracticebeyondopen source.

mockus et al.

paulsonet al.

boulanger identified differences betweenthesoftwaredevelopmentpracticesfor open sourceand commercial software projects.
in open source software defects are usuallyreportedbycustomers unlikeincommercialsoftware.this could also affect the kinds of defects analyzed by failure studies.
as a result the results from these failure studies that studied opensourcesoftware maynot generalize to commercialenvironments.

.
miscellaneousflaws inadditiontotheprimaryflawsdiscussedabove we summarize three more issues.
inconsistent quality measures defect analysis is subjective and single author investigationmethodsareuntrustworthy.
of the papers reviewed only studies had multiple authors independently analyze the data.
hence the results of most studies are untrustworthywithoutthe use of quality controlmeasures.
absenceofreplicabilitydata only11papersincludedlinksto theirreplication package 3of thesewere inaccessible.

rao abbey vincent andjames c.davis missing tool support failure studies are time consuming and lacktoolsupport.leesatapornwongsa etal.
andshen etal.
reportedthatittookthem15and24monthstoconducttheirstudy.
yet according to the third row of table only of failure studies reported using any tool in their study.
these studies require investigators to analyze and categorize hundreds of defect reports manually.whenstudyingaspecificclassofdefects theseinvestigatorsrelyononlykeywordmatchingtofilterprospectivedefect reports and need to go through each filtered report to identify and remove false positives.
mazuera rozo et al.
identified commits using keyword matching and after manual analysis by twoauthors only commits were true positives.
a research agenda .
defect causal chains to effectively identify the root causes of defects as discussed in 3. .
we suggest investigators use additional sources that provide more information about the causal chain of the defect.
it is uncertainifanalysisofpullrequestcomments meetinglogs design documents or other artifacts will be helpful.
still these documents canprovidemoreinsightsintothereasonbehindthecodeswritten by the developers.
the research community can conduct further researchtodeterminewhichartifactswouldbemorehelpfuland howinvestigatorscanadequatelyanalyzethemtoidentifytheroot causes ofdefects.
in addition software engineers have no standard approach to documenting design or implementation decisions or efforts.
while standardssuchasiso iec iee12207requiredetaileddocumentation by the software engineers agile methodologies recommend less comprehensive documentation.
hence this presents anotherchallengeasthereisnoguaranteethatthesedocuments will be available for analysis.
the research results can also inform engineering teams what documentation needs to be maintained if they want to learn from theirfailures.
.2standardizingtheconductoffailurestudies as we discussed in .
.
there are inconsistencies in the conduct of failure studies.
we suggest two ways to standardize the conductofthesestudies.first addastandardforfailureanalysis tothesigsoftempiricalstandards tonotethequalitymeasures replication packages and expected general guidelines for conducting a failure study.
second we suggest the development of a defect type taxonomy map for software defects similar to the commonweaknessenumeration cwe usedforcategorizingsecurity vulnerabilities.
such a map would contain a taxonomy of commondefecttypes.itcanbeextensiblethatinvestigatorsconducting failure studies for a specific system or defect classes can builduponexistingtaxonomieswithdefecttypecategoriesparticulartotheclassofsystembeinginvestigatedratherthaninventinga newtaxonomy.thismapwouldensurethattheresultsofallfailure studiesarecomparable whichwillimprovethe generalizabilityof researchinfluencedbythe results.

.
weproposeincreasedresearch emphasis on replicability studies to verify if failure studies conducted on open source software also hold for commercial software.
wealsosuggestincreasedcollaborationbetweeninvestigatorsof failure studies and software engineering companies which would provide these investigators access to defect reports of commercial software.
this collaboration would ensure that failure studies resultsinfluence research which wouldalsoberelevant topractitioners inthesecompanies.

.
toolsupport forfaster defect analysis withthechallengeofmissingtool supportdiscussedin .
.
we recommend the research and development of tools that would aid theconductofthesestudies.naturallanguageprocessing nlp techniques have become increasingly helpful in understanding the semantic meaning of documents summarizing and extracting usefulinformationfromdocuments.theyhavesuccessfullybeenused toidentifydefectsinrequirementdocuments identifyduplicatedefectreports extracttasksanduserstoriesfromappstore reviews and summarize defect reports .

conclusion inthispaper wereflectontheconductoffailurestudiesinsoftware engineering by surveying published failure study papers.
we identified eight recurring flaws that have marred the conduct of failure studies.
these flaws impede the correctness reliability and impact ofthe reportedresults of thesestudies.
motivated by these challenges we identify various ways the researchcommunitycansupporttheconductofthesefailurestudies.
