we analyzed the interviews using thematic analysis .
the interview data consisted of about hours of recordings and notes taken during the interviews.

the lead author discussed the emerging codes with the study team members over multiple passes and revised the codes merging overlapping codes and re f ining the coding to yield a set of f inal codes.
the f inal codes were then categorized into themes using affinity diagramming .

developers rarely have the time to provide such additional signals and even if they do assessing whether the bot saved the developer s time in software development is difficult because of several confounding factors.
developers ofthe bot threatmodelquality mention p10 we do not have a way to tell if developers f ind value in our recommendations.
developers do not reply to each recommendation s feedback template so we are leftwithusing proxymetrics forassessingvalue.
o2 assessing clarity of bot recommendations many bots that f lag issuesin pull requestsalso provide the next steps tohelp usersresolve the issue e.g.
highlightinglinesincode that violate con f igurations or security policies .
bot developers struggled to improvetheclarityofthebotrecommendationsduetothelackofa structured method to assess the feedback of bot users coming from thebotrecommendationchannel.forexample securitybotsuse codestodenotesecurityvulnerabilities e.g.

we address each feedback one by one and the process is cumbersome.
o3tunebotthresholds twobots cloudprotect and codeinsights have the functionality to con f igure the type and threshold of recommendations that they surface to bot users.

to quantify developer engagement we examined the unique numberof developers whoreplytothe botrecommendations.we calculate the mean developer replies per bot category which representstheaveragenumberofrepliesreceivedbybotsinagiven category within a repository.
figure 5bdisplays the distribution of mean developer replies per bot category across all repositories.
bot categories with higher engagement should exhibit a higher overall mean number of replies for repositories.

to test if this effect is signi f icant we conducted oneway anovas.
because our data was not normally distributed we performed align rank transform art before running the anovas and performed post hoc pairwise analysis using artc with holm bonferroni correction.
