estimating the impact of tweets on open source project popularity and new contributors hongbo fang hemank lamba james herbsleb bogdan vasilescu carnegie mellon university usa hongbofa hlamba jdh bogdanv cs.cmu.edu abstract twitter is widely used by software developers.
but how e ective are tweets at promoting open source projects?
how could one use twitter to increase a project s popularity or attract new contributors?
in this paper we report on a mixed methods empirical study of tweets containing links to open source github repositories looking for evidence of causal e ects of these tweets on the projects attracting new github stars and contributors as well as characterizing the high impact tweets the people likely being attracted by them and how they di er from contributors attracted otherwise.
among others we find that tweets have a statistically significant and practically sizable e ect on obtaining new stars and a small average e ect on attracting new contributors.
the popularity content of the tweet as well as the identity of tweet authors all a ect the scale of the attraction e ect.
in addition our qualitative analysis suggests that forming an active twitter community for an open source project plays an important role in attracting new committers via tweets.
we also report that developers who are new to github or have a long history of twitter usage but few tweets posted are most likely to be attracted as contributors to the repositories mentioned by tweets.
our work contributes to the literature on open source sustainability.

introduction in open source software oss development attention can be a double edged sword.
sometimes oss projects receive too much attention and maintainers have to deal with overwhelming volumes of requests and demands from users in these cases maintainers might rather fend o new attention coming their way.
other times even successful oss projects are unable to attract more than a few contributors and occasionally oss projects are maintained by no one at all in these cases more sustained involvement from users and contributors would be welcome.
yet for many oss projects gaining attention from the community e.g.
to increase adoption and attract more contributors remains a challenge.

mechanisms through which oss projects can gain attention and attract new contributors have been studied in the past.
the literature is especially rich in recent years inthecontextofsocialcodingplatformslikegithub becauseof thehigh levelof transparencyand manyopportunities forproject maintainersto signal explicitlyandimplicitly abouttheirwork .
for example prior studies of oss projects hosted on github have foundthathowprojectsorganizetheirrepositoryhomepagesand readmefiles whetherprojectsget featuredbythehosting platform whether projects have public releases and how maintainers use prominent repository badges to indicate less observableprojectqualities allhaveanimpactonhowtheproject isperceivedbyitsaudienceandeventheactionsthatsomeaudience members take e.g.
joining the project.
however prior work has by and large focused only on endogenousor in network attention eliciting mechanisms i.e.
taking actions or displaying signals afforded by the code hosting platform itself.thisleavesanimportantgap littleisknownaboutattention eliciting mechanisms that can be considered exogenous from the perspectiveofossprojectshostedongithuborsimilarplatforms.
here we focus on one such mechanism social media.
social media platforms widely used by software developers enable oss maintainers to share their work with a potentially larger audience thatexists beyond their immediate connections on any code hosting platform e.g.
social media posts about an oss project may be amplified by the authors social networks influential social media users or the platform itself.
social media platforms also tend to havelowbarriertoparticipationandhighviewership whichmakes them actionable and potentially impactful for oss maintainers admirers andevangelistslookingtoattractattentiontoprojectsin need.
a better understanding of the effectiveness of using social media to attract attentionto oss projects coulddirectly impact the projects success and sustainability.
yet little is known about how much social media activity can contributetoosssustainability ifatall.theevidencefromother contexts suggests that actions taken on social media platforms can have spillover out of network effects e.g.
researchers have found that tweets can predict movie ratings and increase citations to academicpapers .cansimilareffects be expected for oss?
to address this gap in this paper we compile a large dataset of tweets containing links to open source github repositories 1spanning6monthsofhistory andwithcross linksbetween user profiles on both platforms.
we then apply statistical causalinference techniques to a estimate the causal effect of tweets onthenumberofnewgithubrepositorystarsandnewcommitters b characterize the tweets with the highest impact and c characterizethe osscontributorsattracted by these tweets.

and even though oss as a whole plays important infrastructure roles in our digital economy oss maintainers ability to attract onboard and retain contributors has generally not kept up with this success.
for example prior work describes how many popular oss projects are maintained by only oneortwodevelopers howprojectnewcomersface a swath of barriers that hinder their first contributions and how many of these newcomer barriers are accentuated by gender whichfurtherreducestheavailablecontributorpool.
researchers have also found that high turnover in oss projects can have negative effects including knowledge loss longer timetofixissues anddecreasedsoftwarequality .more generally researchershavestudiedtheinternalandexternalfactors that contribute to the oss projects risk of becoming dormant inactive unmaintained or abandoned .

this can cause the oss projects to face an attention shock with notable effects including a surge in new contributors.
within their control maintainers can also actively promote their projects.

focusing on github the most popular platform for hosting oss development we expect that tweets mentioningossprojectscouldexpandtheprojects audienceandreach beyondwhattheyalreadyhaveongithubthroughtheirwatchers orthroughtheirmaintainers directfollowers .we seek to estimate how much of this extended audience if any such tweets are able to attract and convert into stargazers or project contributors bothoutcomeswhichcandriveprojectsuccessand sustainability as discussed above.

content suggested by the platform based on a variety of signals e.g.
whethersomeoneonefollowshasinteractedwiththatcontent.
in addition one s level of engagement with social media attention span and ability to absorb a typically overwhelming volume of content are all very limited.
it follows that in order to even stand a chance at being effective tweets mentioning open source projects should at the very least be noticed.
this may depend on many factors includingtheircontentandvirality andtheirauthors twitter network span.
for instance popular tweets on twitter are liked by many and may have stronger promotional effects and tweets with certain hashtags of different lengths and with different types of content may also have different effects.
it is important to understand the characteristics of successful tweets if this oss project promotional mechanism is to be used effectively.
we ask rq2.howdoestheimpactoftweetsmentioningopen source projects vary with different tweet characteristics?
finally weseektobetterunderstand whoisbeingattractedby these tweets.
knowing what type of audience and contributors can be attracted via twitter is important for developers decision to tweetornot.priorsocialconnectionsareknowntoimpactdeveloper engagement and retention in open source.
twitter offersanadditionalmodalityfordeveloperstosocializeandform connections.
in turn these connections may help explain developers engagement with the open source projects they discovered via twitter e.g.
they may motivate people to contribute more and for a longer period.
by cross linking user accounts across the two platforms github and twitter we can investigate the characteristics of the users who were likely attracted by the tweets mentioning githubrepositories bothrelativetootherusersontwitterwho werelikelyexposedtothosesametweets aswellastoothergithub contributorsto those same projects.
in short we ask rq3.whatarethe characteristicsofthecontributorslikely attracted via tweets mentioning open source projects?
the followingsection gives anoverview of ourstudy design to answer these research questions.
study overview we designed and carried out a mixed methods empirical study analyzinganoveldatasetthatintegratesdataacrosstwitterand github.
starting from a set of tweets containing links to github repositories wecollectdataabouttwooutcomesofinterest projectpopularityasindicatedbythegrowthinthenumberofstarsand projectsuccessinattractingnewcontributorsasindicatedbythe growth in commit authors.
we also collect characteristics of those tweetsandtheirauthors includingthetweetauthors egonetworks.
finally weusepublicinformationtocross linkuseraccountsacross twitter and github and collect additional data about the tweet authors relationship to the repositories mentioned in their tweets.
at a high level figure our study consists of two main parts.
we give a brief overview here and discuss details below in section .
part diff in diff analysis of the causal impact of tweets rq1 rq2 .inthefirstpart we mimicanexperimentalresearchdesign usingtheobservationaldatawecollected bymodelingthedifferentialeffectofaninterventionona treatmentgroup versusa control group in a naturalexperiment .

consider project popularity one of our two main outcomes of interest as an example.
while we expect that twitter mentionsmay helpincreasethe number of github starsprojects receiveonaverage suchanincreasingstarcounttrendmayhave alreadystarted beforethetwittermentions andfordifferentreasons.

one of the tweets mentioning the repository shortly thereafter o8 in the appendix offersaclueastowhy suggestingapossiblein personeventwhere therepositoryfirststartedbeingpromoted.therefore wearenot sure if it is the event itself that causedthe increase in stars or if those tweets also played a role in the star increase.
similarly as discussed above being featured on the github trendingpage or mentioned on platforms like reddit medium and hacker news mayhave also causedthe observed increase in stars.
tobeabletomakecausalinferences thekeyideabehindourdesign is to compare not the historical changes in outcome measures before and after the intervention among mentioned repositories butratherthe difference inthesechangesbetweenagroupoftreated mentioned repositoriesandacarefullyselectedgroupofuntreated 2118icse may21 pittsburgh p a usa hongbo fang hemank lamba james herbsleb bogdan vasilescu repositories that acts as a control.

under this assumption the difference between the observed outcome and the normal outcome i.e.
the difference that would still exist if neither group experienced the treatment given the same trendovertimeinbothgroups canbeseenasthetrueeffectofthe tweets assuming there were no concurrent treatments.

we use the former analysis to address rq1.
to address rq2 we include relevant tweet characteristics as predictors in the same diff in diffmodel which allows us to estimate their effects.

however these tweets are only from a subset of the 427developersincross linkedgithub twitterpublic dataset westartedfrom whilepotentiallymanyotherpeoplecouldhave tweetedaboutthosesamerepositories theirtweetswouldgoundetectediftheywerenotpartofthecross linkeddatasetwestarted from.

aggregating tweets into bursts twitter mentions of github repositories may occur closely together in time as part of coordinated or coincidental burstsof social media activity.
taking the example in figure note how eight tweets by different authors o1 o8 and many retweets of these all mentioning the same repository occurred within a short period.
in this case it is unclear how to reason about which tweet caused a possible increase in github stars shortly thereafter it couldbeanysubsetofthosetweets.ratherthanreasoningabout tweets separately we therefore first aggregate tweets into bursts and then reason about the effect if any of a burst as a whole.
there are two important operationalization decisions here.
first isidentifyingthestartandendofaburst topleftinfigure3 .tothis end wedefinedahyper parameter xrepresentingthemaximum allowable time gap measured in days between any consecutive two tweets or retweets mentioning a given repository before they are considered to be part of different bursts.
second is dealing with neighboring bursts bottom left in figure .
it may take some time before the effects of a burst if any become visible.
during this time it is possible for another burst mentioningthesamerepositorytohavestarted creatingambiguity about which burst caused those effects.
to avoid this we define a hyper parameter yrepresenting the observable effects period aftertheendofaburst andconservativelydiscardallburststhat are tooclose toneighboringbursts i.e.
ifthereisanotherburstmentioning the same repository either started less than ydays aftertheend orendedlessthan ydaysbeforethestartofthisburst.
this decision has implications also for the control group repositories more details about how we identified them below .
a key assumption behind our diff in diff causal inference analysis is that the repositories acting as controls have not been treated i.e.
mentionedintwitterbursts aroundthesametime.thisimpliesthat wenecessarilyalsorequirethatapotentialburstmentioningacontrolgrouprepositorymustnothavestartedlessthan ydaysafter the end of a burst mentioning the corresponding treatment group repository right side of figure .
our results below are computed with x andy days.
we performed sensitivity analyses for x y and found the conclusions after regression analysis to be consistent.
given the chosen values our resulting dataset contains bursts in total 975originaltweetsand28 569retweets mentioning2 unique repositories.
.
compilinga control group asdiscussedinsection4 totestthecausalrelationshipbetween tweetsmentioninggithubrepositoriesandthenumberofgithub stars and the number of new committers we adopt a diff in diff design .
specifically we consider a burst of tweets mentioning a particulargithubrepositoryasan intervention andcontrastthe change in the two outcome variables post intervention between the treated repositories and an appropriate control group.
to compile our control group we adopt a stacked diff in diff design i.e.
we identify suitable control group repositories alsofromamongthesetofrepositoriesmentionedintweets .thisis possiblebecauseevenifallrepositoriesconsideredarementionedin atleastonetwitterburst theyarenotallmentionedatthesametime thus for any repository treated at time t other repositories treated atdifferenttimescanserveascontrolsfortime t.thisapproachhas severaladvantages includinganimplicitwaytocontrolforsome confounding factors potential ways in which the repositories ever mentionedintweetsaredifferentfromthosenevermentioned and computational efficiency some variables that need to be computed for thecontrol group will have been computed anyway .
specifically we use propensity score matching to sample as controls for every treated repository up to five other repositories that were not mentioned in tweets around the same time 5but which show parallel trends in the outcome variables leading up to the intervention time compared to the treated repository.
we chose the ratio as opposed to to increase robustness in our statisticalconclusionswhilekeepingthemodelingsamplerelatively balanced.

identifyingcharacteristicsof developers likelyattracted by tweets rq3 for the second part of our study answering rq3 we focus on developersplacingtheirfirstcontributionstothedifferentgithub projects soon after the repositories were mentioned in tweets and whowere plausibly attracted by those tweets.
to better understand the underlying mechanisms we start by qualitatively studying the relationship between attracted developers and twitter authors.
for every repository and tweet burst we extract the authors of commits recorded in the main branch within30daysoftheendoftheburst thathadnotcommittedto the projectbefore bothdirect pushcommits andindirect merged pull request commits are captured this way.
we then label those newcommittersas likelyattractedbytweets ifthey i arepartof our twitter github cross linked dataset ii retweeted one of the tweetsmentioningthegithubrepositorywithin3daysafterthe tweet was posted and iii starred the mentioned repository in the sameperiod.retweetingensurestheuserisexposedtothetweet whilestarringtherepositoryafterthetweetincreasesthelikelihood thatthe committerwas attracted by the tweet.
with a set of such committers likely attracted by tweets and corresponding tweet authors who plausibly attracted them one author coded and analyzed all instances of twitter interaction and github activity between the tweet authors and attracted committers using thematic analysis.
this was an iterative process that involved discussing with another author the different codes and examples thereof resolving disagreements and recoding where needed.
in each case we coded on three dimensions i the frequencyanddirectionalityofpasttwitterinteractions ii theapparentintentofthecurrenttweetandinteraction iii thefrequencyof past github collaboration and each other s roles in the respective repositories.
the coded interaction is then used to infer the relationship between tweet authors and attracted committers and try to understand the reason developers are attracted.
following the qualitative analysis we estimate three regressions.
first we run alogistic regression model to compare developers whocontributedtothegithubprojectstootherswhodid not conditioning on both plausibly having been exposed to the tweets.
here we use past twitter interaction between the new committers and the tweet authors to identify users exposed to tweets asuserswithfrequentpastinteractionaremorelikelytobeexposed to tweetsposted by each other.6we define interactionas explicit mentioningthetweetauthorandweuseatleastthree past twitter interactions as the threshold of tweet exposure.
withtheoutcomevariablebeingwhethertheexposeddeveloper isattractedascommitter i.e.
madeafirstcommitwithin30days afterthe tweetburst githubcollaborationand otherdeveloperlevel co variates are included as independent variables and the estimated coefficient reflects the difference between developers attracted versus not.
because of the low number of committers attracted and high volume of exposed users we randomly downsampletheexposeduserstomakethedataframerelativelybalanced with respect to the outcome variable.
finally we estimate regression and survival models to test how the new committers likely attracted by tweets differ from other new contributors during the same period in terms of i their total numberof commits 30days aftertheirfirst contribution linear regression 7and ii their total length of engagement with the project cox proportional hazards regression we follow prior work to detect disengagement as the start of months of inactivity.

the effect of tweet likes is partially confirmed by model iiiand no effect is found for the number of retweets.
one possible explanation is that the relatively strong co linear relationship among thethreevariablesrelatedtoburstpopularity i.e.

discussion wenowsummarizeourmainresultsanddiscusstheirimplications.
twitter can be an effective mechanism to popularize open sourcesoftwareprojects.
ourstudyprovidesrobustempiricalevidencethattweetsmentioninggithubrepositorieslikely leadtoan increase in the repositories number of github stars beyond what can be explained by other observable promotional mechanisms such as being featured on the github trending page or otherwise online.theseresultssuggestthattwittercanbeausefultoolfor open source maintainers to promote projects and perhaps even betterthanotherpromotionalmechanisms sinceanyonecantweet at any time unlike e.g.
the github trending page which maintainershavenocontroloverandwhichrequirestheprojecttobe popular already before being featured.
2124icse may21 pittsburgh p a usa hongbo fang hemank lamba james herbsleb bogdan vasilescu not all tweets are created equal.
our models suggest that the popularizing effect of tweets varies with different tweet characteristics.first wefindthatthemoretweetsthereareinaburst the strongertheeffectofthatburstonincreasingaproject sstartcount.
this reflects intuitively the increased exposure andattention the repositories get when mentioned by multiple tweets around the same time.
however we find little evidence that the purpose of the tweets matters.
unlike prior work suggesting that tweets that point to issue discussions or pull requests when mentioning the githubrepositoriesmayhavelesspromotionaleffect wefindthat alltweetshelpattractattentiontotheprojectsimilarly irrespective ofintent andsomeofthisattentiontranslatesintonewgithub stars.
we do however find evidence that the effect varies with the tweet authors affiliation with the github projects tweets by existing project contributors or maintainers i.e.
project insiders areseeminglylessimpactfulthantweetsbyothers.onepossible explanation is that tweets from project insiders may be considered less objective self promotion and may not be taken to reflect the truevalueorqualityoftheproject.anotherpossibleexplanation isthattweetspostedbyothersmaybringthisprojecttoadifferent wideraudience comparedtotweetsfromprojectinsiderswhose twitterfollowersmayalreadyknowthisprojectwell.thisresult suggests that obtaining an endorsement from a trustworthy thirdpartyontwittermayfurtherbenefittheproject spopularity andit alsosuggeststheimportancetopromoteoutside one sown social circle.multipletweetsaboutarepositorybythesamesetofusers may have decreasing value to attract new stars because most of theiraudiencehave already considered the project before.
tweetscanhelptoattractnewcommitters butonlyunder certaincondition.
theeffectoftweetsmentioninggithubrepositories on attracting new contributors is weaker than for stars.
however it is still statistically significant and causalgiven our study design.
comparing the stars and committers models the latter indicate that more focused attention is needed.
in particular itseemsimportantthattweetsnotbegenericbutratherpointto specific repository elements typically specific issue or pull request discussions and that tweet bursts contain more original tweets than retweets to increase the magnitude of the effect.
communityengagementontwitterisimportant.
ourqualitative analysis revealed that of those repositories that do attract newcommitters manyofthemsucceededthroughthebondofa community or strong interpersonal connections.

socialconnectionscanbeleveragedforwork relatedtasks especially short term ones.
our models of how the new project contributors plausibly attracted by tweets differ from other contributors on average confirmed the importance of maintainingties with past collaborators on github and in addition the added valueoftwittersocialties.however comparingthemodelsofshort commitsinthefirst30days andlong termoutcomes lengthof engagementwiththeproject weseeweakeningimpactofthepast twitter connections long term.
this suggests that open source maintainersmaytapintotheirtwittersocialconnectionsforondemand perhaps for help with specific issues but that these resources are not necessarily sustainable.
attention can be a double edged sword.
the fact that tweets havestrongeffecttoattractuserattention butcomparativelylower numbers of new committers also raises concerns to developers tweetingaboutgithubrepositories.aswementionedinsection1 while using twitter as a promotion platform may increase the popularityofaproject itmayalsosimultaneouslybringaboutrequests and demands from new users without a proportional amount of contributioninput.
future research can further investigate other project outcomes that may be affected by increased attention such asthenumberofissuereports.developersshouldalsoconsiderthis factor when they decide to start a promotion campaign for their project on twitter.
theroleof twitter inopen source development.
comparing with developers who are not evidently attracted by tweets the plausibly attracted ones are relatively new to github and they don t post much on twitter.
we hypothesize that they are new developerslookingforopen sourceprojectstocontributetosothey maynot haveroutinecollaboratorsor theenergyand motivation to maintain a strong social media presence.
we argue that twitter is especially important for such developers since it provides them an opportunity to receive updates or information about github projects at a low cost.
twittercanbemoretightlyintegratedintocodehostingplatforms.githubisoneofthemostpopularplatformsforhosting open source repositories and it has various initiatives to promote projects e.g.
trending pages project spotlights which can lead to higher popularity of the promoted projects.
given that twitter seems to be a valuable exogenous attention eliciting platform we suggest that integrating twitter access into the code hosting platform could help with broadcasting information about those projects moreeffectively notethat githubrecently addedan explicittwitterfieldinuserprofilepagestoo8 .thiscouldbedone e.g.
byaddinga tweet buttononeachprojecthomepageandissue threadpage.providingreadyaccesstotwittercouldleadtoeasy immediate action for developers to promote their project.
this can alsobehelpfultoothernon developerusersoftheprojecttodiscuss issuesorpromoteacertainfeatureoftherepositorytotheirbroader social circle.
in addition to this keeping in mind the moderators of the effects of tweets we uncovered platforms could also provide tweet templates that can incorporate some of these suggestions as soon as a user tries to tweet from the project homepage.
diff in diff can be a useful design in software engineering research.
at a higher level we note that our causal inference researchdesign whilewell establishedinthesocialsciences has hardlyever beenusedin softwareengineeringresearch.
wehope 2125estimatingtheimpactof tweets on open source project popularity and new contributors icse may pittsburgh p a usa thatourcurrentworkwillmotivateempiricalsoftwareengineering researchers to consider this and similar causal inference designs more frequently in the future.
threats to validity despite our best efforts to carefully collect and analyze our data we acknowledge the existence of several limitations in our study.
first wehaveseveralmissingdataproblems.thesetoftweets wecollectedmentioningarepositorymaynotbecompletebecause of tweet deletion which we assume is insufficiently frequent to affect our results.
the commit and other activity data we extract fromghtorrentmayalsobeincomplete similarly weassumethat is sufficiently rare.
second the cross linked twitter and github user data may not bealwayscorrectandweexpectnoiseintroducedbecauseofpotentiallyinaccuratetwitter githubaccountmatching.similarly to fang et al .
we selected a random sample of twittergithub linked user pairs in our study where users were either tweet authors or committers likely attracted by or exposed to tweets for further inspection.
among these one pair had either their twitter orgithubaccountdeleted orinaccessible which left uswith99pairs.wethenmanuallyevaluatedtheaccuracyofthe matching by comparing the profile information and activity traces of both accounts.
among the pairs appear obviously correct .
obviously incorrect .
and we cannot confidently validate the accuracy of the remaining pairs .
given their public activity traces.
this puts the accuracy of the linked pairs on parwiththeonereported byfangetal.
andoverall high at least .
in the validation sample and likely higher.
conclusion in this paper we empirically demonstrated that mentioning opensourcegithubrepositoriesontwittercan leadtoanincreasein project popularity and help to attract new developers.
however themechanismisnotequallyeffectiveforthetwooutcomes while the effect of tweets on gaining new stars seems to apply to most repositoriesandkindsoftweets tweetingtoattractnewdevelopers is considerably less effective on average reflective of the relatively higher bar to placing a technical contribution in an open source project compared to simply expressing interest in the project by starringit.still weargue thereishopeforopen sourcemaintainers communitymanagers and evangelists since theeffectof tweeting on both outcomes is moderated by many factors within one s control .
weconclude optimistically thattweetingaboutopensourcecan contributeto improving open source sustainability.
