although such development model permits the emergence of enormousossservingawidespectrumofrequirements italsoposes challengesonthesustainabilityofoss.existingstudieshaveshown that oss are prone to sustainability failures which may impact a large number of downstream clients and cause severe losses.
one major challenge of oss sustainability is to attract and retaincapablenewcomers .successfulonboardingintooss projects can be very difficult especially for developers who are new to open source and for projects with a long developmenthistory .
to help newcomers become familiar with an oss project github provides a list of best practices such as providing readmes formulatingcontributionguidelines etc .evenif sufficient documentation is provided it is still very challenging for newcomers to locate suitable development tasks to start with .
for example not needed pull requests are among the most com mon cause for rejected code in oss projects because newcomers often submit superseded duplicated pull requests .
recently githubrecommendsproject maintainerstolabelissuesas good first issues gfis which is an explicit signal showing that this issue is suitable and welcome for newcomers to solve.
however severalrecentstudieshaveraisedalarmingconcerns aboutthecurrentgfimechanism .first manuallylabeled gfisareoftenhighlyinsufficient whichindicatesthatmany 1we use the term good first issue gfi and issues suitable for newcomers interchangeably throughout this paper.

second the cognitive mismatch between newcomers andveteranshinderstheeffectivenessofgfis whichindicates that labeling gfis can be a challenging task and existing labeled gfis may be inappropriate for newcomers.
to tackle the insufficiencyandinappropriatenessofcurrentgfis weenvisiontheuseof anautomatedapproachforgfirecommendation.suchanapproach cannotonlyeasetheburdenofmaintainersfromlabelinggfis but can also provide the most suitable task for newcomers so that they are more likely to succeed in making their initial contributions.
in this paper we propose recgfi a machine learning approach toward this vision.
recgfi learns from historical issues actually resolvedbynewcomersinsteadoflearningfromissueshavingagfi label astheselabelsarescarceandpotentiallyinappropriate .
foreachhistoricalissue recgfiextractsfeaturesfromheterogeneous sources of information including issue content background and dynamics.
recgfi further uses an xgboost classifier t o learn the difference between issues resolved by newcomers and non newcomers.
then for all open issues recgfi predicts their probability of beinggfis usingthe trainedmodeland returnsthe most probable gfis for human inspection.
newcomers can browse through the recommendations tofind suitable tasks while project maintainerscaninspectandconfirmtherecommendations e.g.
by adding labels with reduced manual effort.
to evaluate recgfi we collect issues from github projectsusing theghtorrent dataset dump and github rest api .
to simulate realistic scenarios and avoid leakage of future data we create two ground truth datasets by carefullyrestoringfeaturesfromtwotimepoints thetimewhen theissueiscreatedandthetimebeforetheissueisbeingworked on.ourperformanceevaluationshowsthatrecgficanachieveup to .
auc at 1st time point and up to .
auc at 2nd time point.recgfialsooutperforms otherbaseline approachesandalternativeswithlessfeatures.wefurtherinterpretthetrainedmodel using local interpretable model agnostic explanations lime and analyze statistics on the dataset to study characteristics of issues suitable for newcomers.
our analysis reveals that recgfi is more likely to predict an issue as a gfi if the reporter has just enough experience in commits and more experience in reportingissues experienced developersparticipate inthe issue e.g.
by adding labels etc and the project has an active owner andmorerecentlyonboardednewcomers.finally toevaluatethe practical usefulness of recgfi we collect latest issues from the github projects report issues without gfi signaling labels to project maintainers and monitor how these issues are resolved.
at the time of writing we receive response for issues and16areconfirmedasrealgfis.afterthe16issuesarelabeledas gfisbyprojectmaintainers threehavealreadybeenresolvedby a newcomer.
even for the issues denied by project maintainers twohavealsobeenresolvedbyanewcomer.weshareareplication package at .
the gfi recommendation problem .
problem in reality itiswell knownthatmakingthefirstcontributiontoanossproject is hard.
for example a newcomer recently complains that there s a lack of resources out there for someone who wants to get started contributing to open sourcemostly because they find it hard to make the first contribution and write the first piece of code.
onemajorreasonhinderingnewcomers contributiontoopensource is the lack of sufficient labeled gfis in most github oss projects.inasampleof105highlypopulargithubprojects only projects have gfis and only .
of all issues in the projects are labeled as gfis another study reports a median proportion of only for projects with labeled gfis .
the insufficiency of gfisisalreadypreventingnewcomersfromparticipatinginoss projects.
for example a newcomer complains on reddit that looking to contribute to open source but issues labeled good firstissue are all taken...i ve had a hard time finding issues that are good for beginners that aren t completely taken over already.
wealsoobservesimilarrequestsingithubissuesbecausethe newcomer cannot find any gfis i had gone through the whole project and i m really excited to contributetoitifisthereanygoodfirstissuesthenpleaseassignme.
the lack of labeled gfis in an oss project may harm its sustainabilityinthelongterm.however atypicalossprojectgenerally havehundredstothousandsofopenissuesandmaintainersmay lacktimetomanuallyevaluatewhethertheseissuesaregfis.for example netlify netlify cms has open issues at the time of writingbutonly97arelabeledasgfis.evenif netlify netlify cms alreadyhaveamuchhighergfiportioncomparedwiththemedian some real gfis may still be missed by maintainers and can not be discovered by newcomers.
for example the issue in figure1is actually suitable for newcomers but nobody has added any gfi signaling label.5in addition the manual labeling of gfis may be even challenging for project maintainers due to the cognitive mismatch between newcomers and veterans.
a well understood construct of the zone of proximal development describes the case where experts are usually not effective at training or teaching novices.thisobservationissupportedbydata .
ofgfisare notsolved bynewcomers and31.
ofnewcomers failtosolve a gfi even after several attempts .
in such scenarios an automated recommendation approach will beuseful newcomerscanbrowsethroughtherecommendations to find issuesto work on while projectmaintainers can check the recommendations and label them with much less effort.
in fact the issueinfigure 1isonlyaddedwithagfilabelafteritisdiscovered by our recgfi approach see section .
.
.
problem formulation given a list of open issues in a github project the goal of gfi recommendationis tofinda subsetof issuesthatare likelysuitable fornewcomers.therefore weformulatetheproblemtoberesolved as binary classification.
the objective is to utilize information of historicalissuestolearnamodel f andpredictwhetherangiven opensource project you like what contribute to open source but issues 5theissuecanbeaccessedat .in figure1 some information e.g.

the issue is suitable for newcomers because it is relatively simple has reproduction steps detailed screenshots and clear expectation of a resolution .
1831recommending good first issues in github oss projects icse may pittsburgh pa usa figure a good first issue without any signaling label.
unresolvedissue xisagfi.thelearnedmodel f bythisobjective can be used in flexible ways.
for example it can be used to recommend a list of issues to newcomers in project websites or suggest project maintainers to inspect label certain issues if the model predicts them to be gfis.
tolearnf weneedtodefinegroundtruthlabelsforhistorical issues.asmentionedinsection .
manuallylabeledgfisareoften insufficientandinappropriate andthusnotsuitableasgroundtruth labels.
in this paper we propose to learn f to predict whether an issue will be resolved by a newcomer .
in the historical issues i.e.
the training dataset we define f x if issue xis resolved by a newcomerand f x 0ifissue xisnotresolvedbyanewcomer.
wedefinedevelopersas newcomers inaprojectiftheyhascontributed no more than kcommits in this project and we define the developers as non newcomers if otherwise.
wechoosetointroduceathresholdparameter kfortworeasons.
first previousresearchhasshownthatnotonlydeveloperswho have not contributed to the project but also developers who have successfully made contributions seek to resolve gfis because they believethattheircapabilitiesareinsufficientforotherissues .
second the criteria of being a newcomer may be different across projects and we want to retain some flexibility in problem formulation.forexample successfullycontributingonecommitincomplex softwaresystemslikethelinuxkernelmayindicatethatthedeveloper is already qualified and experienced enough while in some otherprojectsmakingsmallcontributionsismucheasier.theeffect of threshold kon performance will be discussed in section .i n real application scenarios we expect project maintainers to choose apr operkandusethecorrespondingmodelfortheirproject.we will provide suggestions on choosing kin section .
approach inthissection wepresentrecgfi oursolutiontothegfirecommendation problem including how it extracts features from three heterogeneous sources of information and how it uses an xgboost classifier to learn from these features for gfi classification.
.
feature engineering identification and modeling of viable features is vital for the performance of any recommender systems .
recgfi extracts three dimensionsoffeaturesfromanissuetoabstractandlearnevidence indicating possible gfis content background anddynamics .
.
.
content.
intuitively one can infer whether an issue is a gfi afterreadingitscontent includingissuetitle description andlabels.
many kinds of information in issue content may be helpful in such inference suchaswhethertheissueisclear whatkindofissueit is etc.
therefore we derive the following features titleand description.
intuitively issueswithlonger clearer and more detailed description should help newcomers understand and resolve correctly.
therefore we extract the following statistics fromissuetitleanddescription length i.e.
numberofwords of issue title len title length of issue description len body number of urls urls number of code snippets code snips and number of images imgs .
these statistical features are frequently used in previous work to measure the quality and granularity of issue reports .
we also compute the following readability metricsfortitleanddescription coleman liauformula coleman kincaidgrade level kincaid flesch readingease flesch and automated readability index ari ari .
these readability metrics are also used in previous work to measure the readability of bug reports .
furthermore we use the training set to find the most frequent keywords from descriptions of issues resolved by newcomers and non newcomers respectively.
we remove common words and get two keyword lists.
for description of an issue we separately count number of words gfi words and nongfi words in the two keyword lists.
finally for issue title and description we compute tf idf for the top words with highest term frequency excluding stop words forming two dimension feature vectors tfidf title and tfidf description .
labels.labels are an effective approach to attach categorical information to issues such as topic priority and development task .exceptforgenericlabels e.g.
bug avarietyofcustom labelsarewidelyusedinprojects .certaintypesoflabelsmayindicateanissueaslikelysuitablefornewcomers.tocaptureevidence fromlabels wedivide commonlabels into12categories including task type bug documentation test build enhancement coding o rnew feature difficulty priority gfi signaling medium difficulty o rdifficult important and status triaged oruntriaged .toderivelabelcategoriesandheuristicsforautomatic categorization of labels we count the occurrence of all labels in our dataset section .
manually categorize frequently occurring labels anddiscussdetectionrulesuntilreachingaconsensus.for each category we derive detection rules based on keyword matching.forexample alabelisconsideredas bugifitcontainskeyword bug o rgfi signaling if it contains any of the common keywords providedbytanetal.fornewcomers oruntriaged ifitcontains keywords like untriaged needs triage etc.
for each issue we count the numbers of labels belonging to the categories and the total number of labels labels resulting in a dimensional feature vector.
.
.
background.
apart from issue content some issue background information may also be useful when inferring whether an 1832icse may pittsburgh pa usa wenxin xiao hao he weiwei xu xin tan jinhao dong and minghui zhou issue is a gfi.
in recgfi we extract features from the following sources of background information reporter.
developerswhohavereportednewcomer resolved issues may be more experienced in reporting issues and report bettergfis.ontheotherhand veteransmayreportcomplexissues or issues missing information necessary for newcomers to resolve this issue.
therefore we collect the following features to characterize reporter experience in project development being a newcomerhim herself rptr is new numberofcommits cmt proj issues issues proj andpullrequests pr proj intheproject ossdevelopmentingeneral numberofcommits cmt all issues issues all and pull requests pr all in all over the github number of repositories owned repo number of stars received in their own repositories stars rptr and number of followers followers and gfi reporting number of reported issues resolved by non newcomers divided by number of reported issues resolved by newcomers nongfi gfi .
additionally we check ifreporters have comments for the issues has comment or participated in any kind of events has event to measure their participation in their reported issues.
project.oss participants tend to seek projects that match task difficulty with their skill level while projects may vary in difficulty skillrequirements andattractivenesstoexternaldevelopers.
although project background information does not help whenrecommendingwithinaspecificproject theymayhelpcalibrateotherfeaturesandtransferknowledgefromotherprojects incross projectrecommendationscenarios.therefore weextract the following project related features basic information number of stars stars contributors contributors commits cmt and closed pull requests pr owner information same set of featurespreviouslyusedtocharacterizereporterexperience excluding rptr is new issue related information number of open issues iss open medianissueclosetime iss cls t andnumber ratio of issues resolved by newcomers gfi proj and gfi proj .
.
.
dynamics.
an issue is not static after its creation.
it may attract attention from different stakeholders maintainers users etc be supplemented with more information or undergo status changes.thesedynamicsmayaffectwhetheranissueissuitablefor newcomers and should also be considered during recommendation.
therefore we extract the following features comments.
after issue creation other developers may comment on issues to add supplementary information provide guidance management project maintainers or express interest potentialresolvers .foreachissue wecountthenumberofcomments comments asthefirstfeature.then similartoissuetitleanddescription we generate a dimension feature vector based on the tf idf computed from comment text tfidf comment .
events.the events of an issue reflects change of issue status afteritscreation.eacheventcarriesdifferentmeaningsandmay berelatedtoallkindsofactivitieswithinthisgithubrepository.
for example a subscribed event indicates the issue is drawing attentionfrommoredevelopers whilea mentioned eventindicates the issue is complicated and related with other issues.
similar to labels we first find the top events with most occurrences in the set.
then for each issue we count total number of events events andthenumberofeventsforeachfrequentlyoccurring event type forming a dimension feature vector.
participants.
similartotheissuereporter theexpertiseofissue participants may also play a role in determining whether the issue isagfi sincetheymayimprovetheissue byaddinglabels editing titles etc andprovidehelptonewcomers.therefore foralllabelers and event operators we compute the same features for characterizing project development expertise and oss development expertise as the issue reporter.
for gfi reporting expertise we compute the number of reported issues resolved by newcomers gfi labeler and gfi evtr andratioofreportedissuesresolvedbynewcomers gfi labeler and gfi evtr .
wetakethe averageofall labelers expertiseandtheaverageofalleventoperators expertiseastwo inputfeaturevectors.wealsocomputethenumber ratioofnewcomers among event operators event new and event new and thenumber ratioofnewcomersamonglabelers labler new and labeler new as additional issue participant features.

the xgboost classifier recgfiusestheextremegradientboosting xgboost classifier tolearnfromhistoricalgroundtruthdataandpredictwhetheran issue is a gfi.
xgboost is a gradient boosted regression tree approachwithseveralcleveroptimizationswhichenablesitsexcellent performanceandhighscalability.xgboosthasachievedstate ofthe art performance in a diverse range of application scenarios including software engineering tasks e.g.
.
xgboost is alsoeasilyinterpretableusingthegeneratedfeatureweightsand supports automated feature selection during ensemble of trees.
we will show in section 4that xgboost is also highly competitive for thegfirecommendationproblem outperformingothermachine learning approaches in our ground truth dataset.

specifically issues belonging to the minor class i.e.

or collected from github section .
recgfi uses the trained xgboost classifier to output its probability of being an gfi.
evaluation .
research questions to test the ability of recgfi in identifying suitable issues for newcomersandtoenrichourunderstandingonthegfirecommendation problem we ask the following research questions rq1 howdoesrecgfiperforminpredictingwhetheran issue is suitable for newcomers?
as discussed in section .
there is no clear boundary of experience to divide newcomers and non newcomers so we set a threshold kin newcomer definition.
therefore weneedto evaluatetheperformanceof recgfiunder different k inbothtimepoints andindifferentsettings.wealso presentperformanceof recgfiandbaselineapproachestovalidate 1833recommending good first issues in github oss projects icse may pittsburgh pa usa thatrecgfiismore competitive andinvestigatethe contribution of each feature group by comparing recgfi with its variants.
rq2 whatkindofissuesaresuitablefornewcomers?
we takethefollowingtwostepstofacilitatetheunderstandingofissues suitablefor newcomers uselocalinterpretable model agnostic explanations lime to reveal contributions of features in the trainedmodel statisticallyanalyzethedifferencesbetweenissues resolved by newcomers and other issues.
rq3 is recgfi helpful in a real world setting?
finally to demonstrate the practical usefulness of our approach we collect latestopenissuesanduseourmodeltogeneraterecommendedgfis.
using the recommendations we conduct a preliminary user study among project maintainers and monitor how these recommended gfis are actually resolved.
.
data collection we choose to build a dataset for the gfi recommendation problem because we are not aware of any prior work that provides a similar dataset.
to retrieve engineered open source software projects willing to attract newcomers attention we follow the instructionsintroducedbymunaiahetal.
toselectrepresentative github repositories.
according to the octoverse report javascript python java typescript c php c andcarethetop eight popular programming languages on github in .
we use thelatestlibraries.io8datasettofilterouttherepositorieswhose primary programming language is one of them and keep repositorieswithmorethan100stars 5contributors 5forksand 10openissues.wefurtherusetheghtorrentdataset dump to collect all issues for these projects and locate issues withgfi signalinglabelsaccordingtothelabelsetprovidedbytan et al.
.
to locate projects with a strong interest in attracting newcomers we sort projects by the number of issues with gfisignaling labels and only keep the top projects.
these projects have issues in total and only .
issues with gfi signaling labels this gfi ratio is in line with previous studies .
sincetheghtorrentdataset doesnotcontainsufficientdata forourapproach e.g.
lackingissuetext wefurtherusethegithub rest api to collect title description labels comments and events forall issuesand pullrequests.
issue eventsare neededfor restoringhistoricalissuestatebeforecertaintimepointsandpull requestsareusedtotraceissuestotheirresolvers.thiscollection process takes about one month using github api tokens.
issuesongithubhavedifferentnaturesuchasaskingquestions reporting bugs and proposing features .
not all issues correspond to a specific development task to be assigned to a specific developer.
therefore we need to locate issues resolved by a specific developer.
however recovering links between issues and the versioncontrolsystemisstillanopenproblem soweresort toaconservativebutreliableapproach findingissuesclosedbya commitorpullrequest pr accordingtogithubconventions.in github developers can link commits prs to issues using certain text patterns e.g.
closes num which also tells github to automatically close the issue if the commit appears in the main branch .ifanissueisclosedbyacommit we find the commit using the corresponding commit sha recorded by githubintheissuecloseevent .ifanissueisclosedbyapr we scan patterns in pr text as defined in to find whether a prclosedthisissue.finally weareabletocollect53 510issuesand their corresponding resolver in the projects.
when computing features we need to take time into consideration to avoid leakage of future data which frequently leads to overly optimistic results .
to simulate real world scenarios and diversifyourdataset werestoreissuehistoricalstateattwotime points thetimewhentheissueiscreatedandbeforesomedeveloperstartstoworkonthisissue.recgfishouldworkwellforboth time points since any issue in between the two time points may be apossiblegfifornewcomers.wecomputethesecondtimepoint as follows if an issue is referenced by a pull request or assigned to a specific developer it indicates that a developer may already be working on it so we use the first reference or assignment event as the second time point if the issue has never been referenced or assigned wesetthesecondtimepointtothetimebeforetheissueis closed.
we compute all features at the two time points for learning and prediction.
we then compute the number of commits made by the issue resolver before the issue is closed excluding commits that resolved this issue .
this number can be used to distinguish betweennewcomers non newcomersandgenerategroundtruth labels when training recgfi with a given threshold.
.

specifically developers who have reported more issues and contributedmorecommitsarelesslikelytoreportgfis.higherratio of historical non gfis also plays a similar role.
to further observe issues reported by developers with different experiences we divide reporters into four groups according to the numberofcommitstheycontributedtotheproject.thecoefficients of reporter related features are presented in figure .
although in generalexperienceofreporterslowerstheprobabilityofprediction when they have fewer less than commits in project more experience means that issues reported by them are more likely to be gfis.
figure 5confirms that issues reported by developers with less than commits in project are more likely to be gfis.
in general just enough experience in project leads to a higher probability for the developer to report a gfi.
intuitively project relatedfeaturesarenothelpfulwhenpredicting issues within the same project at the same time because these 1836icse may pittsburgh pa usa wenxin xiao hao he weiwei xu xin tan jinhao dong and minghui zhou figure6 numberofprojectswithpositive orange andnegative blue coefficients for project related features.
features are the samefor the issues.
these features areused to adjust the predicted probabilities of issues across projects or different periodsofthesameproject sothatissuescanbeclassifiedusing the same probability threshold.
in this way project maintainers do not need to spend extra effort to adjust probability threshold for different period based on expert knowledge.
to show what kind of projects recgfi tends to provide higher prediction probability we countthenumberofprojectswithpositive negativecoefficientsfor project related features in figure .

.
rq3 real world evaluation to demonstrate that recgfi works on real world unseen data and also useful under realistic scenarios we run a script on august to collect and compute features for open issues with recent activities in the last seven days in the projects.
we get issues after this step.
then we use our trained recgfi model to predict whether these issues are possible gfis and we retain 511issueswithpredictionprobabilityhigherthan0.
.wechoose theprobabilitythresholdof0.7becausewedonotwanttobother project maintainers with too many recommended issues and these issues with higher possibilities are more likely to be real gfis as demonstratedinfigure .projectmaintainerscanchooseanappropriate probability threshold according to the needs of their project.
a lower probability threshold means more potential false positives and fewer gfis omissions while a higher probability threshold ensure that recommended issues are more likely to be gfis and more gfis may be missed.
1838icse may pittsburgh pa usa wenxin xiao hao he weiwei xu xin tan jinhao dong and minghui zhou figure the issue in section .1is labeled as a gfi by a project maintainer after our recommendation.
our first goal is to evaluate whether the recommended gfis are really perceived as gfis by project maintainers.
to achieve this goal we carefully check the recommended issues by browsing through issue titles description labels comments and timeline events.wealsocheckprojectcontributiondocumentationtounderstandtheirissueworkflowwherenecessary.asexpected alarge number of open issues are not in a suitable state for recommendation issues still need further information or discussion to be confirmed as a real issue issues are already being solved by a specific developer issues do not correspond to a specific development task i.e.
they may be discussions proposals etc finally issues are closed between script execution and manual inspection.fortunately weobservethatmostprojectshavecustom labelstospecifyissuestates e.g.
needstriage indiscussion in progress etc and better recommendation can be facilitated by customizing recgfi to work on a subset of open issues e.g.
by specifying filtering rules on issue labels .

we limit the number of issues reported to avoid being perceived as spamming or causing too much workload for project maintainers and we report issues after this procedure.
atthetimeofwriting wehavereceivedresponsefor33reported issues.
issues are confirmed as gfis see an example in figure andprojectmaintainersaddgfi signalinglabelsfortheseissues while17issuesarenotconsideredasgfisbyprojectmaintainers.
in other words our model reaches an estimated precision of .
intherealworldsetting.although our recommendations stillcontain false positives asperceived by the project maintainers we receive positive responses from the maintainers about our approach marking more issues as gfi does have the potential of making projects more accessible to new contributors so i m intrigued!

one issue18has attracted a newcomerbutislater resolvedbyanon newcomer.interestingly for the issues denied by project maintainers two issues19 among eight resolved are also resolved by newcomers both with only several lines of changes.
the two issues offer preliminary evidence that project maintainers may not always be correct in labeling gfis and an automated recommendation approach adds up more value in helping newcomers onboard.
summary for rq3 recgfiishelpfulinrealworldscenarios.wereporttherecommendissuestoprojectmaintainersinwhich16areconfirmed as gfis and five have already been resolved by a newcomer.
discussion identifying issues suitable for newcomers.
ideally recgfi should be able to clearly distinguish between issues suitable inappropriatefornewcomers.becausesuchidealgroundtruthlabelsare notavailable recgfiistrainedfromdifferentlabels whetheran issueisresolvedbyanewcomer whichcomeswithanumberofadvantagesandlimitations.first itworksonanyprojectwithatleast someonboardnewcomerseveniftheprojectmaintainersdonot addanygfi signalinglabelstoissues.however althoughweshow thatissuesresolvedbynewcomersarelessscarce .

it is also possiblethatissuesresolvedbynon newcomersareactuallysuitable fornewcomersbecauseitcanbehardfornewcomerstodiscover these issues.
such cases canbe mitigated if recgfi is deployed in practice and continuously recommending gfis to newcomers in a project.
we also do not consider the expertise or preference of newcomers during recommendation and we plan to explore the possibility of personalized gfi recommendation in future work.

future work can design an approachthatautomaticallylearnsandfilters nottask issuesto make gfi recommendation more effective.
thethreshold k.thethresholdusedtodefinenewcomersisa parameter that can be flexibly adjusted.
if project maintainers tend to define newcomers more strictly k is a reasonable choice.
1839recommending good first issues in github oss projects icse may pittsburgh pa usa otherwise previous work has shown that the distribution of commits are often sparse between newcomers and long term contributors so a kvalue can also be chosen near this boundary which should be k 2o rk for most projects.
expertiseandexperienceinthenewcomerdefinition.
in thiswork weonlyconsiderthenumberofcommitsfortheconcept of newcomers and ignores other forms of experiences e.g.
code review issue reporting commenting etc.
because other experiences are either not indicative of expertise in contributing code e.g.
issue reporting commenting or are only possible when one already becomes a veteran e.g.
code review .
according to baltes and diehl knowledge experience and skills constitute one s expertise in a project.
however it is non trivial to infer knowledge and skills from data which is important for personalized recommendation so we leave them for future work.
learning from issue text.
in recgfi we model issue text using readability keyword frequency text length number of images number of code snippets and number of hyperlinks.
domainspecific information in issue descriptions may be helpful for recognizinggfis butwefindthatstraightforwarddeepneuralnetworks e.g.
lstm fail to capture such semantics and cannot outperform our current approach.
therefore future work can be devoted to approaches that better capture issue semantics.
generalizabilitytootherprojects.

however to ensure the quality of ourdataset ourevaluationisbasedsolelyonprojectswithmany manually labeled gfis and high popularity.
future work is needed to investigate to what extent can recgfi perform on projects with differentcharacteristics.ifaprojectlackshistoricaldata e.g.
