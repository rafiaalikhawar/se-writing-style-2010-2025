indeed previous researchhas shown that developers often miss even popular and easy to detect vulnerabilities duringcodereview.initialevidencesuggeststhatasignificantcause may lie in the reviewers mental attitude and common practices.
in this study we investigate whether and how explicitly asking developers to focus on security during a code review affects the detection of vulnerabilities.

so how can we better support code reviewers in detecting vulnerabilities?
in the study we present in this paper we investigate three interventions that aim to tackle the problem by guiding the focus of the reviewer.
one isbasedon the developer s mentalattitude hypothesis and two are based on an additional security checklists hypothesis.
studies in the literature indicate developers mental attitude as a leading cause for the introduction of vulnerabilities in thecode .
specifically vulnerabilities may be introduced because developers do not consider security as their responsibility orstronglyrelyonotherprojectmembers processes and technologies .
a potential solution to resolve issues related to developers mental attitude is giving explicit instructions regarding security.
indeed naiakshina et al .
showed positive effectswhenexplicitlyinstructingcomputersciencestudentsand freelance developers to implement securepassword storage during coding.
nevertheless writing and reviewing code are different activities with even cultural differences among teams therefore evidence about the former may not translate to the latter.

in our study we set up three interventions treatments that we compare among themselves and to a review baseline control .

background and related work in this section we briefly introduce the concepts of code inspections and modern code review the context of our study .
then we reviewtheliteratureonexplicitlyaskingdeveloperstousesecure coding practices as a way to overcome issues due to the mental attitude and on checklists for secure software development and inspections reviews.wealsoprovidebackgroundonthetwosecurity vulnerabilities we focus on in our online experiment.
software developers and security.
security often fails because of the lack of usability users either misunderstand the se curity implications of their actions or turn off security features to workaround usability problems .
software developers need to design systems that are both usable and secure.
yet they still needsupporttocreatesecureapplicationsbeforeaddressingusable security .
existingfindingsaboutdevelopers attitudetowardssecurityare not conclusive.
on the one hand a number of studies found that developers prioritize more visible functional requirementsoreveneasy to measureactivities suchasclosingbugtrackingtickets oversecurity.ontheotherhand christakisandbird reported that developers care more about security issues than otherreliabilityissues.smithetal .
advocatethatstaticanalysis toolsdetectvulnerabilitiesandhelpdevelopersresolvethosevulnerabilities.
previous studies have proposed and improved tooling support according to developers needs but tools are still generally poorly adopted by developers as they are confusing for developers to use .
developer centred security dcs .
dcs studies have addressed some of developers needs and attempted to apply existingmethodologies from human computer interaction and to adopt well established usable security measures to software development .thesystematicliteraturereviewbytahaeiand vaniea points out the lack of research on several aspects of dcs.
for instance they reported only one study inthe context of code review .
codeinspectionsandmoderncodereview.
peercodereview is a manual inspection of source code by developers other than the author.
in fagan formalized a highly structured process for code reviewing which includes a synchronous inspection meeting code inspections.
over the years researchers conducted several empirical studies on code inspections .
nowadays mostorganizationsadoptamorelightweightcode review process to limit the inefficiencies of inspections moderncode review .
this form of review is the focus of our study.
modern code review is asynchronous tool and change based and widely used in practice nowadays across companies and community driven projects .
contemporarycodereviewmitigatesseveralissuesofcodeinspections but also removes the structure and checks devised tokeep the reliability of the process and its outcome.
researchers providedstrongevidencethat asaresultofthisdifferentapproach to inspection the outcome of contemporary code review is less predictable and past theories from code inspections do not transferseamlessly .therefore itisimportanttoconductstudies specific to this different context.

checklists in software security.
previous studies have addressedthedesign ofchecklistsforsecurity relatedaspects such assoftware security requirements and security life cycle .
gilliam et al .
provided guidelines for creating a software security checklist emphasizing the importance of verifying security requirements beforehand to create a viable checklist.
garrison and posey suggestedthatsecuritychecklistsareparticularlyuseful in guiding non security professionals through a security oriented softwaredevelopmentprocess.owasp statedthatorganizationswithapropercodereviewprocessintegratedintothesoftware development life cycle produced remarkably better code from a security standpoint .
to help businesses strengthen their security suchorganizationsdevelopeddifferentsecurecodingpractices which are widely adopted globally .
in fact they proposed a code review guide containing a security checklist .
cruzes et al .
investigated secure coding checklists usage.
however the authors disagree that developers should adopt thispractice.

we address this question by analyzing whether a security checklist supports developers in this task.
software vulnerabilities.
owasp and the common weakness enumeration project cwe are well established projects that provide guidance and best practices for organizations to avoid security issues.
our study investigates whether security checklistssupportdevelopersinvulnerabilitydetectionduringcodereviews.
therefore among the owasp s top web application security risks list we focus on the sensitive data exposure sde cwe group which can be mapped to items in our checklist.
sdeoccurrences have increased significantly overthe last few years leading to damaging leaks.
for instance the largest instance of sdeto date impacted billion yahoo!
s user accounts leaking their credentials i.e.
email addresses passwords andsecurityquestionsandanswers .securityexpertsnotedthat the majority of the passwords used a strong hashing algorithm but many used the md5 algorithm which can be broken rather quickly .
there are many reasons for sde such as the missing encryption of sensitive data cwe and the ones covered in our experiments namely generation of error message containing sensitive information msi cwe anduse of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm bra cwe .
the former refers to software that generates an error message including sensitive information about its environment users or associated data while the latter refers to the use of a not recommended algorithm that may allow attackers to compromise data that has been protected.
research methodology inthissection weintroduceourresearchquestionsanddetail our experimental design.
.
research questions we structure our study around two research questions.
we aim to understand the impact of instructing developers to focuson security issues and providing an additional checklists on vulnerability detection.
we formulate our first research question as follows rq1.doesexplicitlyaskingdeveloperstofocusonsecurityissues facilitate vulnerability detection during code review?
we hypothesize that explicitly asking developers to focus on security issues increases vulnerability detection during in codereview because it would steer developers mental attitude.
our formal hypothesis for rq1is h01 the presence of security instructions does not facilitate vulnerability detection during code review.
evidence shows that generic checklists aid developers during codeinspectionsandcanimprovetheinspections outcome .
weexplorethehypothesisthatprovidingdeveloperswithasecurity checklist inadditiontoinstructingthemtodoasecurityreview further increases the vulnerability detection during code review becauseitwouldguidethereviewtasksonrelevantsecurityaspects.
we formulate our second research question as follows rq2.how does the presence of a security checklist affect vulnerability detection during a security focused code review?
we organize rq2.in two sub questions.
first we ask rq2.
.to what extent does the presence of a security checklist affectvulnerabilitydetectionduringasecurity focusedcode review?
thepresenceofitemsirrelevanttothechangemightdeteriorate developers codereviewperformance.brykczynski suggests that users are less likely to read through a multitude of checklistitems.

therefore even if findingthefirstvulnerabilitydistractedtheparticipants thisdid not impact the final results.
participantshavedifferentlevelsofexperience practices.
one factor that may impact the participants performance in the review task is their experience and practice e.g.
developers with fewer years ofexperience might findit more challengingtoidentify the vulnerability .itisimportantthatthetreatmentgroupsarebalanced in this aspect.
in addition to adding experience and practice as controlfactorsinourregressionmodels wealsoperformedmultiple pairwise comparisonbetweenthemeansofthetreatmentsusing thetukeyhsdtestandcorrectingformultipletestswiththeholm approach.
we found no statistically significant difference.
the number participants is too low.
to calculate the minimum size sample of our experiment i.e.
number of participants with valid responses we performed a preliminary power analysis using theg power usingtwo tailtestwithoddsratio .

and r2 .
.
we used a manual distribution.
after running the analysis we found that our experiment needed a minimum of participants.
as our experiment reached valid participants bigger than necessary we believe that our sample is representative.
h owever this sample size is valid only for the first logistic regression model that we built to answer the research question rq1.
to build the second logistic regression model for rq2 weexcludetheparticipantsassignedto ni.therefore forthis analysis we reduced our participants number to which is still a quite large sample compared to many experiments in software engineering .however wealsoconductedotherstatisticaltests to verify the effect of single variables on the expected outcome and reported the results as the sample size could have affected the significativity of the multivariate statistics.
the vulnerabilities are too easy hard to detect.
the vulnerabilities injected in the changes might have affected the validityof our results.
reviewers might not find a too hard to detect vulnerabilityandgetdiscouragedtocontinuetheexperiment while participants might detect a too easy vulnerability regardless of any otherinfluencing factor even withoutpayingtoo muchattention to the review.
we measure that and of the participantsfound the msiand thebra respectively suggesting that these vulnerabilities were neither too trivial nor too difficult to find.
threats to validity internal validity.
as our experiment was online participants conducted it in different environments e.g.
noise level and web searches whichcouldhaveinfluencedtheresults yetitisexpected that developers in real world settings also work with various tools and environments.
interruptions could have also influenced the results so we asked participants about interruptions and their duration and included this information in our statistical analyses.
to mitigate the possible threat from missing control over subjects we included some questions to characterize our sample such as experienceandrole step4infigure1 .weconductedstatistical teststoinvestigatehowthesefactorsaffecttheresults.participants wereallowedtotaketheexperimentonlyoncetopreventduplicateparticipation.
we removed participantswho did not completethe experiment and manually analyzed outliers in terms of duration.

in their open text responses developers indicatedthattheyperceivetheseaspects especiallyknowledge toplaya substantial role.
in addition we performed multiple pairwise comparisons between the means of the treatments using the tukey hsd test and correcting for multiple tests with the holm approach section .

we believe the impact of background knowledge and practice should be investigated with further studies.

mentalattitudematters.
vulnerabilitiescanleadtostrongnegative consequences when they go undetected.
almost every day the media publishes news about successful cyberattacks showing more and more the urgency and need for advances in the secure softwareengineeringfield.previousstudiesreportedmentalattitude as one leading cause of why vulnerabilities are introduced in the code and initial evidence suggests that it may be one of the reasons for not being detected during code review .
in line with previous findings our results suggest that developers mental attitude plays an important role in thedetection of software vulnerabilities during code reviews.
these results strengthen the questions on the effectiveness of the current development process including coding and reviewing activities.organizations may consider incorporating secure code review scr intotheirdevelopmentprocesstocreateadifferentapproach.

interestingly our results show that security instructions are helpful but the detection of vulnerabilities does not increase when a security checklist is added to the code review.
thus a less is moreapproach can be adopted to improve the code review process keeping it as simple as possible with security instructions ratherthan incorporating advanced or complicated solutions such as securitychecklists.studiescanbecarriedouttoinvestigatehowto effectively address security instructions during scr.

in total participants found at least one of the vulnerabilities.
thosewhoreceivedtheinstructionstofocusonsecurityissueswere at least eight times more likely to detect vulnerabilities.
however surprisingly adding security checklists did not increase further the vulnerabilities detection during code review compared to only receiving security instructions.
our findings provide evidence that developers mental attitude plays a role in detecting software vulnerabilities during code reviews.theeffectofthesecurityinstructionsprovidesevidencethatvulnerabilitydetectioncouldbetriggeredwithpropersecurityconsiderations such as security standards for code reviews.
moreover the role and design of security checklists should be investigated further to establish and improve their effectiveness.
