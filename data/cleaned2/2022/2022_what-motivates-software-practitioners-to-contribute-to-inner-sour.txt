given the rapid adoption of inner source we wonder what motivates software practitioners to contribute to inner source projects.
we followed a mixed methods approach a qualitative phase of interviews with interviewees followed by a quantitative phase of an exploratory survey with respondents from countries across four continents.
our study uncovers practitioners motivation to contribute to inner source projects as well as how the motivation differs from what motivates practitioners to participate in open source projects.
we also investigate how software practitioners motivation impacts their contribution level and continuance intention in inner source projects.
based on our findings we outline directions for future research and provide recommendations for organizations and software practitioners.

keywords inner source motivation software development open collaboration internal open source introduction open source software oss has been making an enormous impact on the software industry.
oss is recognized to be capable of delivering high quality software products with a fast development cycle .
software development organizations have widely adopted oss in a variety of ways e.g.
integrating oss components into proprietary software products and leveraging oss tools as part of software development processes .
in addition to the corresponding author.adoption of oss numerous software development organizations have shown a significant interest in adopting oss development practices to exploit the benefits of oss .
the use of oss development practices within organizations is called inner source .
inner source allows universal access to the development artifacts inside an organization .
thus everyone within the organization can potentially become contributors to inner source projects.
unlike traditional software development within an organization contributors of an inner source project do not belong to a single team or organizational unit.
the growth of inner source adoption led to the emergence of a number of studies on inner source.
prior studies investigate the challenges of inner source adoption e.g.
cultural transition and competing tensions among stakeholders within organizations .
researchers also propose frameworks tools and models to support practices of inner source software development.
nevertheless there has been little focus on investigating what motivates software practitioners to contribute to inner source development.
an understanding of software practitioners motivation is of essential importance to attract the participation of more practitioners and sustain inner source development.
to address this gap we followed a mixed methods approach to investigate software practitioners motivation to contribute to inner source development.
we started with semi structured interviews with software practitioners with experience in inner source development who have an average of .
years of professional experience in software development.
through the interviews we qualitatively investigated the motivation that drives software practitioners to participate in inner source development as well as their experience in inner source development.
we further performed an exploratory survey with software practitioners from countries to quantitatively validate the motivation and practices that are uncovered in our interviews.
we investigated the following research questions rq1.
what motivates software practitioners to participate in inner source projects?esec fse november singapore singapore wan et al.
software practitioners are motivated by both internal motivation1 e.g.
helping others and external motivation2 e.g.
job responsibility to contribute to inner source development.
the survey respondents report stronger agreement on internal motivation than on external motivation.
the survey respondents who contribute to utility oriented projects show stronger motivation for sharing than those who contribute to service oriented projects3.
rq2 how does the motivation of software practitioners differ when they contribute to inner source development compared with open source development?
in comparison with open source development software practitioners tend to have higher motivation for software improvement andjob responsibility when they contribute to inner source development.
meanwhile they show lower motivation for funwhen they participate in inner source development.
rq3 how does motivation influence the contribution level and continuance intention of software practitioners in inner source development?
the level of job responsibility motivation is positively correlated with the contribution level of software practitioners in inner source development.
the levels of all measured motivators are positively correlated with the intention of software practitioners to be involved in inner source development in the future where the correlations vary from moderate to weak.
based on our findings we discuss implications and provide practical lessons for attracting and retaining software practitioners for inner source development.
in summary we make the following contributions we identify motivators of software practitioners to contribute to inner source development based on a mixed methods approach we highlight the differences between inner source and oss motivations we provide practical implications for sustaining inner source development and outlined future avenues of research we provide the interview guide questionnaire and survey responses publicly accessible for future investigation by others4.

philips healthcare and alcatel lucent adopted project based inner source programs in which an organizational unit a core team takes responsibility for a specific inner source project.
organizations and companies implement different inner source development practices in terms of participatory reuse collaborative development self selection of tasks and volunteering .
in addition some studies propose metrics to quantify inner source development practices e.g.
size of an inner source program and inner source collaboration .
inner source allows universal access to development artifacts throughout an organization company .
thus everyone within the organization company can potentially become contributors to inner source projects.
gurbani et al.
suggest that multiple roles are involved in the community of an inner source project.
the initiator of an inner source project assumes the role of a benevolent dictator .
some contributors become experts in the course of development who are further promoted to be trusted lieutenants .
the benevolent dictator and trusted lieutenants form a core team of an inner source project.
additional roles of contributors may emerge to tail the implementation of inner source to a particular context .
the motivation of contributors to participate is of essential importance to the success of software development projects .
nonetheless there is no existing study that systematically explores the motivation of software practitioners to contribute to inner source development.
in this work we quantitatively analyze software practitioners motivation to contribute to inner source development and further investigate the relationship between motivation and contribution level and continuance intention of software practitioners.
.
research on motivations in software engineering motivation has been the object of studies in a variety of areas for a long time including software engineering.
in software engineering the motivation of software practitioners has been intensively studied since the 1980s.
proper management of motivation could help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity as well as avoid human resource turnover budget overflow and delivery delays .
sharp et al.
provide an overview of the motivation models in software engineering based on which they propose a new model.
more recently sach et al.
suggest a trend towards more socially oriented motivation in software engineering via interviews with professional software engineers .
fran a et al.
present a variety of factors that influence work motivation and job performance in software engineering.
due to the high degree of autonomy intrinsic motivation and self determination of oss contributors motivations in software engineering may not apply to oss development .
thus motivation to contribute to oss has been extensively studied since the 2000s.
some researchers conducted broad surveys to collectwhat motivates software practitioners to contribute to inner source?
esec fse november singapore singapore oss contributions .
other researchers conducted surveys focused on motivations of specific oss communities e.g.
linux and apache .
in addition prior studies investigate the motivation of specific groups of oss contributors e.g.
newcomers one time code contributors quasi contributors and students .
in von krogh et al.
provided a literature review of studies on the motivation for participation in oss development.
they identified ten categories of motivations grouped as intrinsic internalized extrinsic and extrinsic motivations.
intrinsic motivation moves the person to act for the fun or challenge entailed rather than in response to external pressures or rewards .
in contrast extrinsic motivations are based on outside incentives when people change their actions due to an external intervention .
developers can also internalize extrinsic motivations in a way that they are perceived as self regulating behavior rather than external impositions .
these internalized extrinsic motivations include reputation reciprocity learning and own use.
researchers also investigated the relation between motivation and other factors e.g.
retention task effort intention to contribute and contribution level .
most recently gerosa et al.
replicate and extend previous research on motivation to contribute to oss and investigate the shift of motivation.
considering inner source is the use of open source development practices within organizations in this work we investigate the difference in motivations when software practitioners contribute to inner source compared with open source development.
methodology our research methodology followed a mixed methods approach as depicted in figure .
we collected data from two different sources5 we interviewed software practitioners with experience in inner source development and derived a list of statements and potential answers for survey questions from the results of interviews we surveyed respondents with experience in inner source development.
to preserve the anonymity of participants we anonymized all items that constitute personally identifiable information pii before analyzing the data and further considered aliases as pii throughout our study e.g.
we refer to the interviewees as p1 p20 .
.
interviews the left part of figure describes the process of interviews.

.
participant selection.
we recruited full time software practitioners with experience in inner source development from tech companies e.g.
alibaba huawei and tencent .
interviewees were recruited by emailing our contact in each company who disseminated the news of our study to their colleagues.
volunteers would inform us if they were willing to participate in our study with no compensation.
volunteers contacted us and participated in the interviews.
in the remainder of this paper we denote these interviewees as p1 to p20.

protocol.
the first author conducted a series of face to face interviews with the software practitioners.
each interview took minutes.
the interviews were semi structured and made use of an interview guide6.
the interview comprised three parts.
in the first part we asked some demographic questions about the experience of the interviewees in software development.
the questions covered various aspects of experience including years of experience tenure7 programming languages job roles and experience in open source development.
in the second part we asked the interviewees about their specific experience in inner source development.
specifically we asked how many projects they have participated in what roles they have played in the projects how much time per week they spend contributing to their primary project.
in the third part we asked open ended questions about the motivations to contribute to inner source.
this part aims to allow the interviewees to speak freely about their opinions without the interviewer biasing their responses.
at the end of each interview we thanked the interviewee and briefly informed her of our next plans.
.
.
data analysis.
we conducted a thematic analysis to process the recorded interviews by following the steps below transcribing and coding.
we transcribed the recordings of the interviews as the interviews proceeded and developed a thorough understanding by reviewing the transcripts.
the first author read the transcripts and coded the interviews using nvivo qualitative analysis software .
to ensure the quality of codes another author verified initial codes created by the first author and provided suggestions for improvement.
after incorporating these suggestions we generated a total of cards for codes to cards for each coded interview.
after merging the codes with the same words or meanings we have a total of unique codes.
we noticed that when our interviews were drawing to a close the collected codes from interview transcripts reached saturation.
new codes did not appear anymore the set of codes was considered stable.
open card sorting.
two of the authors then separately analyzed the codes and sorted the generated cards into potential themes for thematic similarity as illustrated in latoza et al.
s study .
the themes that emerged during the sorting were not chosen beforehand.
we then use the cohen s kappa measure to examine the agreement between the two labelers.
the overall kappa value 6interview guide online 7the length of time a software practitioner has been with her current organization company.esec fse november singapore singapore wan et al.

indicating substantial agreement between the labelers.
after completing the labeling process the two labelers discussed their disagreements to reach a common decision.
to reduce bias from the two authors sorting the cards to form initial themes they both reviewed and agreed on the final set of themes.
eventually we derived statements that describe the motivation of software practitioners to contribute to inner source development and options for survey questions regarding inner source practices.
.
survey the right part of figure describes the process of our online survey.
.
.
recruitment of respondents.
we spread the survey to a broad range of companies from various locations worldwide.
no identifying information was required or gathered from our respondents.
to get a sufficient number of respondents from diverse backgrounds we followed a multi pronged strategy to recruit respondents we contacted professionals from various companies around the world and asked their help to disseminate our survey within their organizations.
specifically we sent emails to our contacts in alibaba bytedance google hengtian huawei tencent and other companies encouraging them to disseminate our survey to their colleagues.
by following this strategy we aimed to recruit respondents in the industry from diverse organizations.
we sent an email with a link to the survey to practitioners who contributed to open source repositories initiated by tech companies and hosted on github e.g.
tensorflow andangular and solicited their participation.
we aimed to recruit oss contributors who have inner source experience in addition to professionals working in the industry.
out of these emails five emails received automatic replies notifying us of the absence of the receiver two emails indicated the receivers left their organizations.
.
.
protocol.
we conducted an irb approved anonymous online survey to validate and quantify the observations from the interviews and literature.
we followed kitchenham and pfleeger s guidelines for personal opinion surveys and used an anonymous survey to increase response rates .
respondents have the option to specify that they prefer not to answer or do not understand the description of a particular question.
we include this option to reduce the possibility of respondents providing arbitrary answers.
we piloted the preliminary survey with six practitioners with inner source experience who were different from our interviewees and survey takers.
we obtained feedback on the length of the survey and the clarity and understandability of the terms.
wemade minor modifications to the preliminary survey based on the received feedback and produced a final version.
the collected responses from the pilot survey are excluded from the presented results in this paper.
to support respondents from china we translated our survey to chinese before publishing the survey.
we chose to make our survey available both in english and chinese because english is an international lingua franca and chinese is the most spoken language.
we expected that a large number of our survey recipients are fluent in one of these two languages.
we carefully translated our survey to make sure there exists no ambiguity between english and chinese terms in our survey.
also we polished the translation by improving clarity and understandability according to the feedback from our pilot survey.
.
.
survey design.
the survey includes different types of questions e.g.
multiple choice and free text answer questions.
the potential answers and statements of multiple choice questions were derived from the results of our interviews.
we include an i don t understand option in case some questions are not applicable to the experience of respondents or respondents had a poor understanding.
the survey consists of three sections grouping questions by topic to minimize the cognitive load on participants and allow them to consider the topic more deeply .
specifically the following sections have been captured in the survey the complete questionnaire is available online as supplemental material8 demographics.
we collected demographic information about the respondents to allow us to filter respondents who may not understand our survey i.e.
respondents without any experience in inner source development break down the results into groups.
based on the selections of respondents we could exclude invalid responses and divide the survey respondents into various groups.
to focus the respondents attention on a particular inner source project the survey asked respondents to answer following questions according to the experience with their primary inner source project.
we received a total of responses and first excluded two responses made by non software practitioners who described their job roles as sales and legal affairs.
we then excluded responses made by respondents who claimed that they do not have experience in inner source development.
we further excluded incomplete responses from respondents who have experience in inner source development but selected the i don t understand option for one to two questions out of seven questions.
the seven questions receive 8questionnaire online motivates software practitioners to contribute to inner source?

the top four counties in which respondents reside are china france united states and netherlands .
as presented in table our survey respondents are diverse in terms of age gender tenure job role professional experience and experience in oss development.experience with inner source.
this section investigates the specific inner source experience of software practitioners specifically project objective governance model role s contribution level and continuance intention in inner source development.
the questions include what best describes the objective of the primary inner source project you contribute to?
exploration oriented utility oriented service oriented how is your primary inner source project governed?
by a single organizational unit by multiple organizational units by all organizational units what best describes the role s you play in your primary inner source project?
how much time per week do you spend contributing to your primary inner source project?
hours per week hours per week hours per week hours per week in terms of the third question we provided two dimensions of options for roles project centric roles and community centric roles as suggested in .
in terms of the project centric roles an inner source contributor can be coder project manager and system administrator .
as for the community centric roles an inner source contributor can be founder advocate mentor strategist treasurer andwriter .
the fourth question is commonly used in oss studies as a proxy for participant contribution .
to understand the continuance intention of software practitioners we further asked respondents to state how strongly they agree or disagree with the statement i look forward to being involved in inner source development in the future on a level likert scale strongly disagree disagree neutral agree strongly agree .
the construct is used in a previous study to measure continuance intention of software practitioners in oss development.
motivation to contribute to inner source.
this section focused on motivation to contribute to inner source projects.
the motivation items were extracted from our interviews and presented as statements to which respondents were asked to state how strongly they agree or disagree on a level likert scale strongly disagree disagree neutral agree strongly agree .
in addition we asked respondents to specify any other motivations that were not included in our questionnaire.
more details about the questions and format are available in section along with the corresponding results.
.
.
data analysis.
we analyzed the survey results based on the question types.
for multiple choice questions we reported the percentage of each option is selected.
in terms of free text answer questions we followed an inductive approach in which two authors separately performed open card sorting and regularly discussed emerging themes until an agreement was reached.
for likert scale questions we conducted multiple analyses as below factor analysis.
to identify meaningful clusters of closely related motivation items we conducted an exploratory factor analysis to analyze the likert scale ratings of the survey questions with respect to motivation.
specifically we first used the fa.parallel function in the psych r library to select the optimal number of factors for factor analysis.
we then used principal axis factor analysis in the psych r library to group related motivators with a cut off point of .
for factor loadings.
as a result we reduced a large set ofesec fse november singapore singapore wan et al.
motivators into a small set factors while retaining the majority of original information .
comparison.
to compare with oss motivations rq2 we used the survey data in a recent study on oss motivations by gerosa et al.
.
the study conducted a survey of oss contributors to measure oss motivations using likert scale questions.
the likert scale questions capture ten categories of oss motivations namely ideology altruism kinship fun reputation reciprocity learning own use career and pay as proposed by von krogh et al.
.
in terms of the comparisons across subgroups of our survey respondents we classified our respondents into different subgroups based on their characteristics.
we used the wilcoxon rank sum test for likert scale answers to perform comparisons.
all statistical tests assumed a p value .05as a significant level.
benjamini hochberg correction was applied to adjust p values in multiple comparisons.
in addition we used cliff s delta to measure the magnitude of the differences because cliff s delta is reported to be more robust and reliable than cohen s delta .
the magnitudes are assessed with the thresholds as specified in if .
the effect size is negligible if .
.
the effect size is small if .
.
the effect size is medium and otherwise the effect size is large.
correlation analysis.
we conducted correlational analyses to explore the associations between likert scale ratings of motivation and other variables in our survey results.
given ordinal variables were involved we used spearman correlational analysis to evaluate the associations.
.
.
evaluation of data quality and measurement model.
we evaluated the quality of collected survey data followed by an evaluation of the measurement model of motivations.
sampling adequacy.
before applying exploratory factor analysis on our survey data we checked the suitability of the data for factor analysis.
specifically we calculated two statistical measures for our constructs related to motivations i.e.
kaiser meyer olkin measure of sampling adequacy kmo and bartlett s test of sphericity .
the result of kmo .
is well above the recommended threshold .
which indicates that sampling is adequate and factor analysis is appropriate for our survey data.
the bartlett s test of sphericity is highly significant at p .
which indicates that factor analysis could be worthwhile.
internal consistency reliability.
internal consistency reliability refers to the extent to which the items are consistent with one another.
we use cronbach s as a measure of internal consistency.
the cronbach s values for our motivation items score well above the recommended threshold .
with all items scoring between .
and .

job responsibility q3 is the most frequent theme to emerge as a motivator to contribute to inner source projects discussed by of the interviewees.
out of the interviewees mentioned learning new things q9 as their motivators to participate in inner source projects which is the second most frequent theme for motivation in our interviews.
in the questionnaire we asked the respondents i contribute to the primary inner source project because ... and presented the motivators derived from our interviews.
as shown in figure the top three motivators are helping others q5 sharing q6 and belief in effectiveness of inner source q4 .
specifically and of our respondents agree or strongly agree with the three motivators respectively.
it is worth noting that the top three motivators are respondents internal motivations.
meanwhile external motivations i.e.
job responsibility q3 and support from managers leaders q2 are reported less important than internal motivations.
we further used exploratory factor analysis to investigate underlying structure of the identified motivators.
the exploratory factor analysis suggests that of the motivators load on two factors one motivator q12 did not conform to any particular factor.
the factor loadings for each motivator are presented in the last two columns of table loadings less than .

factor loadings indicate how strongly each item correlates with its underlying factor.
we labeled the two factors as internal motivation factor that reflects the belief and desire of a software practitioner e.g.

no statistically significant differences exist between these two subgroups.
difference in motivation across types of inner source projects .
our respondents contribute to diverse types of inner source projects in terms of objectives and governance models as shown in figure .
the majority of our respondents have contributed to utilityoriented projects.
in the meantime most of our respondents reported that their primary inner source projects are governed byesec fse november singapore singapore wan et al.
a single organizational unit.
note that respondents selected other and explained that their projects are governed by individuals.
we further examined if statistically significant differences exist in motivations across contributors of various types of inner source projects.
the results indicate that statistically significant difference exists in the sharing motivator q6 between contributors of utilityoriented projects and those of service oriented projects p .
with a small effect size .

.
comparison of motivation inner source vs. open source rq2 in rq2 we compared what motivates practitioners to contribute to inner source projects with what drives them to participate in open source projects.
previous studies have extensively investigated the motivation of practitioners to contribute to open source projects.
thus we use the survey data from a most recent study gerosa et al.
s work for the comparison.
gerosa et al.
conducted a survey of oss contributors to measure oss motivations using likert scale motivation items.
we started by qualitatively studying the relationship between our motivation items identified in rq1 as shown in table and those in gerosa et al.
s work.
for each motivation item we coded the corresponding survey question by removing words related to inner source.
with the codes of survey questions we identified the related oss motivators as described in gerosa et al.
s work.
finally we identified common motivators of software practitioners as listed in the first two columns in table .
the common motivators were distributed across out of oss motivation categories proposed by von krogh et al.
.
the uncovered three categories include ideology reciprocity andlearning .
note that we identified learning new things q9 as a motivator to contribute inner source projects.
given that we did not find a match for q9 in gerosa et al.
s work we did not conduct further comparison for the learning motivation.
we then investigated the differences in likert ratings for the common motivators as shown in table .
the two likert distribution subcolumns present the distributions of ratings for motivators to inner source and open source development.
for the likert distributions the leftmost bar indicates strong disagreement the middle bar indicates neutrality and the rightmost bar indicates strong agreement.
for example most software practitioners strongly agreed that they contribute to inner source projects because of their job responsibility q3 but strongly disagreed that they are paid to contribute to open source projects.
thep value column indicates whether the difference in the agreement for each motivator is statistically significant.
the table is sorted by the p values with benjamini hochberg correction.
statistical significant differences at a confidence level are highlighted in green benjamini hochberg corrected p values .
.
theeffect size column indicates the magnitude of difference in the agreement for each motivation.
we used cliff s delta to measure effect sizes.
effect sizes are additionally colored on a gradient from blue to orange based on the magnitudes of difference as referring to the interpretation of cliff s delta blue color means the former group is more likely to agree with the statement and orange color means the latter group is more likely to agree with the statement.based on the observed statistically significant differences in motivations we can say with some certainty that software improvement and job responsibility software practitioners tend to have significantly higher levels of software improvement q10 and job responsibility q3 motivations to contribute to inner source projects than to open source projects with large effect sizes .613and .
.
fun software practitioners tend to have a slightly lower level of motivation for fun q8 to dedicate time to inner source projects than to open source projects with a small effect size .

effect of motivation on contribution level and continuance intention rq3 rq3 explores whether motivation is predictive for the contribution level and continuance intention of software practitioners in inner source development.
specifically we conducted correlation analyses to estimate the impact of the motivators identified in rq1 on contribution level and continuance intention of software practitioners.
we measured the contribution level as hours per week software practitioners spent on their primary inner source projects and the continuance intention as the agreement level to a statement in our survey describing their intention to contribute to future inner source development.
contribution level.
as shown in figure a the distribution of hours spent on their primary inner source projects is skewed as our respondents reported.
out of respondents .
spend less than hours per week on their primary inner source projects.
on the contrary .
of our respondents spend more than hours per week.
we further investigated the relationship between financial rewards and contribution levels of practitioners in inner source projects.
.
of our respondents reported that they have received extra pay beyond their salaries to work on inner source projects.
software practitioners with extra pay tend to dedicate more time per week to inner source projects than those without extra pay.
however the difference is not statically significant according to the wilcoxon rank sum test.
continuance intention.
most of our respondents .
strongly agree or agree that they are willing to involve in future inner source development as shown in figure b .
we noticed that out of respondents .
were neutral or disagreed when asked if they plan to make future contributions to inner source projects.
the respondents with no low continuance intention contribute to various types of inner source projects as shown in figure .
among the respondents with no low continuance intention participate inexploration oriented projects governed by a single organizational unit.
we notice that two contributors out of five in service oriented projects governed by multiple organizational units show no low continuance intention.what motivates software practitioners to contribute to inner source?

we observed that statistically significant correlations exist between motivation and contribution level as well as between motivation and continuance intention effect on contribution level.
the levels of the job responsibility motivation q3 are positively correlated with the weekly contribution of software practitioners to the inner source projects.
however somewhat unexpectedly the levels of other measured motivators are not significantly correlated with the levels of practitioners weekly contribution.
effect on continuance intention.
the levels of all measured motivators are positively correlated with the intention of software practitioners to contribute to future inner source development.
the belief in effectiveness of inner source motivation q4 shows the greatest correlation .
with continuance intention among the motivators.
in addition to the motivator q4 the levels of other motivatorsesec fse november singapore singapore wan et al.
e.g.
career development are moderately correlated with continuance intention.
a statistically significant but weak correlation exists between three motivators e.g.
reputation and continuance intention.
note that the job responsibility has the smallest correlation .
with continuance intention among the motivators.
discussion we reflect our findings from the research questions delving into factors that can help in attracting and retaining software practitioners for inner source development.
we also highlight the avenues of future research.
internal motivation.
software practitioners are motivated by their belief in effectiveness of inner source to contribute to inner source projects rq1 .
specifically of the survey respondents strongly agree or agree that they contribute to inner source projects because adoption of inner source can benefit my company organization q4 .
on the other hand this motivator is positively correlated with the continuance intention of software practitioners in inner source projects with the greatest correlation coefficient across the motivators rq3 .
the results implies that the cultural shift for adopting inner source development may directly impact the success and sustainability of inner source projects.
in order to achieve effectiveness and buy in of practitioners it is essential to demonstrate the benefits of inner source first.
a previous study claimed that organizations usually lack measurement capabilities for evaluating inner source initiatives to communicate the benefits.
future studies could put more effort into providing metrics to evaluate the improvements due to the adoption of inner source.
compared to open source development software practitioners tend to have a significantly higher level of software improvement motivation to contribute to inner source development rq2 .
the improvement of software requires a community of users and developers within an organization so that the software project can benefit from organization wide input and continuously evolve.
however the organizational units within an organization may aim for different goals and have different priorities.
thus the organization could perform a certain level of coordination to guide the improvement of inner source software.
external motivation.
thejob responsibility motivation was bottom ranked in our survey results rq2 .
specifically of our survey respondents strongly agree or agree that they contribute to inner source projects because contributing to inner source is my job responsibility q3 .
the low rank of external motivations are observed in previous oss studies e.g.
and .
at the same time the job responsibility motivation was the only variable among the identified motivators positively correlated with the contribution level of software practitioners but with the weakest correlation with the continuance intention of practitioners rq3 .
job responsibility could enable software practitioners to dedicate time to inner source development but has a weak impact on their continuance intention.
organizations may provide more flexibility to their employees e.g.
flexibility for task selection to retain contributors and enable inner source communities to flourish.as another external motivation support from managers leaders shows a moderate positive correlation with the continuance intention of practitioners rq3 .
the support from managers or leaders is more likely to lead to software practitioners sustainable contribution in inner source development.
financial incentives.
we expected extra pay beyond the salary to affect the contribution level and continuance intention of software practitioners but no statistically significant difference is introduced by extra pay rq3 .
this may be because we only have a limited number of respondents out of who contribute to inner source projects with extra pay.
future studies could explore the effect of financial incentives on contribution level and continuance intention in inner source development.
variety in roles.
.
of our respondents out of take coder as their project centric roles rq1 .
only .
of the respondents joined their primary inner source projects by taking non coder roles.
the percentage of non coder contributors in inner source projects is lower than the percentage .
in oss projects as reported in gerosa et al.
s work .
we observed that most of the non coder contributors take core community centric roles e.g.
strategist andmentor .
future work could investigate whether various roles in inner source development play different from those in open source development.
the prevalent existence of community centric roles in inner source development rq1 is in line with the findings from oss studies .
thus organizations may define an entry path in terms of community centric roles for newcomers.
threats to validity internal validity.
the interviewees were selected by a contact at each tech company.
the procedure partially alleviates the threat of selection bias beacause the interviewer has no contact with interviewees before the interviews.
the threat of selection bias would always be present when the interviewees were not fully randomly sampled.
however given that our interviews include practitioners with various job roles and from different companies the threat has limited effect.
some of our respondents may have a poor understanding of the questions.
to reduce the impact of this issue we included an i don t understand option in the survey and ignored responses marked as such.
we also dropped responses that were submitted by people whose job roles are none of these software development testing and project management.
two of the authors translated our survey to chinese to ensure that respondents from china could understand our survey well.
to reduce the bias of presenting the survey bilingually we carefully translated our survey to ensure there is no ambiguity between english and chinese terms.
we polished the translation by improving clarity and understandability according to the feedback from our pilot survey.
construct validity.
in our interviews the evaluation apprehension was ameliorated by the anonymity of the interviewees as well as the guarantee that all the information obtained during the interviews would be used only by the researchers.
the interviewer might have influenced the interviewees by asking specific questions.
to mitigate this risk we used open ended questions to elicit as much information as possible.
the interviewees may have a different understanding of the questions than what we had intended.what motivates software practitioners to contribute to inner source?
esec fse november singapore singapore to minimize this aspect we encouraged the interviewees to ask questions at all times.
our survey results are based on respondents self reported responses which may be subject to bias and not exactly represent reality.
we followed recommendations to reduce social desirability bias by ensuring respondents anonymity .
our study made a direct comparison of the responses to matched survey questions regarding motivators between two surveys ours and gerosa et al.
s from their replication package9.
to match survey questions between the two surveys two authors removed context related words e.g.
inner source and open source and coded the survey questions.
they discussed the codes and agreed on the matched questions between the two surveys.
the matched survey questions between the two surveys tend to capture a common motivation.
nonetheless the differences in the wording of matched survey questions may influence the responses respondents would give in unintended ways and further introduce bias to the comparison of survey data.
to minimize the unintended effects from wording we followed a guideline for defining survey items provided by the bruso model making sure that the survey items are brief relevant unambiguous specific and objective.
we also conducted a pilot survey to collect feedback and further improve the clarity and understandability of survey items.
conclusion validity.
the interviews were conducted at different locations and each interview was done in one session.
thus answers were not influenced by internal discussions.
to ensure that the interview instrument is of high quality to obtain reliable measures we conducted several pilots to improve the questions and layout of the interview guide prior to conducting the interviews.
we did our best to randomly select survey respondents from both tech companies and open source projects.
our survey respondents come from countries across continents who are working in various job roles with a wide range of experience.
external validity.
to improve the generalizability of our findings we interviewed interviewees from various companies.
we further surveyed respondents from countries across four continents who are working for various companies or contributing to opensource projects that are hosted on github in various job roles.
conclusion and future work this work followed a mixed methods approach to explore software practitioners motivation to contribute to inner source projects.
we identified motivators that drive practitioners to participate in inner source development as well as several statistically significant differences between the identified motivators and oss motivators that motivate practitioners to participate in open source projects.
besides we observed several statistically significant correlations between the identified motivators and software practitioners contribution level and continuance intention in inner source development.
future work could put efforts into investigating other factors that impact practitioners contribution and continuance intention in inner source projects and leveraging the factors to design strategies to sustain and grow inner source development.
