introduction software logs are essential for various software engineering tasks such as model inference and anomaly detection sincelogsareoftentheonlydataavailablethatrecordtherun time behavior of a software system.
in general a log is a sequence of log messages generated by log printing statements in the source code.
for example the execution of the log printing statement log retry counter when the program variable counter evaluates to will generate the log message retry .whilesuchlogmessagescontainvaluableruntimeinformation theycannotbedirectlyprocessedbylog based analysis techniques that require structured input logs instead of free formed log messages.
log message template identification aims to address the issue by decomposinglogmessagesintofixedpartscalledmessagetemplates templates inshort characterizingtheeventtypes andvariable parts containing the parameter values of the events which are determined at run time.
for the above example message the event template would be retry where symbol indicates the position of the parameter value in the variable part.

nevertheless in both studies we observed three important issues regarding the accuracy evaluation of template identification techniques.
first bothstudiesuseddifferentaccuracymetrics namelygroupingaccuracy ga 1andparsingaccuracy pa leadingtodifferent rankings for several techniques.
however these evaluation results have not been compared with each other yet making it hard to clearly understand how and why the rankings of template identificationtechniquesvarywhenusingdifferentaccuracymetrics.
furthermore some accuracy metrics can return misleading results sincetheyaresensitivetothenumberofrepeatedlogmessages.this can be a significant issue for systems whose logs contain repeated logmessages e.g.
heartbeatmessages thatarenotimportantin terms of the system s business logic a common situation.
second both studies determined the oracle templates which represent the ground truth of template identification results by manuallyinspectinglogmessages whichisanerror proneprocess.
though such a process is unavoidable when the source code is not accessible the impact of using incorrect oracle templates on the assessment of the accuracy of template identification techniques is unclear for the various accuracy metrics.
third bothstudiesdidnotprovideanyinformationregarding the templates incorrectly identified by template identification techniques.
due to such lack of information we cannot understand the weaknessesandlimitationsofthevarioustechniquesforlogtemplate identification making it difficult to select the best technique for a given application context.
contributions.
in this paper we address the above issues by providing guidelinesforassessing theaccuracyof logmessage template identification techniques and assessing the applicationofsuchguidelinesthroughacomprehensiveevaluationof14 existing template identification techniques.
more specifically to address the issue related to the choice of accuracy metrics we first describe new metrics called template accuracy ta metrics that unlike ga and pa are not sensitive to thenumberoflogmessages.wethendiscusswhichmetrics ga pa orta aremoreappropriatedependingonthenatureofthesoftwareengineeringtaskinwhichlogmessagetemplatesareused.theideabehindtametricsisthattemplateidentificationshouldberegardedasaninformationretrievalprocessinwhichmessagetemplatesare identified from a collection of log messages.

though 1096guidelines for assessing the accuracy of log message template identification techniques icse may pittsburgh pa usa both studies made essential steps towards a comprehensive assessment of the accuracy of log template identification techniques we observed three important issues the choice of accuracy metrics determining oracle templates and incorrectly identified templates.
the three issues are discussed in detail in the following subsections.
.
the choice of accuracy metrics the choice of accuracy metrics is naturally of great importance in evaluatingtheaccuracyoflogtemplateidentificationtechniques.
initially zhu et al .
used the grouping accuracy ga metric toassesstheaccuracyoflogtemplateidentification.theideabehind the ga metric is that template identification can be regarded as a clustering process in which log messages with different log events are clustered into different groups.
therefore this metricchecks if log messages that are grouped together by having thesame identified template indeed form the same group as in the ground truth.specifically thega metricis definedas theratio of correctly parsed log messages thanks to the identified templates over the total number of log messages where a log message is considered correctlyparsed ifandonlyifitisgroupedwithotherlog messages in a way consistent with the ground truth.
however dai etal.
usedanothermetric called parsingaccuracy pa since thegametricdoesnotconsiderwhethertheidentifiedtemplates are identical to the oracle ones but only accounts for how the identified templates support the log message grouping activity.
the pa metric is defined as the ratio of correctly parsed log messagesover the total number of log messages the same as for the ga metric where a log message is considered to be correctly parsed ifandonlyif allitsstatictextanddynamicvariables i.e.
fixedand variablesparts arecorrectlyidentified .asaresult thega and pa metrics return different results in assessing the accuracy of log template identification techniques.
to better understand the ga and pa metrics let us consider the scenario in which a software engineer or a researcher wants to assesstheaccuracyoftwotemplateidentificationtechniques calledaandb usingthesetofexamplelogmessages mex m1 ... m6 andthecorrespondingsetoforacle i.e.
groundtruth templates o o1 ... o5 in table the example is based on a simplified versionofreallogmessagesandtemplatesextractedfromthelog datasetsprovidedbyzhuetal .
.runningtheimplementation of each of the two techniques on mexyields the corresponding set of identified templates ta ta ... ta andtb tb ... tb asshowntable1.noticethatonetemplatematchesoneormore messages e.g.
template ta 1matches both m1andm2.
according to the definition of correctly parsed log messages adopted for computing the ga metric messages m1andm2can be correctly parsedby technique abecause according to ta they are exactly grouped together as they would be by o1 i.e.
the oracle template of m1andm2 .
however message m5cannot be correctly parsedusing ta 3sincethelattergroups m5withanothermessage m4whileo4 i.e.
theoracletemplateof m5 doesnot.forreadability the correctly parsed log messages are marked under column ga in table .
overall only four messages i.e.
m1 m2 m3 andm6 out of six can be correctly parsed using the templates in the set ta ta ... ta resulting in a ga score for technique aequalto4 .
.
similarly the ga score for technique bis2 .
sinceonlytwomessages i.e.
m3andm6 outofsixcanbecorrectly parsed using the templates in the set tb tb ... tb .
just by looking at the ga score one could think that technique ais better than technique b. however eveniftemplate ta 4canbeusedtocorrectlyparsemessagem6in terms of the ga metric it is quite different from oracle template o5.morespecifically template o5containsstring adrin thefixedpart informallysuggestingthatthistemplatematcheslog messages that record different values for the memory location adr.
onthe otherhand thefixedpart oftemplate ta 4isrepresented by string0xff meaning that this template will match log messages thatrecordthe value oxffatanymemorylocation.such alimitationofthegametricisaddressedinthepametric whichconsidersboththefixedandvariablepartsofidentifiedtemplates.inthesame running example the pa score for technique ais2 .
since two messages i.e.
m1andm2 out of six can be correctly parsed by the template ta sinceta 1is identical to its oracle template o1in bothfixedandvariableparts .similarly thepascorefortechnique bis2 .
since two messages i.e.
m3andm6 out of six can be correctly parsed by the templates tb 3andtb .
for readability the log messages correctly parsed in terms of pa are marked under columnpaintable .bylooking atthepa score onecould think that both of the techniques aandbare equally accurate in log template identification which is clearly different from the result obtained when using the ga metric.
while the ga and pa metrics are clearly different both metrics share the same issue they are sensitive to the number of messages contained in the log and not to the number of templates .
thiscan be problematic for systems whose logs contain repeated log messages that are not important in terms of the system s business logic.
for example if a log contains many heartbeat messages that arerepeatedeverysecond thenthegaandpascoresofatemplate identification technique can appear sufficiently high even if thetechnique is only able to correctly identify one template for the heartbeats.inourrunningexample wecanalreadyseethat though technique acorrectly identifies only one template i.e.
ta the pa scoreis2 .33sincetwomessages i.e.
m1andm2 outofsixcan becorrectlyparsedbythetemplate ta .ifwefocusonthenumberof correctlyidentifiedtemplates technique bis better thantechnique asince technique bcorrectly identifies two templates tb 3andtb .
we want to note that choosing a template identification techniquebasedonthegametricisnotanissuepersewhenatemplate identification technique is only used for grouping log messagesbased on the identified templates.
for example for performanceanomaly detection it is sufficient to monitor occurrence patterns e.g.
a repetition of the same event in a short period of time ofthe eventscorrespondingto logmessages withoutconsideringthemessageparametervalues.however inotherscenarios inwhichtheparametervaluesofmessages e.g.
1inm1 matter such asmodel inferencewith guardconditions andadvanced anomalydetectionusingparametervalues itisimportantto choose a log template identification technique based on another accuracy metric that accounts for the correctness of both fixed and variable parts in identified templates.

additionally using different accuracy metrics including the proposedalternative ones to better understand how andwhy the ranking of log template identification techniques vary when using different techniques.
.
determining oracle templates oracle templates are essential to evaluate the accuracy of template identificationtechniques.bothoftheexistingstudiesusedthesame oracle templates generated by zhu et al .
.
the oracle templates weredeterminedbymanuallyinspectinglogmessages.however when we compare them with the corresponding log printing statements in the source code the oracle templates are not always correct.forexample foralogmessage status is false generated by a log printing statement log.info status is var a n engineer with no access to the source code has mistakenly defined anoracletemplate status is false insteadof status is by incorrectly assuming that the token false was hard coded in the log printing statement.
nevertheless manuallydeterminingoracletemplates inthecontext of the study by zhu et al .
was unavoidable since some of thebenchmarklogdatasetswerecollectedfromreal worldsystems that do not provide access to the source code.
furthermore from a morepragmaticperspective thisstrategyisacceptableconsidering thefactthatmanuallygeneratedoracletemplatesare inmostcases very similar to the actual templates extracted from the source code.
however theimpactofusingslightlyincorrectoracletemplatesontheassessmentoftheaccuracyoftemplateidentificationtechniques may vary depending on the accuracy metrics used.
for example thegametriconlyaccountsforhowlogmessagesaregroupedand does not consider whether the technique under evaluation tue correctly identifies templates by accurately decomposing fixed and variable parts therefore one could speculate that the impact of using slightly incorrect oracletemplates could be limited.
proving such assumptions is an open problem.

weproposeasetofheuristic rules that can automatically correct many oracle templates.

.
incorrectly identified templates regardless of the accuracy metric used simply ranking the logtemplate identification techniques by their accuracy scores may notbesufficient.itisalsoimportanttoanalyzewhythetechniques incorrectly identify some templates.
for example let us consider a techniquethathasalowaccuracyscoreonlybecauseitdoesnot correctly recognize ip addresses as variable parts.
in practice such an issue can be easily addressed by modifying the tue to support user defined regular expressions for pre processing structured text strings like ip addresses.
however without additional information about incorrectly identified templates the tue could be perceived as being severely inaccurate even if this is not really the case.
however both existing studies did not provide any information regarding the templates incorrectly identified by template identificationtechniques.suchmissinginformationhindersthepossibility to improve existing techniques by addressing the limitations discovered by experimental assessment.
to address this issue in section .
we propose a technique for analyzing incorrect templates that can help software engineers andresearchersunderstandinwhichwaytemplatesareincorrectly identified.
we also discuss the insights one can get by applying the proposed analysis technique to the empirical evaluation results presented in section .

template accuracy ta metrics.
recall that both ga and pa aresensitivetothenumberofmessagescontainedinthelog which ispossiblymisleadingwhentherearemanyrepetitiveyetuseless messages commonlyfoundinreal worldsystemlogs.toaddress 1098guidelines for assessing the accuracy of log message template identification techniques icse may pittsburgh pa usa this weproposealternativeaccuracymetricsthattakeintoaccount how many templates are correctly identified by the tue.
first wedefinetheconceptof correctlyidentified templates.a template determined by a template identification technique is correctly identified from log messages if and only if it is identical token by token totheoracletemplate s ofthelogmessages.in other words the correctness of an identified template must be determinedbycomparisontoits corresponding oracletemplate s .
more precisely let mbe a set of log messages obe the set of oracletemplatesfor m andtvbeasetoftemplatesfor midentified by a tue v. we introduce two auxiliary functions msg tv 2m which givenanidentifiedtemplate t returnsthesetofmessages frommwhosetemplateis t ot m o which givenamessage m returnstheoracletemplateof mincludedin o.wedefinethe set of corresponding oracle templates in ofor a template t denoted and definedas corrot t ot m m msg t .forinstance inour running example mex oex andtashown in figure corrot ta is o1 becausemsg ta m1 m2 andot m1 ot m2 o1.
basedonthedefinitionofcorrespondingoracletemplates wesay thata template t tviscorrectlyidentified correct for simplicity by tuevif and only if corrot t t otherwise we say tis incorrectlyidentified incorrect forsimplicity by v.fortherunning example above ta 1is correct since corrot ta o1 ta o n the other hand ta 3is incorrect since corrot ta o3 o4 ta .
notice that our definition of correctly identified template relies on the set oforacle templates corresponding to a certain message.
itisnotenoughthattheidentifiedtemplateisincludedintheset of oracle templates o to be correct the identified template has to be identical to the one and only oracle template corresponding to the messages for which it was identified.
for instance in our running example even if there were an additional oracle template o6 o primeex whereo primeex oex o6 that is identical to ta 4such thatta ta o primeex ta 4could not be considered correct because corrot ta o5 ta .
usingthedefinitionofcorrectlyidentifiedtemplate weintroduce twotametrics precision ta pta and recall ta rta collectively denoted by pta rta which are based on the standard metricsprecision andrecallused in the information retrieval domain.
pta is defined as t tv corrot t t tv theratio of correctly identifiedtemplatesoverthetotalnumberofidentifiedtemplates indi catingthe precisionofthetueatthetemplatelevel.rtaisdefined as t tv corrot t t o theratio of correctly identified templates overthetotalnumberoforacletemplates indicatingthe recallofthe tue at the template level.

thereareinterestingrelationships among ga pa and pta rta.
specifically when pta r t a 1w eh a v eg a 1be cause log message groups determinedby oracle templates must be the same as the groups determined by identifiedtemplates giventhatall identifiedtemplatesare correct and the total number of identified templates is the same as the number of oracle templates.
for the same reason when p a 1w e have ga .

how to choose appropriate metrics.
given a target use case oneshouldchooseanappropriatemetrictoevaluatetheaccuracyof the tue.
the two important criteria to consider when performing thischoiceare whetherthevariablepartsoflogmessagesare usedand whethertheimportanceof amessageisproportionalto its frequency.
when the variable parts of log messages are not used in the targetusecase thenoneshouldusethegametric.forexample thelogkeyanomalydetectionmodelofdeeplog aimstodetect behavioral anomalies using the system s event sequences recorded in the log.
it uses log template identification to convert a sequence of log messages into a sequence of log keys i.e.
template ids .
therefore the ga metric that only considers message grouping isthebesttoassesstheaccuracyoftemplateidentificationinthis use case.
when the variable parts of log messages matter in the target use case one should additionally consider the second criterionabove if the importance of a log message is proportional to itsfrequency then pa should be used otherwise pta rta should be used.
this is because pa is sensitive to the proportion of log messageswhereaspta rtaarenot.forexample deeplog has anothermodelfordetectingirregularparametervalues whichis not detected by the above log key anomaly detection model.
since the irregular parameter detection model needs different parameter values i.e.
variable parts of log messages accurately extracted by logtemplateidentification gacannotbeusedtoadequatelyassess the accuracy of template identification in this case.
furthermore if the importance of system events recorded in the log does notdepend on the frequency of the event messages then using pa can yield misleading accuracy evaluation results as pa counts the numberoflogmessagesparsedbycorrectlyidentifiedtemplates.
inthiscase pta rtashouldbeusedtoassesstheaccuracyofthe tue.
to summarize by evaluating the two aforementioned criteria in the context of the target use cases one can choose an appropriate metric among ga pa and pta rta to assess the accuracy of log template identification techniques.

analysis of incorrect templates.
this analysis is based on the observation that template identification can also be seen as the process ofgeneralizing logmessages byconverting fixedparts into variableparts.inourrunningexample showninfigure1 technique ageneralizesthetwomessages m1 retry andm2 retry tothetemplate ta retry byconvertingthesecondtokenof bothmessagesintoavariable.thus incorrectlyidentifiedtemplatescanbeseenasincorrectlygeneralizedtemplates.basedonthisidea weclassify incorrecttemplatesintothree types over generalized og under generalized ug and mixed mx .
by this we can understand whether the tue suffers from over generalization under generalization or both.
the core of this three way classification is the generalization relationship between templates which is defined in terms of theformal language defined by the templates.
since a template can be seen as a regular expression2 we denote by lang t the regular languagedefinedbyatemplate t.wesaythatatemplate txismore generalthanatemplate tyifandonlyif lang ty lang tx .inour running example o2is moregeneral than ta 2because allpotential logmessagesthatmatch ta 2willalsomatch o2buttheoppositedoes nothold e.g.

rq1 ranking of techniques methodology.
to answer rq1 we executed the log template identification techniques on each dataset in the benchmark and used their output to compute the accuracy in terms of the ga pa and ta pta and rta metrics.
for each execution of a technique on a dataset we set a timeout of hours.
to account for the randomness of lke and molfi we repeated the correspondingexperiments times and computed the average results.
noticethat we did not use oracle template correction because it will be investigated in rq2.

this means that for all techniques there are manyidentified templates that are incorrect but happen to be able to grouplogmessagesinawayconsistentwiththegroundtruth.this impliesthat thega metricis inadequateto measurethe accuracy of a template identification technique when identifying correct templates both fixed and variable parts is important.
the left hand side of table shows the ranking of the different techniques in terms of the ga pa and pta rta scores.
the techniques are sorted in descending order by average accuracyscore computed over the datasets .
we can see that drain is ranked1stforgaandpta rta butnotforpa.inotherwords drain outperforms all other techniques both at correctly grouping messages and at identifying correct templates.
however slctoutperforms drain in terms of pa meaning that slct is betterthan drain at identifying correct templates when the number oflog messages corresponding to the correctly identified templates is also considered.
notice that slct is ranked 10th for ga but 1st for pa.thisisnottheonlycasewheretherankingofthetechniques differs depending on the metric used for example lenma is better thanaelintermsofga butaelisbetterthanlenmaintermsof pa and pta rta.
this happens because lenmacorrectly groups more log messages than ael even though ael correctly identifies moretemplatesthanlenma.suchresultsstronglyimplythatthe choice of the accuracy metric matters a lot when comparing log template identification techniques.
to assess how the ranking of the techniques varies when using the different accuracy metrics we measured spearman s rank correlationbetweentherankingsofeachpairofaccuracymetrics.a rank correlation coefficient ranges between and the more similarthecomparedrankings thehigherthevalueof .wefound that thoughtheresultingrankcorrelationvariesdependingonthe accuracymetricscompared rangingfrom0.

for allx ga pa pta rta the difference between xotcand xorgis statistically insignificant across log datasets based on the mann whitney u test with a level of significance .

given that many oracle templates .
on average for all datasets were incorrect and thus modified by applying oracle templatecorrections itissurprisingtoseesuchalimitedimpactofthe corrections.
through a more thorough analysis we found that this was the case because many templates identified by the techniques are different enough from the corresponding oracle templates tosuchanextentthattheyare incorrect regardlessofthecorrections that can be applied to the oracle templates.
this implies that the impact oforacle template correctionswould bemuch larger ifthe techniques fared better at correctly identifying templates.
notice that ga otcis non zero for many techniques even though the ga metric ignores whether the identified templates are correct in terms of their fixed and variables parts.
this is because the numberoforacletemplates andthereforethenumberoflogmessage groupsgeneratedbytheoracletemplates canbechangedbythe oracle template correction step when two or more incorrect oracle templates become the same oracle template after applying a correction.

discussion in rq1 the results obtained for the ga metric are exactly the sameasthosecomputedbythereplicationpackage3oftheoriginal study .
however the results obtained for the pa metric are quitedifferentfromthosereportedbydaietal .
.forexample on average for all datasets drain achieved a pa score of withoutoracletemplatecorrection seetable5 whichismuchlower than the pa score of reported by dai et al .

we could not reproducetheirresultssince theymanuallycheckedtheparsing 1104guidelines for assessing the accuracy of log message template identification techniques icse may pittsburgh pa usa resultstocalculatepavaluesand theirreplicationpackage4contains an accuracy evaluation script only for calculating ga scores not pa scores.
one of the most surprising results from our evaluation is the significantgapbetweengaandtheothermetricsintermsofaccuracy scores for the same templateidentification techniques for example on average for all datasets drain achieved a ga score of but its pa and pta rta scores were only and respectively.inotherwords bytakingintoaccountthecorrectness of fixed and variable parts of identified templates we get a very differentpictureoftheaccuracyofthetechniquesincomparisonto theexistingstudy relyingonthegametric.theresultsemphasizetheimportanceofusingadequatemetricstoassesstemplate identificationresultsinthecontextoftargetusecases.forexample if the parameter values of log messages are used by a log based analysis task e.g.
model inference with guard conditions and advanced anomaly detection using parameter values accuracy should be assessed using pa or ta scores since they adequately measureatechnique sabilitytocorrectlyidentifythevariablepartsoflogmessages.however onemightarguethatpaandtametrics are too strict to fairly indicate the usefulness of template identi fication techniques as no degree of correctness is accounted for individual templates even for the cases where the variable parts of log messages matter.
more studies are therefore required to better understand the relationship between various accuracy scores oftemplate identification techniques and their actual usefulness in specific applications.
for some of the techniques e.g.
drain the importance of oracle template corrections is confirmed by the evaluation results.
however overall theimpactofsuchcorrectionsonaccuracyscores is limited.
based on our analysis we reckon that the more accurate the technique the more likely its ranking is to be significantly affectedbyoracletemplatecorrections.sincealltechniques tovari ousdegrees farerelativelypoorly asdiscussedabove thisresultinlimitedimpactonaccuracy.inthefuture astemplateidentification techniques are expected to improve oracle template corrections will increasingly become important.
wealsoshowthattheanalysisofincorrectlyidentifiedtemplates canprovideinsightsonhowtoimproveindividualtechniquesby understanding their limitations in terms of the over and undergeneralizationoftemplates.nevertheless sincedecreasingtheovergeneralizationmayincreaseunder generalizationandviceversa how to practically improve the accuracy of the techniques remains an open problem for future work.

threats to validity using a specific set of log datasets is a potential threat to external validity.
however the benchmark contains log datasets from real worldsystemsandthecorrespondingoracletemplates andhasbeenusedinpreviousstudiesfocusedonlogtemplateidentificationtechniques .nevertheless furtherexperimentswithdifferent benchmarks are required to improve the generalizability of our results.

.
furthermore as mentioned above wecheckedthatthegascoresobtainedbyourexperiments are exactly the same as those computed by the replication package of zhu et al.
.
the heuristic rules for oracle template correction can also be potential threats to internal validity.
ideally correct oracle tem plates extracted from the source code are mandatory to validate theheuristicrules.atthesametime suchextractiontaskisvery challenging even for open source programs.
this is because differentversionsofthesameprogrammayhavedifferentlogprinting statementswhilethelogsprovidedinthebenchmark donot havethecorrespondingprogramversioninformation.therefore for each program one should manually check many previous versions to find log printing statements that would generate the given log messages moreover older versions may no longer be available.

wecouldfindthemonlyforhdfs hadoop andopenstacklogs and confirmed that the oracle templates modified by our heuristic rulesareindeedcorrectwithrespecttotheloggingstatementsin the source code.

data availability thereplicationpackageofourempiricalevaluation includingthe pythonimplementationsforcomputingtametricsandapplying oracle template correction and incorrect template analysis is available on figshare .
conclusion and future work in this paper we provide three guidelines for evaluating the accuracy of log message template identification techniques.
we alsoassess the application of such guidelines through a comprehensiveevaluationof14logtemplateidentificationtechniquesusing a benchmark composed of real world log datasets previously usedintheliterature.theevaluationresultsshowthattheaccuracy assessment results for different techniques may significantly vary depending on whether the guidelines are followed.
as part of future work we plan to further refine the accuracy metrics for example by incorporating the concept of edit distance to compute the similaritybetween identified templates andtheir corresponding oracles leveraging the idea proposed by nedelkoskiet al .
.
we also plan to apply template identification techniques to specific applications such as anomaly detection and measure the impact of incorrectly identifiedtemplates on the performance of such applications.
