the ase conference series is the premier research forum for automated s oftware engineering research and practice.
each year it brings together researchers and prac titioners from academia and industry to discuss foundations techniques and tools for automated analysis design implementation testing and maintenance of large software syst ems.
ase was held between october 28th and november in the historic sheraton grand hotel in sacramento california usa.
after a number of years o f virtual conferences and then a few years of hybrid formats this year we are happy to report the conference was fully in person allowing unfettered social networking and exchange of scientifi c ideas.
this publication contains the proceedings of ase .
the firs t and the last day of the conference were allocated to workshops tutorials and the doct oral symposium.
the main conference was held from october 29th to october 31th and featu red three keynotes as well as technical research new idea journal first tool demonstration industry showcase posters and student research competition papers.
the goal of ase is to support developers with automated solutio ns for the construction and evolution of modern ever more complex and critical software systems.
the conference technical program features the latest development in the area of automated software engineering including but not limited to research on applications of arti ficial intelligence and machine learning to automated software engineering automated program synthesis and repair mobile application development verification and validation program analysis sec urity quality assurance and of course different types of software tools.
ase has been supported by many organizing committee member s including numerous members from the university of california davis with its premier software engineering research programs and research labs of more than faculty members o f the computer science department are actively involved in software engineering resear ch and several are well known community leaders.
we thank all organizing committee members fo r their support making the conference a success!
the ase program included three exceptional keynote speaker s dr. korina pasareanu from nasa ames cmu dr. charles sutton from google deepmind and pro f. koushik sen from uc berkeley.
their talks started each day of the conference excit ing all the attendees with profound thoughts and novel applications.
a new record number of submissions has been received in almost every track of ase with a total of papers submitted.
this includes papers submitted to the main research track papers submitted to the nier track to tool demonstrations to industry showcase to journal first and to students research competition.
xxxix the research track followed a double anonymous review process in which manuscripts were anonymized at submission.
authors identities were only reveale d for accepted papers upon conclusion of the review period.
out of submissions to the research track submissions were desk rejected for various major violations of scope and or formatting.
the remaining submissions went through a thorough review process.
during this process each submission was reviewed by at least three program committee members and was intensively discussed online.
at the end of the discussion period submissions were accepted conditionally provided that the authors adequately address the reviewers comments in the r evision.
overall this careful and thorough review process resulted in the final selection of papers accepted to the research track.
our sincere thanks go to saikat chakraborty and yuxia zhang who served as review process co chairs and helped monitor the quality of submissions and reviews all members of the program committee and all the authors for their hard work and contributions!
the ase journal first track accepted ase relevant papers from several top software engineering journals including automated software engineering journal ieee transaction of software engineering acm transactions on software engineering and methodology empirical software engineering journal and journal of systems and software .
many thanks to the track chairs wing lam and wei le and the committee members.
ase traditionally has a vibrant tool demonstrations track and a large number of high quality demonstrations were submitted and a total of demo papers wer e accepted.
many thanks to the track chairs marcel b hme and lingming zhang and the comm ittee members.

open source software community.
while vulnerabilities are officially expected to be patched before being disclosed patching vulnerabilities is complicated and remains a struggle for many organizations.
to patch vulnerabilities security practitioners typically track vulnerable issue reports irs and analyze their relevant insecure code to generate potential patches.
however the relevant insecure code may not be explicitly specified and practitioners cannot track the insecure code in the repositories thus limiting their ability to generate patches.
in such cases providing examples of insecure code and the corresponding patches would benefit the security developers to better locate and resolve the actual insecure code.
in this paper we propose patuntrack an automated approach to generating patch examples from irs without tracked insecure code.
patuntrack utilizes auto prompting to optimize the large language model llm to make it applicable for analyzing the vulnerabilities described in irs and generating appropriate patch examples.
specifically it first generates the completed description of the vulnerability triggering path vtp from vulnerable irs.
then it corrects potential hallucinations in the vtp description with external golden knowledge.
finally it generates top kpairs of insecure code and patch example based on the corrected vtp description.
to evaluate the performance of patuntrack we conducted experiments on vulnerable irs.
the experimental results show that patuntrack can obtain the highest performance and improve the traditional llm baselines by .
matchfix and .
fix on average in patch example generation.
furthermore patuntrack was applied to generate patch examples for newly disclosed vulnerable irs.
out of replies from the authors of these irs confirmed the usefulness of the patch examples generated by patuntrack indicating that they can benefit from these examples for patching the vulnerabilities.

introduction security patches are essential for enhancing the stability and robustness of projects in the open source software oss community.
in the software engineering institute sei at carnegie mellon university released the cert guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure cvd which officially states that individuals or organizations should deploy a patch or take other remediation action before they disclose a vulnerability to the public security databases such as common vulnerabilities and exposure cve .
however patching vulnerabilities is complicated and remains a struggle for many organizations .
for example a vulnerability in the project python markdown2 has no fix and welcome pull requests for a long time as is reported in the issue trentm python markdown2 issues .
these unpatched vulnerabilities can be utilized by attackers through deploying exploits to harm the affected systems e.g.
zero day and one day attacks resulting in millions dollars of business losses .
oss developers typically report vulnerabilities through the issue reports irs .
security practitioners who manage the vulnerability disclosure can then track these irs with issue tracking systems and analyze the relevant insecure code to generate potential patches.
however the relevant insecure code may not be explicitly specified and practitioners cannot track the insecure code in the repositories thus limiting their ability to generate patches.
in such cases providing examples of insecure code and the corresponding patches would benefit the security developers to better locate and patch the actual insecure code.
in general generating example insecure code and patches is challenging mainly due to the semantic gaps between code and natural language as well as the information omission in developer s description of the venerability in the irs.
our preliminary study in section .1shows that .
of vulnerable irs have no insecure code tracked with either manual analysis or state of the art sota commit trackers and over of them were successfully exploited by attackers.

patch examples based on the irs without tracked insecure code which can help security practitioners patch vulnerabilities soon after the irs are created by the developers.
in this paper we propose an automatic approach i.e.
patuntrack which generates patch examples from irs without tracked insecure code.
it optimizes the large language model llm with auto prompting to make it applicable for analyzing the types and triggering logic of vulnerabilities from their textual descriptions and generating appropriate patches.
patuntrack consists of three main steps first it generates the description of the vulnerability triggering path vtp from ir which captures how the vulnerability is triggered.
second it corrects potential hallucinations in the vtp description with external golden knowledge.
third it utilizes the vtp description to predict the patch types and generates top kpairs insecure code and patch example.
to evaluate the performance of patuntrack we conducted experiments on vulnerable irs.
the results show that patuntrack achieves the highest performance and improves the traditional llm baselines by .
matchfix and .
fix on average in patch example generation.
furthermore we applied patuntrack to generate patch examples for newly disclosed vulnerable irs that do not have tracked insecure code and asked the authors whether our patch examples can assist them with patching the vulnerabilities.
we have received replies from the authors for irs and replies confirmed the usefulness of the patch examples generated by patuntrack indicating that they can benefit from these examples for patching the vulnerabilities.
to summarize this paper makes the following main contributions technique patuntrack an automated approach to generate patch examples for vulnerable irs without tracked insecure code.
to the best of our knowledge this is the first work on generating patch examples without guidance from the source code.
evaluation an experimental evaluation of patuntrack that shows that patuntrack outperforms all baselines on generating insecure code patch examples as well as a human evaluation on newly disclosed vulnerable irs that further demonstrates its usefulness in practice.
data the datasets and source code which are made publicly available to facilitate the replication and the application of patuntrack in the more extensive contexts.
preliminaries in this section we first conduct the preliminary study by analyzing the time cost of raising patches for the vulnerable irs and the exploited ratio of irs with without tracked insecure commits.
then we provide an example to illustrate the motivation of patuntrack.
.
preliminary study of vulnerability patching to analyze the time cost of vulnerability patching we introduce a widely used vulnerability dataset i.e.
gharchive which achieves the irs in the software community.
among them gharchive contains vulnerable irs with their original information of cvedisclosed vulnerabilities such as ir s textual descriptions commits for insecure code and patch indicated by links with string tcommit andtpatch etc.
we first analyze the time lag between the ir creation and the vulnerability patching by referring to the commit b exploit of irs with without tracked insecure commits in cve.

500ratio of fixed vulnerability time lag days figure the preliminary study to analyze the time cost of patching and the exploited ratio of the vulnerable irs.
links to the vulnerable irs containing insecure commits.
figure a shows that nearly of the vulnerable irs require over days to raise the patches for successfully fixing the vulnerabilities and require over commits to fix the vulnerabilities.
moreover we also analyze whether the tracked insecure commits may affect vulnerability exploitation by calculating the intersections of vulnerable irs with tracked insecure commits and exploited vulnerabilities.
we first decide whether the vulnerable ir contains the insecure commits with the following steps we analyze the commit links in gharchive we utilize the sota commit tracker to track the commits if gharchive does not present the link and we manually track the commit links if the previous steps cannot find the commit links.
second we determine whether the vulnerability is exploited by analyzing the logs in the links with texploited for vulnerability exploitation e.g.
exploited time ip address and vulnerable version.
we find that there are three types of exploitation as follows unexploited the vulnerabilities are not exploited by attackers.
exploited failed the vulnerabilities are exploited after they are fixed with specific patches.
exploited successful the vulnerabilities are exploited before they are fixed which means the attackers may harm the systems.
figure b shows that of vulnerable irs .
cannot track the insecure commits from the gharchive among these irs without tracked insecure code .
of vulnerabilities in the vulnerable irs are successfully exploited by attackers which is .
higher than irs with insecure commits.
these results show that the insecure commits with patches are important to reduce the exploitation of vulnerable irs but raising appropriate patches to fix the vulnerabilities is a time consuming task.
.
motivating example figure 2shows the motivation of generating insecure code patch examples from the vulnerable ir.
from the example we analyze how the vulnerability is triggered based on the textual description of ir.
the project first loads the library dynsync and initializes the parameter hostname .
then it calls the function dynsync.resolve which will execute the system command to look up the dns server to resolve the hostname .
however this function calling process has vulnerabilities since the logic of resolve function contains the execution of the system command.
if the attackers initialize the hostname with specific strings like id tmp foo it may inject the vulnerabilities and harm the system.
2patuntrack automated generating patch examples for issue reports without tracked insecure code ase october november sacramento ca usa this package contains a serious security hole.
skxopened this issue on nov comments consider the following code var dnssync require dns sync console.log dnssync.resolve id tmp foo the library is loaded.
the function resolve is called which contains this code cmd util.format s s s nodebinary scriptpath hostname response shell.exec cmd silent true so the end result is a call to a command like opt node bin node path to dns lookup script id tmp foo the shell expands that by executing usr bin id tmp foo et voila arbitrary command execution triggered by a dns lookup.

referring to the secure coding practices in owasp this vulnerability is a typical os command injection cwe and the type of patching is validating the input with regex testing so the patch example will incorporate the validation of the inputs.
the system commands will not execute if the input strings contain such specific strings thus preventing the vulnerabilities.
approach the overall framework of patuntrack is illustrated in figure .
since the ir authors may miss some details in describing vulnerabilities we first extract the vtp descriptions from ir s textual description and complete the missing nodes and edges.
second since the pre trained data and training strategy of llms have flaws that result in hallucinations we propose vulcok to correct the hallucinations in vtp descriptions.
third we jointly generate insecure code patch examples with patch type prediction with the corrected vtp description.
for each step we utilize auto prompting to optimize llm and make it applicable to analyze vulnerabilities.
.
generating complete vtp description the ir can be formulated as follows title body wheretitle is the summarization of the main topic body contains a set of sentences that describe the details of ir.
patuntrack generates the complete vtp description by extracting the original vtp description from the ir textual descriptions and completing the missing nodes and edges to update the vulnerable irs.
.
.
vtp description extraction.
previously cheng et al.
s define a bug triggering path btp as a set of program statements to reside in the execution paths toward the location where the error is triggered which is an effective method to detect and reproduce the vulnerabilities and has been utilized by different vulnerability detectors .
however there are gaps between normal bugs and vulnerabilities so traditional btps are not useful to accurately find vulnerabilities.
for example the traditional btp defines the operations of the program as package loading variable declaration andfunction calling which are operations to trigger normal bugs in the oss projects.
on the contrary vulnerabilities focus on the transmission of tainted data where we find the source and sink code to describe the transmission path of the tainted data and locate the code lines that may produce the vulnerabilities.
the vtp description in our work can identify the triggering paths of vulnerability by incorporating the transmission of tainted data.
the structure can be modeled as gvtp vvtp evtp where thevvtp op0 op ... opt is a series of nodes that describe the operations that may result in the vulnerability.
the op0is the start operation which contains the operation to load the sources such as loading third party library andinitializing variables andoptis the end operation that indicates the vulnerability is triggered after the previous operations are conducted.
based on the previous works and our manual analysis on over 1k vulnerabilities we summarize four types of operations that cover the triggering process of vulnerabilities.
we manually analyzed the irs with experienced security practitioners who participated in our data annotation to determine the types of operation nodes edges with open card sorting a flexible classification method that allows us to create information categories freely thus helping designers develop more appropriate types.
src load this operation indicates that the program loads the vulnerability related source data such as loading the packages that may have vulnerabilities and loading the variables that may contain the taint information.
func call since some vulnerabilities are directly caused by the incorrect calling of the functions such as the use after free vulnerability we specifically analyze the function calling processes that may trigger the vulnerabilities.
vuldata transmit this operation denotes the transmission of the vulnerable data.
the data comes from the source variables or the different libraries and will finally transmit to the sink code lines that may harm the system.
secdata transmit this operation indicates the transmission of other data in the function calling process.
different from the vuldata transmit these data are secure and will not harm the system and we also analyze the transmission of secure data to distinguish it from vulnerable data.
vul trigger we add this node to intuitively indicate the results of vulnerability triggering.
the edges in vtp description opi opj evtp is the one way link that denotes the transition of how to trigger the vulnerability where opiis the prerequisite operation for the opj.
with the extracted vtp description we can generate the insecure coding example which can reflect the vulnerable code in the projects and generate patches based on the coding examples.

each nodeopiis a triplet op type op desc vul type where the element op type is the previous type of operation node.
theop desc is the description of the operations which briefly explains the information of each operation step with texts and a few code snippets.
thevul type is the type of vulnerability and we introduce the cwe type and the detailed error types in it to describe the vulnerability.
chow et al.
indicates that for different error types the focuses of bug triggering methods are different.
inspired by it we define seven error types in vtp based on our manual analysis of vulnerabilities as shown in table .
table the error types in the vtb operation nodes.
id err or types vtp description enco ding validation errorsthe error comes from improperly handled leading to unexpected behavior.
dep endency errorsthe variables functions or libraries are unresolved or incorrect.
inje ction logic errorsthe functions are improperly used leading to incorrect execution.
4memor y management concurrency errorsthe way how data is handled has errors leading to exploitable conditions.
race configuration errorsthe error relates to the system conditions affecting its correct operation.
buffer overflowthe error involves improper handling of boundaries and limits in storage leading to overflows.
error handling logging issuesthe encoding or decoding have errors leading to xss or injection attacks.
based on the above definitions we format the structure of the promptsp0in the patuntrack as is shown in figure .
each prompt consists of the following three components task definition where we define the problem that llm should resolve details of vtp description where we incorporate the definition of the vtp operation i.e.
operation type descriptions and vulnerability typevul type as well as the transmissions between edges.
thevul type contains two parts of the types i.e.
the error and cwe types where common weakness enumeration cwe is a more specific categorization that differentiates the types of vulnerabilities with their causes and behaviors and focus list where we provide some focuses that guide llm to resolve the problem.
the focus list contains a set of pairs vul typei fi wherefi is the focus of vul type when generating vtp descriptions.
we introduce the focus list due to the following two reasons some historical irs may contain guidance on how to generate patch examples.
llms can refer to this information to guide the generation of vtp descriptions and reduce output biases.
some irs may lack detailed information to introduce the triggering process of vulnerability so llms cannot directly generate the vtp description based on the contents.
by referring to the focus list llms can utilize historical information to complete the missing information in these irs.
task description e.g.
please extract the vtp description based on the inputted issue report and we define the structure of the vtp description for triggering the vulnerabilities.

thefiwill be updated when llm analyzes the historical irs with the auto prompting and we will discuss the auto prompting in the following sections in detail.
to extract the vtp description we will design the prompt pextract p0by replacing the task description in this prompt format p0with instructions for vtp extraction.
.
.
vtp description completing.
since some vtp descriptions are not complete and miss some essential operations and transitions in the paths patuntrack will first detect whether the extracted vtp description is complete.
then it will complete the missing operation nodes and transitions.
patuntrack detects the operation level andtransition level completeness and adds the missing information in the nodes and edges in these levels.
operation level completeness patuntrack detects whether the vtp description misses some intermediate operation nodes opmiss or the existing operation node opimisses some information such as the description of insecure code and vul type misses the error or cwe types.
patuntrack will ask the llms to reason the missing information within the operation nodes or generate some new intermediate nodes between the existing operation nodes to complement the missing flows.
transition level completeness the transitions between the operationsopi opjare missed so the logic flow is not complete to trigger the vulnerability and patuntrack will add these transition edges to complement the vtp description.

auto prompting for generating vtp description.
since some of the llms cannot be directly fine tuned such as chatgpt the researchers have utilized the text generation ability of llm to design the specific prompt for each input i.e.
auto prompting .
we design a meta framework for auto prompting as is shown in algorithm .
it utilizes the score function fsto calculate the differences between predicted and ground truth labels in the labeled dataset and updates the fiin the prompt.
the line 1indicates that the autoprompting updates the prompt s focus fibyinserting deleting and modifying elements in the original prompts.
the auto prompting process controls the prompt updating with simple prompts such as please update the prompt by inserting deleting modifying the to the prompt s focus f where is the sample used to optimize the prompt.
the samples come from the historical irs that can track the ground truth insecure code and patch.
the line 8indicate thatpatuntrack utilizes a score function fsto analyze the similarity between llm outputs and ground truth lower the score higher the similarity .
we select the most appropriate prompt ptbased on the score differences among these three updated prompts.
the score function of auto prompting the vtp description extractor and completer is calculated by analyzing the matching and masking scores which can be formulated as follows fs v tp code vtp vtp ir vtp pextract pcomplete sim vtp code vtp ir z scorematch sim vtp vtp z scoremask wherefsis the score function that calculates the sum of two scores i.e.
scorematch andscoremask .
the first score analyzes whether llm can accurately generate the vtp descriptions that reflect the triggering process of vulnerabilities and socremask analyzes whether llm can complement the incomplete irs.
forscorematch thevtp iris the generated irs with original promptpextract andvtp code is the ground truth triggeringtable the golden external dataset dof vulcok.
id golden dataset last updated link sard owasp debian vdisc path from the insecure code.
we utilize the edit distance i.e.
levenshtein distance as the similarity which is useful to measure the similarity between two texts.
for scoremask we randomly select some nodes in the extracted vtp then reflect them to the original ir and mask these chosen texts vtp .
we utilize the llm to predict the masked text to vtp and calculate the edit distances between them.
we utilize these scores to measure the performance of llm on generating vtp descriptions and update the prompts with the meta framework.
.
correcting hallucinatory vtp description in huang et al s survey they indicate that the pre trained data training and decoding strategies of llms have flaws that result in content that is inconsistent with real world facts which is called llm hallucinations.
to address the hallucinations li et al.
proposed the cok which utilizes external golden knowledge for the hallucination correction.
inspired by this work we propose the vulcok as is shown in figure which can correct the hallucinations in vtp operation nodes and transition edges.
.
.
hallucinatory vtp detection.
the detection process of vtp description contains two parts.
i.e.
vul type hallucination detection and description hallucination detection which detects the hallucinations in vulnerability types and descriptions of vtp nodes.
we first introduce the external golden databases table which is selected based on the update time the usage of databases in industry and research and the number of vulnerabilities.
we detect the hallucinations in the vtp description with the breadth first search bfs which searches for the current operation item opitem and its connected operations opconn opitem opconn .
the llm first generates the queries for retrieving the golden items in the datasetd.
similar to section .
.
we also utilize the operation and the historical transitions to analyze whether they contain the hallucination.
we utilize the prompt phaldetect with the prompt formatp0to detect the hallucination which contains the definition of hallucinations as well as the focus list of cwe and error types.
.
.
hallucinatory vtp correction.
for the vtp descriptions that contain the hallucinations i.e.
the hallucinations from type and description in vtp.
first suppose the cwe and error types are incorrect and contain hallucinations.
in that case the vulcok needs to correct the hallucinatory types in the node opitem andopconn .
if the types are correct the llm needs to correct the hallucinations of the vtp description and opnext and re generate the transitions for the new vtp operations.
after these corrections the original gvtp will be updated tog vtp and the current item opitem will move to its connected items opconn .
the prompt phalcorrect utilizes the same format p0for correcting the hallucinations.
it directly asks llm to correct the vtp s vulnerability types and descriptions based on the retrieved golden knowledge and it will also incorporate the focus list of different vulnerability types.

auto prompting for vulcok.
since the retrieved knowledge in the selected golden dataset incorporated the insecure code the score function of auto prompting the vulcok is calculated by analyzing the similarity between the tracked insecure code and the golden knowledge s insecure code.
fs codegold code phaldetect phalcorrect coldgold sim codegold code where thecodegold indicates the insecure code in the golden knowledge and the simis the edit distance.
we sum all the distances in the retrieved knowledge then we feed the fsinto algorithm and update the prompt with this meta framework.
.
generating insecure code patch example in this section patuntrack first predicts the patch types based on the corrected vtp description.
then it jointly generates the insecure coding patch examples based on the patch types.
.
.
vtp based patch type prediction.
previously chow et al.
defines patch types for fixing the normal bugs in oss projects.
they construct a mapping from the error types to the patch types which reflect which types of patches are more frequently used for fixing certain bugs.
inspired by this work we also ask the llms to predict the patch types before the patch example generation.
first since the manual investigation of vulnerable irs with patches shows the types of patches for fixing the vulnerabilities are similar to fixing the normal bugs we directly migrate the patch type defined by chow et al.
to our patch type prediction.
then we ask the llm to predict the patch type patch type for the vtp description gvtp and record the co occurrence between the vulnerability type and patch type in the current predicted irsfreq vul type patch type predicted ir.
the prompt ptypepredict incorporates the definition of patch types and the frequency as well as the type and focus list in cwe and error types.
.
.
joint insecure code patch example generation.
after the prediction of patch types we generate the patch example based on thepatch type and the original vtp description gvtp.
since some nodes are operations in the imported third party libraries we first ask the llms to select the nodes and edges that reflectthe developer s insecure coding process.
then we utilize the selected nodes and edges to jointly generate the pairs with insecure coding and patch examples.
the idea of joint generation comes from multitask learning where the incorrect output elements are modified based on other output elements results thus improving the accuracy of patch generation.
the prompt pgenerate asks llms to select nodes edges and jointly generate the pairs as well as incorporates the focus list of cwe and error types .
.
auto prompting for patch example generation.
the autoprompting process for the patch example generation utilizes the edit similarity between generated code and ground truth code in the historical irs to optimize the prompts and the score function is shown as follows fs code patch code patch ptypepredict pgenerate sim code code sim patch patch where thecode andpatch are the generated insecure coding and patch examples.
the code andpatch are the ground truth of insecure code and patch of the vulnerabilities.
we also feed the fs into algorithm 1and update the prompt with the meta framework.
experimental design to evaluate the performance of patuntrack we will investigate the following three research questions rqs rq1 how does patuntrack perform on generating insecure code examples?
rq2 how does patuntrack perform on generating patch examples for fix the vulnerability?
rq3 how does patuntrack handle irs when they lack detailed information?
rq4 how does each component contributes to the patuntrack on generating insecure coding and patch examples?
.
dataset preparation in this section we first enrich the irs from original gharchive with other two representative data sources i.e.
d2a and patchdb then we denoise the d2a dataset to improve its quality third we preprocess the dataset with token replacement and split the dataset into irs for auto prompting and evaluation.
step collecting the dataset.
we collect the dataset from three major sources following previous works .
the first data source is gharchive a comprehensive dataset that contains over 120k github irs since .
the second data source isd2a which is built from real world vulnerability prediction scenarios and contains over 10k insecure code found from github irs with their vulnerability types.
the third data source ispatchdb which incorporates over 4k security patches in the github repositories.
all the datasets have been widely used in multiple vulnerability identification tasks .
we collect the vulnerability information in these two data sources by searching commit messages and vulnerable irs then we remove items without the searched vulnerable irs.
step denoising the dataset.
the d2a is automatically built by the commit message analyzer and the authors report that d2a only has accuracy in extracting commits.
therefore we remove 6patuntrack automated generating patch examples for issue reports without tracked insecure code ase october november sacramento ca usa table the size of the dataset with three sources.
data sources v ul irs auto prompt evaluation w labels w o labels ghar chive d2a patchdb t otal noisy samples from d2a as follows we obtain the commit messages and vulnerable irs by manually searching the repositories we remove the noisy items that the commit messages and irs explicitly indicate that they do not contain the vulnerabilities and in the remaining code we remove the noisy items by checking whether the disclosed vulnerabilities are depreciated in the cve.
to reduce the biases in the data denoising process we have invited three security practitioners with over year experience to determine whether the dataset is correctly denoised.
we ask them to independently check whether the removed noisy items are accurate.
the average cohen s kappa value is over .
which means they highly agree on the noisy data removal.
step preprocessing the dataset.
the github irs collected from the web pages are in xml format and we need to preprocess the irs by ragging screenshots and code snippets.
we preprocess the irs with the following procedures we first utilize the tencent ocr to transit the screenshots wrapped by xml tag a href .jpg .png to the text then use to tag the screenshots and to tag the code snippets wrapped by xml tags code code .
the content will be content of code snippet after tagging we merge similar code snippets and page screenshots which may have few differences and describe similar vulnerability information and following the previous works we remove other xml tags and retain the plain text inside then we correct typos with spacy .
we utilize of the irs with code commits for auto prompting the llms and the rest of the irs for evaluation.
in consequence the evaluation dataset contains irs with without code labels.
table 3shows the number of vulnerable irs for auto prompting and evaluation.
in total we have obtained vulnerable irs from these three sources where for auto prompting and for evaluating the patuntrack.
among the evaluation irs irs do not contain the tracked insecure code patches w o labels .
.
experimental baselines non llm baselines for code generation.
codebert is a large code model pre trained on millions of code snippets with the bert model.
we fine tune the codebert on the dataset for autoprompting.
codeium is a low cost ai driven approach for code completion and searching.
we utilize these baselines to generate insecure code examples from the description of ir.
compared with other baselines they achieve sota performances in our task.
non llm baselines for apr.
the apr tools also utilize the fine tuned codebert as the baseline.
incoder is designed for code infilling by adopting a causal masking objective.
we fine tune these two models on the insecure code patch pairs of evaluation dataset for auto prompting.
to keep these apr baselines consistent with patuntrack these two models generate the patches based onthe generated insecure code example of patuntrack .
compared with other baselines they achieve sota performances in our task.
baselines with generative llms.
recently researchers have utilized the llms with prompt learning to automatically generate code and repair the bugs.
we choose the three common llm baselines in our tasks which can achieve the sota performances.
codet5 is pre trained on t5 which is an encoder decoder model that takes into account token type information in the code.
codex gpt3 and chatgpt i.e.
gpt .
are two novel llms proposed by openai which use over 100b of parameters and are trained on over 10tb samples with multiple training strategies fewshot zero shot etc.
.
we choose the stable and well maintained versions t5 base text davinci and gpt .
turbo and use the same prompt in section .
.
except for the chatgpt all the baselines are fine tuned on our dataset then generate code examples and predict types.
.
metrics and experimental settings metrics.
the first metric is the matchline which is a strict metric that measures the proportion of total matched statements with the ground truth code.
the second is the matchtrig andmatchfix which measure the matching rate of statements that may contain insecure code annotated with and patch annotated with .
these two metrics indicate whether the generated code can trigger or fix the vulnerabilities.
we choose the k 10as the default value to measure these matching rates.
acctype is utilized to measure the accuracy of type prediction and it measures the average of both cwe and error types in insecure code examples.
we also use the triggering rate trig k and fixing rate fix k to measure the triggering and fixing rate of generated code examples t rig k trig vul k t otal vul k fix k trig vul k fix vul k t otal vul k where is the symbol of the number calculation of evaluation samples and fix k 1if both the vulnerability triggering and fixing are satisfied in the top kgenerated pairs.
we choose k 10for measuring the triggering and fixing rates.
parameter and hardware settings.
we split of irs with code commits for auto prompting and the rest and the irs w o commits for evaluation.
we fine tune all the baselines except for chatgpt with batch size .
all experiments are run on a pc with windows os nvidia geforce rtx .
result .
performances on insecure code generation we introduce the patuntrack to improve the t5 gpt and chatgpt s performances and the model names are llms patuntrack.
in the evaluation dataset with code labels we analyze the matching rate between generated insecure code and the ground truth labels of insecure code.
in the evaluation dataset without code labels we first utilize the open sourced security testing tools such as zed and wapiti etc.
to test whether the generated insecure code example will trigger the corresponding vulnerabilities and manually test the insecure code if the automatic detectors cannot trigger the vulnerabilities.

case study.
we conduct the case study on the vulnerable ir in figure2to qualitatively evaluate the patuntrack.
figure 6shows the generated insecure code example of chatgpt and patuntrack.
referring to the ground truth insecure code in the repository we can see that patuntrack can accurately indicate that the hostname comes from the external url and find all the statements that may contain cwe vulnerabilities.
chatgpt has made errors in these two points and generated inaccurate code examples.
these results illustrate that our approach is more accurate than baselines on generating insecure code examples.
advantages of patuntrack.

case study.
figure 6also shows the results of the case study on patch example generation.
we can see that the patch example generated by patuntrack can successfully utilize the input validation to fix the vulnerability.
chatgpt utilizes the sanitizer to replace the error strings with null but does not terminate the system command.
if the regular expression cannot match the whole input string the attack may still succeed.
therefore the patuntrack s patch example is more appropriate to fix the vulnerabilities.
advantages of patuntrack.
in addition to the advantages in section .
the benefits of patuntrack also come from the patch type prediction and the joint prediction.
these methods can reduce the biases in generated patch examples thus improving the accuracy and fixing rate of patch generation.

effect of ir s information in figure we introduce the focus list to guide the generation of patch examples when the ir lacks detailed information and we also complete the missing nodes and edges in the vtp description.
in this experiment we measure how the patuntrack depends on ir s amount of information.
since there is no standard way to measure the richness of ir s information we report the number of iterations abbreviated as iter.
in section .
where each iteration is a step with vtp extraction vtp completing.
this iteration indicates the difficulty of generating a completed vtp description.
intuitively an ir with less information would require more iterations to generate a complete vtp description.
based on the iterations we split the evaluation irs evaluation in table into three intervals i.e.
iter.
irs iter.
irs and iter.
irs .
we can see that of them are minimally descriptive irs e.g.
a single sentence to describe the vulnerability but lacks details where the vtp generator takes iterations to complete the missing nodes and edges in the generated vtp descriptions.
we compare the performances of llms and llm patuntrack on the metrics of insecure code example generation i.e.
matchtrig and trig and patch example generation i.e.
matchfix and fix within these three iteration intervals.
we can see that the performances of all techniques are decreased when the information in the ir is less detailed.
however patuntrack can accurately generate the insecure code patch examples outperforming these original llms with over .

.
moreover patuntrack has fewer fluctuations than original llms among different iteration intervals.

human evaluation to analyze the performances of patuntrack on generating patch examples for the vulnerable irs without insecure code we track the vulnerable irs from github that are not included in the collected dataset in section .
.
we track the irs with the issue tracking system then we observe that cve disclosed vulnerable irs have not released the code commits which may pose security risks to the public.
to analyze the contribution of patuntrack we utilize the chatgpt and chatgpt patuntrack to generate the patch examples and ask the authors the following questions q1 does the type of patch example we provide match the vulnerabilities you have encountered?
please reply yes no .
q2 will you accept the patch example to help you fix the vulnerabilities in your projects?
please reply accepted unaccepted .
q3 please use several sentences to describe the reason why the patch example can cannot be accepted to fix the vulnerabilities.
we contact the ir authors with emails or directly submit the comments on the ir pages.
then we analyze the proportion of acceptance.

we received of responses .
from the ir authors and pairs .
generated by chatgpt patuntrack can help authors fix the vulnerabilities which is .
higher than chatgpt.
most insecure code patch example pairs belong to cwe and pairs .
are accepted.
moreover we ask the authors to manually inspect the generated results and rate their accurateness .
this criterion measures the accuracy of the generated insecure code patch examples to the real commits in their projects.
we ask the authors to rate under the above criteria.
for each accepted unaccepted patch example a score of means that the generated code almost matches the real code in the repository and a score of means the generated code is completely different from the real code.
a score of is borderline table the number and the ratio of accepted generated insecure code patches for chatgpt and patuntrack.

discussion .
effect of joint code generation in section .
we utilize the joint code generation to generate the insecure code patch examples accurately.
to analyze the effect of insecure code examples on the patch example generation during the auto prompting we compare the performances of chatgpt and chatgpt patuntrack on the change of matchtrig matchfix andtrig fix on our evaluation dataset.
figure 9shows the generation results of insecure code patch examples in the auto prompting.
we can see that with the improvement of matchtrig and trig both chatgpt and patuntrack s generation results on patch examples will improve and the differences between these models will also increase.
when matchtrig and trig reach patuntrack s matchfix and fix reach the maximum value which means patch examples are appropriate based on the insecure code examples.
.
unsuccessful cases although patuntrack can generate appropriate insecure code patch examples there are still cases where patuntrack 1p .05in the t test shows the significant differences between two sets of data.

figure insecure code s effect to patch example generation.
10patuntrack automated generating patch examples for issue reports without tracked insecure code ase october november sacramento ca usa failed to generate correct patches.
we manually inspected these unsuccessful cases and found that most of these cases come from incompletely generated vtps.
some ir authors omit too many details in the ir descriptions so patuntrack cannot complete the vtp operations and transitions solely based on the ir descriptions.
for example the bedita bedita issues cve does not provide any description of the vulnerability except for links to external reports that are currently not analyzed by patuntrack thus patuntrack cannot generate insecure code patch examples based on ir description.
.
threats to validity internal threats.
the internal threat mainly comes from the approach.
first we only analyze the textual description in ir to build the vtp description and we plan to utilize other sources such as textual description in the third party links to improve the patuntrack.
second the time costs of loops in the vtp generator and vulcok are heavy which may affect its practical usage.
to alleviate it we set an upper limit 10for auto prompting and the current step will exit if the loops exceed this limitation.
third we utilize the llm to correct hallucinatory types and descriptions which may have biases in the vulcok.
in the future we plan to analyze the success rate of hallucination correction to mitigate this threat.
external threat.
the external threat may come from the dataset we use.
we only refer to the cve disclosed irs to analyze whether these irs contain the vulnerabilities.
however some vulnerable irs may not be incorporated by these two datasets and some vulnerabilities may be disclosed by other security databases such as capec .
another threat comes from the silent patches since the authors may quietly submit patches for the vulnerabilities but not report them to the public.
to alleviate it we manually inspected vulnerable irs from the public and found that only of them have these threats so the impact of external threats is small.
constructive threat.
the constructive threat mainly comes from the metrics.
all the chosen metrics i.e.
matchline matchtrig matchfix and trig k fix k may have biases for evaluating the generated results.
we review and discuss the settings of metrics with team members thus alleviating this constructive threat.
related works vulnerability detection and analysis from oss projects.
recently researchers have proposed various approaches to detect and analyze the vulnerabilities in oss projects.
automatic vulnerability detection aims to determine whether there are malicious code in the projects .
the researchers first proposed the statistic dynamic and hybrid techniques to detect the vulnerabilities with rules .
with the development of machine learning ml and deep learning dl approaches researchers utilized these novel models to automatically build code features and improve the efficiency of vulnerability detection tools .
in addition researchers also analyze the vulnerabilities from various project artifacts e.g.
irs bug reports etc.
.
some researchers utilized text mining methods to explore the security bug reports to identify the vulnerabilities while other works analyze the negative impact of the vulnerabilities from the irs .
the other researchers focus onthe crowd based security discussions e.g.
security posts in stack overflow and discussion groups in gitter slacks to analyze the topics attacks and the corresponding mitigations .
different from these previous works we build the gaps between the ir textual description and source code by generating insecure code patch examples that cannot track the insecure code thus helping developers fix the vulnerabilities.
patch generation for vulnerable oss projects.
apr methods are the typical methods for generating patches for fixing normal bugs or vulnerabilities.
the template based apr methods leverage different bug fixing templates which are designed by human experts to fix the specific types of bugs in the source code .
recent researchers have proposed learning based apr tools which typically model program repair as a neural machine translation nmt problem .
with the development of llm the researchers also analyze how to combine the llms to the apr tools to improve their patching ability and reduce the time and financial cost of llm .
these works rely on the source code to fix the vulnerabilities which cannot be applied on irs without tracked insecure code.
on the contrary our approach can generate patch examples based on ir textual description which can timely help developers fix the vulnerabilities after the ir creation.
conclusion in this paper we introduced patuntrack to generate patch examples from irs without tracked insecure code.
it auto prompts llms to make them applicable for analyzing the vulnerabilities described in irs and generating appropriate patch examples.
specifically it first generates the completed vtp description from vulnerable irs.
then it utilizes the vulcok to correct the hallucinatory vtp description.
finally it generates top kpairs of insecure code and patch example based on the corrected vtp description.
experiments conducted on vulnerable irs show that patuntrack can achieve the highest performance and improve the traditional llm baselines by .
matchfix and .
fix on average in patch example generation.
furthermore patuntrack has been applied to generating patch examples for newly disclosed vulnerable irs and out of replies from the authors of these irs confirmed the usefulness of the patch examples generated by patuntrack indicating that they can benefit from these examples for patching the vulnerabilities.
in the future we plan to enhance the patuntrack by introducing other third party resources to generate the vtp descriptions as well as analyzing whether vtp can improve the performance of traditional apr tools in patch generation.
