a large number of invocation mechanisms proposed in the literature in particular for android mobile applications employ graphical user interface gui driven application exploration.
however studies show that even the most advanced gui exploration techniques can cover only around of a real world application.
with extensive effort being invested into gui exploration strategies in this thesis we factored out gui related issues by having skilled human analysts perform a thorough manual exploration on a number of large and popular google play applications.
to our surprise coverage achieved by humans exceeded that of the automated tools by only a small fraction.
the main reasons preventing human analysts from covering the entire application include application dependencies on device characteristics remote servers and external resources.
we further explore characteristics of these dependencies and discuss the applicability of dynamic techniques that extend beyond gui exploration i.e.
that involve various forms of alterations to the application s ecosystem to bypass these dependencies.
based on our analysis we outline possible future research directions for improving application coverage such as developing adaptive exploration strategies that determine when and how to bypass dependencies.
iiilay summary having an efficient strategy to explore applications is a major requirement to ensure the quality of mobile applications especially those built for millions of users.
detecting bugs or security risks for example requires interacting with as much of the application as possible.
unfortunately most approaches to automatically explore applications only focus on user actions like button clicks and fall short for real word commercial applications.
in this thesis we aim to understand and characterize parts of applications which are hard to reach through a case study on a large number of android applications.
by relating these challenges to specialized more targeted techniques for addressing them we pinpoint gaps in knowledge and directions for future work.
we hope our findings will help create better and more tailored application exploration tools.
ivpreface this thesis presents an in depth characterization of reasons leading to low coverage of top google play applications.
the presented work was conducted by myself under the guidelines of my advisor professor julia rubin.
i collaborated with professor lili wei from mcgill university siddharth gupta an undergraduate research intern from the indian institute of technology iit patna.
and louie tang an undergraduate intern from ubc.
i was responsible for the collection exploration analysis and characterization of applications and for the selection experimentation analysis and categorization of tools.
i was also responsible for the manuscript writing and revision.
professor rubin helped with the concept formation and discussion and the manuscript write up and revisions.
professor wei also helped with concept discussion and manuscript revisions.
siddharth gupta and louie tang helped with the cross validation of manual exploration coverage and analysis results section .
