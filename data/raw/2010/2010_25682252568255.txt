ABSTRACT
Building is an integral part of the software development pro-
cess. However, little is known about the compiler errors that
occur in this process. In this paper, we present an empirical
study of 26.6 million builds produced during a period of
nine months by thousands of developers. We describe the
workow through which those builds are generated, and we
analyze failure frequency, compiler error types, and resolu-
tion eorts to x those compiler errors. The results provide
insights on how a large organization build process works, and
pinpoints errors for which further developer support would
be most eective.

1. INTRODUCTION
Building is a central phase in the software development
process in which developers use compilers, linkers, build
les and scripts to assemble their code into executable units.
This assembly process can be quite complex as it may involve
multiple subsystems and programming languages and rely
on evolving libraries and platforms. For example, one build
we studied included 2858 build targets and 6 languages.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568255.The speed of a build directly aects programmer produc-
tivity. Programming is often described as an \edit-compile-
debug" cycle in which a programmer makes a change, com-
piles, and tests the resulting binary, then repeats the cycle
until the program behaves as expected. Slow compiles may
cause the programmer to be distracted by other tasks or
lose context, and reduce the number of changes that can
be attempted during a day. Failed compiles, whether be-
cause of errors in the source code or incorrect references to
other software components, force the programmer to step
away from the larger task to track down an unexpected or
unfamiliar error. Any delay widens the gap between the
programmer deciding on the next change to perform and
viewing the eect of that change. Keeping the build process
fast and understanding when and how it fails is a key part
of improving programmer productivity [12].
Yet we lack enough quantiable evidence of how often
the build process fails, why it fails, and how much eort
is necessary to x errors. As we discuss in Section 5, the
related work in this area has focused on students building
at a small scale (e.g., [4, 5, 10]) or on characterizing the
complexity of the building process (e.g., [16, 13, 14]). In
this paper, we present the ndings of a case study of 26.6
million builds involving 18,000 developers over a nine month
period. Specically, we examine the builds done in C++
and Java, Google's most common languages, and the errors
produced by the javac compiler (for the Java language) and
the LLVM Clang compiler (for C++) by those builds. We
report on the frequency of builds, the failure ratio, the errors
reported by the Java and C++ compilers, and the time to
x these errors.
Our results reveal that C++ developers build 10.1 times
a day and Java developers build 6.98 times a day when av-
eraged over months. 37.4% and 29.7%, respectively, of these
builds fail. The most common errors are associated with
dependencies between components; developers spend signif-
icant eort resolving these build dependency issues.

Quantication, categorization, and analysis of build
errors, their frequency, and their resolution based on
26.6 million builds (Section 3 and 4). The ndings pin-
point particular areas where additional IDE features,
build support, and analysis tools would provide the
greatest benet for developers.
2. GOOGLE’S BUILD ENVIRONMENT
Most Google developers employ an \edit-compile-test" cy-
cle when working. This cycle occurs mostly within IDEs
such as Eclipse [18] or IntelliJ IDEA [11] for Java (nine out
of ten developers), while C++ developers typically use a
text editor such as Emacs [19] or Vim [1] (eight out of ten
developers). Source control, building, and testing tools are
standardized through much of the company. To keep up with
the large and quickly-evolving code base and the high levels
of reuse, developers use a cloud-based build system. The
build system allows programmers to build from the most
recently committed sources (\head"), amortizing complica-
tions caused by the divergence of other components [8].
Google's cloud-based build process utilizes a proprietary
build language [8]. BUILD les specify the build congu-
ration, declaring the list of targets that need to build, the
sources and dependent targets required to compile, and the
compiler to use when building those targets. The primary
action is a \build action" where a programmer requests one
or more targets (a binary or a set of tests) to be built. The
build system does all compiles and other actions necessary
for each build action. Throughout this paper, a build rep-
resents a single request from a programmer which executes
one or more compiles; a build only succeeds if all compiles
succeed.
Most IDEs have an embedded compiler that can perform
incremental compilation and unit testing, but may not ex-
actly match the behavior of the compiler used by the buildsystem (javac for Java, LLVM Clang for C++). Developers
may build with the IDE's own compiler during development,
but must ensure the code successfully builds with the cen-
tralized build system before committing.
Figure 1 provides a rst characterization of developers'
build frequency sorted by the number of builds. This dataset
contains over 26.6 millions build attempts performed by over
18,000 developers during a period of nine months, and logged
by the centralized build system. Section 3.2 will provide a
more detailed account of the dataset and Section 4 will pro-
vide a breakdown of the data by factors such as the program-
ming language and the failure rate. However, we already
observe quite a variance in a long tail distribution, with a
mean of 1446 and a median of 759 builds per developer over
nine months.
Not all developers doing builds give us insights into be-
havior during the\edit-compile-debug"cycle and ways to im-
prove compiler error messages. Developers with extremely
high and low numbers of builds often are not doing \normal"
development, and so their experiences do not characterize
the behavior of the compiler errors faced by programmers
during maintenance or enhancement.
For example, developers with the highest numbers of builds
(on the left side of the graph) include janitors ,infrastructure
developers ,builders , and robots .Janitors perform large-scale
changes across the whole Google codebase as they migrate
users to a newer API or x all instances of a certain bug pat-
tern using automated tools. Janitors trigger a large number
of builds when testing their changes. Infrastructure develop-
erswork on critical tools such as compilers. Deploying new
versions of infrastructure tools often requires testing that the
new tools correctly handle the entire code base, so infrastruc-
ture developers often do huge numbers of successful builds.
Builders include developers in charge of releasing, testing,
or isolating failures. These tasks require a continous cycle
of building and testing, often with a large number of fail-
ures. Robots are automated tools performing similar tasks
to builders. Janitors, infrastructure developers, and robots
make up approximately 0.5% of the developers in our build
logs.
On the right side of the distribution in Figure 1, we nd
theinactive developers who do very few builds. Inactive
developers may work in a programming language or on a
project that is not part of this study, may only need to build
tools from source as part of their job, or may not be actively
coding (on leave, project manager, release engineer).
Between these extremes, the bulk of the developers be-
long to a group that we call the standard developer . The
standard developer works primarily on a small number of
projects, adding features or performing maintenance. This
group constitutes the primary focus of the rest of this paper.
3. STUDY
In this section we dene the research questions, describe
the data collection process and metrics, and explain the
threats to validity and their potential impact on our ndings.
3.1 Research Questions
We explore three research questions:
RQ1. How often do builds fail? We report on the
failure-to-success build ratio across developers and lan-
guages to characterize the distribution of build failures.725C++ 
Java

These ndings help us understand the potential impact
of changes in the development workow.
RQ2. Why do builds fail? We report on the fre-
quency of the error kinds and taxonomize them to better
understand what kinds of challenges are most commonly
faced by the developers. These ndings can help priori-
tize areas where development environments and program
analysis tools may provide the most benet.
RQ3. How long does it take to x broken builds?
We report on the time spent by developers xing each
kind of compiler error, and describe particular instances
of xing eorts. These ndings highlight which kinds of
errors require the most eort to correct, and hint at the
tool support and training that might help programmers
x troublesome classes of errors more easily.
3.2 Data Collection
The results of all builds in Google's cloud-based build sys-
tem are saved in persistent logs describing the result of each
build (succeeded or failed) and the errors produced by all
compiles during the build. These logs are the main source
of data for this study. We analyzed build logs to extract
information about build sessions, success/failure ratios, and
error messages. Figure 2 shows an overview of the logging
pipeline. For this study, we examined log data from the
build system for a period of nine months from November
2012 through July 2013. This data represented the compi-
lation work necessary to build C++ and Java binaries that
would run on Google's own servers. The data did not in-
clude projects built by other build systems within Google
(generally client software for Mac, Windows, or mobile, or
outside software such as javac, gcc, or the Linux kernel).
Because we wanted to distinguish compiles by standard de-
velopers from non-development builds in our build frequency
and failure rate data, we dened rules to distinguish be-
tween users performing automatic and user-requested com-
piles. We recognized janitors ,robots andinfrastructure de-
velopers either by the specic build commands they used,
or by detecting users performing more than 50 builds per
day over the entire nine months. We also classied non-
active developers as any user performing less than one build
per day. Across standard developers, each month Java pro-
grammers performed an average of 140 builds (median: 101builds) and C++ programmers performed an average of 202
builds (median: 147 builds).
In addition to partitioning users based on the logs, we also
routinely performed sample checking throughout the data
collection process to validate our categorizations and thresh-
olds. We talked with specic developers to validate how we
classied them, and checked with the engineers maintaining
internal tools to validate our assumptions.
As mentioned previously, the data collected includes 26.6
million build invocation commands performed by 18,000 uni-
que developers. 9.6M of the build invocations included at
least one Java target, and 17.7M builds included at least one
C++ target. 7% of the Java builds and 3.9% of the C++
builds included both Java and C++ targets.
We analyzed a total of 57.8M error messages captured
in the logs. The errors logged are those generated by the
compilers. Errors generated by other tools, such as the
C++ linker, are not currently logged, so some problems,
e.g. omitting a dependency required at link time, could not
be detected. However, other dependency problems could be
inferred. For example, if the developer has forgotten to list
a dependency in her BUILD le, sometimes the compilation
will fail with a \ undefined symbol " error.
We built a parser to map each error message to its kind.
Compiler conguration les dene the error kinds and their
format string. For example, Clang, the LLVM compiler fron-
tend, denes an error kind member_decl_does_not_match
and its format string\ out-of-line definition of %0 does
not match any declaration in %1 ". The actual error mes-
sages are generated by replacing the placeholders in the for-
mat string with identiers. We used the parser and mapped
each logged error message to its kind.
3.3 Metrics
We computed the following metrics from the log les:
Number of builds. We count the number of build
commands performed by each developer.
Build failure ratio. We count the number of failed
builds and divide it by the total number of build at-
tempts by the developer.
Build errors. We count the number of errors for
each error kind. We investigated two strategies for
counting the number of errors: count-all and count-
distinct . The count-all strategy considers all error mes-
sages, even if one build has many of the same kind of
errors. The count-distinct strategy counts the number
of dierent kinds of errors in a build. For example,
when a build fails with three doesnt.exist errors, ten
cant.resolve errors and two expected errors, count-
distinct would add 3 errors to the histogram (one for
each kind) and count-all would add 15 (one for each
individual error). Counting each error once is straight-
forward, but we noticed that unfair weight was given
to certain error kinds when one fault generates mul-
tiple errors. For example, missing an import state-
ment may generate a large number of name resolution
errors, and counting each error once would result in
over-representation of the name resolution error kind.
We decided instead to count each error kind only once
on each build failure.726Resolution time. For each error kind, we measure
the elapsed time a developer spends to x the error.
Figure 3 shows an example of how we measure resolu-
tion time. In this example, a developer has two failing
builds before the build succeeds. We measure the time
from the completion of the rst failing build to the
beginning of the next successful build. In addition, we
count the number of failing builds before succeeding.
In this example the build attempt count is two. In
computing this metric we only considered build failures
containing one error, and that were corrected within
twelve hours of their occurrence to avoid compounding
resolution time with the developers' schedule.

3.4 Threats To Validity
This study is performed within a single company with
particular processes, constraints, resources, and tools. This
constitutes a threat to the generalizability of the results.
Still, the magnitude of the study in terms of the number
of builds, developers, and systems involved provides a valu-
able baseline for the community, and the details provided
characterizing the environment of the study should help to
contextualize our ndings.
We were able to capture data only from the centralized
build system. We do not include errors encountered when
a developer performs compiles with other compilers, such
as using the incremental build feature built into IntelliJ or
Eclipse. For C++, we also do not have data on linker errors
encountered; we track only the compiler errors received. So,
even through the distribution of errors and resolution times
we found are based on 56M error messages, they are still
limited by the richness of the data source.
There are also many variations of the software develop-
ment workows we describe that may have made it into our
dataset. We are trying to understand builds done as part
of development, the relative proportion of developers doing
tests, preparing releases, or experimenting with a new lan-
guage could bias the data. To address this threat, we ltered
out extreme users, such as code janitors or compiler develop-
ers, and sample-checked the dataset by manually inspecting
the data having unusual value.
The collected data includes projects belonging to various
domains, with dierent complexity, schedules, development
contexts, and personnel. In this paper, we perform an analy-
sis that does not attempt to deeply discriminate across those
factors even though we recognize they may have aected our
ndings. Teasing those factors apart is part of our future
research agenda.
Other threats to validity include the focus on only Java
and C++, potential errors in our data gathering process, the
choice to count each error kind once per build failure, our
decisions in mapping errors to a taxonomy, and our choice
of cutos to remove noise from our data. To mitigate these
threats, we performed multiple checks on the data and onthe implications of the decisions we made in the design of
the study, and have documented them in the paper.
4. RESULTS
In this section we address each research question.
4.1 RQ1: How often do builds fail?
Figure 4 shows the distribution of build failure ratios across
developers. This ratio is approximately normally distributed,
with the median percentage of build failures higher for C++
(38.4%) than Java (28.5%). The dierences across languages
can be attributable, at least in part, to IDE usage as most
JAVA developers benet from the IDEs' built-in checks.
We further investigated developers with very high (more
than 85%1) or very low (less than 5%) failure rates in order
to understand what leads to such extreme outcomes. De-
velopers with a low build failure rate had a median of 45
and 41 builds (Java and C++) and developers with a high
failure rate had a median of 22 and 27 builds (Java and
C++) per month. The rst thing we notice is that both of
these numbers are well below the rest of the developers who
have a median of 101 and 147 builds per month for Java and
C++. Developers with either very low or very high failure
rate seem to be rare builders.
Developers with very low failure rates were not regular
developers in the specic language or projects. Some devel-
oped in other languages, some worked on projects outside
the build system, one worked on release tools, and others
were in non-coding roles. They had rare or occasional builds
without participating in active development, in some cases
consisting of small conservative changes with no discernible
eects, and this resulted in very low build failure rates.
Developers with very high failure rates were also typically
not regular developers in the specic language. For exam-
ple, we found a case where a prolic Java developer had
done a small number of C++ janitorial changes that broke
many unexpected targets which resulted in a very high fail-
ure ratio in C++. We did nd, however, a small number of
cases where prolic developers had high failure rates. These
instances occurred when developers were working on infras-
tructure tools such as compilers that trigger the re-building
of many other systems, and cause cascading build errors
when faulty.
We explored other conjectures that, based on our experi-
ence, seemed likely but were not supported by the data. For
example, we hypothesized that developers who build more
frequently may have a higher failure ratio, but we found no
strong correlation between the build counts and the build
failure ratio. We also examined the correlation between the
number of builds and build time. Although we hypothe-
sized that developers with faster build times build more fre-
quently, we found no strong correlation. We also hypothe-
sized that experienced developers, across all developers that
built software, would have a lower failure rate. We dened
experienced developers as those who had invoked a build at
least 1000 times in the past 9 months, and novice develop-
ers as those who had only performed a build within the past
three months and had fewer than 200 builds. However, we
did not see any correlation in this data. In part, this may be
due to the diculties in precisely characterizing experience
or expertise in a setting where developers frequently move

4.2 RQ2: Why do builds fail?
To investigate why builds fail, we analyzed the compiler
errors reported in the build log les. Each error message in
the dataset was mapped to an error message kind by using
the compiler conguration les used by javac and Clang.
For example, we mapped the Clang error message \ use of
undeclared identifier %0 " to undeclared_var_use . We
retained the variations of error messages used by the com-
pilers. For example, expected is an error message of the
form \ {0} expected " (f0gfor the rst parameter) whereas
expected3 is an error message of the form \ {0}, {1}, or
{2} expected " (with 3 parameters). We decided to keep
each error variation separate so as to identify any dierences
between them. Tables 2 and 3 provide the error message
kinds we considered/found, a brief description of each one,
and their category.
After this mapping was complete, we identied the 25
most frequent error message kinds for Java (Figure 5a) and
C++ (Figure 5b). We used the count-distinct methodology
described in Section 3.3 to avoid over-weighting error kinds
in which one fault generates multiple errors.
For Java, the top ve errors constitute approximately 80%
of the errors reported, and the most common error kind,
cant.resolve , appears in 43.25% of the errors seen. This
error kind occurs when the compiler encounters a symbol
it does not recognize, such as when there is a missing de-
pendency or when a developer mistypes a name. See Ta-
ble 4 for a sample of why these errors occur. Similarly,
thedoesnt.exist message occurs when a developer tries to
import something that is not in the classpath. The strict
errors are Google-specic and identify situations in which
transitive dependencies should be added to the list of direct
dependencies for a particular target [3]. cant.apply.symbol
and cant.apply.symbol.1 are both the result of a method
called with an incorrect argument list. The majority of er-
ror kinds for Java are dependency-related (all strict and
doesnt.exist errors and a signicant fraction of cant.re-
solve errors); we believe the extensive use of IDEs for Java
development contributes to this trend because many simpler
errors are captured within the IDE.For C++, the top error kind, undeclared_var_use , also
means that the compiler could not recognize a symbol. Clang
provides more specic error messages than Java depending
on the context of the errors. For example, undeclared_var_
useandundeclared_var_use_suggest are basically the same
error except that Clang provides a suggestion after trying
to nd a similar name from the symbol table for the lat-
ter one. no_member is reported when the compiler knows
that the name is located within a class but could not nd it.
Similarly, unknown_typename_suggest andovl_no_viable_
function_in_call are reported when the compiler nds an
unknown typename or function calls. The majority of error
kinds for C++ are, as with Java, dependency-related. On
the other hand, we nd that simple syntax errors such as
expected_rparen occur more frequently than in Java.
To better understand the errors occurring across languages,
we taxonomized them. Table 1 summarizes the number of
error kinds we used in forming this taxonomy, relative to the
total number of error message kinds for each language, and
the percentage of total error messages in our data set cov-
ered by the proposed taxonomy. For example, among 1284
dierent error kinds in C++, we used 102 in the taxonomy
and they covered more than 88% of all the errors in C++.
Table 1: Number of error kinds covered in taxonomy
Java C++
# error kinds used in taxonomy 25/230 102/1284
% dataset messages covered 91.96% 88.17%
We used open coding to initially categorize the message
kinds. Open coding refers to a part of analysis that deals
with the labelling and categorising the data in qualitative re-
search [15, 7]. Once we had the initial categories, we enlisted
experts from the Java and C++ compiler teams to decide
which category was the best t for each message. We put
each error message kind into only one category. In total, we
involved seven developers in this process. As a side benet,
in the process of coming up with this taxonomy, members of
one of the compiler teams realized that some error messages
were confusingly worded and updated the wording for two
message kinds. Table 2 and 3 shows which category applies
to all of the errors in Figure 5a and Figure 5b.
We classied error kinds into ve categories. Dependency
includes error kinds related to dependencies between source728operator.cant.be.appliedexpected3illegal.start.of.typevar.might.not.have.been.initializednot.def.public.cant.accessmissing.ret.stmtnot.stmtstatic.imp.only.classes.and.interfacesillegal.start.of.exprreport.accessnon−static.cant.be.refalready.definedrawtypesunreported.exception.need.to.catch.or.throwcant.apply.symbolsdoes.not.override.abstractexpectedmethod.does.not.override.superclassuncheckedincompatible.typescant.apply.symbol.1cant.apply.symboldoesnt.existstrictcant.resolve

code components. For example, name resolution errors or
missing le errors belong to this category. However, other
errors, such as when produced by mistyping a variable name,
also fall into this category as they have the same underlying
compiler error kind. Type mismatch includes type errors.
For example, errors occurring when a variable is assigned
to an incompatible type or when a function is called with
wrong argument types belong to this category. Syntax rep-
resents simple syntax errors such as omitting a parenthesis
or includes errors that occur when the compiler expects an
expression but is given something else. Semantic includes
errors related to class access rule violations or not imple-
menting abstract methods. We classied the remaining er-
rors into Other . Undened virtual destructors, redened
names, or uncaught exceptions belong to this category.
The percentage of error messages in each category is shown
in Figure 6. Dependency-related errors are the most com-
mon error type for both C++ (52.68%) and Java (64.71%).2
We also noticed that there are more syntax errors in our data
set for C++; this is again consistent with the greater IDE
usage for Java.
4.3 RQ3: How long does it take to ﬁx builds?
To measure how long it takes to x build errors, we col-
lected resolution time data as described in Section 3.3. Res-
olution time measures the time interval between the com-
pletion of a rst failed build and the start of the next suc-
cessful build. Resolution time may not measure the time
2Note that we may classify mistyping a variable name as
a dependency error when the compiler produces the same
error message for both cases. However, even if we assume
3/4 of cant.resolve errors are the result of typos (as in the
sample from Table 4) and remove them from this category,
dependency errors are still the most common error category
for Java.

that the developer actually spent addressing the problem
and waiting for compiles to complete; it is possible that the
developer switched to a dierent task or was away from her
desk during some error xing sessions we logged. To re-
move extreme cases (e.g., the developer went home for the
day), we omitted any builds in which the resolution time
was greater than twelve hours. When multiple error kinds
are resolved at once, it is not easy to discriminate resolution
time per error kind. Dividing the total resolution time by
the number of error kinds is one possible approach but this
introduces further imprecision to the resolution time. In-
stead, we constrained our analysis to failing builds with one
kind of error message. This lter retains 60% of the Java
builds and 40% of the C++ builds, for a total of more than
10 million builds.729Table 2: Java error messages taxonomy

Figure 7: Cost per error. Cost is computed based on the frequency times the median resolution time.
Figure 8a and Figure 8b show resolution time of the top
25 error kinds for C++ and Java. There is a box per error
type, where the box is bounded by the 25 and 75 percentiles,
the line within a box is the median. Overall, the median
resolution time of build errors were 5 and 12 minutes for
C++ and Java, respectively, and can vary by an order of
magnitude across error kinds.3
In Figure 8a, we observe that some errors, like missing
.ret.stmt , are much faster to x than others, like does.not
.override.abstract .4The longer resolution times for cer-
tain errors make sense; does.not.override.abstract will
likely require the programmer to implement additional meth-
ods and think about design issues. More interesting is raw-
types , introduced in Java 7, which is seen in 2% of the
errors but has a median resolution time of close to 5 min-
utes. This insight combined with conversations with the
developers about the value of this message in the identica-
tion or xing of bugs led to the disabling of this error. The
sample size for static.imp.only.classes.and.interfaces
was very small (less than 10).
Figure 8b shows the same data for C++. Overall, C++
resolution time is less than Java. However, some compiler
errors show a higher median resolution time as they are more
dicult to puzzle out ( non_virtual_dtor ,ovl_no_viable_
function_in_init ,typecheck_nonviable_condition , or
typename_nested_not_found ), or else may take time to track
down the missing dependency ( pp_file_not_found ).ex-
pected_rparen and typecheck_call_too_few_args show
very large distributions and incomplete_member_access
3As is not surprising, the dierence between some error
kinds is signicant, with a p-value <.001 returned by the
Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test.
4Wilcoxon rank sum test reports a p-value <.001 and the
Cli's delta eect size is -.043 (medium).shows a very tight distribution. We inspected the data
and found that sample sizes for these error kinds are much
smaller than the other error kinds (less than 110, as com-
pared with thousands or tens of thousands); this skews the
distributions.
We also investigated the cost of xing a particular error
message. In Figures 7a and 7b, we multiply the median
resolution time to x a particular error kind by the number
of errors of that kind. The errors are ordered in decreas-
ing frequency. For Java, this closely matches the frequency
order of error kinds, but some C++ errors (such as ovl_no_
viable_function_in_init andpp_file_not_found ) have a
signicantly higher cost.
The median number of build attempts until the errors are
resolved was 1. 75% of build errors were resolved within
at most two builds for all of the 25 most common error
kinds for both Java and C++. For Java targets, 75% of
build errors were resolved by the next build in 18 of the
25 most common error kinds. For the remaining seven er-
ror kinds ( cant.apply.symbol ,cant.apply.symbol1 ,cant
.apply.symbols ,cant.resolve ,strict ,unchecked and
does.not.override.abstract ), 75% of build errors were re-
solved within two builds.
For C++ targets, 75% of build errors were resolved by
the next build in 20 error types. In the remaining 5 error
types ( ovl_no_viable_function_in_call ,ovl_no_viable_
function_in_init ,pp_file_not_found ,ovl_no_viable_
member_function_in_call , and typecheck_nonviable_
condition ), 75% of build errors were resolved within two
builds.
To better understand the eort involved in xing depen-
dency errors, we looked at the dataset in more detail with
two case studies. First, we randomly selected 25 Java build
failures having a cant.resolve error kind that were resolved
by the following build.

BUILD le at both the failed build and succeeded build and
compared them to see how the errors were xed. We cat-
egorized the errors and xes and present them in Table 4.
Note that the total number of errors exceeds 25 because
some errors t into two categories. Approximately 1/4 of
the errors were related to a missing dependency statement,
but the most signicant fraction of errors were the result of
a misspelled identier.
These simple xes hint that many problems might be au-
tomatically xed. In fact, the resolution time for strict
errors was cut in half when the build tool started providing
suggested xes for strict errors.
Second, we investigated an extreme case in which a devel-
oper had ve consecutive failed builds before nally resolv-
ing a cant.resolve error kind. The developer actually had
multiple cant.resolve errors at rst, and performed ve
builds over 10 minutes, removing one cant.resolve error
each time, each by adding dependencies. In this case, the
developer might have appreciated more guidance on how to
x all the errors at once, perhaps by an error message that
more clearly describes which dependencies may be missing.
4.4 Findings and Implications
Our analysis of over 26M builds shows that building is an
activity central to software development, that exhibits vari-
ation in terms of workow and eectiveness depending on
the context such as the programming language and the IDE
used, but that is consistently performed on average multiple
times a day by developers. An analysis of the errors found
during the build process revealed that, independent of pro-
gramming language, approximately 10 percent of the error
types account for 90% of the build failures. Furthermore,
dependency errors are the most common. In terms of the
cost of xing build errors, we found that on average it tookone build iteration, and most errors are xed in two build
iterations.
Quantifying and understanding build patterns and prac-
tices has implications for practitioners, tool builders, and re-
searchers. For practitioners, it provides a means to identify
areas where additional expertise, tool usage, or development
activity (e.g., reducing dependencies) may be most bene-
cial. In the context of our organization it served to highlight
the values of available infrastructure to address some of the
common errors.
For tool builders, the analysis on the frequency of build
errors and resolution time serves to identify areas where
developers can get the most benet by assistive tools. In
fact, our study clearly shows that better tools to resolve de-
pendency errors have the greatest potential payo, and the
infrastructure team in our organization is already allocating
their eorts based on this outcome. Similarly, the quanti-
cation by error message and type served for the compiler
team to identify error messages that, based on their failure
rates relative to other messages, need to be revisited as they
may be confusing developers.
For researchers, this work contributes in establishing the
importance of building in the overall development process,
and in quantifying the cost of specic resolution times. Fur-
ther, this work highlights the need for techniques that can
pro-actively analyze a combination of source code and build
les to reduce the introduction of build errors, and support
the x of such errors when they occur.

This study is novel for characterizing how programmers
in industry interact with their compiler and build tools.

IDE to record how often undergraduate programmers edited
and recompiled their code. Jadud's analysis diered from
ours by reasoning about individual programming sessions
rather than over months. Jadud found programmers had
short intervals between compiles, usually compiling within
seconds after receiving a syntax error, but with minutes be-
tween compiles after a successful compile. Our data on time
to resolve errors suggests longer delays between compiles,
especially when xing dependency-related issues. Students
encountered dierent Java errors in Jadud's study, slightly
resembling our C++ developers with syntax problems and
unknown variables (25% of errors) being the most common
errors. Jadud also found that 44% of failed compiles were
followed by another failed compile, compared with our ob-
servation that most classes of errors were resolved in one
compile 75% of the time. The dierence is most likely the
result of the fact that we only consider the resolution time
for compiles with one error. Denny et. al [4] also logged
compile errors encountered by student programmers coding
in Java. They found that 48% of compiles failed; cannot
resolve identifier was the most common error, followed
bytype mismatch . Like us, their students were using a
standard Java compiler.
Speeding compilation and removing errors is often as-
sumed to aect programmer productivity. Dyke not only
studied the frequency of compilation and compiler errors,
but tested for correlation with productivity (as measured by
nal grade) [5]. Number of runs (both debug and normal)
did correlate with grade, suggesting that the more success-
ful compiles and more runs completed are related to better
productivity.
Less is known about the behavior of programmers in in-
dustry, and most studies focus on higher-level tasks rather
than specically on compiles [6]. Singer et al. [16] observed
programmer work at a large company, via logging tool use
as well as direct observation. Compilers were the most fre-
quent tool used, accounting for 40% of all actions performed
by the programmers; they similarly found testing and ver-
ication runs complicated analysis, but they provided few
details about the compiles performed.
Other studies have looked at the behavior of builds and
releases in large systems, though none have directly studied
the cost of build-related problems for programmers during
a programming session. McIntosh et al. explored the com-
plexity of the build systems for several large open-source
projects, and measured cost of complex build systems to
developers [13]. Neitsch et al. explored the complexity and
fragility of typical build specications by noting the prob-
lems building source distributions of various open-sourceprojects [14]. Both papers highlight the complexity of large
systems, and hint at why certain errors caused by build con-
gurations might require multiple attempts to correct.
Other studies are more focused on showing the impact
of tools meant to support build le maintenance and evo-
lution. For example, Adams et al. [2], designed and im-
plemented a tool to reverse engineer build les to support
system evolution. The application of this tool to two large
code bases reects the complexity involved in large, indus-
trial build processes. The recent work of Tamrawi et al. [17]
brings symbolic analysis to operate on build les to derive
dependency graphs. These graphs are then used to support
error and smell detection in build les; studies show their
potential on open code bases and in an assessment includ-
ing eight graduate students. Our study highlights why such
tools are important by quantifying the time programmers
spend trying to x compile errors that could be repaired
automatically. Our results on errors causing the most di-
culty suggest additional tools and areas of analysis to help
programmers spend less time xing compile errors.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this work we presented what we believe is the largest
study about the errors developers encounter when building
their code. We quantied, categorized, and analyzed build
errors, their frequency, and their resolution based on 26.6
million builds. In spite of its magnitude, like any empirical
study, this work has limitations. It reects the setting of
one software development organization, the primary source
of data is global build system logs, it does not discriminate
based on project or contextual attributes, and the devel-
oper and error counting and classication schemes were de-
ned carefully but still arbitrarily. Our future work involves
deeper analysis on dependency-related errors, ner measures
on resolution time and studying x patterns for automatic
x. Still, the insights derived from this study can be used
as a baseline to better understand how developers build and
to guide future process renements and tool development to
improve developer productivity.
