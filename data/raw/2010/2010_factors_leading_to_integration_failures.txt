ABSTRACT  
Feature -driven software development is a novel approach that has 
grown in popularity over the past decade . Researchers and pract i-
tioners alike have argued that numero us benefits could be ga r-
nered from adopting a feature -driven development approach. 
However, those persuasive arguments  have not been matched with 
supporting empirical evidence . Moreover, developing software 
systems around features involve s n e w  t e c h n i c a l  a n d organiz a-
tional elements that could have significant implications for out-
comes such as software quality. This paper presents an empirical 
analysis of a large -scale project that implemented 1195 features  in 
a software system . We examined the impact that technical attri b-
utes of product features, attributes of the feature teams and cro ss-
feature interactions have  o n  software integration failures. Our 
results show that t e c h n i c a l  factors such as the nature of comp o-
nent dependencies and organizational factors such as the ge o-
graphic dispersion of the feature teams and the role of the feature 
owners ha d c o m p l e m e n t a r y  i m p a c t  s u g g e s t i n g  t h e i r  i n d e p e n d e n t  
and important role in terms of software quality. Furthermore, our 
analyses revealed that cross -feature interaction s, measured as the 
number of architectural dependencies between two product fe a-
tures, are a major driver of integration failures. The resear ch and 
practical implications of our results are discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION 
A product feature is an important concept in software develo p-
ment  because it conveys attributes of a product relevant to all the  
stakeholders involved in the development process. For example, a customer  might communi cate his/her requirements for a particular 
product  a s  a  c o l l e c t i o n  o f  c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s  o r  f e a t u r e s  t h e  p r o d u c t  
ought to have or a software architect  might  make design decision s 
based on the collection of features that will be part of a product. 
Over the yea rs, researchers and practitioners alike have articulated 
a number of benefits that could be garnered from adopting a fea-
ture-driven development approach.  For instance f rom a technical 
point  of view, past work has argued that feature -driven develop-
ment enh ances development flexibility (e.g. [28]), facilitates fo r-
mal modeling of systems (e.g. [31 ]) and even leads to higher lev-
els of quality (e.g. [27]). From a process perspective, the concept  
of features is an integral part of the software product lines ap-
proach [12]. Finally from an organizational perspective, researc h-
ers have ar gued that features represent very valuable entities  that 
can facilitate coordination, collaboration and overall governance 
of software projects [8, 32]. 
Despite the growing popularit y and adoption of feature -driven 
software development, we have very limited understanding as to 
how the technical attributes  o f  f e a t u r e s  i m p a c t  t r a d i t i o n a l  d e v e l-
opment outcomes such as productivity and quality. Furthermore, 
there are also a number of o rganizational parameters that are i n-
volve d i n  t h e  u s a g e  o f  a  f e a t u r e -driven develop ment approach 
such as configuring feature teams and selecting feature owners. 
The current state of the art on how those  organizational aspects of 
feature -oriented development impact outcomes such as develop-
ment productivity or software quality consists  mostly of anecdotal 
evidence . 
In this paper, we examine the impact that technical attributes  o f  
product features, attributes of the feature teams and cross -feature 
interactions hav e on integration failures. We collected data from a 
large -scale global software development project that implemented 
1195 features over a period of 32 month s of activity. Our results 
show that t e c h n i c a l  a n d  o r g a n i z a t i o n a l  f a c t o r s  h a v e  c o m p l e m e n-
tary impact suggesting their independent and important role in 
terms of software quality. In particular, we found that the level of 
technical coupling within features, the concentration  of that cou-
pling across architectural components, the geographic distribution 
of feature teams as well as the group membership of feature own-
ers were important factors leading to integration failures. Fur-
thermore, our analyses revealed that cross -feature interactions, 
measured as the number of architectural dependencies between 
two prod uct features, are a major driver of integration failures.  
The rest of the document is organized as follows. We  first discuss 
past work and the research questions examined in this paper. 
Then, we describe our research setting, research des ign and r e-
sults. We conclude with a discussion of the contributions, limit a-
tions and future research directions.

1612. INTEGRATION FAILURES IN FE A-
TURE-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT 
Software quality has been the subject of a large bod y of past r e-
search work , a n d  n u m e r o u s  f a c t o r s  that negatively impact soft-
ware quality have been identified (e.g. [7, 10, 13, 14, 17, 25, 26,  
30, 34]. A distinctive characteristic of that w o r k  i s  t h e  f o c u s  o n  
particular units of a software system such as files, classes, mod-
ules, components or binaries  a n d  h o w  t heir technical attributes  
and patterns of change impact their quality. Those s oftware ent i-
ties represent tangible boundaries that support critical design pr in-
ciples such as abstraction, information hiding and , in general, 
modular design . Feature -driven dev elopment  introduces a distin c-
tive n e w  e l e m e n t ,  t h e  p r o d u c t  f e a t u r e ,  w h i c h  h a s  c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s  
that differ from what we traditionally consider as a software e ntity 
(e.g. a file, class, module or component). First, product feature s, 
like aspects [ 20] tend to cut across those traditional software ent i-
ties. In doing so, they define  n e w  t e c h n i c a l  b o u n d a r i e s  which 
might include , for instance,  entire component s o r  portion s o f  
them. Second, those new boundaries tend to create a challenging 
tension between adequatel y designing and implementing the ne c-
essary functionality of the product features and the integ rity of the 
architectural components or modules involved or impacted by the 
various product features. Given the se differences between features 
and the traditional  s o f t ware entities, it is important to consider 
how the specific technical attributes  of features such as the cha r-
acteristics of architectural dependencies embedded in the feature  
impact software quality. I n particular, we are interested in sof t-
ware qualit y o u t c o m e s  in the context  o f  i n t e g r a ting the various 
parts that constitute a feature , which is a critical process step in 
feature -driven development.  This leads to the following research 
question:  
RQ1a: What is the impact of technical attributes of a 
product feature on failures during the integration of 
that feature?  
It is well established that software development invo lves not just a 
technical dimension but also a socio -organizational one. For e x-
ample, i ndividual -level experience, either technical or domain -
specific, has been found to be an important factor leading to  errors  
and failures  in the development of software systems (e.g. [4, 13, 
14]). Configuration aspects of the development teams are also 
another important set of factors  t h a t  i m p a c t  i m p o r t a n t  s oftware 
development outcomes such as quality . For instance, the ge o-
graphic dispersion of the team members (e.g. [9, 10]), the chara c-
teristics of the leaders and manager as well as their leadersh ip 
styles [33], the pattern s o f  i n t e r a c t i o n  on t a s k  t r a c k i n g  s ystems 
[34] as well as the number of individuals involved in the devel-
opment of a piece of software  (e.g. [17]) impact software quality.  
A key aspect of feature -driven development is the establishment 
of feature teams to develop  t h e  n e c e s s a r y  f e a t u r e s  [ 2 7 ] . Those 
teams tend to be short -lived (just for the duration of developing a 
feature) and individuals tend to be members of multiple  feature 
teams. Socio-organizational factors  s e e m  l i k e l y  t o  play a major 
role in the quality outcomes of feature teams , but  given the su b-
stantial differences in development organized around feature 
teams as opposed to traditional teams, it is difficult to know what 
attributes will have important effects.  This leads to the following 
research question : 
RQ1b: What is the impact of  organizational attributes 
of the feature team on failures during the integration 
of a product feature?  The previous paragraphs have considered technical an d organiz a-
tional factors in the context of a single product feature. Howev er, 
product features do no t exist in isolation. They depend or interact 
with other product features. A growing body of work has shown  
that cross -feature s interaction s are a major challenge . Calder and 
colleagues [6] a r g u e d  t h a t  c u r r e n t  r e s e a r c h  c h a l l e n g e s  i n c l u d e  
understanding wher e potential interaction s arise , how to determine 
that an interaction did in fact occur and how to resolve it . Those 
gaps in the literature lead  us to the following research question:  
RQ2: How can we assess  c r o s s -feature interactions 
and what is their impac t on failures during the int e-
gration of product features?  
3. RESEARCH SETTING 
We collected data from a development organization responsible 
for producing a navigation system  for automobiles . Our data co v-
ered 32 months of development activity between 2006 and 2008 
corresponding to the last version of the product. One  hundred and 
seventy nine  engineers  located in 6 development sites distributed 
across North America, Europe and India participated in the pr o-
ject. Those developers were organized in 13 development t eams.  
Most of the teams involved engineers from at least 2 development 
sites. Telephone, conference calls and  e m a i l  w e r e  t h e  p r i m a r y  
mechanisms of communication among distributed teams and e n-
gineers .  The use of  lightweight  collaboration  technologies such as 
instant messaging and wikis was not allowed. The project also had 
daily status meetings organized like scrum meetings.  
The system was composed of about 1.5  million lines of code di s-
tributed in 6,789  source code files and 107 architectural comp o-
nents. The development responsibilities of each component were 
assigned to a single development team. The  source code files were 
written mostly in C++ but contained a significant amount of code 
written in C and Assembly  language. All developers ha d full a c-
cess t o the version control system,  the task tracking  system and a 
document repository that contained requirements, architectural 
and design specifications .  
The project involved the development of 1 ,195 product featur es. 
The organization utilized a featur e-oriented development ap-
proach and it started using that  approach  5 years prior to the time 
covered by our data.  In th is project,  the software  architects and the 
software architecture of the sy stem pla yed an important role in the 
feature -oriented development  process . Software a rchitects were 
respons ible for an alyzing the descriptions of each product feature  
and determining the set of architectural comp onents that would 
have to be altered or e nhanced in order to i mplemen t the r e-
quested feature. The sof tware architects, then, produce a feature 
develo pment specification that contained a d escription of the work 
to be done in each arch itectural component. The feature  t e a m s  
used those specifications to do the detailed design a nd implemen-
tation  o f  t h e  f e a t u r e . O n c e  a feature deve lopment specification 
was wri tten, the ma nagement of the project defined a feature team 
that would be assigned to that  particular product feature . The fe a-
ture teams were c omposed of engineers for the tea ms responsible 
from the architectural comp onents  that were impacted by the fe a-
ture as i ndi cat ed i n t he feat ur e speci fi c ation document . Manag e-
ment also assigned a feature owner to each  product feature . That 
individual was a senior eng ineer, a group leader  or a manager 
from one of the teams involved in the feature team. The  organiz a-
tion did not have any specific process for s electing feature ow n-
ers. However, project executives tended to base their selection on 
162experience with the type of pro duct feature and they also tried to 
balance the feature ownership load across all feature owners.  
Once completed, e ach product feature was delivered to an integra-
tion and testing  (I&T) team who was responsible for two activ i-
ties. First, they  merg ed the source code of the f eature into a pre-
release branch in the version control system. Following that step, 
they ran  a collection of integration testing suites that evaluated t he 
feature just integrated as well as all the previously in tegrated fe a-
tures. The test suite consisted of a collection of tests defined by 
architects and engineers to evaluate the requirements of each fea-
ture. The I&T team implemented the test suites in two compl e-
mentary parts. One part consisted of simple tests (similar in nature 
to a “smoke test”) that we re run on the software system using a 
simulator for the real hardware . A second part of the testing in-
cluded the full implementation of the test s a n d  i t  w a s  e x e c u t e d  
against the software system running on the actual hardware of the 
embedded system. The out comes of the integration tests were 
recorded  a n d  k e p t  a s  p a r t  o f  t h e  p r o j e c t ’ s  r e p o s i t o r i es. T he I&T 
team recorded for each integration test  whether the tests assoc i-
ated with the recently integrated feature passed or not. They also 
recorded whether the tes ts associated with features integrated in 
the past passed or not.  
Our empirical analyses are organized in two parts. In section 4, 
we examine research questions 1a and  1b related to technical and 
organizational attributes of features that lead to integrat ion fail-
ures. In section 5, we examine the role of cross -feature intera c-
tions on integration failures (RQ2).  
4. WHAT FACTORS DRIVE FAILURES 
WHEN INTEGRATING FEATURES? 
The first step in our investigation was to examine how technical 
attributes  o f  a  p r o d u c t  f e a ture as well as c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s  o f  t h e  
feature teams responsible for developing that product feature i m-
pact the occurrence of software failures at the time of integra ting 
the product feature. The literature on software failures is vas t and 
over the years numerous aspects of a software systems as well as 
aspects of the development process have been linked to failures 
(e.g. [1, 5, 9, 17, 19, 22, 26, 30, 34]). That work guided us in the 
selection of independent variables as well as control factors that 
might impact failures  during the integration of features . The rest 
of this section describes in detail the m e a s u r e s  a n d  s t a t i s t i cal 
models used in our analyses followed by our results.  
4.1 Description of the Measures 
In order to address research question s 1a and 1b , we collected a 
number of measures from various  data sources including the pr o-
ject’s software repositories  and document ation as well as human 
resource records . 
4.1.1 Measuring Integration Failures  
As discussed earlier , the I&T t e a m  i n t e g r a t e d  each feature ind i-
vidually. That p r o c e s s  a l l o w e d  t h e  t e a m  t o  r u n  a  c o l l e c t i o n  o f  
integration tests  to evaluate the feature just integrated as well as 
all the previously integrated features. The I&T team recorded for 
each integration test whether the tests associated with the recently 
integrated feature passed or not. They also recorded whethe r the 
tests associated with previously integrated features  passed or not. 
Our outcome  measure  is a dichotomous variable where a 1 ind i-
cates that at least one of the tests performed by the I&T team at 
the time of integrating a feature failed. O therwise, the variable is 
set to 0.  4.1.2 Independent Variables  
Our independent measures are organized in two groups. We first 
describe  a  c o l l e c t i o n  o f  technical attributes  o f  t h e  f e a t u r e s  t h a t  
were assessed . The development of each product feature consisted 
of o n e  o r  m o r e  t r a n s a c t i o n s  i n  t h e  v e r s i o n  c o n t r o l  s y s t e m  t h a t  
impacted one or more architectural  c o m p o n e n t s. From those 
transactions, we collected the Changed  LOCs , which  accounts for 
the number of non -comment non -empty lines of code that were 
added, deleted and modified as part of developing a feature . I n  
addition to the amount of change, the locality of those changes 
might be relevant to integration failures. For example, if the m a-
jority of the changes a re collocated in the single component i n-
volved in a feature, it might be easier to test them and assess their 
potential impact and implications. On the other hand, if the 
changes are dispersed across all the components involved in the 
feature, testing the changes or understanding their potential impl i-
cation might be more challenging. In order to reach a  better u n-
derstanding of how tho se different patterns of code change within 
a feature might impact integration failures, we computed the Con-
centration  of Cha nged LOCs  measure . Building o n past work that 
examined the notion of dispersion of software engineers across 
development locations (e.g. [7] and [10]), we evaluated two ap-
proaches for constructing the measure . One approach (based on 
[7]) uses the standard deviation of the changes made to each co m-
ponent involved in a feature. Smaller values indicate that the 
changes are relatively evenly distributed among the changed co m-
ponents. A second approach builds on entropy -based measures 
(e.g. [10]) to assess the degree of concentration of changes  in one 
particular architectural component. Both measures had equivalent 
impact of the results from the regression models. We chose to  
include the measure based on the first approach because th e fit of 
the regression models w as higher than the fit obtained when using 
the entropy -based approach . 
Technical coupling among constituent parts of a soft ware system 
has consistently been shown to impact software failures  (e.g. [5, 9, 
26, 30 ]). A measure of the extent of the technical c oupling within 
each feature was collected from the architectural description of 
the s ystem . The Number of  Dependencies  variable  r e f e r s  t o  t h e  
number of interfaces that the architectural components involved 
within a feature had with each other . In other wor ds, Number of 
Dependencies measures the int er-component coupling within the 
boundaries of a product feature.  As in the case of changes in the 
source code, the locality of the technical dependencies within a 
feature might impact failures. Past work in the a rea of coupling 
and cohesion (e.g. [9, 26, 30]) would suggest that if the inter -
component dependencies within a feature are concentrated in one 
or few components, their high levels of coupling could lead t o  
failures. How ever, a product feature aggregates t hose different 
patterns of technical coupling, therefore it is unclear how they 
might impact failures when considering features as the  unit of 
analyses rather than architectural components. In order to shed 
light on the relationship between technical coupling and product 
features, we computed the  Concentration  o f  D e p e n d e n c i e s  vari-
able a s  t h e  s t a n d a r d  deviation of the number of dependencies 
among all possible pairs of components involved in a feature.  
Smaller values indicate that the dependencies are re latively evenly 
distributed among the components  involved in a product feature . 
As indicated in the previous paragraph, this approac h of construc t-
ing the measure prove d to be a better measure than other a p-
proaches (e.g. an entropy -based measure)  for the statis tical models 
used in our analyses . 
163In a second set of measures we assessed  organizational properties 
of the feature teams involved in the development of a feature. 
GSD  is a dichotomous variable where 1 indicates that the feature  
team members were located i n different development sites ; othe r-
wise it is set to 0. It is worth pointing out that all the project me m-
bers that were collocated work in a single open space in individual 
cubicles. We also measure d the Number of Developers  that were 
part of the feature teams. As discussed earlier, feature team me m-
bers were selected from formal groups responsible for the various 
architectural compone nts. Therefore, we also measured  the Num-
ber of Groups  i n v o l v e d  i n  t h e  d e v e l o p m e n t  o f  each feature . Fi-
nally, we constructed  two measures that assess  t h e  r e l a t i o n s h i p  
between the organizational and the technical dimensions of deve l-
oping a product feature. The feature owner has an important role 
within the development effort associated with a featur e because it 
is the individual r esponsible for making sure the feature team is 
able to accomplish its goal of developing the feature. In our re-
search setting, feature owners were selected from among the 
members of the  g r o u p s  r e s p o n s i b l e  f o r  t h e  c o m p o n e n t s  b e i n g  
affected by a product feat ure suggesting that feature owners might 
have particular sets of skills, experiences and relationships that 
might benefit certain members of a feature team and hin der ot h-
ers. Therefore, we computed the Feature Owner Belongs to 
Highly Coupled Component  m easure as a dichotomous variable, 
which is set to 1 if the feature  o w n e r  b e l o n g e d  t o  t h e  g r o u p  r e-
sponsible for the component with the h ighest number of technical 
dependencies within the assigned feature.  Similarly, we computed 
the measure Feature Owner Belong s to Highly Changed Comp o-
nent, which is set to 1 if the fea ture owner belonged  to the group 
responsible for the component that was changed the mo st as part 
of the development of the focal  feature . 
4.1.3 Additional Control Factors  
We collected  a number of additio nal measures that past research 
has shown to be relate d t o  softwa re quality and, consequently, 
relevant to modeling  i n t e g r a t i o n  f a i l u r e s  [2, 5, 17, 26, 30]. For 
each p r o d u c t  f e a t u r e , we collected the Number of Modification 
Requests  a s  r e p o r t e d  i n  t h e  m o d i f ication request (MR) tracking 
system associated with each feature . We also collected the Total 
Size in LOC s of the components that were involved in a feature. It 
is well established that over time development organizations learn 
and mature their processes and practices and consequently, tend to 
reduce mistakes and errors. Therefore, we computed the va riable 
Time  t h a t  r e p r e s e n t s  t h e  w e e k  w i t h i n  t h e  p r o j e c t  o n  w h i c h  t h e  
feature was integrated.  
Finally, we collected measures of experience based  o n  t h e  a p-
proach es used by Boh and col l eagues  [ 4]  and Espinosa and co l-
league s [15], which utilize  the data in software repositories as the 
basis for assessing experience. We measured prior  experience on 
the product in two different ways. Average MR Experience  as-
sessed  the average number of MR that the feature team member  
worked on prior to the focal feature . Average Component  Exper i-
ence measured  the average number of times that the feature team  
members modified the architectural components associated with 
the focal  feature  prior to the beginning of the development of the 
feature .  
4.2 Description of the Model 
Our dependent measure is a dichotomous variable. Conse quently, 
we used  logistic regression models to examine research questions  
1a and 1b . We followed a traditional  hierar chical approach where 
we start our analyses  w i t h  a  b a s e l i n e  m o d e l  t h a t  c o n t a i n s  o n l y  control factors . In subsequent models, we added the various  inde-
pendent  measures associated with the different research questions. 
This modeling approach allows us to unde rstand the independent 
and relative impact on integration failures of each set of factors .  
In order to assess the fit of each model, we report the deviance  of 
each model as well as the percentage of deviance explained by the 
model . The deviance of a m odel is defined as “ -2 * log -likelihood 
of the model”  and lower values are associated with better fit of the 
model to the data . The percentage of the deviance explained is a 
ratio of the deviance of the null model (contains only the inte r-
cept) and the deviance  of the final model. In order to simplify the 
interpretation of the results, we report the odds ratios associate d 
with each measure instead of reporting the regression  coefficients. 
Odds ratios larger than 1 indicate a positive relati onship between 
the ind ependent and dependent variables whereas an odds ratio 
less than 1 indicates a negative relationship.  
4.3 Results 
4.3.1 Preliminary Analyses  
The first step in our analysis consisted in examinin g various d e-
scriptive statistics of the measures described earlier. Seve ral var i-
ables had skewed distributions so they were log -transformed. In 
the next step, we performed various collinearity diagnostics. A 
variance  inflation factors (VIF) analysis revealed that several of 
the measures were highly collinear. In accordance wit h well -
established recommendations, we removed from our analyses all 
the variables with VIF values above 5 [23]. A pair -wise correl a-
tion analysis among those remaining measures showed levels o f 
correlation that were not problematic with the highest values be-
ing 0.359 and 0.258  between Changed LOCs  and Number of D e-
pendencies and Time , respectively . 
Table 1 reports the results of our regression analys es examining 
the impact on integration failures of various technical and orga ni-
zational factors. Model I repor ts t h e  o d d s  r a t i o s  a s s o c i a t e d  w i t h  
the control factors included in our analyses. As expected, Time  
and higher levels of Average Component Experiences  are assoc i-
ated with lower probability of failures. For instance, an additi onal 
week in the development pro ject corresponding to a unit increase 
in the variable Time  reduces the likelihood of failure (odds ratio 
equal to 0.992 – lower than 1) by 0.8% considering  all other fa c-
tors constant.  
4.3.2 The Impact of Technical Attributes of Features  
We examined research ques tion 1a with model II in table 1. The 
model includes the technical attributes  of the feature to study their 
impact on integration failures. Our results do  not provide evidence 
that either the amount of source code changed ( Changed LOCs ) 
during the developm ent of the feature or t h e  concentration  o f

the level of technical coupli ng (Number of Dependencies ) among 
the components involved in the feature and the degree of conce n-
tration  of that coupling ( Concentration  of Number of Depende n-
cies) do have a statistically significant effect on inte gration fai l-
ures. We observe that the high er the number of architectural de-
pendencies among the components  that are impact ed by a feature, 
the higher the likelihood of failures (odds ratio > 1 ) .  Moreover,  
the higher the concentration of the coupling in a smaller number 
of components is, the higher  is the likelihood of integration fail-
ures.

4.3.3 The Impact of Organizational Attributes of 
Feature Teams  
In model III, we examined the role that org anizational attributes 
of the feature teams have on integration failures (RQ1b). We ob-
serve that several organizational factors have a statistically si g-
nificant impact on integration failures. As the number of deve l-
opment groups that work on a feature incr eases, so does the  prob-
ability of occurrence of integration failures. In addition, ge o-
graphic di spersion of the feature team has  a major impact of int e-
gration failures. When the engineers that worked on the feature 
were  geographically distributed, the like lihood of integration fail-
ures is almost 14 times higher than when all engineers are in the 
same location (odds ratio = 13.924). We also examine d how the 
group membership of the feature owner impacted the outcome of 
the feature teams. We found that selecti ng the feature owner from 
the group that is responsible for the architectural component w ith 
the highest level of technical coupling within the product feature 
helps reduce the probability of integration failures to occur. Sp e-
cifically, having the feature owner belong to the group responsible 
for the highest coupled component decreases the likelih ood of 
failures by about 20% (odds ratio=0.839) compared to n ot having 
the feature owner belong to that development group.  
Models II and III provide insight on the  relative impact on failures 
of the technical attributes  o f  p r o d u c t  f e a t u r e s  a n d  o r g a n i z a t i o n a l  
characteristics of feature teams. Organizational attributes explain 
21.1% of the deviance  in the data (the difference in the deviance 
explained between model II  and III) whereas technical attributes  
of feature explained 13.6% of the deviance . Those results hig h-
light the significant impact that the characteristics of feature teams  
have on the outcomes of feature -driven development endeavors  
4.3.4 Additional Analyses  
We performed additional analyses to examine the potential cond i-
tional impact of particular factors such as which group the fe ature 
owner belonged to and the geographic dispersion of the feature 
team. The conditional impact of the variables can be studied with  
interaction terms in a regression model. An interaction between two 
factors, for instance, GSD  and Feature Owner Belongs to Highly 
Coupled Component , allows us to examine how the impact of one 
factor (e.g. Feature Owner Belongs to Highly Coupled Comp o-nent) on the dependent variable changes for different values of the 
second factor  (e.g. feature team is collocated  or not).  
In model  III, we found that the group to which the feature owner 
belongs is an important organizational factor in the context of  inte-
gration failures. However, the impact of such factor might differ 
depending whether the feature team members are geographically 
distributed or not. In addition, the level of concentration  i n  t h e  
changes to the code or in the technical coupling among component s 
might moderate the impact of having the feature owner b elonging to 
a particular group. For example, it might be only beneficial to  have 
the feature owner belong to the group that is responsible for  the 
component with the highest amount of changes or depe ndencies 
only when the concentration  l evel s are relatively  hi gh . In order to 
explore tho se potential conditional effects, model IV  of table 1 in-
cludes several interaction terms that were selected based on the 
results reported in models II and III . All inde pendent variables  were 
mean -centered, an approach traditionally used to address the colli n-
earity issues introduced by the interaction terms.  
 
Figure 1: The Interplay between the Concentration  of Techn i-
cal Coupling within a Feature and the Feature Owner Belon g-
ing to the Highly Coupled Component.  
The results reported in model IV show only  o n e  i n t e r a c t i o n  t e r m ,  
Concentration  o f  N u m b e r  o f  D e p e n d e n c i e s  X F e a t u r e  O w n e r  
Belongs to Highly Coupled Component , is statistically significant  
165suggesting that the impact of the concentration  of the technical co u-
pling within a feature is moderated by whether the feature owner 
belong s to the group responsible for the highly coupled components 
or not . An odds ratio below 1 indicates that when the feature owner 
belongs to the group responsible for the highest coupled component, 
the negative impact of higher levels of concentration of the tec hni-
cal coupling is reduced. Figure 1 illustrates this point  by depicting 
how the probabilities of integration failure estimated by our logi stic 
regression models change as the number of dependencies changes . 
As the concentration  o f  t h e  n u m b e r  o f  d e p e n d e n c i e s  i n c r e a s e s  ( x  
axis), we observe that the estimated probability of failure (y axis) 
increases faster when the feature owner does not belon g to the 
group responsible for the component with the highest level of cou-
pling (solid line in figure 1) than when the feature owner belongs to 
the group responsible for the component with the highest level of 
coupling (dashed line in figure 1). In fact, t he probability of failure 
reduces by half in the latter case where the  number of dependencies 
is higher than 40 . Furthermore, we see that this relationship inverts 
for lower values of concentration  i n  t h e  n u m b e r  o f  d e p e n d e n c i e s  
(values < 20).  
5. CROSS -FEATURE INTERACTIONS 
AND INTEGRATION FAILURES 
We now turn our attention to cross -feature interactions  and their 
implication for integration of features. In particular, we examine 
how architectural dependencies that represent relationships b e-
tween product features  impact the occurrence of integration fai l-
ures in a feature -driven development setting. The rest of the se c-
tion describes in detail the measures and statistical models used in 
our analyses as well as the results of our investigations.  
5.1 Description of the Measures 
In order to address research question  2, we collected a number of 
measures from various data sources including the project’s sof t-
ware repositories, documentation and human resource records.  
5.1.1 Measuring Integration Failures  
In this case, our unit of an alysis is the pair of product features. As 
described  in section 3, product features were integrated into a pre -
release development stream  individually . Then, the I&T team ran 
a collection of integration tests every time a feature was inte-
grated. Using such  i n f o r m a t i o n ,  w e  c o n s t r u c t e d  o u r  d a t a s e t  o f  
pairs of features in the following way. When a feature F n w a s  
integrated, we created n -1 pairs (F 1, Fn) … (F n-1, Fn). Considering 
all 1,195 features developed in the project and integ rated, we had 
a total of 713 ,416 possible pairs of features. Our dependent mea s-
ures is a dichotomous variable where a 1  associated with a pair of 
features (F x, Fy) indicates that the integration tests associated wit h 
either features F x or F y failed at the time of integrating feature Fy 
(assuming that feature Fy was integrated after feature Fx).  
5.1.2 Measuring Cross -Features Interactions  
We measured the  Number of Cross -Features Dependencies  for a 
pair of features (F x, Fy) as t he number of architectural dependen-
cies that the components invol ved in feature Fx had with the co m-
ponents involved in feature Fy. The data a b o u t  a r c h i t e c t u r a l  d e-
pendencies were  extracted from the project’s software architecture 
documentation that contained detailed descriptions of all 107 a r-
chitectural components and t heir relationships.  
5.1.3 Additional Control Factors  
We collected a number of additional measures  f o r  e a c h  p a i r  o f  
features . Since our unit of analysis is the pair of features, integr a-tion failures could be impacted by a buggy feature that was in te-
grated in the past rather than by the feature being integrated. In 
order to control for this effect, we constructed dichotomous var i-
ables, Past Failures in the Past X Weeks . These variables mea s-
ured t he i mpact  of past failures associated with the features that 
were inte grated in the past – feature Fx in a given pair (F x, Fy) – 
when integrating a new feature F y. We considered 1 to 10 weeks 
time periods. For example, the variable Past Failures in the Past 5  
Weeks  would be set to 1 for the pair of features  (F x, Fy) if ther e 
has been an integration testing failure associated with F x i n  t h e  
past 5 weeks prior to integrating feature F y. We measured  t h e  
Changed  LOCs  a s  t h e  nu mb e r  of  no n -comment non -empty lines 
of code that were added, deleted and modified  as part of develo p-
ing both features in each pair . The measure  Number of Modific a-
tion Requests  captured the number of MRs  associa ted with each 
pair of features as reported in the  MR tracking system.  It is well 
established that over time development organizations learn and 
mature  t h e i r  p r o c e s s e s  a n d  p r a c t i c e s  a n d  c o n s e q u e n t l y ,  t e n d  t o  
reduce mistakes and errors. Therefore, we computed the va riable 
Time  f o r  e a c h  p a i r  o f  f e a t u r e s  (Fx, Fy) that represents the week 
within the project on which the feature Fy was integrated.  
We also assessed  a set of organizational properties of the feature 
teams involved  in the development of each pair of features . GSD  
is a dichotomous variable where 1  indicates that the members of 
either  feature teams  involved in the development of the features in 
a given pair (F x, Fy) were located in different development sites; 
otherwise it is set to 0. As indicated earlier, all the project me m-
bers that were collocated work in a single open space in individual 
cubicles. We also measure the Number of Groups  involved in the 
development of each pair of features  a s  w e l l  a s  t h e  Number of 
Developers  t h a t  w e r e  p a r t  o f  t h o s e  f e a t u r e  t e a m s .  T h e  engineers 
involved in the development of a pair of features that belong to 
the same formal groups responsible for certain architectural  com-
ponents might have more opportunities to interact, communicate 
and coordinate than if they belong to different formal teams. 
Then, we computed the Overlap Among Groups  as the proportion 
of feature team members from F x that belong to the same set of 
formal groups that the members of the feature team associa ted 
with F y. We also computed the Same Feature Owner  measure as a 
dichotomous variable set to 1 if the same individual was the fe a-
ture owner for the pair of features; otherwise the measure was set 
to 0. Finally, we collected measures of experience based o n the 
approaches used by Boh and colleagues [4] and Espinosa and 
colleagues [15]. We measured prior experience on the product in 
two different ways. Average MR Experience  measures  the average 
number of MR that the feature team s’ members associated with a 
pair of features  w o r k e d  o n  p r i o r  t o  t h e  f o c a l  f e a t u r e .  Average 
Component  E x p e r i e n c e  represents  t h e  a v e r a g e  n u m b e r  o f  t i m e s  
that the feature team s’ members modified the components assoc i-
ated with each pai r of features . 
5.2 Description of the Model 
As in the case of the analyses reported in the previ ous section, our 
dependent measure is also dichotomous variable. Consequently, 
we followed the same modeling strategy (the use of logi stic r e-
gression  models ) descri bed in section 4.2.  
5.3 Results

with co llinearity, we removed from our analyses all the variables 
with variance inflation factor values  above 5  as s uggested  by the 
literature [23]. We also performed a pair -wise correlation analysis 
among those remaining measures and we did not find any corre la-
tions that should be a concern. The highest values were 0.391  and 
0.357 between Number of Cross -Feature Dependencies and the 
variables Number of Groups  and Changed LOCs , respectively.  
Table 2 reports the results of our regression analys es examining 
the i mpact of cross -features interactions  o n  i n t e g r a t i o n  f a i l u r e s . 
Model I presents the odds ratios associated with the  control fa c-
tors included in our analyses. As expected, the later in the pr o-
ject’s lifecycle a feature is integrated (the Time  variable), the  
lower the probability of integration failures , a result consistent 
with learning and development maturity arguments . I n  a d d i t i o n ,  
higher Number of Groups  involved in the development each pair 
of features and having those groups geographic ally d i s t r i b u t e d ,  
increased significantly the likelihood of integration failures to 
occur. On the other hand, two organiz ational factors, the propo r-
tion of members of the feature teams that developed a pair o f fea-
tures overlapped or belonged to the same formal groups i ncreased 
(the Overlap Among Groups  v a r i a b l e )  and h a v i n g  t h e  s a m e  f e a-
ture owner for both features in the pair (the Same Feature Owner  
variable)  h a d  a  p o s i t i v e  i m p a c t  o f  i n t egration failures, reducing 
their probability of occurrence . Finally in each pair of featu res (F x, 
Fy), past f ailures associated with a feature F x prior to the integr a-
tion of feature F y was also an impo rtant factor leading to integr a-
tion failures. As discussed earlier, we computed 10 different v er-
sions of the variables covering a period of 1 we ek prior to integra-
tion of a feature to 10 weeks prior. We found that the variab le 
corresponding to the 5 -week period worked best in our models. 
We think this particular result is r elated to characteristics of the 
project. An analysis of the d efects report s stored in the defect 
tracking system revealed that the ave rage time to resolve a defect 
was 11 days and the standard devi ation was 18 days, suggesting 
that in most defects were r esolved within a 5 -week period.  
5.3.2 The Impact of Cross -Feature Interactions  
Model II introduces the Number of Cross -Feature Dependencies  
into the analysis and we observe that its impact is statistically 
significant. The higher the Number of Cross -Feature Depende n-
cies a pair of features have, the higher the likelihood of integration  
failures to occur. It is also important to highlight that  this factor 
has a major impact in the explanatory power of the model repr e-
senting 17.9 % of the deviance explained by the model . This result suggests  that our metric could be a valuable tool  for prac titioner to 
identify where potential coordination problems  might occur . 
5.3.3 Additional Analyses  
We performed additional analyses to examine whether the strong 
impact of cross -feature interactions on integration failures was co n-
ditional on other factors. As dis cussed in section 4.3.4, conditional 
or moderating effects can be analyzed with interaction terms in a 
regression mode. Model  III, we introduced two interaction terms of 
particular interest: Number of Groups  X Number of Cross -Feature 
Dependencies  a n d  GSD  X N u m b e r  o f  C r o s s -Feature Depende n-
cies. G e o g r a p h i c  d i s p e r s i o n  a n d  h i g h e r  n u m b e r  o f  i n d i v i d u a l s  i n-
volved in the development are two well -established factors that 
increase the coordination complexity of software development e n-
deavors. Since model II showed su ch a strong negative impact on 
failures from the Number of Cross -Feature Dependencies , it is 
important two understand if such impact changes as the numbe r of 
groups involved in the development of a pair of features changes 
or whether those groups are geogr aphically distributed or not.  
The results reported in model III show only  o n e  i n t e r a c t i o n  t e r m ,  
GSD  X N u m b e r  o f  C r o s s -Feature Dependencies , is statistically 
significant . The odds ratio associated with the in teraction term is 
below 1 (0.799 ) suggesting that  the impact of cross -feature depen d-
encies is lower when developers of the feature teams are geograph i-
cally distributed than when they are collocated. These are une x-
pected results. Figure 2 illustrates the GSD  X N u m b e r  o f  C r o s s -
Feature Dependencies  i n t e r a c t ion effect  b y  d e p i c t i n g  t h e  c h a n g e s  
in the estimated probabilities of having integration failures as the 
number of cross -feature dependencies changes . As the number of 
cross -feature dependencies increases (x axis), we observe that there 
is a point (values > 4 in the log -transformed measure  on the x axis ) 
at which the probability of integration failures (y axi s) increases 
significantly faster when the features teams that worked o n a pair of 
features are collocated (solid line in figure 2) than w hen feature 
teams are geographically distributed (dashed line in figure 2). I t is 
important to point out that for levels of the cross -feature depende n-
cies measure below 5.5 (in the log -transformed values of the mea s-
ure), the probability of having integration failure s is more than do u-
ble for the GSD case than for the collocated case.  Such a result is 
consistent with the growing body of work showing the det rimental 
effects of distribution on quality (e.g. [7, 9]). However, when fe a-
tures are very highly interrelated (value s > 6), our results show that 
the impact of cross -feature dependencies is lower when feature 
teams are geographically distributed. One possible explanation fo r 
167this result is that the work practices developed by collocated tea ms 
might allow them to handle certain levels of interdependence be-
tween features very well. For example, dependencies might be han-
dled more informally because the interdependent engineers are 
physically collocated. However, beyond a certain point (e.g. in our 
analysis values > 4), those work practices failed to adequately id en-
tify and manage the interdependencies between features. On th e 
other hand, distributed teams are always at a disadvantage and re c-
ognizing such condition they might develop different work practices 
to manage depende ncies that help them cope better with high levels 
of interdependence.

of the Feature Teams and Cross -Feature Dependencies.  
5.3.4 Assessing the Robustness of the Results  
We performed one final analysi s t o  a s s e s s  t h e  r o b u s t n e s s  o f  t h e  
results reported in table 2. Our large dataset is characterized by 
having a low proportion of 1s in the outcome variable (an integr a-
tion failure associated with a pair of features) , which is  known as 
rare events data [21] . A traditional logistic regression run against 
a rare events dataset tends to underestimate the probability of the 
outcome [21]. Given that potential problem , we used a  strategy to 
overcome it as suggested by Hahn and colleagues [18] and, in the 
process, ev aluate the robustness of our results. The approach is 
known as  c h o i c e -based sampling and consists in  s t r a t e g i c a l l y  
constructing samples from the original dataset  based on the values 
of the outcome variable. We followed this procedure. First, w e 
constructed  two dataset with a random sample of 50% of the pairs 
of features that had integration failures. We then match those pair s 
with 5 pairs in one dataset and 10 pairs in the othe r that had the 
outcome variable 0. The se pairs were created using features int e-
grated within a week of the matched pair and involved one of the 
features in the match pair . We ran the same analyses reported on 
table 2 on these two additional datasets. The results were all co n-
sistent with the ones reported in table 2, providing additional co n-
fidence in our results.  
6. DISCUSSION  
Feature -driven development is a promising approach. In this p a-
per, we set out to empirically study how technical and organiz a-
tional factors impact outcomes in projects that use a feature -
driven development approach in order to further our understand-
ing of its potential. Specifically, we examined the impact that 
technical attributes  of product features and attributes of the feature 
teams that developed such feature have on one particular dimen-sion of software quality, integration failures. Our results showed 
the amount of architectural dependencies contained within a fe a-
ture as well as how those dependencies are distributed acros s 
components have an important effect on f a i l u r e s .  S p e c i f i c a l l y ,  
higher levels of technical coupling and higher concentration of 
such coupling in a small set of architectural components signif i-
cantly increase the probability of failures at the time of integrati ng 
a product feature. Most importantly, our analyses revealed that 
cross -feature intera ctions, measured as the number of architectural 
dependencies between two product features, are a major driver of 
integration failures. We also found that several attributes of the 
feature teams impacted quality. The number of engineer s involved 
in the development of a feature and their geographic dispers ion 
were detrimental to quality. However, our analyses showe d also 
that selecting a feature owner that is involved with a highly co u-
pled architectural component that is part of a product feature helps 
overco me the detrimental effects that other technical and o rgani-
zational factors have on the likelihood of integration failures to  
occur.  
The work r eported in this paper has four important contributions 
to the software engineering literature, in particular, to t he work on 
feature -oriented development. First, our results provide one of the 
very first empirical evaluations of a feature -oriented development 
setting and its implications for software quality. Second, our 
analyses explored how the technical and the organizational d i-
mensions of feature -oriented development  i m p a c t e d  integration 
failures as well as how the interplay between both dimensions  
impacted such failures . Third, we evaluated an a pproach to assess 
the impact of cross -feature inte ractions and the res ults showed 
that our measure based on architectural dependency i nformation 
was a major driver of integration failures a ccounting for almost 
18% of the deviance  i n  o u r  m o d e l .  F i n a l l y ,  o u r  r e s u l t s  p r o v i d e  
concrete guidance  to the practice of feature -oriented  development.  
We discuss in detail the pragmatic implic ations in section 6.3 . 
6.1 Limitations 
Our study has several limitations worth highlighting. First, our work  
examined a single development organization  a n d  a  s i n g l e  s y s t e m  
developed by that organization , which raises concerns regarding 
external validity. However, the characteristics of the system (e.g. 
embedded system developed in a combination of C++, C and a s-
sembly programming languages)  as well as the processes and work 
practices used by the studied organization are similar to those found 
in the telecommunication, healthcare, infotainment and automotive 
industries. Therefore, we think that our findings are applicable  
across a wide spectrum of corporate settings  that develop embedded 
systems using feature -oriented development approaches . 
As discussed in the literature (e.g. [6]), cross -feature interactions 
could stem from multiple sources including architectural depen d-
encies , logical or semantic dependencies not adequately repr e-
sented in architectural descr iptions or even from unknown d e-
pendencies among different parts of a software system. Our mea s-
ure of cross -feature interaction is based on architectural depen d-
ency information and captures only a fraction of the possible 
cross -feature interactions that mig ht exist in a system representing 
a limitation of our analysis. However, the strong impact that ou r 
measure had on the probability of integration failur es raises a pair 
of interesting questions: how much additional impact might other 
types of cross -feature  interactions have on failures? And how can 
we measure such interactions? We elaborate on these i ssues fu r-
ther in the implications for future research section.  
168Third , the organization we studied did not allow the use of ligh t-
weight  collaboration  t e c hnol ogi es such as in stant messaging  and 
wikis. Past research have found that such technologi es help sof t-
ware engineers be more aware of the activities that ar e taking 
place in the project and coordinate and collaborate better (e.g. [16, 
24, 34 ]). It is possible t hat the impact of some of the factors con-
sidered in our analyses were exacerbated by this particular limit a-
tion in our research setting. Future research should examine the 
impact those collaborative technologies in the context of ge o-
graphically distributed  feature -driven development . 
Finally, the development locations differed in the maturity of the 
development practices. All the development locations but the one 
in India started to use a feature -oriented development approach at 
the same time. The Indian site, on the other hand, was constra ined 
by their  h i g h  l e v e l s  o f  m a t u r i t y  i n  t h e i r  d e v e l o p m e n t  p r o c e s s e s  
(CMM level 5 ). Hence, their adoption of the more fluid develo p-
ment practices associated with fe ature-oriented development was 
limited. Ho wever, we do no t think that such disparity has a major 
impact in our results for two re asons. First, the amount of work 
done in the I ndian site was about 12% of the total development 
effort of the project and , second, most of the work was ass ociated 
with parts of a featu re. Only 17 product features out of the 1195 
were co mpletely developed by teams in India.   
6.2 Implications for Future Research  
The results of our study have important implications  for research.  
First,  our analyses revealed that the measure of  cross -feature  inter-
action based on architectural dependency information was a major 
predictor of integration failures. However, as discussed earlier,  such 
a measure represents a subset of all potential interactions between 
product features that might exist in a system. P ast research has 
shown that version control data can be used to identify  logical d e-
pendencies between part s of a software system. Those  dependencies 
have been found to drive relevant coordination needs among deve l-
opers that when satisfied development produ ctivity improves and 
probability of software failures to occur is reduced [11] . Then, a 
potentially valuable future research path is to explore combining 
those  t w o  a p p r o a c h e s  to measure cross -feature interactions, assess 
their impact on software quality as  well as examine their implic a-
tions for evolving software system either by adding more fea tures or 
modifying existing ones.  
Second, our findings showed an important detrimental  impact of 
geographic distribution on integration failures. Recent work in the 
areas o f  s o f t w a r e  q u a l i t y  a n d  d i s t r i b u t e d  d e v e l o p m e n t  h a s  s h o w n  
mixed results. For example, Ramasubbu  a n d  B a l a n  [29] f o u n d  n o  
evidence that geographic dispersion impacted quality outcomes of 
software development projects. Bird and colleagues [3] found  that 
collocated and distributed teams developed binaries with very sim i-
lar levels of quality. In contrast, Cataldo and Nambiar  [9, 10] found 
that different dimensions of geographic dispersion impacted ne ga-
tively the quality of architectural components as well a s the quality 
outcomes of projects. Such disparity in results might be indicative  
that the relationship between distributed development and software  
quality could be moderated by different technical and organizational 
factors that future research should ex amine.  
The relative role of tec hnical and organizational factors associated 
with product features suggested by our results point  out that future 
research in the area of collaborative technologies to support the 
development organization  could benefit from  consider ing product 
features as first order entities . Recently, researchers have argued that the concept of a product feature could represent the “g lue” to 
facilitate coordination, collaboration and overall governance of 
software development endeavors [8, 32]. Our results provide 
guidance on the set of factors and metrics that collaborative tech-
nologies can focus on in order to enhance the coordinative and 
collaborative capabilities of software development organizations, 
particularly, those that are geograph ically distributed. For exa m-
ple, considering product features as a first order entity , a collab o-
rative tool could collect cross -feature dependency information and 
automatically suggests potential interdependent engineers based 
on the individuals’ current work activities and the degree of cross -
feature interaction that between the features those ind ividuals are 
working on.  
Finally, the results of our analyses also call for a  more systematic 
evaluation of the range of organizational and governance princ i-
ples and practices that apply in the context of feature -driven d e-
velopment.  Our analyses focused on only three aspects: ge o-
graphic dispersion, selection of the feature owner and overlap in 
feature team membership. Certainly there are several o ther aspects 
that deserve further investigation such as different configura tional 
properties of geographic dispersion and the integration of feature -
oriented development with agile practices to name a few.  
6.3 Practical Implications  
Our results also have important practical implications. As software 
architecture has become a central element in the development proc-
ess of many software projects, it is quite common to have in early 
stages of projects, sufficient information of the software arc hitec-
ture, its constituent elements and their relationships. The strong 
impact on integration failures that cross -feature dependencies exhi b-
ited in our analyses suggest that software architects, software man-
ager or other stakeholders are now in a position to assess the level of 
cross -feature  i n t e r a c t i o n s ,  d e t e r m i n e  t h e i r  r e l a t i v e  i m p o r t a n c e  a n d  
plan appropriate organizational mechanisms to support the feature 
teams involved in developing highly interrelated features.  
Second, and in relation to the previous point , the detrimental impact 
of te chnical coupling within a product feature and cross -feature 
dependencies is likely to be reduced, our results suggest, by ad e-
quately selecting the feature owner. Traditionally , i n  s o f t w a r e  d e-
velopment as well as in  other engineering disciplines, the select ion 
criteria for technical leadership positions tend to be based on ex pe-
rience and technical expertise. Certainly, our analyses  do not di s-
pute such an approach but they suggest that if such a person is 
closely involved with an architectural component part of a product 
featured that highly coupled with the rest of the comp onents, such 
decision will pay off more in terms of software quality than if suc h 
person is closely involved in the development of any other compo-
nent of the product feature. Then, our find ings provide guidance to 
software managers and other decision makers of how to best  select 
feature owners.
