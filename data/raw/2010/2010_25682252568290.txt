ABSTRACT
Many guidelines for safety-critical industries such as aero-
nautics, medical devices, and railway communications, spec-
ify that traceability must be used to demonstrate that a rig-
orous process has been followed and to provide evidence that
the system is safe for use. In practice, there is a gap between
what is prescribed by guidelines and what is implemented
in practice, making it dicult for organizations and certi-
ers to fully evaluate the safety of the software system. In
this paper we present an approach, which parses a guideline
to extract a Traceability Model depicting software artifact
types and their prescribed traces. It then analyzes the trace-
ability data within a project to identify areas of traceability
failure. Missing traceability paths, redundant and/or incon-
sistent data, and other problems are highlighted. We used
our approach to evaluate the traceability of seven safety-
critical software systems and found that none of the evalu-
ated projects contained traceability that fully conformed to
its relevant guidelines.

1. INTRODUCTION
Developing software for regulated industries is a challeng-
ing process. Not only must the software deliver the required
features, but it must do so in a way that ensures that the
system is safe and secure for its intended use [27, 10]. To this

stringent guidelines before they can be approved or certied
for use [50, 19, 3]. For example, software developed for the
aerospace industry must comply to the ISO12207 and/or the
DO-178B guidelines, while software developed for European
railway communication, signaling, and processing systems,
must comply to EN50128 [13, 20]. Most guidelines prescribe
a set of steps, deliverable documents, and exit criterion fo-
cused around planning, analysis and design, implementa-
tion, verication and validation, conguration management,
and quality assurance activities. In addition they often pro-
vide specic guidelines for the creation and use of trace-
ability in the project. For example, depending upon the
criticality level of a requirement, the US Federal Aviation
Authority guideline DO-178B requires traceability from re-
quirements to design, and from requirements to source code
and executable object code [50].
In practice, traceability is achieved through the creation
and use of trace links , dened by the Center of Excellence
for Software and Systems Traceability (CoEST) as\specied
associations between a pair of artifacts, one comprising the
source artifact and one comprising the target artifact" [26,
12, 11]. Software traceability serves an important role in
demonstrating that a delivered software system satises its
software design constraints and mitigates all identied haz-
ards. When executed correctly, traceability demonstrates
that a rigorous software development process has been es-
tablished and systematically followed.
1.1 Traceability Challenges
Organizations struggle to establish and maintain accurate
and complete sets of traceability links [5, 38, 49, 48, 39]. A
prior analysis of the traceability information submitted by
various organizations to the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) as part of the medical device approval process,
showed a signicant traceability gap between the traceability
expectations as laid out in the FDA's\Guidance for the Con-
tent of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in
Medical Devices" [21], and the traceability data documented
in the submissions [39]. While all of the submissions made
some attempt to satisfy the FDA's traceability guidelines,
serious deciencies were found in almost all the submissions
in terms of missing traceability paths, missing and redun-
dant links, and problems in trace granularity which made
it very dicult to understand the rationale for individual
links. These observations draw attention to the traceability
gapwhich exists between the traceability specied and re-
quired in guidelines and the actual trace links established inPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or

software projects. Trace deciencies make it dicult for the
manufacturers to ensure that the system they are building
is safe for use and for certiers to understand whether they
should approve it for use in the public domain.
Furthermore, the emerging trend towards the adoption of
agile methods in regulated domains introduces the need for
more continual evaluation. In fact, the European Open-DO
initiative [42], actively seeks to address the Big Freeze prob-
lem in which the signicant cost and eort of the certica-
tion process makes it dicult to introduce change once the
product is certied. The initiative is developing techniques
for integrating agility into the safety-critical software de-
velopment process. Although many people do not consider
agile techniques suitable for use in safety-critical domains,
the verication-driven life-cycle based on a rigorous test-
rst environment with continuous integration of changes has
been used eectively in a number of safety-critical projects
[36, 32]. The Open-DO initiative has a specic goal to de-
velop techniques and tools that will allow all software to be
constantly maintained in a `ready-to-certify' state. The big-
bang approach in which trace links are created after-the-fact
for certication purposes, obviously does not support this
notion of constant certiability. As traceability is a critical
element of the certication process, our approach provides
techniques and tools for constantly evaluating, and report-
ing on, the trace coverage of a project.
1.2 Gap Analysis
In this paper we provide formalisms, metrics, and tool
support for evaluating traceability coverage with respect to
the guidelines that are relevant for a specic project. Within
the context of this paper, we dene a technical guideline as a
document describing a common position of industry and cer-
tication bodies on how to develop safety-critical software
within a certain domain. Guidelines generally help to coor-
dinate technical viewpoints of regulators and safety experts
in their licensing practices. They serve as a reference for
constructing a safety case and for demonstrating the safety
of software based systems. Furthermore, they support man-
ufacturers in developing products for international markets.
In contrast regulations are rules of order having the force of
law prescribed by a superior or competent authority. While
a regulation only lists obligations that have to be fullled in
order to be compliant with law, a guideline suggests mea-
sures that should be taken in order to provide evidence that
a software complies with regulations.Performing a traceability gap analysis is similar to the
notion of using test coverage tools to measure the extent
to which unit test cases cover lines of code, decisions and
branches, methods, and classes [57]. While test coverage
tools are designed to evaluate the rigor of the testing process
and to predict the readiness of the software for release, our
trace coverage tool assesses the extent to which the created
trace links adhere to the guidelines for the project. Later
in this paper, we introduce a set of ten trace coverage met-
rics that measure traceability coverage at the guideline, the
project, and the artifact level.
1.3 Our Approach
Our approach can be applied during the process of prepar-
ing the system for initial certication or continuously through-
out the software development life-cycle in order to achieve
continuous certication [42]. It involves three primary steps.
First, those parts of a guideline that are relevant to the
traceability of a complying development project are trans-
lated into a formal representation. This is a manual step
that produces a formal model of a guideline, which can be
reused across any impacted project. Second, project data is
automatically parsed and relevant information, such as arti-
fact identiers, artifact types, and trace links, are captured
in a formal representation. Finally, formally specied rules
are used to analyze the data for traceability problems within
an individual guideline, between guidelines, and between a
relevant guideline and project data. The concepts of our
approach as well as its major steps are illustrated in Fig-
ure 1. The guideline-level and project-level models serve as
meta-models for representing traceability within individual
guidelines and projects.
The remainder of the paper is laid out as follows. Section 2
describes ve major usage scenarios of our work. Section 3
describes the proposed approach for modeling and assessing
guidelines. Section 4 describes the preparation and assess-
ment of project data as well as the problem types that can
be identied in that data. Section 5 evaluates the dier-
ent usage scenarios against industrial guidelines and relevant
safety-critical software projects. In sections 6 and 7 we dis-
cuss the results and address threats to the validity of those
results. Section 8 reviews related work in the area of re-
quirements traceability and, more specically, in measuring
conformance between guidelines and project eorts. Finally,
Section 9 concludes by proposing future research directions.9442. USAGE SCENARIOS
In this section, we discuss ve major usage scenarios for
our approach and outline their associated challenges.
Scenario 1: Project's Conformance to Guideline. For
new projects, we provide traceability models that conform to
the relevant guideline(s). These traceability models serves as
a strategic plan for instrumenting the project environment
and dening the processes needed to create, maintain, and
use trace links as prescribed by the guideline. Furthermore,
our process constantly evaluates the project for conformance
to the traceability model.
Scenario 2: Continuous Certication. Consistently
maintaining a project in a ready-to-certify state is challeng-
ing, but certainly not impossible [20]. It requires a rig-
orous verication process built into the development envi-
ronment, continuous integration [18], and accurately main-
tained traceability, available at any time to support the cer-
tication process. Our approach supports ongoing analysis
of the traceability coverage of a system with respect to the
project's relevant guidelines.
Scenario 3: Integration of External Components.
Safety-critical systems often integrate subsystems developed
by dierent groups and subcontractors. Each of these sub-
systems carries its own traceability information. However, at
integration time, traceability must be demonstrated across
subsystems. The traceability model extracted from the guide-
lines helps to highlight the required integration-level trace
coverage, and to evaluate its actual coverage in the inte-
grated project. For example, it could take a high-level re-
quirement which is realized across multiple subsystems, and
measure and display its overall traceability coverage.
Scenario 4: Migration to a New or Revised Guide-
line. When an existing product is introduced into a new
market it may be necessary to certify the product under a
new guideline. Similarly, existing guidelines may be revised
(e.g. DO-178B!DO-178C) and the new version becomes
immediately relevant for product development. In such sce-
narios the existing traceability model is updated to reect
the new and/or modied guidelines, and a gap analysis per-
formed between the updated and original traceability model.
Our approach provides support for identifying trace decien-
cies introduced by the adoption of a new or revised guideline.
Scenario 5: Multiple Guideline Conformance. Prod-
ucts are often released into multiple markets governed by
dierent guidelines. Similarly, a single product may con-
tain components governed by dierent guidelines. In both
cases, the product needs to comply to multiple guidelines.
This introduces the need for creating a merged traceability
model for two or more guidelines. To nd the high water-
mark , i.e., the minimum set of traceability requirements that
if followed will satisfy all relevant guidelines, traceability re-
quirements need to be merged and contradictions need to be
addressed [23]. Our systematic process provides a single set
of traceability requirements, which can be used for planning
purposes and for evaluating trace coverage.
These ve scenarios provide the context for work described
in the remainder of this paper.
3. GUIDELINE ANALYSIS
In this study, we analyzed ve representative technical
guidelines (DO-178B [50], ISO 26262-6 [31], ECSS-E-40 [19],FDA [21]), with application to four industrial domains: Avi-
ation, Space, Automotive, and Medical. These guidelines
were selected based on a literature review and are discussed
in more detail in Section 5.1. The rst step of the pro-
posed approach involves manually creating a model of the
traceability concepts prescribed by a guideline. All stud-
ied guidelines follow a similar structure which starts with a
description of the development life-cycle. This life-cycle con-
sists of multiple processes, each composed of activities, their
prerequisites, and the artifacts they are required to produce.
Additionally, a guideline denes objectives to be fullled for
demonstrating safety. One of the most important objectives
is software traceability. In this section, we use the DO-178B
guideline to illustrate our approach. Guidelines were mod-
eled manually by one author of this paper. The process in-
volved reading the guidelines, identifying artifacts and their
required traceability links, and then specifying them for-
mally using F-Logic.
3.1 F-logic
For the formalization, representation, and assessment of
the traceability concepts found in the guidelines and the
projects' artifact and traceability structure we used the F-
logic (frame logic) language. We chose F-logic because it
is a knowledge representation and ontology language, which
combines the advantages of conceptual modeling with object-
oriented, frame-based languages and oers a declarative and
compact syntax [34]. Features include object identity, com-
plex objects, inheritance, polymorphism, query methods,
and encapsulation. F-logic allowed us to dene the required
complex data schema, to reason about dierences between
two schemas, to reason about dierences between a schema
and instances, and to infer implicit knowledge from a schema.
As elaborated by Kifer et al. [35], the F-logic language
consists of the sets C(object constructors ) andV(vari-
ables ), logical connectives and quantiers ( _;^;:; ;8;9),
and auxiliary symbols ([ ;];(;);f;g;);) ) ;!;! ! ;! ;! ! ;:
;::;:=:, etc.).
Classes are dened as a group of objects or as a subclass
of another class. For example:
Requirement :: Artifact :
R23 :Requirement :
R23 :=: R25 :(1)
expresses that Requirement is asubclass ofArtifact , that
R23 is-a or an instance-of Requirement , and that R23is
equivalent toR25.
Signature atoms specify constraints on classes. For exam-
ple:
TraceLink [source)Artifact ]:
Activity [output) )ArtifactType ]:(2)
expresses that the method expressions source and output ,
when applied to objects that belong to class TraceLink and
Activity respectively, must yield an object belonging to
class Artifact orArtifactType . The rst signature ex-
pression is a scalar signature ()), the second signature ex-
pression is a set-valued signature () )).
Data atoms apply value-returning methods to objects.

expresses that the methods source and output are applied
to the objects TL1and ACT1 respectively. Method source
returns the object ART1 and method output returns the set
of objectsfAT1 ;AT2g. As with comparable logic-based lan-
guages, implication rules can be specied in the form of head
 body, where head is a single molecule and body can be a
conjunction of molecules ornegated molecules . Thereby, a
molecule is the simplest kind of formula constructed from
the F-logic alphabet introduced above. The following exam-
ple species an implication rule:
?X:Activity (allArtifactTypes ! !?Y) 
?X(input! !?I;output! !?O)^?I:?Y^?O:?Y:(4)
This rule states that the method allArtifactTypes returns
for any object of class Activity a unied set of all input
and output artifact types. The example also illustrates the
syntax of variables (? X;?Y;?I;?O), named with a question
mark and followed by letters, digits, or underscores.
3.2 Modeling the Guidelines
Formalizing a guideline involves modeling its required ar-
tifact types, activities, and traceability paths.
3.2.1 Step 1: Model Artifact Types
All investigated guidelines dene types of artifacts, which
are required to be created during software development.
Guidelines also dene which artifact type should include
what information. Based on this information, types of ar-
tifacts that are required by a guideline can be derived (see
Figure 1: ArtifactType ).
Example: The DO-178B guideline [50] lists all required
artifact types in a dedicated section. One required artifact
type is software requirements data. The guideline states that
\Software Requirements Data is a denition of the high-level
requirements including the derived requirements. This data
should include functional and operational requirements un-
der each mode of operation, performance criteria ..." . The
following molecule denes class SWReqData (Software Re-
quirements Data) as a subclass ofArtifactType , which rep-
resents all artifact types.
SWReqData ::ArtifactType : (5)Additionally, the following signature atom asserts that class
SWReqData consists of two multi-valued methods: funcReq
(functional requirements) and opReq (operational require-
ments). Both methods correspond to the result type SWReq
(software requirement) and are parameterized by modeOfOp ,
the related software requirement's mode of operation.
SWReqData [funcReq @(modeOfOp )) )SWReq ;
opReq @(modeOfOp )) )SWReq ]:(6)
Class SWReq consists of a single value method, which denes
whether or not the software requirement is derived:
SWReq [derived)boolean ]: (7)
3.2.2 Step 2: Model Activities
Guidelines also dene the activities of the prescribed soft-
ware life-cycle (Figure 1: Activity ). Each activity is charac-
terized by the set of artifact types that it creates (Figure 1:
 Output ). Additionally, an activity may use one or more
previously created artifact types (Figure 1:  Input ).
Example: The DO-178B guideline [50] prescribes require-
ments specication as follows: \ Inputs to the software re-
quirements process include the system requirements, the hard-
ware interface and system architecture (if not included in
the requirements) from the system life-cycle process, and the
Software Development Plan, and the Software Requirements
Standards from the software planning process. When the
planned transition criteria have been satised, these inputs
are used to develop the software high-level requirements. "
The following molecule asserts that class SpecifySWReq is
asubclass ofActivity .
SpecifySWReq ::Activity : (8)
The following data molecule asserts that SpecifySWReq de-
pends on the input artifact objects SyRD (system require-
ment data), SyA(system architecture), SwDP (software devel-
opment plan), SwRS (software requirements standards) and
produces the output SWReqData .
SpecifySWReq [infSyRD ;SyA ;SwDP ;SwRSg;
outfSWReqDatag]:(9)9463.2.3 Step 3: Model Traceability Paths
A guideline also prescribes the traceability to be pro-
vided between artifact types (Figure 1: Traceability ). Pre-
scribed traceability is always related to an artifact type as
origin (Figure 1:  Origin ) and an artifact type as destina-
tion (Figure 1: Destination ).
Example: \Traceability between source code and low-level
requirements should be provided to enable verication of the
absence of undocumented source code and verication of the
complete implementation of the low-level requirements. " The
following data atom asserts that RT1is an element of the
class RequiredTrace (required traceability), which requires
traceability between SWDesignSpec (software design speci-
cation) and SourceCode (source code).
RT1:RequiredTrace [origin!SWDesignSpec ;
destination!SourceCode ]:(10)
3.3 Assessing Guideline Consistency
As illustrated in Figure 2 (problems #1, #2, and #3), we
identied three types of problems that can occur in technical
guideline models. We describe each problem and then dis-
cuss how it can be identied automatically from the formal
model. For this purpose we provide formalized assessment
rules per problem type.
Guideline Problem #1: Missing artifact creation ac-
tivity. Every artifact type that is dened by a guideline
should be created by a software process activity. Otherwise,
artifacts of this artifact type cannot be traced to the activ-
ity that produced the artifact type nor to the artifact types
that were used as input.
Implication: When conducting our case studies, we iden-
tied three potential reasons for the occurrence of this prob-
lem: (i) The denition of software process activities within
the guideline is inconsistent; however we consider this un-
likely given that technical guidelines are written and revised
carefully by a group of subject matter experts. (ii) Activi-
ties or artifact types of the software life-cycle prescribed by
a guideline have not been modeled correctly, leading to in-
consistencies in the guideline model that are detected by our
problem checking rules. (iii) A guideline is written within
a larger context and refers to artifact types that were cre-
ated in a process that is out of the guideline's scope. For
instance, the guideline ISO 26262 [31] consists of ten parts,
while only part six is related to software development. Fur-
thermore, part six requires traceability to a system require-
ment artifact without dening system requirement creation
activities.
Guideline Problem #2: Missing trace path. When
a guideline requires traceability between two artifact types,
it implicitly requires the existence of a direct or transitive
trace path between both artifact types. This means that
if no trace path exists between these two artifact types, it
is clear at the denition level that the required traceability
between the two artifacts cannot be satised.
Implication: As with to problem #1, this problem can
be caused by an inconsistent guideline, an incorrect model
creation, or an unresolved reference to a related guideline.
Guideline Problem #3: Ambiguous trace path. If
a guideline requires traceability between two artifacts, the
existence of a trace path between the artifact types is neces-sary (see problem #2). If multiple trace paths between two
artifacts are identied, these paths are ambiguous.
Implication: Analogous to problems #1 and #2, the ex-
istence of this problem indicates an inconsistent guideline
model caused by one of the three reasons described in the
implications of problem #1. The main intention for creat-
ing the assessment rules for the problems #1 to #3 was to
automatically evaluate the consistency of the derived guide-
line model and to thereby assure the quality of the model
preparation as described in Section 3.
3.4 Assessing Merged Guidelines
We identied two problem types, which may be caused
when two or more guidelines are relevant for a given product
and must therefore be merged together. Figure 2 illustrates
the two problems (#4 and #5) types.
Guideline Problem #4: Contradicting artifact cre-
ation after merge. Every single guideline denes software
process activities and artifact types, which are produced by
activities. However, if two guidelines dene dierent ac-
tivities for creating the same artifact type, these activities
contradict each other.
Implication: The existence of this problem type indicates
that two or more guidelines cannot be unied into a single
model which respects all of the stated guidelines. If a soft-
ware products needs to comply to both guidelines, measures
must be taken to explicitly distinguish contradicting artifact
type creation activities. Otherwise, the origin of a created
artifact cannot be determined unambiguously.
Guideline Problem #5: Ambiguous trace path after
merge. Every single guideline denes required traceability.
Additionally, trace paths can be derived from the dened
software process activities. If two guidelines require trace-
ability between the same pair of artifact types but prescribe
dierent trace paths, the merging of these guidelines intro-
duces ambiguous trace paths to the merged model.
Implication: As with the previous problem type, the ana-
lyzed guidelines cannot be unied into one model respecting
all requirements.
4. PROJECT COMPLIANCE
The primary purpose of our work is to analyze compliance
of an individual project's traceability to its relevant set of
guidelines. Therefore, we also need to formally model the
traceability artifacts found in an individual project and to
compare these to the formal model of the guidelines. We
rst describe our process for constructing the project level
Traceability Model.
4.1 Constructing a Project Level Model
The constructed model consists of traceability artifacts,
traceability paths, and traceability links.
4.1.1 Step 1: Parse Project Artifacts and Trace Links
The rst step towards a project level traceability model is
to collect all artifacts and trace links from within the soft-
ware project. Typical representations of artifacts are text
documents, hypertext, application database records, source
code, and diagrams. Trace links typically appear in the form
of trace link matrices, hyper links, text references to artifact
identiers, database records, and through the re-use of ar-
tifact names. Once, all project artifacts and trace links are947Table 1: Problem types and assessment rules to detect them

identied, the raw artifact and trace data needs to be parsed
and transformed into our standardized format for further
processing steps. As described in Section 5.3 we developed
a number of automated parsers to perform this task.
4.1.2 Step 2: Extract Artifacts and Trace Types
Once all data related to artifacts and trace links has been
preprocessed, artifact and trace link types can be assigned
to the data records. By aggregating artifacts and trace links
by type, a project traceability model can be derived.
4.1.3 Step 3: Map Guideline and Project Model
The project traceability model, created in the previous
step, contains information about a project's artifact types,
trace link types, and trace paths at the same abstraction
level as the guideline traceability model (see Section 3).
To assess whether or not a project fullls the traceability
requirements dened by a guideline, artifact types of the
project traceability model need to be mapped to the corre-
sponding artifact types of the guideline traceability model.
4.2 Assessing Project Data vs. Guideline
By comparing the modeled project data against a guide-
line model the following problem types can be identied.
Compliance Problem #6: Missing artifact type. The
artifact types required by a guideline must be available within
a project in order for traceability to be established between
them. To check this necessary precondition, the complete-ness of artifact types at the project level is assessed.
Compliance Problem #7: Missing trace path. In ad-
ditional to problem #6, traceability required by a guideline
between artifact types can only be established at the project
level if a trace path between the two artifact types is avail-
able at the project level.
Compliance Problem #8: Invalid trace path. A trace
path required by a guideline must not merely exist at the
project level, but its route must also conform to the pre-
scription of the guideline. To assess this problem, the arti-
fact route of a trace path at project level can be compared
with the artifact route of a trace path at the guideline level.
Compliance Problem #9: Ambiguous trace path.
Traceability is ambiguous if multiple trace paths between
two artifact types can be identied (compare problem #3).
Compliance Problem #10: Missing trace link. In
addition to problem #7, traceability between artifact types
that is required by a guideline can only be considered com-
plete if at the project level every single artifact of the re-
quested source artifact type is traced directly via a trace
link or transitively via a trace path to an artifact of the re-
quested target artifact type. We consider every required but
non-existing direct or transitive trace link a missing trace.
5. CASE STUDIES
In order to evaluate our approach we conducted several
case studies that refer back to the usage scenarios described948in Section 2. We consider the support of Scenario 1 (Sup-
port for Project Planning) as a by-product of our approach.
Once, the traceability requirements of a guideline have been
successfully modeled (see Section 3.3) our prototype is able
to generate a traceability model that conforms to selected
guidelines. This model can be used by stakeholders as they
establish a traceability plan for their project. Supporting
Scenario 2 (Constant Certiability) and Scenario 3 (Inte-
gration of External Components) require a similar assess-
ment procedure, which compares a project's artifacts and
trace links against applicable guidelines. In order to demon-
strate the capabilities of our approach in supporting those
usage scenarios, we assessed seven safety-critical software
projects against their respective technical guidelines. Sup-
porting Scenario 4 (Migration to New or Revised Guideline)
and Scenario 5 (Multiple Guideline Conformance) also re-
quire a similar assessment procedure, which compares two
guideline models with each other. We conducted a second
analysis in which we performed ve comparisons among the
ve technical guidelines relevant for the assessed projects in
the previous case study. The ve guidelines and seven safety-
critical projects for those studies are briey introduced in the
following subsections.
5.1 Technical Guidelines
Throughout the case studies, we use ve technical guide-
lines applicable for the development of safety-critical soft-
ware in dierent domains. Table 2 shows these guidelines
and each of their application domains. It also provides a
quantitative overview in terms of relevant concepts for our
approach. The number of required artifact types provides an
impression of the complexity of the described development
process per guideline, while the number of trace paths refers
to requested traceable connections between a pair of artifact
types, which may be connected through a single trace link
or a chain of trace links. All ve guidelines were modeled
according to the process described in Section 3. Each model
was assessed for problems #1 to #3 to ensure its correctness
and consistency. Once all problems were resolved, all mod-
els were reviewed by a colleague with extensive experience
in safety-critical development (not an author of this paper)
for their accordance to the modeled guideline.
5.2 Assessed Projects

5.3 Prototype
We created a prototypical implementation that leverages
the F-logic open source development environment Flora-2
[54]. We created traceability models for the ve technical
guidelines as well as inference rules to automatically as-949sess the captured data for the previously described problem
types. Additionally, we developed crawlers to parse rele-
vant project data (artifacts and trace links) from the seven
studied software projects. Our prototype derives the project
traceability model from the parsed data and transforms all
information into Flora-2 expressions. By applying the devel-
oped reasoning rules per problem type (see Table 1) to the
captured project and guideline related facts we were able to
assess both the guidelines and compliance of each project
against its relevant guidelines. Results from this evaluation
are presented in the following subsections.
5.4 Project Assessment Results
Table 3 shows aggregated results of the projects versus
guideline assessment. The rst and second column refer to
the project and the guideline that were compared. Columns
three to seven refer to the ve problem types that are rel-
evant for this assessment. The rst number within a cell
shows the percentage of a problem's occurrence in relation
to the total occurrence of the assessed concept within the
project, while the number in brackets shows the problem
occurrence count. Cells with a dash refer to problems that
could not be assessed because preconditions in terms of ar-
tifacts or trace links were not available for the particular
project. In Figure 3, we visualize the assessment results of
project TC-SAM vs. guideline DO-178B.

6. DISCUSSION
All studied cases were safety-critical software projects that
are required to conform with one of the technical guidelines.
The fact that our project assessment results (see Table 4)
show that none of the projects provided sucient traceabil-
ity to conform with its relevant guideline(s) means that none
of them can be considered as ready for certication.
6.1 Project Assessment
Before we start to discuss the results of every problem
in detail, it should be noted that several problem types are
interdependent. The existence of problem #6 means that
not a single artifact of the missing artifact type exists at
project level. This implies that not a single required trace
link (problem #10) was established from or to an artifact
of that artifact type. The correct amount of missing trace
links can be calculated if the second artifact of the required
trace link exists within the project. However, if source and
target artifacts are both missing (problem #7), the actual
number of missing trace links cannot be determined, because
all required elements (source artifact, target artifact, trace)
of the trace link are missing completely. Due to this de-
pendency, problem #7 can be used as a leading indicator to
detect critical areas of the project with respect to traceabil-
ity. These problem interdependencies should be considered
when interpreting the assessment results of a single project.
Missing artifacts (problem #10) indicate that trace links
are incomplete at the project level and thus traceability anal-
ysis might lead to wrong assumptions and conclusions. To
solve that issue, projects suering from this problem need to
add missing trace links for achieving trace link completeness
at the project level with respect to the relevant guideline.
For example, the GeneAuto project with more than 50%
missing trace links, will require substantial eort to resolve
this problem. RAMI and CONNECT also suer from a high
amount of missing trace links.
The absence of required trace paths at the project level
(problem #7) indicates that required trace links between950Table 4: Comparison of guideline migrations in terms of required artifact types and trace paths

DO-178B FDA Guide 0 8 3 0 8 2
ECSS-E-40 FDA Guide 1 8 3 1 8 2
project artifacts of two types are missing. This means that
required trace links must be established to conform with
the guideline. As outlined in Table 4, no project has been
setup with the capability of providing all the required trace
paths. Most projects suer from a high percentage (more
than 70%) of missing trace paths at the project level.
The absence of required artifact types at the project level
(problem #6) indicates that even the preconditions for es-
tablishing traceability conforming with a guideline are not
fullled. Thus, artifacts of missing artifact types need to be
created to enable a project to conform with a guideline.
Divergence of trace paths at the guideline and project level
(problem #8) would indicate that even though traceability
required by a guideline is available at the project level, it
carries the wrong semantics and might not be usable to ad-
dress the traceability goals of the guideline assigned to a
specic trace path. The existence of ambiguous trace paths
(problem #9) indicates that project artifacts cannot unam-
biguously be traced to their origin. As with problem #8,
ambiguous trace paths at the project level carry wrong or
at least ambiguous semantics and might not be usable to
address related traceability goals. As a high percentage of
the required trace paths were missing or incomplete for the
evaluated projects, it is not surprising that problems #8 and
#9 were not identied in the examined projects.
6.2 Guideline Assessment
The guideline assessment results shown in Table 3 demon-
strate that dierences among technical guidelines are rela-
tively small in terms of required traceability. It becomes
apparent that the TC-QK guideline, an in-house guideline
for projects of the TOPCASED initiative, is a subset of ISO
26262-6, which is a subset of DO-178B. Similarly, DO-178B
is a subset of the FDA Guide as well as ECSS-E-40. This im-
plies that for a project, which complies to a complex guide-
line like the FDA Guide, no additional eort is required
to conform with ISO 26262-6 or DO-178B. The contrary is
true, if a project complies to a less restrictive guideline such
as ISO 26262-6 and then needs to conform with ECSS-E-
40, additional artifact types and trace paths will need to be
added to the project.
7. THREATS TO VALIDITY
When planning and conducting our case studies we care-
fully considered validity concerns. The fact that our cases
diverge across multiple guidelines and industrial projects of
various sizes and domains suggests that our approach is ap-
plicable across a wide variety of projects. However, we are
aware of the fact that a larger evaluation is required in order
to gain generalizable results.A potential threat exists due to the required studying and
understanding of a guideline and the creation of the respec-
tive model. The responsible person may misunderstand or
entirely miss requirements of a guideline. In order to miti-
gate that threat, we took three measures. First, we followed
the same procedure for all analyzed guidelines, searching
for the concepts: artifact type, activity, and required trace
paths in subsequent passes. Second, we identied poten-
tial consistency problems that can occur within a guideline
model and support their identication within our prototype.
Third, all guideline models used for our case study were re-
viewed by a colleague with extensive experience in the de-
velopment of safety-critical software.
Another potential threat exists in the preparation of the
analyzed project data. We examined carefully the structure
of each project and its available artifacts. However, the ar-
tifacts that we found were diverse and often spread across
multiple tools and repositories. In order to identify possible
problems, we performed where possible completeness and
consistency checks on the captured data. Nonetheless, there
remains a risk that we may have missed or misclassied cer-
tain artifacts or trace links. For ongoing work, we plan to
involve project stakeholders in order to get feedback on the
correctness and completeness of the captured data.
8. RELATED WORK
Several authors have conducted empirical research on re-
quirements traceability and argued the need for planned
traceability and dened traceability strategies. Gotel and
Finkelstein showed that understanding the stakeholders re-
sponsible for the creation and maintenance of trace links is
essential for improving the outcome of the tracing process
[25]. Ramesh [45] identied two groups of traceability users,
which he referred to as low-end and high-end users. While
low-ends users rely on simple dependencies among require-
ments, high-end users leverage more sophisticated traceabil-
ity schemes. Ramesh and Jarke [46] conducted a large prac-
titioner and tool study on traceability. They pointed out
that traceability links should be strongly typed in order to
avoid semantic misinterpretations. As a result, the authors
proposed a traceability meta-model and reference models as
guidance for practitioners. Gotel et al. described the trace-
ability life-cycle and highlighted the importance of planning
and managing traceability in addition to the daily activities
of creating, maintaining, and using trace links [24]. In prior
work we also advocated the use of a traceability informa-
tion model as a necessary condition to employ traceability
[37, 39]. Arkley and Riddle [2] conducted a case study on
a software project, which successfully leveraged traceability.
They concluded that the success of the observed traceability
system was mainly inuenced by two facts: (i) general trace-951ability needs were examined to support project participants
in their tasks, and (ii) the traceability information model
was systematically tailored to the identied needs.
Several researchers investigated aspects of traceability in
regulated industries. Mc Caery et al. comprehensively
discussed traceability requirements for medical device soft-
ware development [9]. Hill and Tilley developed a database
schema for tracing between a safety process improvement
model, safety requirements and taxonomies, and software
safety risks [29]. Peraldi-Frati and Albinet presented an
approach for tracing non-functional requirements such as
safety, timing, and performance across the life-cycle artifacts
of an automotive system design [44]. Katta and Stalhane de-
veloped a very detailed traceability model depicting numer-
ous artifact types and related links for safety-critical systems
such as nuclear power stations [33]. Similarly, Sanchez et al.
described a traceability meta-model and supporting tech-
niques for integrating tracing into the model driven devel-
opment of safety critical systems [52]. Borg et al. [4] investi-
gated the reusability of traceability in safety critical control
systems that had evolved over more than 30 years. However,
the focus of all these publications was on prescribing general
traceability techniques and practices as opposed to evaluat-
ing traceability compliance. One exception is our prior work
[39], in which we reported on traceability problems that were
observed by members of the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) responsible for evaluating traceability docu-
mentation as part of medical device approval. Several of the
metrics described in this paper emerged from that study.
This paper presents a technique for measuring confor-
mance of a project's traceability to relevant technical guide-
lines. To the best of our knowledge there have been no other
eorts to create traceability metrics for evaluating actual
traceability coverage. The closest work is that by Dinesh et
al., who used natural language processing (NLP) techniques
to extract formal process representations from regulatory
documents. They used these process representations to an-
alyze an organization's conformance to the regulation [17].
However, the authors focused on analyzing activities explic-
itly logged in a database. In contrast, our approach retrieves
and analyzes artifacts and their associated trace links from
project repositories, processes these to generate a structural
model of traceability in the project and then compares this
to the model prescribed in the guideline.
Researchers proposed solutions to formalize safety stan-
dards, regulations, and law for supporting compliance ver-
ication against those texts. De la Vara et al. [16] de-
veloped a generic meta-model for safety-standards, which is
larger and more generic than our guideline model as its scope
goes far beyond software traceability. Panesar-Walawege et
al. [43] proposed a UML prole for ensuring software de-
sign compliance to the IEC61508 standard. Similarly, Ne-
jati et al. dened a traceability information model, which
links safety related requirements with software design com-
ponents [41]. Maxwell and Ant on [40] formalized legal texts
of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
as production rule models to support regulatory compliance
analysis. Breaux et al. performed extensive research on for-
malizing legal text for supporting compliance verication of
software requirements with regulations in order to establish
traceability between requirements and regulations [6, 8, 7].
Furthermore, metrics have been proposed for a variety of
other software engineering activities. For example, Ambriolaand Gervasi developed a set of process metrics for evaluating
stability and eciency of the requirements analysis process
[1]. Their metrics were designed to identify risky or inef-
cient behavior during the requirements analysis process,
so that managers could take corrective actions. Other re-
searchers and practitioners proposed and used test-coverage
metrics for measuring and evaluating the quality of the test-
ing process. These metrics are now used ubiquitously across
many software development environments.
Finally, researchers developed techniques for reverse en-
gineering software development processes through mining
project repositories. For example, Hindle extracted software
artifacts from software repositories and used these to infer
the underlying software development process [30]. Similarly,
Cook and Wolfe proposed a technique to instrument exist-
ing software systems to discover the software development
process [15]. We also mine software repositories to extract
traceability data. However, we use this data to infer specic
problems with the traceability process rather than attempt-
ing to completely reconstruct the development process.
9. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have focused primarily on the gap be-
tween the traceability that is prescribed by technical guide-
lines and the traceability that is implemented in practice.
This gap makes it dicult for organizations and certiers to
fully evaluate the safety of developed software systems. We
presented an approach, which uses a manually created model
of a guideline's required traceability and related concepts to
analyze project data and to identify areas of traceability fail-
ure. Furthermore, we dened ten types of traceability prob-
lems that may occur when a project aims to conform to one
or more guidelines. Those problem types cover, for example,
missing traceability paths as well as redundant and/or in-
consistent data. Our approach facilitates the identication
of those problems both during initial certication eorts and
then continuously throughout the project's life cycle. As a
byproduct we provide traceability models that conform to a
guideline and can be used for planning a project's traceabil-
ity. Furthermore, we support the comparison of guidelines
in order to assist the migration of a project from compliance
to an initial set of guidelines towards compliance to a revised
or expanded set of guidelines.
We used our approach to evaluate the traceability of seven
safety-critical software systems against a set of ve techni-
cal guidelines and found that none of the evaluated projects
was in full conformance to its relevant traceability guide-
lines. This suggests that these projects were not ready for
certication and emphasizes the importance of performing
a traceability analyses.
Future work will focus on the presentation of problems
and on generalizing the access to project data for easier and
continuous assessment. We will also extend our catalog of
traceability problem classes and detection metrics. Finally,
in addition to conformance of traceability data with tech-
nical guidelines, we are interested in extensions that unify
various qualities into a single model.
