ABSTRACT  
Regulatory standards, designed to protect the safety, security, and 
privacy of the public, govern numerous areas of software 
intensive systems.  Project personnel must therefore demonstrate 
that an as-built system meets all relevant regulatory codes.  
Current methods for demonstrating compliance rely either on 
after-the-fact audits, which can lead to significant refactoring 
when regulations are not met, or else require analysts to construct 
and use traceability matrices to demonstrate compliance.  Manual 
tracing can be prohibitively time- consuming; however automated 
trace retrieval methods are not very effective due to the 
vocabulary mismatch es that often occur between regulatory codes 
and product level requirements.  This paper introduces and 
evaluates two machine-learning methods, designed to improve the 
quality of traces generated between regulatory codes and product 
level requirements . The first approach uses manually created 
traceability matrices to train a trace classifier, while the second 
approach uses web-mining techniques to reconstruct the original 
trace query.  The techniques were evaluated against security 
regulations from the USA government‟s Health Insurance Privacy 
and Portability Act (HIPAA) traced against ten healthcare related 
requirements specifications.  Results demonstrated improvements 
for the subset of HIPAA regulations that exhibited high fan-out 
behavior across the requirements datasets.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Software systems designed to support safety, security, or 
financially critical applications must conform to an increasing 
number of regulatory codes.  For example, financial software 
systems in the USA must comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley act of 2002 (SOX), which establishes wide ranging standards for all 
U.S. public company boards, management, and public accounting 
firms.  Similarly, all healthcare related products in the USA must 
comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA) [1] which requires covered entities to use 
administrative and technical safeguards to protect patient medical 
information and governs privacy-related practices, including the 
use and disclosure of patient medical information for patient care 
and research.  Embedded software systems often have to satisfy a 
staggeringly large number of regulatory codes. For example, two 
authors of this paper were recently involved in the traceability of a 
large software intensive system that included over 30,000 
requirements and 300 different sets of relevant regulatory codes 
[4].  Traceability costs for this system alone were estimated by the 
industrial requirements specialist at over USD$3 Million! 
Current methods for demonstrating regulatory compliance rely on 
the standard software engineering practice of requirements 
traceability , which refers to the “ability to track a requirement 
from its origins back to its rationale and downstream to various 
work products that implement that requirement in software” [15].  
Full life-cycle compliance can be achieved by tracing regulatory 
codes to product level requirements and from there to design 
documents, code, and test cases.  For example, the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) states that traceability analysis must 
be used to verify that a software design implements all of its 
specified software requirements, that all aspects of the design are 
traceable to software requirements, and that all code is linked to 
established specifications and established test procedures.  
To trace regulatory codes, software developers are often forced to 
manually pore over documentation manuals to identify relevant 
sections, and then painstakingly trace them to the product level 
requirements or implemented code [4].   Traces are typically 
documented in a trace matrix.  Unfortunately, numerous case 
studies have shown that organizations struggle to implement 
successful and cost-effective traceability, primarily because 
creating, maintaining, and using traces is a time-consuming, 
costly, arduous, and error prone activity [7, 15, 16, 25]. 
These traceability problems have been partially addressed through 
automated tracing methods using the Vector Space Model, Latent 
Semantic Indexing, probabilistic networks [2, 7, 20 , 22] and other 
similar approaches, which  return a set of candidate links, in much 
the same way that Google returns results in response to a user‟s 
query for information.  Automated methods have generally been 
quite effective, returning a candidate set of traces that contain 85-
90% of the targeted links at precision rates of 10-50%.  
Unfortunately, these methods have limited success for tracing 
regulatory codes[4] due to the significant disparity in terminology 
that can exist between the codes and product level requirements.

In this paper we introduce and empirically evaluate two machine 
learning techniques designed to improve trace results from 
regulatory codes to product level requirements.  Both techniques 
resulted in improvements for the subset of HIPAA regulations that 
were hard to trace using traditional trace-retrieval methods . The 
first approach uses a manually created traceability matrix to train 
a classifier to trace regulatory codes, while the second approach 
utilizes a novel information retrieval method to mine terms and 
phrases from domain specific documents in order to replace or 
augment the original trace query.  Both techniques are illustrated 
and evaluated against the technical safeguards of the USA‟s 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 
1996.  This act defines administrative, physical, and technical 
safeguards designed to reduce the unauthorized use and disclosure 
of private healthcare related data [1].   The security safeguards, 
which include requirements for access control, audit controls, 
authentication, and transmission security, are depicted in Figure 1.    
The experiments described in this paper are based on the software 
requirements specifications (SRS) for ten patient healthcare 
products.  These SRS documents, which are summarized in Table 
1, were obtained from a variety of sources including open source 
products,  IT healthcare standards, requirements exemplars, and 
feature descriptions for commercial products.   In cases where 
requirements were extracted from product-level documentation or 
from online forums, care was taken to retain the original language 
and text, and to ensure that no additional terminology was added.   
Four members of the research team at DePaul University 
manually constructed and validated traceability links between the 
HIPAA regulations and requirements in the SRS documents.  For 
illustrative purposes, the traceability matrix for the Automatic 
Logout  (AL) regulation is depicted in Table 2. 
The next section of this paper describes a baseline experiment in 
which a standard trace retrieval method is used to generate traces 
between regulatory codes and the healthcare requirements.  Sections 3 and 4 then describe the two proposed machine learning 
techniques and evaluate their effectiveness in comparison to the 
baseline.  Sections 5 to 7 analyze these results, address the 
generality of the approach and discuss threats to validity.  Finally 
Section 7 discusses related work, and section 8 concludes with a 
discussion of future work. 
2.  BASIC TRACE RETRIEVAL  
As previously stated, there are many different approaches for 
automatically generating traces including the vector space model, 
probabilistic network (PN) models, and latent semantic indexing 
(LSI) [2, 7 , 19, 23], however various studies have shown only 
minor and inconsistent differences between results obtained from 
these methods.  The PN model is therefore used in our baseline 
experiment for pragmatic reasons as it was adopted in the tracing 
tool we developed for conducting industrial pilot studies [7].  
 
2.1  The probabilistic tracing model 
To prepare text for tracing, a pre-parsing phase is conducted to 
remove common words known as „stop‟ words, and to stem the 
remaining words to their root forms.   A similarity score is then 
computed based upon the frequency and distribution of terms in 
the regulations and requirements to be traced.   In the probabilistic 
network method, the basic probability of a link between a query 
artifact q and a traceable requirement rj is defined as follows:  
𝑝𝑟 𝑟𝑗 𝑞 =  𝑝𝑟 𝑟𝑗 𝑡𝑖 𝑝𝑟 𝑞,𝑡𝑖 𝑘
𝑖=1 
𝑝𝑟 𝑞    (1) 
The first two parts of the formula, pr(r j|ti) and pr(q,t i) represent 
the dispersion of the term ti within the requirement rj and query q 
(i.e. a regulatory code) respectively.  These are estimated by 
computing the normalized frequency of terms.  For example 
pr(r j|ti) is calculated by considering the frequency with which tj 
occurs in the requirement, normalized over the total number of 
words in the requirement.  This is represented as 𝑝𝑟 𝑟𝑗 𝑡𝑖 =
𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞 (𝑟𝑗,𝑡𝑖 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞 (𝑟𝑗,𝑡𝑘) 𝑘 . Similarly pr(q,t i) is calculated by   
Figure 1.  HIPAA regulations to be implemented in software .   
156considering the frequency at which term ti occurs in query q, 
normalized over the total number of potential queries in which ti 
occurs.     
In the third part of the formula , pr(q)  is computed as 𝑝𝑟 𝑞 =
 𝑝𝑟(𝑞,𝑡𝑖) 𝑖 , using simple marginalization techniques, and 
represents the relevance of the term ti to describe the query 
concept q.  The resulting probability is inversely proportional to 
the number of requirements containing the index term, reflecting 
the assumption that rarer index terms are more relevant than 
common ones in detecting potential links.  A more complete 
description of the probabilistic network model is provided in 
several related papers [9, 31].    
 
2.2  Trace retrieval metrics 
Experimental information retrieval results are typically evaluated 
using recall and precision metrics [26].  Recall measures the 
fraction of relevant links that are retrieved and is computed as: 
 
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 =  𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡  𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠   𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑑  𝐿𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠
𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡  𝐿𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠 
 while precision measures the fraction of retrieved links that are 
relevant [26] and is computed as: 
 
𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 =  𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡  𝐿𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠   𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑑  𝐿𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠
𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑑  𝐿𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠 
 
 
For experimental purposes, a threshold score is established such 
that all links above or at the threshold are retrieved and all links 
below the threshold are rejected.   
Because it is not feasible to achieve identical recall values across 
every trace query, it can be difficult to compare recall and 
precision results across experiments.  Another metric known as 
the F-Measure, which computes the harmonic mean of recall and 
precision is therefore often used for comparative purposes.  In this 
paper we adopt a variant of the F-measure, known as the F 2-
Measure, which weights recall values more highly than precision.  
This weighting is appropriate in the traceability domain where it 
is essential to recall as many of the correct links as possible.   The 
version of F 2 Measure used in this paper is computed as follows: 
𝐹2𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 =  3 ×𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛  ×𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
(2 ×𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 ) +𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙  Table 1.  Healthcare related datasets used in experiments .

157Recall, precision, and F-Measure metrics are unable to 
differentiate between results in which relevant links are closer to 
the top of the ranked listing of results, versus those in which 
relevant links are lower down in the list. We therefore introduce 
one additional metric, Average Precision, which favors results 
that return relevant links nearer to the top of the list.  An 
additional benefit of this metric is that it does not depend on an 
arbitrary threshold value.  Average precision is computed a s: 
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒  𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 =   (𝑃 𝑟 ×𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡  𝑟 )𝑁
𝑟=1
𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  𝑜𝑓 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡  𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 
where r is the rank, N is the number of retrieved documents, 
relevant() is a binary function assigned 1 if the rank is relevant 
and 0 otherwise, and P(r) is the precision computed after 
truncating the list immediately below that ranked position. These 
four metrics are used throughout the remainder of the paper to 
document and compare results from each of the experiments. 
2.3  Basic Automated Tracing Experiment  
In the first experiment, the probabilistic network model described 
in section 2.1 was used to generate traces from the ten targeted 
HIPAA regulations shown in Figure 1 to requirements in each of 
the 10 patient healthcare systems.   Trace queries were formulated 
directly from the text of each HIPAA security regulation. Recall, 
precision, and F 2-measure metrics were computed individually for 
each of the HIPAA regulations by establishing threshold values 
that optimized the F 2-measure. The decision to optimize recall and 
precision across each regulatory type was used consistently for all 
experiments reported in this paper.   Average precision, which is 
not dependent upon a threshold value was also computed.  The 
results are reported in Table 3. 
For four of the HIPAA regulations, namely storage encryption , 
emergency access procedures , transmission encryption , and 
transmission security  it was possible to recall all of the relevant 
requirements. For many of the HIPAA regulations, the precision 
values were unacceptably low, in some cases returning precision 
values close to 0.02, however; even for regulations with lower 
levels of precision, the trace performed the useful function of 
excluding a large number of unlikely links.  For example, the 
transmission encryption  regulation returned recall results of 1.000 
and precision of only 0.06, but successfully excluded 1,806 of the 
potential 1,889 links.  Average precision results were highest for 
automatic logoff , emergency access, and storage encryption , 
meaning that for these HIPAA regulations, the trace retrieval 
algorithm returned results that were generally closer to the top of 
the list than for the other regulations.   
Unfortunately, prior studies have demonstrated that users lose 
confidence in a traceability tool that returns imprecise results.  
Furthermore human error is introduced when human analysts are 
asked to evaluate a long list of candidate links [20 ].  The 
remainder of this paper therefore describes two techniques for 
improving the accuracy of traces for regulatory codes. 
 
3. MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH 
Machine learning methods are particularly appealing for tracing 
regulatory codes, because the upfront effort of training a classifier 
can be potentially recouped when those same codes are applied 
across future projects. Although there are many potential 
classification techniques , we adopted an algorithm that was 
previously developed for classifying non-functional requirements 
[10].  Prior studies demonstrated that this algorithm matched  or outperform ed standard classification techniques including the 
naïve bayes classifier, standard decision tree algorithm (J48), 
feature subset selection (FSS), correlation-based feature subset 
selection (CFS), and various combinations of the above  for the 
specific task of classifying NFRs in the studied datasets [ 21]. 
3.1 The Classification Process    
The trace classifica tion process  includes  the three primary  stages  
of preparation , training, and classifying.   
During the  preparatory stage , a training set of regulatory codes, 
product level requirements, and their associated traces is 
constructed . Each requirement is then pre -processed using the 
techniques described in section 2.1 . 
A probabilistic weight is assigned to each term found in the 
requirements with respect to each of the regulatory codes .  This 
weight reflects the degree to which a term represents a specific 
regulatory code .  For example, the term timeout  occurs frequently 
in requirements related to the HIPAA rule for automat ic logoff  
and occurs  much less frequently in other types of requirements.  It 
is therefore  assigned a relatively strong weighting with respect to 
automat ic logoff . In contrast, a term such as session , which  is 
found not only in automat ic logoff requirements  but also across a 
variety of other types of requirements, is assigned a much lower 
indicator weighting  with respect to the automat ic logoff  
regulation .  The formulas for weighting indicator terms are as 
follows.  
Let q be a specific regulation such as the HIPAA rule for 
automat ic logoff. Indicator terms of type q are mined by 
considering the set Sq of all requirements i n the training set  that 
are related to regulation q. The cardinality of Sq is defined as Nq. 
Each term t is assigned a weight score  Prq(t) that measures how 
well the term identifies  a requirement that matches  regulation  q. 
The weight score Prq(t) corresponds to the probability that a 
particular term t identifies a requirement  as being associated to 
regulation q based on the s tandard Information Retrieval 
assumption that terms indicating relevance for a certain targeted 
regulation  must be present in the document to be classified. The 
frequency freq( rq,,t) of occurrence of term t in requirement rq,  is 
computed for each requirement  in Sq. Prq(t) is then  computed as :  
𝑃𝑟𝑞 𝑡 = 1
𝑁𝑞 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞 (𝑟𝑞,𝑡)
|𝑟𝑞|𝑟𝑞∈𝑆𝑞∙𝑁𝑞(𝑡)
𝑁(𝑡)∙𝑁𝑃𝑞(𝑡)
𝑁𝑃𝑞         (2) 
The first factor 1
𝑁 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞 (𝑟𝑞,𝑡)
|𝑟𝑞|𝑟𝑞∈𝑆𝑞 represents the term 
frequency component that is standard in Information Retrieval 
[26] and shows that the weight score Prq(t) increases if term t 
occurs frequently in requirements related to regulation q. It is Table 3.  Results from basic trace retrieval

158computed as the average term frequency of term t in type q 
requirements rq rescaled by the documents size | rq|.  
The remaining component of the expression in (1) measures 
inverse document frequency and penalizes the weight score if the 
term occurs in requirements related to other regulations.  The 
second factor 𝑁𝑞(𝑡)𝑁(𝑡)    is the percentage of q type documents 
in Sq containing t with respect to all requirements in the training 
set containing t, whose number is denoted by N(t). This factor 
decreases if the indicator term t is used broadly throughout the 
requirements specification.  If the term is only used in q type 
requirements, it will evaluate to 1 for that type. The third factor 
𝑁𝑃𝑞(𝑡)𝑁𝑃𝑞  is the ratio between the number NP q(t) of projects 
containing type q documents with term t and the number  NP q of 
all projects in the training set with type q NFRs. The purpose of 
this rescaling factor with values ranging between zero and one is 
to decrease the weight Prq(t) for terms that are project specific. It 
is equal to one only if a term appears in all the projects containing 
type q documents.  
A probability score Prq(t) is computed for each term t with respect 
to q, and terms are then ranked by decreasing order according to 
Prq(t).  Results from prior experiments with the NFR detector 
[10], and a series of initial experiments with the HIPAA security 
regulations showed that selecting the top 10 terms for each of the 
q types returned optimal classification results in comparison to 
other selection methods.  This approach was therefore adopted for 
all of the reported experiments.    
To classify requirements, a score Prq(r) is computed that 
evaluates the probability that a certain requirement r is associated 
with the regulation q. This probability score depends on the 
lexical content of requirement r, and is based on the assumption 
that type q requirements are more likely to contain indicator terms 
for that type.  
Let Iq be the set of indicator terms for regulation q identified 
during the training phase following expression (2).  We assume 
that the weighted indicator terms in Iq are identified and their 
weights computed from a training set that contains correctly pre-
categorized requirements. The indicator terms are mined using the 
expression in (2). The classification score that a requirement r 
belongs to regulation q is then defined as follows: 
𝑃𝑟𝑞 𝑟 = 𝑃𝑟𝑞(𝑡) 𝑡∈𝑟∩𝐼𝑞
 𝑃𝑟𝑞(𝑡) 𝑡∈𝐼𝑞          (3) 
where the numerator is computed as the sum of the term weights 
of all type q indicator terms that are contained in r, and the 
denominator is the sum of the term weights for all type q indicator 
terms. The probabilistic classifier for a given type q will assign 
higher score Prq(r) to a requirement r that contains several strong 
indicator terms for q.  
 
3.2  Experimental Evaluation  
To evaluate the effectiveness of the regulatory classifier, a leave-
one-out cross validation experimental design was used for tracing 
HIPAA security rules against the patient healthcare systems. The 
manually created trace matrices were used as both the training and 
testing sets for this experiment. During each iteration of the 
experiment, nine datasets were used to train the classifier, while 
the remaining dataset was used for testing purposes.  As a result, 
following ten iterations of the experiment each dataset was tested 
one time.   In each iteration , indicator terms were extracted from 
the requirements in the training set, and were weighted using formula (2). The top ten scoring indicator terms for each 
regulatory code were selected and used to classify requirements in 
the test set using formul a (3).  A multiple classification scheme 
was used so that for any targeted HIPAA regulation, all 
requirements that scored higher than a certain threshold value 
were classified as retrieved for that regulation.  This meant that a 
single requirement could be assigned to more than one HIPAA 
regulation. As with the previous experiment, threshold values 
were set individually for each query so as to maximize F 2-
measure values. 
3.3  Results 
The results are reported in the confusion matrix of Table 4, which 
provides a useful visual means for analyzing classification results 
[14], and has the ability to depict true and false positives as well 
as true and false negatives.  The true positives, are depicted on the 
diagonal, and have been highlighted in the diagram.  The matrix 
shows, for example, that 48 of the 54 access control requirements 
were correctly classified, but that 5 of them were incorrectly 
classified as audit control , and 1 as emergency access protocol 
etc.  As with the previous experiment, the F 2 measure and average 
precision are also reported.   
Figure 2 depicts the average precision scores obtained using both 
the basic trace retrieval method and the machine learning method.  
Four of the regulatory codes showed very marked improvements 
in average precision when using the machine learning technique.  
For example the average precision for access control  traces 
increased from 0.176 to  0.370 , and for audit control  from 0.144 
to 0.647.  Major improvements were also observed in 
transmission encryption and decryption  and persona l 
authentication .  An examination of the requirements associated 
with each of these successful cases indicated that they had 
relatively strong themes that wove across the ten datasets, making 
the training process relatively straightforward.   Furthermore, three 
of these cases had significantly larger than average training sets.  
access control  had a total of 54 requirements across the 10 
datasets, audit control  had 86, and personal authentication  had 
42.  The only HIPAA goal with a small training set which 
performed well under the machine learning approach was 
transmission encryption and decryption  with a training set of only 
5 requirements.  
For the  remaining HIPAA regulations , the machine learning 
technique did not improve average precision results in compa rison 
to the basic trace retrieval results .  However, in addition to having  
smaller training sets , five of the se regulations, namely  automatic 
logoff , emergency access protocols , transmission security , storage 
encryption and decryption , and unique user ID, had already all 
returned relatively strong  average precision values for the basic 
traceability approach ranging from 0.264 to 0.933.   These 
observations  are discussed further in Section 5 of this paper. For 
the final regulatory code of integrity , neither the basic trace 
method nor the machine learning method were very effective.  An 
analysis of the HIPAA integrity regulation suggests that the code 
itself is rather broadly -defined stating only that the product should 
“Implement polic ies and procedures to protect electronic health 
information from improper alteration or destruction. ”  A total of  
17 requirements from the ten datasets were traced to this integrity 
code; however an analysis of these requirements showed that they 
covered a  relatively broad gamut of topics such as a very high 
level requirement that “ the system must warn t he user if format, 
consistency,  or validity are in doubt ” and another one that stated 
159that “ the system shall… retain all original documentation. ”  The 
bread th of integrity requirements suggested that the HIPAA 
regulation itself was perhaps at too high a level to be concretely 
traced to requirements.    
In summary, the machine learning approach did not improve 
traceability for the five HIPAA goals that performe d best under 
the basic traceability approach; however it did significantly 
improve results for four of the five HIPAA goals that had not 
previously performed well.  The machine learning approach might 
therefore be used to improve traceability of regulatory  codes that 
do not tend to trace easily into requirements documents.  
However this approach is only feasible when a training set is 
available. For purposes of these experiments, we spent 
approximately 125  person hours developing the training set for 
the HIPAA regulations, even though it involved only 11 
individual requirements.  The vast majority of this time was spent 
finding and processing the requirements for 10 healthcare related 
products, and constructing the associated trace matrices.  This 
effort could be minimized if the training set were built as a natural 
by-product of developing and tracing software systems in 
compliance to a given set of regulatory codes.  It could also be 
distributed across multiple organizations if a specific user 
community worked collaboratively to build the training set.  
Furthermore, one could envision regulatory bodies publishing 
regulations, augmented with terms to support automated trace 
retrieval processes.  Unfortunately without this type of support , 
the sheer number and breadth of regulatory codes suggests that it 
will not always be possible or cost-effective to construct training 
sets using the manual techniques described in this paper.   The 
following section of this paper therefore proposes a novel and alternate approach for automatically discovering indicator terms 
through mining domain-specific documents. 
4. WEB MINING  APPROACH  
The proposed approach is  based on the idea that when a training 
set is not available, a relevant set of indicator terms can be learned 
from domain specific documents mined from the Internet . As the 
experiments  reported in this section will demonstrate, this 
approach generally improved traces for the same set of HIPAA 
regulations that were improved by the machine learning approach.  
The benefit of the web -mining approach is that it bypasses the 
time-consuming step of manually constructing a training set.  The 
approach involves three steps.  First a set of relevant domain 
specific documents are identified.  Second, the documents are 
analyzed to ext ract a set of domain specific terms.  Finally these 
terms are composed into a new query which is used to execute the 
trace.  These steps are  now described in more detail.  
4.1 Retrieving domain specific documents   
Domain specific documents are identified for each regulatory 
code through extracting one or more representative terms or 
phrases and using them to issue a web-based search query.  For 
the HIPAA regulations, the initial query was formulated using the 
title provided for each regulation.   In cases for which the search 
results were deemed unsatisfactory, the user manually refined the 
query by adding or removing additional terms and phrases . 
Following an initial series of experiments, we established the rule 
of only rejecting a retrieved document if it contained small 
amounts of text i.e. less than 200 words in a single block, because 
short websites were found to frequently represent product 
advertisements containing potentially limited and biased 
terminology.  Websites that were judged by the researcher to be Table 4: Confusion  matrix showing results from basic machine learning trace method .

160entirely non-relevant were also rejected. In the future, the process 
of document selection will be automated and standard 
disambiguation techniques will be used to help reject non-relevant 
documents.   
4.2 Term Mining   
The retrieved documents were processed using an algorithm for 
extracting domain concepts from natural text [30] . Q-TAG, a part-
of-Speech tagger , was used to parse the documents and identify 
single nouns and two-term noun phrases.  The following metrics 
were then computed for each of these terms and term-phrases:  
 
Domain term frequency (DTF) computes  term frequency 
information for term t across multiple documents as follows:  
𝐷𝑇𝐹 𝑡 =  𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞 (𝑡,𝐷)
𝑡∈𝐷|𝐷|   
where  𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞(𝑡,𝐷) 𝑡∈𝐷  is the total number of occurrences of term 
t across the  domain -specific document collection D, and |D| is the 
total number of documents.  
 
 
Domain specificity  (DS)  measures the extent to which a term or 
term phrase is specific to the domain doc ument, as opposed to 
occurring frequently across a broad spectrum of topics.  For our 
experiments, domain specificity DS(t)  of term t, was estimated by 
comparing the relative frequency of the term within a domain -
specific document, versus its relative freq uency in a general 
corpus of documents [3].  It is calculated as follows:  
𝐷𝑆 𝑡 =𝑙𝑛 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞 (𝑡,𝐷)
 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞 (𝑡,𝐷) 𝑡∈𝐷𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞 (𝑡,𝐺)
 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞 (𝑡,𝐺) 𝑡∈𝐺   
where the first component 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞 (𝑡,𝐷) 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞 (𝑡,𝐷) 𝑡∈𝐷  is the 
normalized number of occurrences of term t in the domain -
specific document co llection D, and the second component is the 
normalized number of occurrences of t in the general corpus of 
documents.   
 
Concept generality  (CG) computes  the fraction of  domain specific 
documents in which a specific term occurs. Concept generality 
differentiates  between terms that occur in multiple domain 
specific documents versus those that occur in only a few. The 
concept generality of term t, CG(t ), is computed as the number of 
documents containing term t, |Dt| over the total number of 
documents: 𝐶𝐺 𝑡 = |𝐷𝑡||𝐷|  
 
Following a  series of informal exploratory experiments the 
following heuristics were established  for evaluating the set of 
generated terms .  Terms were automatically rejected if CG(t) < 
0.3 or the maximum DS(t) value was less th an 5.   
4.3 Trace Execution  
In the final stage of the algorithm, the terms identified through 
domain concept mining are concatenated into a query which is 
issued using the standard traceability algorithm described in 
Section 2.1  
 
4.4 Experimental Evaluatio n 
To evaluate the web mining technique an experiment was 
conducted for tracing the HIPAA security regulations against 
requirements in the ten healthcare datasets. Initial queries for 
selecting domain specific documents were formulated by 
extracting the headings from each of the HIPAA regulations.  A 
researcher then evaluated the top results returned by BING, GOOGLE, and YAHOO, and as a result modified the search 
queries to produce the final queries shown in Table 5.   Ten 
documents were selected for each HIPAA regulation.  For 
example, the d ocuments selected for Access Control  included a  
Wikipedia Article, Apache HTTP Server documentation, 
“principles surrounding access rights  in the context of the Seventh 
Framework Programme of the European Community ”, Acce ss 
Control Standard by State of Maryland Department of 
Information Technology and Access Control Standards by Purdue 
University.   Each document was analyzed to extract domain 
concepts using the method s described in section 4.2, and the ten 
top terms were i dentified for each regulation.  
 
For illustrative purposes, the indicator terms mined for the Access 
Control HIPAA regulation are shown in stemmed form in Table 6 . 
Several terms, such as access and control,  also occurred in the 
original regulation, however additional terms such as role, right  
and privilege  were discovered, and several relatively non-useful 
terms such as persons  and software that occurred in the original 
regulation were omitted from the reconstituted query.   It is also 
interesting to note that several terms such as right, and privilege  
were discovered by both the standard machine learning method 
and the term mining approach. A new trace query was formulated 
by concatenating the identified terms and phrases.  For example, 
the access control  query was transformed from its original form 
shown in Figure 1 to “access control role resource password 
secur standard right privilege authent”  and executed using the 
probabilistic formula  (1) described in Section 2.1 of this paper.   
Results from the experiment are reported in Table 7, and 
compared against the other two techniques in Figure 3.  Four 
HIPAA regulations, namely Encryption , Emergency Access 
Procedure , Encryption  and Decryption , and Transmission 
Security  were traced with 100% recall.   These were the same four 
that had been recalled at 100% by the original basic algorithm.  Table 5. Queries used to select domain documents .

161Additionally the three regulations of access control , audit controls  
and person or entity authentication  returned recall values of over 
0.85. Although integrity , still did not perform well, with a recall 
of only 0.647; this was a significant improvement over both of the 
previous methods where maximum recall was only 0.529 for the 
basic approach and 0.176 for the machine learning method.  The 
trace for unique user ID at recall o f 0.63 performed worse than for 
both the previous methods. However this particular problem 
highlighted one of the risks of this non-deterministic tracing 
approach which is its dependen ce upon finding a suitable and 
expressive set of documents.  In this case, the selection of domain 
documents failed to produce the term „unique’  which occurred 
quite frequently across UUI requirements.  Future experiments, in 
which the process of selecting domain specific documents is fully 
automated, and therefore can include a more extensive analysis, 
may be able to overcome this problem more satisfactorily.   
The web mining approach outperformed the basic approach  for 
three of the same HIPAA regulations that were improved by the 
machine learning  method;  these were access co ntrol , audit control  
and personal authentication .  Although improvements in average 
precision were less than those achieved by the machine learning 
method, the human effort was also significantly less.  The web 
mining approach  also improve d results for integrity  which the 
machine learning approach had been unable to do.  However the 
web-mining approach performed worse on four of the HIPAA 
regulations than either of the other methods.  These were  
transmission encryption and decryption , emergency access 
proce dures, storage encryption , and unique u ser ID .  There were 
no cases in which the web -mining technique outperformed both of 
the other two methods.  
 5.  ANALYSIS OF THE RESU LTS  
This paper has described three methods for tracing regulatory 
codes to product le vel requirements, and has illustrated and 
evaluated them with respect to the HIPAA security rule.  The 
results suggest that machine learning methods can be used to 
improve trace query results when sufficiently large sized training 
sets are available.  A Pe arson correlation analysis of the number 
of requirements associated with each HIPAA regulation (see 
Table 1) and the improvement in average precision achieved by 
utilizing the machine learning method instead of the basic trace 
retrieval approach, returned a coefficient  of 0.783, indicating a 
strong positive correlation  between these two factors.   
Surprisingly, a similar correlation was observed for the Web 
Mining approach.  Further analysis suggests  that in cases where 
there are a larger number of requireme nts fanning -out from one 
regulatory code, the terms in the raw regulatory code  may provide 
insufficient query terms to adequately retrieve the diverse set of 
related requirements .  In this case, query augmentation is 
essential.  Our experiments show that i n these cases , although  the 
machine learning method was most effective, the web mining 
technique also improved results , but without the excessive effort 
required to manually construct a training set.   These results are 
summarized in Figure 4   
6.  GENERALI TY OF THE APPROACH  
Establishing the training sets and the infrastructure to conduct 
these experiments was very time consuming, and so it was not 
feasible to repeat the entire study for a different set of regulatory 
codes  within the scope of this paper .  Ne vertheless, a small and 
informal study was conducted to evaluate the generality of the 
second technique , in which indicator terms are mined from the 
web and used in the tracing process .   Table 7 . Confusion matrix showing results from query reconstitution trace method .

Figure 3. Average precision of three different traceability methods by query type . 
162In the first informal experiment, a single regulation was traced 
from the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance of 
Way (AREMA) codes to 165 contractual requirements for a large 
systems engineering project.  The selected code stated that “ When 
used, combustion burners should be provided with suitable safety 
controls including a combustion safety control (e.g. flame 
detector), high temperature limit safety control, and other safety 
controls that may be required to provide for safe operation of the 
device .”  This particular code was selected for the experiment 
because it had the most individual traces (5) in the provided 
answer set.  Applying the search-augmented trace method led to 
an improvement in precision from 22% to 27% at consistent recall 
levels of 100%.  In a second informal experiment, a single 
regulation “The total volume of gas required shall (a) be 
determined as the total vol ume for all appliances supplied…” was 
traced from the Canadian Natural Gas and Propane Code 
(CNGPC) to 84 component level requirements; however for this 
particular trace, precision was quite poor with and without the 
search-augmented technique.  The single target link, which 
originally appeared in the 17th ranked position moved only to the 
14th position with the enhancement.  However the search-
enhanced method was able to learn the previously undetected 
phrase of gas supply  (i.e. supply of gas) which was found in the 
targeted requirement .  Although not incorporated into our current 
tracing tool, phrasing is known to improve trace results [31] and 
could therefore potentially be used to improve future traces. 
An analysis of the AREMA and CNGPC codes suggests that 
future enhancements are feasible if the algorithm is fine-tuned to 
support a more focused search.  Whereas, regulatory codes such 
as HIPAA tend to include relatively distinct topics, the CNGPC, 
and to some extent the AREMA codes, are much less distinct and 
individual codes contain overlapping ideas.  Future work is 
clearly needed to fully understand the constraints of this approach 
and to fine-tune techniques for retrieving more focused domain 
relevant documents or sections of documents.  
 
7.  THREATS TO VALID ITY 
There are three primary threats to validity in this work.  The first 
relates to the generality of the healthcare related datasets.  This 
threat was largely addressed through using 10 different 
requirements specifications taken from entirely different sources.  
In all cases, the requirements text was extracted directly from 
source documents, and only very common words were added 
during the specification process that would either be ignored as 
stopwords or assigned insignificant weightings by the tf-idf 
algorithm.  The second threat relates to the fact that one of the 
datasets was much larger than the others which could have introduced terminology bias.  Although not reported in detail in 
this paper, an informal analysis showed that the traces worked 
effectively across all of the different projects.  Future work will 
examine this in greater detail. 
The third major threat to validity relates to biases that could have 
been introduced in selecting domain specific documents for 
experimenting with the search-based approach to learning 
indicator terms.  This threat was partially addressed through 
defining a set of selection rules.  Nevertheless these rules were 
based on our observations of security related documents and may 
be biased towards HIPAA regulations or towards security related 
documents in general.  As a result of this issue, we cannot claim 
generality of the document selection process for other types of 
regulations or for the tracing problem in general.  As explained in 
section 5, this will be left primarily to future work. 
 
8.  RELATED WORK 
As referenced in the introductory section of this paper, numerous 
researchers have investigated the use of semi-automatic and 
automatic approache s to dynamically generate traceability links 
[28] based on information retrieval (IR) methods including Latent 
Semantic Analysis (LSA), the Vector Space Model, and prob-
abilistic approaches [2, 7 , 9, 11, 12, 19, 23].  Extensive empirical 
studies have shown that in order to recall at least 90% of the 
correct links, precision levels of 10% to 50% can be achieved in 
most datasets[18].  Despite these precision problems, IR methods 
have been shown to save significant time and effort when used in 
place of brute force tracing methods.  Associated tools such as 
RETRO [20], Poirot [7], and ADAMS[11] are currently being 
used on a variety of government and industrial projects.  Other 
semi-automated tracing techniques include rule-based 
approaches[29], scenario and test case-based methods [13] , event-
based approaches[8], and policy-based methods [24] .  However 
much of this related work has focused on generating traces 
between documentation and code [2, 23] or across artifacts such 
as requirements, design, code, and test cases within a project [7 , 9, 
12, 19, 20].  Furthermore, techniques such as scenario or policy-
based approaches are more appropriate for tracing within a project 
than for tracing external documents such as regulatory codes. 
With respect to automated learning of indicator terms, Hu et al, 
used Wikipedia to augment users‟ web -based queries [17], while 
several other researchers have used more general web knowledge 
to augment queries [5, 27] ; however their work assumes a typical 
web-based query of only 2-3 words.  Their intent is therefore to 
augment the query with additional and potentially disambiguating 
information.  In contrast, regulatory codes are much longer in 
nature, typically involving from 10-20 terms, and so our approach 
is designed to augment a standard regulatory code with alternate 
terms that might be found in the search space, while removing 
non-critical peripheral terms that cause precision problems.   
9.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
The techniques described in this paper offer a promising new 
approach for supporting the task of tracing from regulatory codes 
such as the HIPAA security rule to contractual and product level 
requirements.  Experimental results have shown significant 
improvements over existing trace-retrieval methods, suggesting 
that the reported techniques could significantly reduce the human 
effort and increase the accuracy of tracing regulatory codes.  We 
are currently engaged in an industry pilot study [4] and plan to 
repeat the traces for this study using the term mining technique Figure 4 .  Mean Average Precision for HIPAA regulations 
categorized by number of related requirements in dataset of 
10 Healthcare requirements specifications . 
 
163described in this paper. Other areas for future work include 
tracing requirements to lower level refinements of the HIPAA 
regulations . In prior work, Breaux and Anton [5] identified six 
types of data access constraints, to handle complex cross-
references, resolve ambiguities, and assign priorities between 
access rights and obligations. As part of our future work we will 
therefore apply the data mining techniques described in this paper 
to a more fine-grained model of the HIPAA regulatory codes 
showing specific rights and obligations with respect to specific 
patient healthcare information.   This approach is expected to 
produce a more precise traceability report that highlights 
regulatory risks and failures with respect to specific health care 
information.
