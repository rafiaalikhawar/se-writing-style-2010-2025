ABSTRACT
Many software systems utilize forums to allow a broad set
of stakeholders to request features. However the resulting
mass of ideas and comments can make prioritization and
management of feature requests challenging. In this paper
we propose a novel approach for partially automating the
creation of personas from a set of feature requests in open
forums. Our approach utilizes topic clustering, classica-
tion, and association rules to identify meaningful groupings
of feature requests and then uses them to guide the construc-
tion of personas. Once created, these personas are leveraged
to coordinate feature requests, track changes, and to pro-
vide stakeholder communication mechanisms. We illustrate
our approach with examples taken from the health-insurance
domain and then evaluate it against feature requests in the
SugarCRM project.

1. INTRODUCTION
All software systems must satisfy a wide range of func-
tional and quality-focused concerns [3]. These concerns are
often elicited from stakeholders using online discussion fo-
rums. While this enables a relatively inclusive elicitation
process it also introduces a range of problems such as re-
dundant requests, topics dispersed widely across multiple
discussion threads, and unanswered posts [6]. Such problems
can only partially be mitigated through current practices of
using search technologies to recommend relevant threads for
new posts [6].

http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2642937.2642958 .The solution presented in this paper anchors the require-
ments gathering process around the notion of personas {
each of which provides an archetypal representation of a
group of similar stakeholders. We automate the process of
generating a relevant set of personas from the feature re-
quests in an open forum, and then use these personas as
a focal point for various communication and software en-
gineering activities. To this end, we apply topic analysis
and association rule mining against the feature requests in
a forum to identify meaningful groupings of concerns which
are used to recommend the formation of personas. Each
persona provides a unique perspective on underlying stake-
holder concerns and is used in the coordination, prioritiza-
tion, and tracking of feature requests.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Sec-
tions 2 and 3 introduce the notion of personas and present
our approach for automatically generating them from fea-
ture requests. Section 4 describes the application of our
approach in the SugarCRM forum and presents results from
an initial evaluation. Sections 5, 6, and 7 describe threats
to validity, related work, and discuss conclusions.
2. PERSONAS
Personas were introduced to user interaction design by
Alan Cooper in the mid 1990s through his now infamous
book \The inmates are running the Asylum" [8]. Each per-
sona is given a name and described in terms of psyche, back-
ground, emotions and attitudes. Personas are traditionally
created through a fairly rigorous series of user analysis ac-
tivities which include surveys and interviews, slicing of users
into categories, data collection and analysis to test whether
candidate slices create distinguishable user groups, and anal-
ysis of potential usage patterns within each group.
In our prior work, we demonstrated how personas could
be used to support the architectural design process [4, 5]
and argued that using Architecturally Signicant (AS) Per-
sonas as an aid to understanding architectural concerns in
early phases of a project could guide the architectural design
process and minimize the need for late-stage costly refactor-
ings. Our AS-personas are therefore designed to drive ar-
chitectural and software design as opposed to user-interface
design. In this paper we present a novel, semi-automated
approach for extracting feature requests from online forums,
and then using this information to generate candidate per-
sonas.
We illustrate our approach within the context of a Health
Care Insurance MarketPlace. Figure 1 shows one persona
for this application domain. Joe represents the demographic
479
Joe is married and has two children.  He was previously 
employed as a construction worker, but after a biking 
accident he has been unable to work full -time.   He spends 
much of his time watching television. He has had no health-care insurance since his accident.  The recent government healthcare insurance market places means that he can now apply for affordable healthcare.  This is particularly important as his wife has only a low -paying job.  He feels 
confused by the options available to him and approaches the enrollment process with great trepidation.  Like many others, he has left enrollment for the last minute and worries whether he can register in time.  
 Joe’s user stories:  
 
1.As a potential insuree  I need to find available insurance policies,  to understand what they offer me and how much they will cost.  
2.As a novice user I need the MarketPlace  system to guide me step -by-step through the application process. 
(Usability)  
3.I need the MarketPlace to be online and responsive. 
(Availability)  
4.Once I’ve entered my information and requested a quote I want the quotes to be returned quickly. 
(Performance)  
5.I don’t want  my healthcare record to be made public as 
this might impact my future employment opportunities. 
(Privacy)  
6.I would like to see a side by side comparison of the quotes returned to me.

group of users who currently do not have any health-care in-
surance and have only basic computer skills. Joe's concerns
translate into a number of functional user stories and qual-
ity issues related to availability, performance, privacy, and
usability of the system.
As depicted in Figure 2, personas can serve as a focal point
for communication purposes. Stakeholders register their in-
terests in specic personas, while personas register as ob-
servers to various system level views. For example, view 1
captures the primary features { including the feature request
quotes from Insurance Providers . Both Joe and Martha are
interested in this feature { Joe because he wants to receive
quotes, and Martha because she wants to ensure privacy of
the data transmitted in the request for a quote. If changes
are made to this feature, notications are sent to all rele-
vant personas, and these notications in turn are forwarded
to their registered stakeholders. Similarly, view 2, connects
quality concerns to specic modules through use of a trace
matrix. If changes are made in architecturally signicant
areas of the design or code that impacts the realization of
quality goals, interested personas and their associated stake-
holders should be notied. Our approach requires the un-
derlying support of an event based system.
3. PERSONA CREATION
To represent the diverse interests of real stakeholders, per-
sonas need to be multi-faceted. We generate such personas
in the four-step process of (1) clustering individual posts
into topics, (2) performing association rule mining to dis-
cover groupings of topics which tend to be of interest to
multiple stakeholders, (3) identifying quality concerns for
each grouping of topics related to attributes such as per-
formance, security, and availability, and nally (4) recom-
mending groups of topics from which to create individual
personas, and providing supporting information about asso-
ciated feature requests from which an analyst can create a
persona. We discuss each of these steps below.3.1 Topic Identiﬁcation
Topic identication is accomplished through clustering fea-
ture requests. Unfortunately forum data is very `noisy.' In
addition to the targeted feature requests the posts include
complaints, calls for help, social comments (e.g. \Nice to
hear from you again"), and user's names. They also in-
clude foreign language terms, typos, and spelling errors.
Within this challenging context, our goal is to identify fea-
tures of interest to the users. For example, a feature re-
quest taken from the OpenEMR (Electrical Medical Record)
system states that \Just wanted to know, Is there any way
to transfer the whole billed amount to patient responsibility,
when the insurance denies the claims? One way to post it
through batch payments, but it's too lengthy."
As topics tend to be dispersed across posts in multiple
discussion threads, we take individual posts as the primitive
unit for clustering purposes. Each of the generated clus-
ters represents a single topic. We utilized the Incremental
Diusive Clustering (IDC) algorithm to perform this clus-
tering because it has been shown to produce quite accurate
and meaningful clusters of features. It places each post into
one or more cluster according to the number of its underly-
ing topics. For example, the example feature request could
conceivably cluster into two separate topics related to claim
denial and billing . Each topic is named automatically by
identifying the medoid of its cluster, dened as the descrip-
tor that is most representative of the cluster's theme. Due
to space constraints we do not formaly dene the IDC algo-
rithm here; however a complete description is provided by
Hariri et al. [9].
3.2 Association rule mining
Creating one persona per topic would lead to a prolifer-
ation of personas. We therefore use association rule min-
ing to infer meaningful groupings of topics [10]. For exam-
ple, we might discover that users interested in requests for
quotes also tended to be interested in reviewing and compar-
ing quotes, or in information privacy . This idea is illustrated
in Figure 3. We utilize association rule mining to infer these
relationships.

the set of users who have contributed in all the topics in t.
The support of the topic set tis dened as (t) :=jPtj=jPj.
Topic sets that satisfy a predened support threshold are
referred to as frequent item sets (in the following we will
refer to these as frequent topic sets ).
An association rule ris expressed in the form X=)

ris the condence for the rule rgiven byr:=(X[

main steps. First the discovery of frequent topic sets (i.e.,
itemsets which satisfy a minimum support threshold) and
secondly the discovery of association rules between frequent
topic sets which satisfy a minimum condence threshold.
3.3 Identifying quality concerns
We also identify quality concerns, such as security, per-
formance, and usability, which are relevant to the selected
topics. We utilized a classier that we had previously de-
veloped to detect non-functional requirements (NFRs) [7].
This classier has been trained to detect several dierent
480Stakeholders register their interest in specific 
personas and are subsequently notified (using 
either a pull or push mechanism when any of the persona’s interests are impacted by a change in the system).

Quality concerns are traced to specific modules.  Personas register specific user stories with the quality concern view and are notified when changes occur.  View example # 1: Personas register their interests in specific 
features.  When features are modified, personas are notified).

quality concerns related to security, performance, usability,
and more. The classier evaluates the likelihood that a given
post is associated with each quality.
3.4 Recommending Personas
The combined use of topic analysis, association rule min-
ing, and quality-concern classication produces a set of re-
lated topics, each of which is dened in terms of featurerequests and quality concerns. These \megatopics" serve as
the basis of our persona recommendation process.
For each recommended persona, we rst present a set of
topics to the user representing the groupings identied using
association rule mining. The user can accept or reject topics
for several reasons including (i) the user doesn't believe that
the set of topics are suciently related, or (ii) a topic was
formed around a non-feature. Examples of the second case
include topics formulated around unusual user's names or
terms such as help orrunwhich might be commonly used
in the forum but not removed as stopwords.
For each accepted topic, the user is presented with a list of
related posts. She can search through these posts to identify
sentences or phrases to assign to the persona as user stories
or can write her own stories that reect the stakeholders'
posts. We considered, but rejected the idea of automati-
cally mining the most representative feature requests from
the forum and assigning these directly to the stakeholder in
favor of a manual requirements (user story) extraction phase
guided by the carefully clustered posts. This approach facil-
itated high quality, comprehensible, focused personas, which
better supported our end goal.
4. EV ALUATION
We demonstrate and evaluate our approach against fea-
ture requests in the SugarCRM system. SugarCRM is a pop-
ular open-source, customer relationship management system
designed to automate sales, customer services, and mar-
keting processes [1]. We selected SugarCRM because it is
used in both open source and commercial open source ap-
plications utilized by stakeholders in a broad set of areas,
including business, healthcare, technology and transporta-
tion. The broad interests of the stakeholders, coupled with
481an active customer base results in copious requests for new
features.
4.1 Extracting SugarCRM Personas
We used a screen-scraping tool named Mozenda to extract
posts and user tags from the SugarCRM forum for the pe-
riod of July 2004 to January 2014. This resulted in 6,867
posts from 2,459 unique users. We then applied the IDC
process to produce the 14 initial clusters, depicted in Table
1. Where appropriate we matched the topic to specic Sug-
arCRM modules [1] and provide an associated description in
the table. For example, the topic labeled \Campaign," refers
to a module used to create and manage the marketing and
advertisement campaigns for the customers. Other module-
related topics include\Leads"representing the\ Target"cus-
tomers who replied to a \Campaign" and \Contacts" who
represent particularly qualied \Leads" and are part of a
longer-term selling process. Some topics could be seen as
red-herrings i.e. something that distracts from relevant and
important issues. Examples of red-herrings include the top-
ics labeled \Manoj" and \same." Manoj turns out to be the
administrator of the forum - but as his name occurs ubiqui-
tously throughout the forum and was not included in a list
of stop-names (i.e. names removed during the preprocessing
phase), it ended up as the centroid of a cluster. The topic
\same" was produced for similar reasons { numerous users
made comments such as \I have the same problem." Both of
these topics could easily be removed by adding such words
to the standard stopword list, or simply by rejecting the
topic. We removed non-useful topics from further analysis.
These rejected topics are marked with in the nal column
of Table 1.
Our approach identied 10 of 16 core functional areas of
the SugarCRM system. The six missing areas were not ex-
tensively discussed in the forum, and therefore not detected
as primary topics by our algorithms.
We implemented Association Rule mining using the Apri-
ori algorithm [10]. Given a minimum condence threshold
C, the Apriori algorithm attempts to nd the sets of top-
ics which are subsets of at least C User-Topic contribution
patterns in the data. It extends the discovered frequent
subsets by adding one item at the time and tests all newly
formed subsets against the whole data to identify additional
successful extensions. The minimum support threshold was
set at 10% and condence at 30%. Setting higher thresh-
olds would result in stronger but fewer association rules,
less grouping between topics, and ultimately more distinct
personas. We attempted to establish thresholds that would
discover primary associations between topics, while avoid-
ing the proliferation of resulting personas. Table 2 reports
the strong association rules discovered in the stakeholder's
contribution patterns. Topics that were associated at con-
dence and support levels above the specied thresholds were
then combined (e.g. Topics 2, 7, 10 and 11 representing Tar-
getLists, Campaign, Lead, Contact, Email and Case). For
understandability purposes we provide names for each per-
sona in the table, although in practice the activity of persona
naming is one of the last steps in the process. Table 3 depicts
the topics associated with each of the identied personas.
Finally, we used the NFR classier to identify 516 quality
related posts from the 6,867 posts. These included perfor-
mance, usability, availability, operability, and security. As
an example, a post classied as Performance stated that \ATable 1: Topics extracted from SugarCRM forum

in about 5 seconds without any memory and timeout issues."
In the nal step we create six personas based on the recom-
mended clusterings of topics and their associated functional
and quality-related posts. It took one of the authors approx-
imately 20 minutes per persona to review recommended top-
ics and their associated posts and to construct the personas.
These personas focus on project management, bug report-
ing, SugarForge, search, email management, and campaigns.
They cover quality concerns including performance, privacy,
and usability. Two of these six created personas are depicted
in Figure 4.
During this process, a few of the user stories were ex-
tracted almost word for word from forum posts, while others
were created as a result of browsing through the posts associ-
ated with each recommended persona and then formulating
a concise and representative user story.
4.2 Placing the Persona in the Middle
We automatically subscribed all stakeholders to personas
according to the topics of their posts. For example, if stake-
holder SH1 had contributed posts related to search and
sugar forge then she would be registered to receive noti-
cations from Sarah and any other persona with relevant
interests. On average, each real stakeholder was registered

to 2.2 personas. Registration of personas to views is depen-
dent upon the availability of various views. For purposes
of our SugarCRM case study we developed two views. The
rst was based on the core SugarCRM modules, while the
second depicted a set of trackable feature requests we ex-
tracted from SugarCRM's bug tracking system. We provide
an illustrative example later to show how this infrastructure
could be used to keep stakeholders informed of a change in
the status of a specic feature.
4.3 Evaluating Personas
To evaluate our approach we formulated the research ques-
tion \Are the personas assigned (i.e. registered for) to each
stakeholder appropriate and complete?" To answer this ques-
tion we took a random sampling of 25 stakeholders from the
forum. We eliminated any posts which were not feature re-
quests { for example, comments such as \Yes I like that idea
too," or \Can anyone tell me how to do X?" For stakeholders
with multiple posts related to several dierent topics, we se-
lected the rst instance of each topic. A persona assignment
was deemed correct if the body of the user's post contained
a reference to a topic of the stakeholder's interest. The two
researchers manually inspected each of the posts and identi-
ed the relevant persona(s). A complete listing of the posts,
the assigned stakeholders, and the evaluation results are pro-
vided online at http://re.cs.depaul.edu/Artifacts/Personas.
4.3.1 Results
Based on our analysis of the complete sample of 25 per-
sonas, 13 stakeholders had completely correct personas as-
signed while 7 stakeholders had exactly one relevant per-
sona missing. Of these, 4 were correctly assigned 1 persona
(while missing 1) and 3 were correctly assigned 2 personas
(while missing 1). There were no cases of incorrect assign-
ments; however, we expect that this class of error would
occur if we were to create ner grained clusterings and more
focused personas. Finally we had 5 instances of missing
topics. These topics include synchronization, calender and
reminders, shortcuts for ltering purposes, and a request for
tagging of open SugarCRM tabs. An analysis of these miss-
ing topics showed that there were insucient related posts
in the forum for them to be identied as major topics.
4.4 Demonstrating Personas in the Middle
The eectiveness of the personas-in-the-middle concept is
clearly dependent on the correct assignment of personas toTable 4: Sample feature requests

stakeholders and the quality of those personas. In this sec-
tion we therefore provide an illustrative example taken from
SugarCRM to show how this works. Our example is based
on our two depicted personas and the stakeholders depicted
in Table 4. We discuss only the subscriptions and noti-
cations relevant to the release of the following new plugin
feature (retrieved verbatim from the SugarExchange). The
feature provides \a new powerful search features for Sugar-
CRM: From and To date search capabilities, OR / NOT eld
search options, text/number OPERATOR (LIKE, =, >,<,
IN, BETWEEN and RLIKE are supported) and the new
Additional Search." Unsurprisingly, this feature is tagged
with the topic search and added to a new features list.
This triggers a notication event to all personas with search
interests, which in our example is only Sarah . The notica-
tion is then forwarded (either via push or pull mechanisms)
to all of Sarah's registered users.
5. THREATS TO V ALIDITY
Evaluating new processes in Software Engineering can be
challenging { primarily because demonstrating the viability
of a new software engineering process or infrastructure, such
as the one presented here, requires using the new approach
in a real project during the actual lifetime of the project.
This is out of scope for the current work. However, we have
demonstrated the viability of using data mining techniques
to identify realistic groupings of topics and associated cross-
cutting quality concerns, and then using these results to cre-
ate representative, useful personas. Furthermore, our evalu-
ation is limited to a single open-source project and evaluates
only whether the personas created in response to the auto-
483mated recommendations provided sucient coverage to the
stakeholders. While this assessment was made by two mem-
bers of this team, thereby introducing potential bias, we
mitigated this risk by clearly dening the criterion for asso-
ciating a persona with a stakeholder. Furthermore, we have
publicly posted our evaluation results for review by others.
6. RELATED WORK
Several researchers have developed techniques for extract-
ing requirements from online forum data. For example,
Scacchi describes techniques for using online forums to gather
requirements [14] while Noll introduces online forums as a
way to elicit the requirements for open source software[13].
Several authors have proposed the use of data mining algo-
rithms for identifying personas. Sinha used Principal Com-
ponent Analysis (PCA) to discover dissimilarities among in-
dividuals through identifying the most discriminant factors
in data [15]. Tu et al used PCA to remove insignicant
questions in a survey and then Clustering Analysis(CA) to
group similar users based on their answers. They create one
persona per group by interviewing users [16]. Miaskiewicz et
aluse Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA) in order to discover
the similarities between responses of interviewees to a set
of questions[12]. These approaches dier from ours because
their intent is to create personas early in the development
process based on answers to survey questions in order to
guide the user interaction design of the system. In contrast,
our approach develops personas for the purpose of managing
and communicating information in a forum. Furthermore,
their approaches are limited to text clustering, while ours in-
troduces the additional step of association rule mining. This
means that very disparate topics { which happen to be of
interest to similar stakeholders could be grouped together.
There have also been several attempts to extract require-
ments knowledge from open source forums. Huang et al pro-
posed an approach for extracting <thread-title, reply> pairs
as chat knowledge using a Support Vector Machine(SVM)
[11]. Vlas and Robinson applied a rule-based natural lan-
guage classier to extract feature requests [2]. Although,
the nature of data is similar, their purpose is to extract re-
quirements, whereas ours is to create personas.
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper we have proposed a novel approach that
mines feature requests from forums, identies cohesive top-
ics, learns associations between those topics based on inter-
ests of actual users, identies cross-cutting concerns, and
uses this information to recommend personas. These per-
sonas can be used to anchor the feature management pro-
cess in order to tame the chaos that can pervade large open
feature-request forums.
We have described the application of our approach to over
six thousand feature requests mined from the SugarCRM fo-
rum, and demonstrated the viability of generating a useful
set of personas for managing feature requests. Future work
will explore the use of such personas in active projects across
a far broader set of domains and will also explore the usabil-
ity aspects connected to the task of persona creation.
