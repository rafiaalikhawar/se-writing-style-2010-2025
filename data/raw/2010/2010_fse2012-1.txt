ABSTRACT
It has been claimed that crosscutting concerns are pervasive
and problematic, leading to diculties in program compre-
hension, evolution, and long-term design degradation. To
consider whether this theory bears out, we examine the
patch history of the Mozilla project over a period of a decade
to consider whether crosscutting concerns exist therein and
whether we can see evidence of problems arising from them.
Mozilla is an interesting case, due to its longevity; size;
polylingual nature; and use of a patch review process, which
maintains strong connections between issue reports and the
patches that are intended to address each. We perform sev-
eral statistical analyses of the over 200,000 patches submit-
ted to address over 90,000 issues reported in this time period.
We nd that 90% of patches show little or no evidence of
scattering, that the scattering of a patch tends to decrease
slightly upon review on average, and that the system shows
at worst a slow increase of average scattering over time.

1. INTRODUCTION
It has been argued for decades that software should be
well-modularized to obtain various benets, such as ease of
change, ease of comprehension, and ease of parallel develop-
ment [32]. In the 1990s, it was understood that there ex-
ist software concerns (known as crosscutting concerns ) that

tion present in real systems [20], but are instead scattered
across and tangled with the other, modularized concerns in
a system; typical examples include logging, security, distri-
bution, protocol enforcement, and various design patterns.
Furthermore, it was argued that crosscutting concerns were
inherent, and not an artifact of a poorly-chosen modulariza-
tion [38]. In response, the solution was promoted to separate
and encapsulate crosscutting concerns through novel pro-
grammatic mechanisms; hence was born the aspect-oriented
software development (AOSD) research community. But in
considering how the modularity issues should be addressed,
a key issue was often overlooked: do crosscutting concerns
cause modularity problems in practice?
To be clear, there has been much work that has attempted
to examine whether the novel AOSD mechanisms represent
an improvement in modularity over traditional mechanisms,
but all such work starts from the assumption that crosscut-
ting concerns are necessarily deleterious. We can see sev-
eral serious threats to validity in such studies. (1) Tiny
examples of problems plus assertions that their properties
extrapolate, while reasonable at early research stages to ex-
plain issues, cannot serve as demonstration that problems
exist in practice. (2) Measures of internal quality attributes
(e.g., coupling) can be used descriptively to characterize the
properties of software. But they cannot be used to demon-
strate improvement of external quality attributes (e.g., ease
of change, ease of comprehension, and ease of parallel devel-
opment) in the absence of their independent validation [22,
9]. (3) Similarly, structural or behavioural models can be
used to demonstrate improvement only relative to the as-
sumptions of the model. In the absence of generalizable val-
idation of those assumptions, purely model-based claims of
improvement constitute circular reasoning. (4) Comparisons
between two versions of a program, one written with tradi-
tional programming mechanisms and the other with aspect-
oriented (AO) programming mechanisms, are potentially bi-
ased when the AO version is written with full knowledge of
its evolutionary path or the measurements to be made.
We seek then to examine more closely and with a min-
imum of assumptions whether modularity problems arise
in systems using conventional modularization mechanisms
(i.e., not AO ones) as predicted by standard aspect-oriented
theory. To this end, we analyze the change history for
the Mozilla project over a 10 year period of development.
Mozilla is an interesting and pertinent case study for cross-
cutting concerns: it is large (over 11 MLOC spread amongst
nearly 100,000 les in a recent snapshot), so it potentiallycontains many crosscutting concerns; it is mature, so there
has been adequate time for problems to develop; it is writ-
ten in multiple languages and data formats, allowing a more
general analysis; and it uses a patch review process that
(a) allows a reliable mapping from issue reports to patches
that purport to solve the issues and (b) provides a means
of seeing rejected attempts at providing patches, potentially
providing insight into issues that were dicult to address.
We expect that a patch is scattered (i.e., it includes
changes to multiple parts of the codebase) when the under-
lying issue being addressed relates to crosscutting concerns
in the codebase; analyzing the scattering of patches thus
gives us an opportunity to understand the impact that scat-
tered concerns have on development work in practice. We
focus on scattering rather than tangling, as simple measures
of scattering arise directly from the change history, both
simplifying the collection process and minimizing the po-
tential for biases arising from tailored measures; to measure
tangling would instead require the reconstruction of large
numbers of historical snapshots of the codebase, or the use
of questionable heuristics.
We have gathered issue, patch, and review information
from Mozilla's issue tracking system to consider the extent,
nature, and changes to the scattering of patches. More
specically, we have analyzed this information to address the
following research questions: (1) Does Mozilla show signs
of crosscutting concerns? (2) Is the scattering of patches
spurious? (3) What is the nature of the highly scattered
changes? (4) How scattered are the patches? (5) Do scat-
tered patches require more revision? (6) Does scattering in-
crease after review? (7) Does Mozilla show signs of decay?
We nd that, although crosscutting concerns are clearly
present, they show little evidence overall of causing prob-
lems in Mozilla.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In
Section 2, we examine previous work. In Section 3, we de-
scribe some details of the Mozilla project and the data that
we collected from it. Details of the analysis and its results
are given in Section 4, in which we take an exploratory ap-
proach to deriving each research question. Threats to va-
lidity of our study are discussed in Section 5. Conclusions
about our study are left until Section 6.
This paper contributes an assessment of evidence about
the presence and eects of crosscutting concerns within a
large-scale industrial system.
2. PREVIOUS WORK
Much work in AOSD has created or applied measures of
internal quality attributes (e.g., coupling, entity counts),
particularly with an eye to considering how these measures
change as the software system evolves, or for comparison
between systems employing aspect-oriented and traditional
mechanisms [14, 13, 17, 25, 10]. As argued in the intro-
duction, internal quality attributes do not immediately im-
ply anything about the external quality attributes that we
care about for modularity: ease of change, comprehension,
and parallel development [32]. Przyby lek [33] has argued
that typical aspect-oriented measures fail to consider the full
range of dependencies in aspect-oriented systems, leading to
these measures being biased in favour of AOSD approaches;
his alternatives remain internal quality measures.
Stability has been argued as a means for bridging the gap
between internal and external quality attributes [40]. Sev-eral papers have examined the use of stability to evaluate
AOSD (e.g., [17, 10]. Kelly [19] conducted a case study
to examine how stability can be used to evaluate a design;
she explicitly points out that \since stability is not a su-
cient criterion, software engineering knowledge must be used
to reason about" candidate design characteristics related to
long-term maintainability.
Baldwin and Clark [5] propose a method to compare and
evaluate the design of a system based on design structure
matrices (DSMs), a modelling approach to represent depen-
dencies in a system. Various studies have used DSMs to
investigate the modularity of systems (e.g., [37, 23]). In
particular, MacCormack et al. [27] used the DSM approach
to compare the rst version of Mozilla that was released as
open source and a subsequent redesign of the codebase and
found that the redesigned code base was more modular than
its predecessor. Unfortunately, DSMs necessitate signicant
assumptions about what constitutes a dependency and the
impact of a dependency as a system evolves. In contrast, our
work aims to understand how the modularity of the system
aects the ongoing development of the system by investigat-
ing how scattered the changes are that developers make.
Scattering has been measured in several ways. Absolute
approaches (i.e., counts of entities aected) [41, 35] often
have the advantage that they can avoid biasing the data.
Several works use relative approaches (e.g., concern diu-
sion) [14, 13, 17, 9, 2]; the advantage of these is that scat-
tering can then be compared between systems or versions.
We use absolute measures in our study, and through our
analysis (see Section 4.7), derive a relative measure in order
to compare scattering between dierent contexts.
Baldi et al. [4] utilized an entropy-based model to ana-
lyze the lexical details of software systems to demonstrate
the presence of crosscutting concerns in a purely automated
manner, while also measuring the degree of scattering and
tangling; we do not attempt to identify crosscutting concerns
beyond the issues with which they are associated.
2.1 Results Not Supporting AOSD’s Claims
While the majority of the AOSD literature claims improved
modularity, some works argue that at best the reality is more
nuanced and at worst those claims are false.
Marin et al. [28, 29] classify crosscutting concerns, based
on literature review and their own experience; some of their
categories appear not to be harmful to software systems [11].
Kienzle and G elineau [21] performed a case study in which
they attempted to modularize transactional properties while
ensuring the classic ACID properties from database re-
search; they found that subtle and complex design issues
arise that, if not handled well, could lead to poor modularity.
Siadat et al. [36] considered whether a variety of optimiza-
tions in a network simulator could be modularized through
an AO approach; they found that, while maintaining good
performance, comprehensibility was clearly negatively af-
fected by the separation. Figueiredo et al. [10] evolved two
software product lines to assess their modularity properties;
they found that not all crosscutting concerns cause prob-
lems, and forcing some crosscutting concerns into separated
aspects can itself cause problems. Bartsch and Harrison [6]
conducted an experiment in which 11 developers were asked
to make modications to either a Java- or an AspectJ-based
implementation of a particular system; they found no statis-
tical improvement for the AspectJ version. Przyby lek [34]examined ten applications possessing both Java and AspectJ
implementations to arrive at the conclusion, \the claim that
`the software built in AOP is more modular than the soft-
ware built in OOP' is a myth." In fairness, his measures
have also not been validated, but clearly, the question as to
the eects on modularity by crosscutting concerns have not
been settled at this point.
2.2 “Do Crosscutting Concerns Cause De-
fects?”
An important study to consider here is that of Eaddy et
al. [9]. They also point out that eects on internal qual-
ity attributes do not signify eects on external quality at-
tributes. They set out to measure whether scattering and
defects are correlated, by examining the histories of three
systems. Their methodology was complicated by their need
to link particular code, particular bugs, and particular con-
cerns, in addition to the need to design and collect a number
of complicated measures. In the end, they claim to demon-
strate a statistically signicant correlation between the scat-
tering of a concern and its likelihood to have defects, inde-
pendently of the size of the concern's implementation. Al-
though their study was carefully conducted, their linking
methodology is a serious threat to internal validity, as they
point out; independent means of investigating crosscutting
concerns are warranted.
Figueiredo et al. [12] conducted ve controlled experi-
ments to ascertain how well people can map code to con-
cerns; they found that developers tend to underreport which
concerns are present in a given piece of code, that all
concern-based measures also lead to such biases, but that
coarse-grained scattering measures are less sensitive to poor
mappings from code to concerns. We take this as support
that utilizing simple measures of scattering arising directly
from Mozilla's repository may help avoid biases.
More recently, Aversano et al. [2] also report a correlation
between the number of defects in design-pattern classes and
the scattering of the induced crosscutting concerns.
2.3 Evolvability in Open Source
Previous work has studied the evolvability and modulariza-
tion of various open source systems including the Mozilla
code base. For example, German et al. [15, 16] have con-
ducted studies of the evolution of the Mozilla, Apache, Post-
greSQL, and GCC code bases. They classied modication
records (MRs) based on the type of activity they reect:
functional improvement, defect xing, architectural evolu-
tion and refactoring, documentation, etc. Their analysis of
117,554 MRs from the Mozilla project found that on average
3 les were changed per MR [16], suggesting that scattering
was not signicant. However, measures of central tendency
can be poor summaries of many distributions.
3. THE DATA REPOSITORY
The Mozilla project1is an open source project responsible
for a range of applications, most notably the Firefox web
browser, Thunderbird email client, and Bugzilla issue track-
ing system. Previous research has described the develop-
ment process followed by participants in the Mozilla project
(e.g., [30, 1, 18, 31]). Central to this process is their issue
1http://www.mozilla.org/tracking system (Bugzilla), which tracks issue reports of any
type including bug reports and enhancement requests.
Once an issue is reported, that report is used as a discus-
sion forum on whether to make the requested change and
how it should be made [7]. A bug that cannot be duplicated
or any other issue that is judged as not worth addressing
may simply be marked as closed and not pursued further.
On the other hand, if participants in the community decide
to implement a change to address the issue, the issue track-
ing system is used to facilitate source code review. This
review process begins when a developer uploads a patch (a
le capturing the dis of proposed changes to the code) to
the issue tracking system, which is associated with a specic
issue report. Other developers can download that patch, re-
view it, and make comments on it. Module owners can also
formally mark a patch as approved or not. Mozilla's review
process is often iterative and as problems are identied, a
new patch can be prepared and uploaded with the previ-
ous patch being marked as obsolete. Multiple patches can
simultaneously be non-obsolete; we consider the union of
non-obsolete patches in our analyses where appropriate.
3.1 Data
We examined a total of 93,006 issue reports submitted for
the Mozilla project. First we used the search and export
feature of Bugzilla to generate a list of issue reports. Then
we used custom Python scripts to extract the data regard-
ing each issue report, such as the patch developer's identity,
submission date and time stamp, issue description, and at-
tachments. We analyzed a total of 221,508 patches submit-
ted from 8 April 1999 (patch ID 1) to 17 June 2010 (patch
ID 452149). In our data set, we had a total of 91,085 ob-
solete patches and 130,256 non-obsolete patches (there were
also 167 patches for which obsolescence could not be deter-
mined, and were excluded wherever the question of obsoles-
cence mattered).
Each patch le contains the path of each le aected. We
also collected other parameters that were associated with the
patch: lines added, removed, and modied; obsolescence;
review status; developer of the patch; and the time stamp
when the patch was uploaded.
3.2 Our Scattering Measures
There are many potential ways of measuring the amount of
scattering of a patch. As mentioned in Sections 1 and 2.2,
we are concerned with biasing the results through complex
measures. We selected measures for the sake of simplicity
and ease of computation from the patch data.
The number of les aected per patch (FPP) is the num-
ber of unique les in the codebase that were modied or
added as part of the patch for an issue. When a patch le
is submitted to the Mozilla issue tracker, the generated di
contains the le name of all the les that were changed.
The code for all the individual subprojects in the Mozilla
family (e.g., Firefox, Thunderbird, etc.) is combined into a
single source tree, subdivided into directories referred to as
modules . Each module is specic to some particular feature
of the project. For example, the browser module contains
the front-end code for the Firefox browser. The number of
modules aected per patch (MPP) is the number of unique
modules modied (including additions and deletions) while
addressing a change task. MPP has the potential to eval-
uate the modularity of the directory structure created bythe Mozilla developers. MPP is calculated from the path
information captured by the individual patches.
As mentioned above, multiple patches can exist for the
same issue report; a subset of these will be obsolete, and the
remainder will be non-obsolete. For some of our analyses,
instead of working with per-patch metrics, we union the les
aected by each patch for a given issue report; this yields the
number of les aected per issue considering only obsolete
patches (FPI obs) and the number of les aected per issue
considering only non-obsolete patches (FPI nob).
The unioning procedure is ambiguous for modules, as
patches often contain path information local to the con-
tributing developer's lesystem, at variance with other
patches; we thus do not report modules per issue measure-
ments, to avoid errors that would bias the results.
4. THE ANALYSIS
Our analysis proceeded in an exploratory fashion, discover-
ing new questions while addressing existing ones. Each sub-
section below describes the detailed research questions that
we examined, why the questions matter, how we addressed
the questions, and what we found.
4.1 Are there signs of crosscutting concerns?
This question is a fundamental one, and not to be taken
lightly. Although suggestions have been made that every
system necessarily possesses crosscutting concerns, there are
two points to recognize: (a) we should test hypotheses even
if there is widespread agreement on them; and (b) if we
were unable to see crosscutting concerns through our mea-
surements, our methodology might possess a serious aw.
As 221,508 patches are a lot to visualize, we need some
means of summarizing them. In terms of standard descrip-
tive statistics, for the FPP measure, the mean is 5.09,2the
median is 2, the mode is 1, the standard deviation is 12.99,
the minimum is 1, and the maximum is 872. For the MPP
measure, the mean is 1.48, the median is 1, the mode is 1,
and the standard deviation is 1.81, the minimum is 1, and
the maximum is 136.
These statistics suggest that indeed, at least some patches
are scattered; scattered patches are denite signs of cross-
cutting concerns (by denition)| ifthe scattering of the
patches are reective of the scattering of the underlying
concern. Patch scattering might occur for other, spurious
reasons.
4.2 Is the scattering of patches spurious?
Mozilla's patch review process is supposed to catch situa-
tions where developers have lumped together unrelated sets
of changes as patches; these should be broken up into in-
dividual patches, each addressing an individual issue. Un-
doubtedly, not all patches get reviewed in practice, but more
complex ones (like ones involving scattered changes) are un-
likely to be ignored by module owners. We note that Ayari
et al. [3] conducted a case study to manually inspect is-
sue reports in Mozilla, nding very few cases where changes
were made without an issue report; this is reassuring, but
does not guarantee that the related patches do not address
additional, unrelated issues.
As a simple test, we can examine the patches for issue re-
ports where review has clearly occurred, as evidenced by the
2We report all decimals to 2 digits for convenience.fact that some are marked as obsolete. If we see that scat-
tering decreases markedly in these cases, this would indicate
that unrelated issues are being pushed out of the patches.
Of the 93,006 total issue reports that we collected, 34,726
of them display at least one patch marked as obsolete; each
of these issue reports also has at least one patch marked
as non-obsolete. The standard descriptive statistics for the
FPI nobmeasurements are as follows: the mean is 6.58, the
median is 3, the mode is 1, the standard deviation is 16.14,
the minimum is 1, and the maximum is 635. The stan-
dard descriptive statistics for the FPI obsmeasurements are
as follows: the mean is 7.09, the median is 2, the mode is 1,
the standard deviation is 24.32, the minimum is 1, and the
maximum is 2,670.
Thus we can see that, in at least some cases, the split-
ting procedure happens (notice the drop from the maxi-
mum FPI obsmeasurement to the maximum FPI nobmea-
surement), but that the eect is not large on average. This
is a positive sign that the scattering of patches is actually
reective of the underlying concerns, but we cannot be cer-
tain from this result. We leave this issue for a qualitative
examination in the next section.
4.3 What is the nature of changes that are
highly scattered?
Though the majority of patches touched fewer than 5 les,
there were a number of more scattered changes. For exam-
ple, we found that 5.93% of issue reports had patches touch-
ing more than 11 les in total. To understand the nature
of these scattered changes we conducted a simple qualita-
tive analysis of a random sample of issue reports involving
scattered changes.
To select changes for our analysis, we considered all issue
reports in Mozilla's issue tracking system associated with
the Firefox product, having a status of \Resolved Fixed"
or \Veried Fixed". We ltered the resulting list to only
include reports that had at least one patch that touched 11
or more les, yielding 943 candidate issue reports. Finally,
we randomly selected 50 of those issue reports to use in our
analysis. We categorized these 50 as follows.
Arbitrary issue combination. Five of the issue re-
ports in our sample in fact combined multiple issues for the
convenience of the developer or reviewers. For example, the
patch attached to issue 254982\includes xes for bug 249231
and bug 253657" because of \approval backups and waiting
checkins." As another example, a developer xing several
related issues (337153, 337830, 339484, 340247, and 340312)
created a new issue (340897) and attached patches address-
ing all of the related issues. Such issue reports would tend
to overreport the presence of crosscutting concerns. These
are instances of spurious scattering discussed in Section 4.2.
Dead code removal . The Mozilla community places
emphasis on maintaining code quality.3Getting rid of
dead/unused code is part of maintaining code quality. But
often, it results in removing a lot of les and that ultimately
results in an apparently scattered change. We found 9 in-
stances of dead code removal in our sample. In a strict
sense, these changes are crosscutting concerns, but they are
not particularly signicant ones.
New feature addition . Our sample contained 12 is-
sue reports whose patches were scattered because they were
3https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Code Review FAQnew feature requests in Mozilla Firefox. Changes in func-
tionality of the user interface (UI) were more scattered as
the same changes are required to be made for multiple plat-
forms simultaneously. For instance, issue 322988 involved
the addition a new panel in the browser window for chang-
ing bookmark properties. The change was made for two
dierent themes of Firefox, for both Mac OS and Windows.
The change was more or less the same for both the themes
but resulted in a scattered change. Another instance of a
UI related change is issue 353673; in this issue report, a new
theme was created for Firefox and it resulted in aecting
245 les in total.
Ripple eect . We observed 4 issue reports in our sample
(e.g., 168411, 329741) for which patches are scattered when
changes in one part of the codebase aects other parts of
the codebase, instances of the familiar ripple eect. Ripple
eect is a sign of ineective modularization, but not neces-
sarily to be improved through the separation of crosscutting
concerns.
User-facing changes . Firefox being a web browser
greatly depends upon its UI layout, demanding consistency
for all its versions. Even minor changes in the layout such as
xing a label in a dialog, making buttons semi-transparent
or correcting language errors resulted in a scattered change.
We found that even small UI changes can result in a scat-
tered patch partially because dierent parts of the UI re-
lated code are implemented using dierent programming
languages; examples include xing a label in a dialog, mak-
ing buttons semi-transparent, and correcting the language
of messages displayed to the user. There were 11 such is-
sue reports in our data set. Their associated patches are
scattered due to the lack of direct, cross-language support.
Trivial xes . Some of the changes in our sample were
very large but very trivial. For example, changes to the com-
menting style (issue 338830), xing punctuation errors (is-
sue 255623), removing white spaces from les (issue 316302)
etc. These changes were found to require more review de-
spite their triviality. Because the patch touched many les
from dierent modules, according to Mozilla review stan-
dards each module owner is required to review any patch
submitted for his module. There were 9 such cases in our
data set.
4.4 How scattered are patches?
Assuming that the scattering of patches represents actual
crosscutting concerns, we were curious about the distribu-
tion of scattering.
Seeing the descriptive statistics given in Section 4.1, it
was obvious that we were not dealing with a Gaussian dis-
tribution, but that highly scattered concerns could not be
dismissed out of hand. We examined histograms of the var-
ious measurements to investigate their form; the leftmost
portion of the histogram for the FPP measurements (i.e.,
for FPP of no more than 20) is given in Figure 1. The min-
imum frequency over this range is 730 for FPP = 20 (i.e.,
there are 730 patches with an FPP of 20), and the tail of the
histogram does not reach 0 for the rst time until FPP =
168 after which zeroes occur increasingly often. To visualize
this better, we can redraw the histogram on a log{log plot,
as per Figure 2. The histogram from the MPP measure has
a similar form, as do those from the FPI measures.
The apparent spreading out of the data to the right-
hand side of the plot in Figure 2 is due to noise from the

discrete nature of the histogram; this can be cleaned up
by replacing the linearly-scaled bins of the histogram with
logarithmically-scaled ones. For example, Figure 3 is the
equivalent to Figure 2. The histogram for MPP measure-
ments with logarithmically-scaled bins is shown in Figure 4.
Most importantly, the majority of the data falls at low
levels of scattering (79% of patches have 5 or less les af-
fected, 90% have 10 or less; 79% have 1 directory aected,
95% have 3 or less). But a signicant number of patches
exhibit high or even extremely high degrees of scattering,
for both measures.
4.4.1 Heavy-Tailed Distributions
These results exhibit a structure known colloquially as a
\heavy tail", a distribution in which a non-negligible number
of events occur at large deviations from the mean. Standard
descriptive statistics can give a false impression of the form
of these distributions. Such structures have been reported
in various natural phenomena, and many studies have exam-
ined the presence of heavy-tailed distributions in software;
for example, Louridas et al. [26] provide several plots of an
appearance similar to Figure 2. Recently, Taube-Schock et●

al. [39] reported that every system in a large corpus (of Java
systems across domains, at a wide variety of sizes, and dier-
ing levels of maturity) exhibited heavy-tailed distributions
for coupling, implying the presence of areas of high coupling
in every single one of them.
These heavy-tailed distributions are often assumed to fol-
low a power-law distribution , the discrete version of which
(also known as the zeta distribution ) is pertinent here. Un-
der this distribution, the probability of an event occurring

the point above which the power-law holds (as in practice
only the tail of the data obeys a power-law).Finding that the data conforms (or does not) to a power-
law distribution is potentially important: certain processes
are known to give rise to power laws while other processes
give rise to alternative distributions. Thus, being condent
about the distribution to which data conforms can both al-
low us to make good predictions about future data arising
from the same process, and to model and thus understand
how the data arises in the rst place. Falsely claiming con-
formance to any distribution can be harmful, since it will
both lead to false predictions about future data and to mis-
leading conclusions about how the data arises. Thus, ques-
tions of data distribution should not be ignored.
The most common procedure for tting a power-law dis-
tribution consists of transforming the data and Equation 1
into a log{log form,
log(p(x)) = log(x) + log(C); (2)
a linear equation in which  is the slope and log( C) is the
x-intercept. Thus, a linear regression is generally performed
to get the best t straight line; Louridas et al. follow this
procedure, for example.
However, as described in detail by Clauset et al. [8], there
are a number of serious issues ignored by this procedure:
(1) linear regression makes a set of assumptions that are
violated in transforming the data into the log{log form; (2) a
variety of other distributions also visually follow a linear
form in a log{log plot; and (3) it says nothing about how
well the power-law distribution model ts the data.
To address each of these issues, Clauset et al. have de-
ned more statistically valid and/or empirically supported
alternatives|specically, numerical procedures for estimat-
ing the values of xminand; a set of additional models that
can serve as likely alternatives; and a numerical simulation
procedure for evaluating the probability that a given model
could have generated the observed data. For the details of
the tting procedures and the associated scripts (we used
those provided by Clauset for the R statistics language),
we refer the reader to the manuscript of Clauset et al. [8]
and the companion web page.4The six alternative models
suggested as likely alternatives are: the discrete exponen-
tial distribution, the discrete log-normal distribution, the
discrete power-law distribution with exponential cut-o, the
discrete Weibull distribution, the Poisson distribution, and
the Yule distribution. We collate some details of the proba-
bility estimation procedure in the following subsection.
4.4.2 Estimating goodness-of-ﬁt
Given a set of discrete empirical data fxkg, its cumulative
distribution function ^P(x) can be directly computed as:
^P(x) =jfxkjxkxgj: (3)
Then, any discrete model distribution Dwith probability
mass function pD(x) will have cumulative distribution func-
tion
PD(x) = Pr(Xx)jD=xX
k=0pD(k): (4)
To determine goodness-of-t, we utilize the Monte Carlo
simulation procedure of Clauset et al., in which: (1) a syn-
thetic sample is repeatedly drawn (for a predetermined set
4http://www.santafe.edu/ aaronc/powerlaws/of repetitions) from the model distribution, (2) a measure-
ment is taken to determine whether the empirical data is a
better or worse t for the model distribution than the syn-
thetic sample, and (3) the value ~ pis computed indicating
for what percentage of the synthetic samples the empirical
data is a better t.5
To determine whether the empirical data is a better t
to the model distribution than a given synthetic sample,
a measure is needed to quantify the distance between two
probability distributions. Clauset et al. empirically justify
the use of one such measure, the Kolmogorov{Smirnov (KS)
statistic:
dKS= max
xxminjP(x) PD(x)j (5)
whereP(x) is either the cumulative distribution function of
the data ^P(x) or of thekth synthetic samplecPk
D(x).
The ~pvalue is then computed as
~p=n
kj1kr^dKS
^P(x)
dKScPk
D(x)o
r;(6)
i.e., the fraction of synthetic samples that are a poorer t
to the model distribution than is the data; ris the total
number of synthetic samples to be randomly drawn from the
distribution, which Clauset et al. recommend to lie between
1,000 and 10,000. Finally, ~ p0:1 is interpreted as the model
distribution being a reasonable t to the empirical data.
4.4.3 Results of ﬁtting
We followed the Monte Carlo procedure of Clauset et al. to
determine whether any of the common candidate distribu-
tions are good ts for the data. We arrive at the conclu-
sion that, of the common candidate distributions, the FPP
data most closely follows a discrete log-normal distribution
(= 0:26,= 1:69 forxmin= 1) but that even this
distribution is not a good t (~ p= 0 for 1,000 repetitions);
selecting slightly higher values for the threshold did not im-
prove the t. From Figure 3, we can see a slight curve down-
wards in the data, and so the fact that none of the common
candidate distributions model this well is not surprising.
In contrast, the MPP data reasonably ts a discrete log-
normal distribution ( = 3:52,= 1:68 forxmin= 1;
~p= 0:20 for 10,000 repetitions).
We then examined the FPI nobdata; Figure 5 shows the
resulting histogram. This data ts a discrete log-normal
distribution ( = 0:69,= 1:74 forxmin= 1) best of the
common candidate distributions, although it is a poor t
(~p= 0 for 1,000 repetitions).
4.4.4 Summary
In conclusion, the data all clearly follows a heavy-tailed dis-
tribution, meaning that there are a large number of patches
(whether unioned or not over individual issues) with small
amounts of scattering, few patches with large amounts of
scattering, and very few with very large amounts of scatter-
ing. In particular, we can see that scattering follows a con-
tinuum: a binary distinction between a crosscutting concern
and a non-crosscutting concern seems inappropriate.
None of the data follows a power-law distribution. We
can say only that the MPP measurements t a log-normal

distribution, suggesting that it can be modelled well as the
superimposition of independent random variables [24] and
thus that the entropy-based model of Baldi et al. [4] (see Sec-
tion 2) has a reasonable basis at the module-level. The FPP
and FPI measurements t none of the standard heavy-tailed
distributions, meaning that no standard process models will
be a good description for le-level impact of crosscutting
concerns. These ndings call into question the software en-
gineering literature that follows the common and erroneous
tting process described above to arrive at the conclusion
that power laws are present.
More importantly, there are downsides for aspect ori-
entation in these ndings. (1) There is no natural cut-
o point to dierentiate between crosscutting concerns and
non-crosscutting concerns, except for the degenerate case
when a patch aects only one le. (2) A large number of
patches (about half) illustrate at least minor crosscutting;
thus, it appears unrealistic to separate and encapsulate all
of these, as is promoted by standard AO theory. (3) About
half of the patches of Mozilla manifest at least minor cross-
cutting, so it is a good candidate system on which to test
theories about the eects of crosscutting. (4) The processes
giving rise to the scattering distribution for the patches must
be both complex and poorly understood, meaning that sim-
ple model-based solutions are unlikely to suce.
4.5 Do scattered patches require more revi-
sion?
As described in Section 2, crosscutting concerns have been
argued as causing defects and it is reported that developers
tend to miss the full extent of crosscutting concerns. We
would expect one of a few possible consequences to be visi-
ble in Mozilla as a result: (1) more highly scattered concerns
would require more revision; (2) more highly scattered con-
cerns would more likely become even more scattered after
review; (3) the frequency of issue reports would rise over
time; (4) the codebase would show signs of decay over time.
We address point 1 here, and leave the other points for later.
4.5.1 Scattering versus revision
To measure revision, we used two alternatives: the number
of obsolete patches associated with an issue, and the numberof total patches associated with an issue. Neither is a per-
fect proxy measure, as multiple patches can sometimes be
submitted simultaneously, but one would expect that more
revisions would generally lead to more (obsolete) patches.
We assume that the only reason to have additional patches
submitted is either that there is some competition regard-
ing the best solution, or that additional non-obsolete patches
signal that the earlier solution was incomplete.
For the number of obsolete patches (per issue) versus the
FPI nobmeasurement, we measured two-sided correlation via
both Pearson's product-moment correlation and Spearman's
rank correlation. Pearson's indicates a small but positive
correlation ( r= 0:21;t= 64:26, dof = 93 ;004,p <2:2
10 16, 95% condence = f0:20;0:21g). Spearman's indicates
a small but positive correlation ( = 0:34;S= 8:871013,
p<2:210 16).
For the total number of patches (per issue) versus the
FPI nobmeasurement, we again measured two-sided correla-
tion. Pearson's indicates a marginally larger, positive corre-
lation (r= 0:29;t= 93:45, dof = 93 ;004,p <2:210 16,
95% condence = f0:29;0:30g). Spearman's indicates a
larger, positive correlation ( = 0:45;S= 7:381013,
p<2:210 16).
Our interpretation is that more highly scattered patches
are somewhat more likely to require revision. But is this
eect due to confounding correlation between scattering and
size of the implementation change?
4.5.2 Scattering versus change size
We considered whether there was a correlation between
the scattering measures and the change size measure. For
FPP, Pearson's indicates a middling, positive correlation
(r= 0:48;t= 258:03, dof = 221 ;506,p<2:210 16, 95%
condence =f0:48;0:48g); Spearman's indicates a fairly
high correlation ( = 0:72;S= 5:031014,p<2:210 16).
For MPP, Pearson's indicates a low, positive correlation
(r= 0:19;t= 90:82, dof = 221 ;506,p < 2:210 16,
95% condence = f0:19;0:19g); Spearman's indicates a low-
middle, positive correlation ( = 0:37;S= 1:141015,
p<2:210 16).
There are a number of qualitative points that have to be
considered. We see that, for FPP, Pearson's robtains a
middling value while Spearman's is fairly high. This sug-
gests that there is only a vaguely linear relationship between
FPP and change size. Since it should be self-evident that
as change size grows beyond the size of individual les, the
changes will necessarily become more scattered, and we pos-
tulate that this is the eect witnessed. For MPP however,
change size is much more loosely constrained by the size of
modules, and so we would expect to see a far weaker corre-
lation, which is borne out by the measures.
The third combination, change size versus revision, would
require us to merge the individual patch changes in order to
measure the complete size. As this is a tricky proposition,
we avoid this analysis at present.
4.5.3 Summary
Patches with greater scattering are slightly more likely to
be revised, but the confounding eect of larger changes be-
ing harder to get right brings into question whether there
is a direct eect at work from the presence of crosscutting
concerns. Addressing this point will require future work.FPI CRs

4.6 Is scattering likely to increase after re-
view?
If there were a correlation between initial scattering and the
increase in scattering after review, this would be a signal
that more scattered changes are harder for developers to
cope with and get right.
We examined the number of revised patches for which the
scattering did or did not change. Table 1 overviews the ba-
sic observations on changes to the FPI measures for revised
patches (i.e., the dierence between FPI noband FPI obs,
which we dene as FPI): 34,726 issue reports possess ob-
solete patches (and thus, were revised) out of 93,006 total
issue reports addressed, i.e., 37% required revision upon re-
view. The scattering of the majority (52%) of the revised
patches was the same after the review (FPI nob) as before
(FPI obs).
With respect to FPI, the sets of revised patches for
which scattering increased, for which scattering decreased,
and for which scattering remained constant, all display a
heavy-tailed distribution. Interestingly, for the case where
FPI<0,xmin(see Equation 1 and related discussion) is
about 12; below this, the distribution is rather at, suggest-
ing that scattering has to be fairly high before the review
process reduces the scattering.
As a second step, we examined whether, for revised
patches where the scattering changed, the scattering was
more likely to increase than to decrease.
For each issue with both obsolete and non-obsolete
patches, we counted the number of les unioned over the
obsolete patches and over the non-obsolete patches; we call
these counts nobsandnnobrespectively. We then con-
structed a matrix Min which the i;jth cell counted the
number of patches for which nobs=iandnnob=j; the
diagonal of Mrepresents patches for which no change in
scattering occurred, the upper triangle represents decreased
scattering, and the lower triangle increased scattering. The
matrixMappeared to be asymmetric, skewed signicantly
in favour of a decrease in scattering.
To test this hypothesis, we performed McNemar's 2test
(not to be confused with Pearson's) which determines the
probability that the marginal frequencies are equal (i.e., it
checks whether the matrix deviates from symmetry signi-
cantly). The numerical procedure has problems where the
input matrix is sparse, so we restricted our attention to the
upper left 2424 submatrix; this captured 32,580 of the
issues with revised patches (94% of them) and we treat the
remainder as outliers. McNemar's 2statistic is 782.86, with
276 degrees of freedom, and p <2:210 16. This means
that the null hypothesis|that Mis symmetric|is rejected
in favour of the alternative that is asymmetric.
To get the sense of the degree of asymmetry, we restrict
our attention to only those issues with both obsolete and
non-obsolete patches; we refer to these as the revised issues .
The mean FPP measure over the revised issues, for only
obsolete patches, is 7.09; for only non-obsolete patches, itYear Files MB IRs IRs/le IRs/MB

is 6.58. Hence, the scattering tends to decrease on revision.
By comparison, issues with only non-obsolete patches (i.e.,
non-revised issues) had a smaller mean FPP (3.27).
4.6.1 Summary
We conclude that review usually does not alter the scatter-
ing. In cases when it does, the scattering is slightly more
likely to increase than decrease (54% of the time vs. 46%).
However, overall, the degree of scattering tends to decrease
slightly upon revision.
4.7 Is there evidence of decay?
If patches consistently missed some elements of scattered
concerns, we would expect to see growth in the number of
issue reports as Mozilla increased in bugginess, and hence,
its design decayed.
It is clear that the number of issue reports has grown sig-
nicantly on an annual basis over the lifetime of the Mozilla
project, but so has the size of the system. We attempted to
download the Mozilla codebase at annual snapshots, specif-
ically, for 1 Jan <year>at 00:00:01 Apia time, to represent
the total change over the preceding year.6Table 2 shows
annual counts of les, millions of bytes, and issue reports,
plus issue reports normalized by les and by bytes. Dis-
counting 1999 and 2010 for which only incomplete data was
collected, we do not see an obvious, steady growth in nor-
malized counts of issue reports|Mozilla is not obviously
getting buggier.
More subtle eects may be at play, however. We exam-
ined the proportion of revised patches on an annual basis.
There were clearly start-up eects occurring during the years
1999{2001, and the ratio of issues with obsolete patches to
the total number of issues was very low (0, 0.002, and 0.11
respectively). After this, a steady-state seems to have been
6For the years 1999{2006, this was a straightforward
(though slow) checkout from the main branch of the Mozilla
CVS repository. In early 2007, Mozilla migrated some (but
not all) of its subprojects to a Mercurial repository. It seems
that some of the changes in the Mercurial repository migrate
to the CVS repository for the sake of supporting the remain-
ing subprojects there, but we are unclear whether this is
consistently the case. The distributed nature of Mercurial
makes it very dicult to select a \denitive" version of the
system for any given timestamp. Thus, we report codebase
size as pulled from CVS in all cases, for practicality.reached: the mean ratio for the remaining years is 0.42 (with
a standard deviation of 0.02).
To determine whether the variations are explainable by
random chance, we analyzed the data for non-obsolete
patches on an annual basis and ignored the years 1999{2001
due to the start-up eects. For each of the remaining years,
with respect to the FPI nobmeasure, we collated the prob-
ability mass function ^ p(x) for the data from that year. We
then calculated an average probability mass function ^p(x)
across the years 2002{2010 by taking the mean across all
these years for each discrete value of xand normalizing the
result; ^p(x) served as a model distribution against which
to compare the annual data. We then followed the Monte
Carlo procedure of Clauset et al. (Section 4.4.2) to deter-
mine whether each year's data t ^p(x) better than a syn-
thetic sample randomly drawn from ^p(x).
For each set of annual data for 2002{2010, we generated
1,000 synthetic samples from ^p(x) and compared their KS
statistic to that of the empirical data. The resultant ~ pvalue
was 0 in all cases|a very strong indication that the varia-
tions in the data cannot be explained by random chance.
We then examined the data for trends in the annual vari-
ations, shown in Table 3. After initial startup eects, we
see a clear trend towards higher scattering, as the mean
level of FPI nobincreases steadily though slowly from 2005
through 2010. But we see that the number of issues dealt
with annually increases rapidly: this may either be a sign
that the system's design is decaying (despite the lack of a
strong signal in Table 2) or that its size (and hence, feature
set) is expanding. That a bigger, more complex system has
slightly higher levels of scattering is not surprising.
In order to assess the annual variations, we needed a
means to evaluate the overall annual scatteredness that is
independent from the number of issues addressed. Consider
again that if the exact same distribution t each year's data,
clearly, there would be no change in the (normalized) scat-
teredness of patches, even if the mean (non-normalized) scat-
tering were changing. Since a probability mass function is
necessarily normalized, the number of data points involved
is irrelevant (the gures earlier in the paper were not shown
with normalized axes) and hence we would expect that the
slope would remain constant. On the other hand, if the scat-
teredness is increasing but we hold the number of data points
xed, this will have the eect of spreading the data to the
right, and decreasing the height of the initial peak. For sim-
plicity, we t the power-law distribution to each annual set
of data to suggest its shape. The slope of this data (which is
the negative of the parameter, as per Equation 2) can be
compared across years to determine how the scatteredness
is changing| serves as a relative measure of scatteredness
over whole systems. The fact that a power-law distribution
does not t a data set well is potentially problematic, since
theparameter will then not be a true representation of
the scatteredness in a statistically sound sense, but it will
suce here to indicate trends.
Examining the parameter for each year's best tted
power law, we see a slow decrease from 2005 to 2010. A lower
indicates an increase in issue reports with high FPI nob
measurements relative to issue reports with low FPI nobmea-
surements (i.e., the long-tail is stretching): scattering is get-
ting slowly more pronounced, independently of the growth
in the number of issue reports handled annually. This means
that Mozilla shows minor signs of decay.Year(FPI nob)

5. THREATS TO V ALIDITY
In the Mozilla issue tracking system, developers sometimes
submit patches for more than the issue supposedly being
addressed. Ideally, the project's patch review process would
catch this, but it is not likely to be perfect. Nevertheless,
this phenomenon would have the eect of articially increas-
ingthe scattering of patches, but the impact of scattering
is already low, so this eect can be ignored.
On the other hand, a patch may fail to fully address an
issue, and hence underrepresent the appropriate level of scat-
tering. One would presume that such cases would be caught
when a patch failed to completely address an issue, or else
we would see a steady rise in issue reports independent from
the trends in system size.
Also, the Mozilla codebase is designed for multiple plat-
forms and this results in patches containing les that are
written in multiple programming languages. Most of the
code is written in C++, but there are Javascript and XML
les to support cross-platform compatibility in a clone-like
manner. (We note that such polylingual crosscutting con-
cerns are not refactorable to aspects with current tech-
niques.) Cross-platform support will tend to raise the levels
of scattering, so the observed scattering in the system is
again potentially worse than a monolingual system.
As the system considered in this study is open source,
there are many possible sources of defects including the
complexity of problem domain. The developers' experience
likely varies widely, with contributions arriving daily from
around the world. We expect that developer's experience
with the codebase and the programming language used will
have an impact on the amount of scattering observed.
Our study does not consider factors of developer eort in
coping with more scattered concerns. If scattered concerns
require a disproportionate eort to deal with, we would ex-
pect that developers would do a poorer job with them, lead-
ing to more revision or more issues being reported. Neither
eect is observed.
6. CONCLUSION
We have analyzed the submitted patches for the Mozilla
project over a 10-year period, examining their scatter-
ing properties to consider whether scattering causes evo-
lutionary problems. We found that real crosscutting con-
cerns occur in Mozilla, but that scattering of its patches
forms a continuum: patches are not simply either scat-
tered or not. Thus, there is no natural distinction to be
made between crosscutting concerns and non-crosscutting
concerns|roughly half of the submitted patches show at
least some scattering.
Furthermore, while our measures of scattering take the
form of a heavy-tailed distribution, they fail statistical teststo be a power-law distribution or any other typical candi-
date distributions (the MPP measure is an exception). This
implies that we have no good process models at our disposal
to describe how scattering arises at the le-level in Mozilla,
and hence simple model-based approaches are unlikely to
easily capture the nuances. This also contradicts the com-
mon assumption in the software engineering literature that
heavy-tailed distributions imply power laws.
Patches with greater scattering are slightly more likely to
be revised upon review than not, but the degree of scattering
does not change in the majority of cases upon revision; when
it does, the degree of scattering tends to decrease slightly
on average. This contradicts the prediction derived from as-
pect oriented theory that elements in a scattered concern are
more likely to be overlooked, suggesting that modications
to some elements would likely be added based on review.
While the absolute number of change requests has shown
steady growth for Mozilla, so has the size of the codebase:
normalized counts of issue reports show no obvious growth
pattern suggestive of increasing bugginess. On the other
hand, there is a subtle annual increase of scatteredness of
patches, independent of the growth in issue reports. This
suggests that Mozilla's structure is getting slowly more brit-
tle, but the eect is small. Overall, this contradicts the stan-
dard aspect-oriented theory that any crosscutting concern
will lead to signicant evolutionary problems, and hence
that refactoring to aspect-oriented constructs is warranted.
One issue that our study has not addressed is whether
particular kinds of crosscutting concerns cause problems, as
some of the literature has suggested. If such crosscutting
concerns are in the minority within Mozilla, their eects may
be washed out in our analyses. Future work will need to at-
tempt to distinguish dierent kinds of crosscutting concerns
within a system like Mozilla to examine if these are more
consistently or severely problematic.
The case for aspect orientation rests on the assumption
that crosscutting concerns will cause signicant evolution-
ary problems. Our results on Mozilla appear to contra-
dict this assumption. Of course, Mozilla is only a single
system|a single, open-source, massive, heavily used, and
long-lived system containing a wide variety of features com-
monly pointed to as archetypes for crosscutting concerns. If
the results were not to generalize, there would have to be
something special and important about Mozilla or the pro-
cesses used in its development, warranting close study as a
potential alternative to the explicit separation of crosscut-
ting concerns.
