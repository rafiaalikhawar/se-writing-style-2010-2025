ABSTRACT
When developers join a software development project, they ﬁnd
themselves in a project landscape, and they must become familiar
with the various landscape features. To better understand the natureof project landscapes and the integration process, with a view to im-proving the experience of both newcomers and the people responsi-ble for orienting them, we performed a grounded theory study with18 newcomers across 18 projects. We identiﬁed the main featuresthat characterize a project landscape, together with key orientationaids and obstacles, and we theorize that there are three primaryfactors that impact the integration experience of newcomers: earlyexperimentation, internalizing structures and cultures, and progressvalidation.

1. INTRODUCTION
Software developers working on a project effectively inhabit a
project landscape . They are familiar with its features, such as the
product architecture, the team communication strategies and the de-velopment process, and they know the shortcuts and the commonly-traveled paths. Newcomers are explorers who must orient them-selves within an unfamiliar landscape. As they gain experience,they eventually settle in and create their own places within thelandscape. Like explorers of the natural landscape, they encountermany obstacles, such as culture shock or getting lost without help.
We conducted a qualitative study to better understand what proj-
ect landscapes look like and how newcomers explore them. Think-ing of a project as a landscape, and integration of newcomers asthe process of settling into that landscape, changes what we per-ceive to be important and helps us see new ways of aiding new-comers. From a newcomer’s perspective, it emphasizes the pro-

time. From the perspective of someone helping newcomers set-tle in, the landscape metaphor reveals the need to show them thecommonly-traversed routes, to help them learn to interpret aspectsof the landscape unique to the project, and to introduce them to thecustoms of the people who inhabit the landscape. It also suggeststhat if the community wants to be welcoming to newcomers, theyneed to be tolerant of cultural faux-pas, be sensitive to mis-stepscaused by a newcomer’s lack of understanding, take the time tounderstand why newcomers get lost in their landscape, add readily-interpretable signposts and move them as things change. Such sign-posts are especially important at cross-roads—places with choiceswhere others have tended to get lost. Identifying what counts as across-roads and what characterizes the parts of a project that needsignposts can be aided by studies such as that presented here.
Speciﬁcally, we were interested in answering three main research
questions: what are the key, prominent features in a project land-scape, what orientation obstacles do new team members face, andwhat orientation aids can be provided? We interviewed 18 develop-ers and team leaders across 18 projects at IBM during the last yearto answer these questions.
Following these interviews, we theorized that there are three
main factors that impact how newcomers settle into a project land-scape: early experimentation, internalizing structures and cultures,
and progress validation. We also identiﬁed the landscape features
that newcomers learned while moving into new project landscapesand we observed how the features facilitated or hindered the new-comers’ integration. When we presented the results of our study toseven of the participants, they all agreed that the factors accuratelyrepresented their experiences as newcomers and that application ofour ﬁndings would have eased their integration.
In the past, studies on project integration have been performed
with new employees joining their ﬁrst software development proj-ects [2, 15]. Because these studies were performed with junior andrecently-hired developers, many of the difﬁculties they encounteredrelated to the newness of the corporate culture and the differencebetween academic and industrial environments. We were interestedin understanding speciﬁcally the project landscape, independentlyof the circumstances related to the ﬁrst-time transition of personnelinto an industry environment. To this end, we focused this studyon developers with varying degrees of experience in the ﬁeld andwithin their company who were joining on-going projects in thecompany. We reported preliminary results at a workshop [6].
The contributions of this paper include a theory, grounded in em-
pirical data, of how newcomers integrate into a project landscape,and a characterization of project landscapes as seen by newcomers.The landscape features identiﬁed are well known; the contributionin this area is the empirical evidence of their impact on integration.
275We begin by summarizing the method we used to perform this
study, in Section 2. We characterize project landscapes by present-
ing the main features and their roles in the integration of newcomersin Section 3, and describe the three factors impacting the integra-tion of newcomers in Section 4. We present how we evaluated thecredibility and quality of our results in Section 5, then cover therelated work in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.
2. METHOD
2.1 Grounded Theory
We based our study on grounded theory as described by Corbin
and Strauss [4]. Grounded theory is a qualitative research approach
that employs theoretical sampling and open coding to formulate a
social theory “grounded” in the empirical data. Grounded theoryis well suited to an exploratory study like ours because it involvesstarting from general research questions and reﬁning the questions,and the instruments, as the study progresses. For example, as op-posed to traditional sampling techniques (e.g., random sampling),grounded theory involves reﬁning the sampling criteria through-out the course of the study to ensure that the selected participantsare able to answer new questions that have been formulated. Inour study, analysis of the data, collected through interviews, wasperformed using open coding: we assigned codes to sentences orparagraphs and we deﬁned them as the study progressed. We thenused axial coding: we went through the codes and linked them tocategories usually found in a grounded theory study [5, p.161]: fac-tors, context (aids and obstacles in our study), and consequences.Finally, the goal of a grounded theory study is to produce a the-ory, i.e., a coherent set of hypotheses in the context of a process,that originates from empirical data. Because the use of groundedtheory is relatively recent in software engineering [7], we brieﬂyhighlight in Section 5 the criteria that are generally used in otherﬁelds to evaluate the quality of such studies.
2.2 Data Collection
We started this study by sending an informal survey to the IBM
QSE (Quality of Software Engineering) mailing list. We askedwhat mechanisms currently exist in IBM to introduce employeesto software projects. Nineteen managers, directors, and architectsresponded and mentioned a wide variety of mechanisms (e.g., men-tor, document repository, wiki) and problems (e.g., newcomers mustlearn on their own). Following this survey, we focused our effortson experienced software developers joining ongoing projects.
We used three instruments to collect data about the integration
experiences of newcomers. First, we sent a short questionnaire topotential participants asking about their projects (e.g., project ageand type, when they joined the project, frequency of team meetings)and their level of experience (e.g., time at IBM, programming expe-rience). The responses helped us select the participants who wouldbe most likely to provide answers to our questions as they becamemore precise. We then asked each selected participant to draw asketch of their project such as could be used to introduce anotherdeveloper, with similar skills, to the key aspects of the participant’sjob. This sketch made the participant think about their project andprepared them for the third instrument, a one-hour semi-structuredphone interview. Most of the questions were initially derived fromthe results of our informal survey. At the end of the interview, weasked the participant to describe their sketch, effectively walkingus through their project landscape. We also used the sketch to elicitspeciﬁc answers (e.g., why did you draw the release schedule?).
In accordance with the grounded theory approach, all instru-
ments evolved as the study progressed. For example, our inter-IBM Proj. IBM Proj.

Table 1: Participants
view guide contained eight general questions, such as “What wasyour ﬁrst day’s experience like?” and “Can you describe some spe-ciﬁc examples that show how you found what you needed to getstarted on the project.” As we learned more about the various is-sues participants encountered, we modiﬁed the general questionsand appended more speciﬁc questions.
Participants and Projects. Most of our participants were experi-
enced developers who had recently joined an ongoing project (at
least 6 months old). These selection criteria resulted from the ﬁrstfour interviews, where we learned that developers new to IBM wereunsuitable for this study because they focused on organizationalrather than project-speciﬁc issues, and new projects were unsuit-able for this study because they were in the process of formingtheir project landscapes. The participants were recruited from awide variety of sources, ensuring a broad spectrum of participants.The intent of this study was to look for similarities across the sam-ple, not differences between sub-groups. Almost all the newcomerswe approached were eager to participate and were interested in theresults, providing anecdotal evidence of the importance of projectintegration issues.
A beneﬁt of the grounded theory approach is that by forming
our selection criteria as we went, we were able to focus on a nar-rower set of research questions, purposely leaving other importantquestions for future work. In developing this focus, we could thenensure that future interviews covered a wide variety of participantsand projects, allowing us to uncover aspects of a project landscapethat were not speciﬁc to just one type of project or participant.
Table 1 shows that our 18 participants (3 women and 15 men)
and projects exhibited great variability with respect to IBM experi-ence, project age, and product type. We focused on developers, butalso interviewed two team leads and one test lead. Our participantshad all joined their projects in the prior 1 to 12 months, except forone team lead who had joined his project two years earlier. Mostparticipants were in teams developing products, but one worked onbuilding a custom application for a customer. Most team mem-bers were collocated, though almost all projects were distributed tosome degree. Participants came from eight countries on three con-tinents: North America (13), Europe (3), and Asia (2). The numberof developers per team ranged from 4 to 80. All participants weretold that their answers would be reported only in aggregated form.
2.3 Analysis
Each interview was transcribed, and then coded several times by
one author. Eventually, the codes were associated with categoriesprescribed by grounded theory (factors, context, consequences) andemerging categories (e.g., the landscape features). The results ofeach interview were discussed with the other authors, who jointlyidentiﬁed the concepts worth investigating. At the end of our study,we also listed the landscape features drawn in each sketch. Wefound that the features drawn in the sketch were almost always
276the same as those mentioned in the interview; the list of the most
commonly-drawn features thus conﬁrmed our interview ﬁndings.
2.4 Evaluation
Following our analysis, we re-interviewed some participants to
validate our ﬁndings. We checked whether our ﬁndings resonatedwith the participants’ experiences, and whether they were helpfuland presented at the appropriate abstraction level: not so speciﬁc asto match only one participant and not so general as to be useless anduninteresting. Due to time constraints, we could only re-interviewseven participants. We randomly selected participants from threecategories of newcomers: two junior (<=1 year of IBM experience),three senior (>1 year of IBM experience), and two team leads. Thecategories ensured that we would validate our ﬁndings with a rep-resentative sample of participants, and the random sampling de-creased potential investigator bias in the evaluation. We sent a two-page document presenting our ﬁndings to each participant and weasked open-ended questions regarding their experiences with re-spect to our ﬁndings. The seven participants found our ﬁndings tobe helpful and representative of their experiences (see Section 5).
3. PROJECT LANDSCAPE FEATURES
Interviewing newcomers whose integration experiences were still
fresh in their minds allowed us to identify the key landscape fea-tures they had to learn, the key orientation aids they used, and thekey obstacles they encountered. Features repeatedly encounteredby newcomers probably include the major features in the land-scapes. Knowing the effect of these features on the newcomers’integration experiences can also lead to the establishment of betterorientation aids and reduction of obstacles.
We summarize the importance of the landscape features, aids and
obstacles on the integration of newcomers in Table 2. Features arelisted at the left, grouped into categories discussed below. For eachfeature, the next two columns show the number of participants whodrew that feature in their sketches and who referred to it as im-portant in their interviews. Because our questions evolved as thestudy progressed, these numbers should not be interpreted as thefrequency with which these features were encountered by partici-
pants. A quantitative study with a larger sample would be a naturalstep to evaluate the importance of the features, aids and obstacles.
Additional columns show orientation aids and obstacles, grouped
according to the integration factors described in Section 4. Only themost important aids and obstacles we encountered are shown in thetable and discussed in the text. The entries in these columns show(1) which aids helped and (2) which obstacles hindered learningabout features, and, conversely, which features (3) contributed toorientation aids, facilitating the integration experience, or (4) con-tributed to obstacles, hindering the experience. An example of (1)is that the second aid, walkthroughs, helped newcomers learn aboutthe low-level design and runtime behavior of their product, amongother things. An example of (3) is that the development processesof some teams prescribed daily meetings, which, in turn, helpednewcomers learn about the role and expertise of their colleagues,among other things. Many of the interactions shown in the tableare described in the text, but not all, due to space constraints.
We brieﬂy explain the role of each landscape feature in the in-
tegration of newcomers in the rest of this section, and we providefurther insight into how the orientation aids and obstacles are re-lated to the three integration factors in Section 4.
3.1 Product
The product being produced is central to the project landscape.
Interestingly, however, only a single feature of the product, low-level design and runtime behavior, generally played a crucial rolein the integration of the newcomers; the other aspects were learnedrelatively easily or did not signiﬁcantly affect integration.
Software Architecture. Newcomers sought to understand the ar-
chitecture mostly to get a broader view of their project, rather than
because their tasks impacted or were directly impacted by the ar-chitecture. Without a good understanding of the architecture it washard for newcomers to determine where their tasks ﬁtted in thebroader product and if their changes were compliant with the ex-isting architecture. Teams tried to help participants understand thearchitecture by having a team member present an overview of thearchitecture within the ﬁrst few days of their integration, but it wasonly through exploration, i.e., questions, technical meetings andexperimentation, that newcomers ﬁnally understood this feature.
Low-level Design and Runtime Behavior. The majority of tasks
given to newcomers dealt with the intricacies of the low-level de-
sign and the runtime behavior of particular components of the prod-uct. Newcomers had to learn this feature to ensure that they under-stood the impact and correctness of changes they made. Unfor-tunately, this feature was often the least documented, not even asimple overview was available, so newcomers had to ask technicalquestions, actively search for code examples, and rely on trial anderror, a time-consuming activity.
Design and Implementation Rationale. Newcomers who had to
ﬁx bugs or modify or use legacy code whose authors were no longer
available sought to understand the rationale behind the code by ask-ing questions. For example, a colleague of participant P14
1told
him that the bug report he was working on was an intentional bug:the feature had been implemented that way to comply with a stan-dard. The issue tracking system of teams having a strict procedurefor issue management was helpful for recovering design rationale.
Product/Domain. Newcomers were usually able to do their tasks
without a complete understanding of the requirements in the prod-
uct’s domain. Nonetheless, newcomers who did not know the do-main before joining their team reported that greater understandingled to feelings of comfort and conﬁdence that they were doing theirjob efﬁciently and properly. These newcomers sought to acquire adeeper understanding of the domain by reading documentation andsearching for learning material, but did not always succeed.
Technologies Used. Newcomers learned about technologies used
in their project (e.g., programming language, libraries) in a variety
of ways, such as reading books or reference manuals or browsingtutorials and code examples. Only one participant mentioned thathe needed a course to learn about a technology. In general, partic-ipants did not encounter signiﬁcant difﬁculties while learning newtechnologies, thanks to their previous experience and education, anobservation that corroborates Begel and Simon’s ﬁndings [2].
3.2 Processes and Practices.
The processes and practices adopted by the team to build a prod-
uct affect how newcomers explore the project landscape and deter-mine the characteristics of the trails left by the team members.
Development Process. All our participants belonged to agile teams
with iterations consisting of activities such as planning, coding, and
testing. Newcomers needed to learn the speciﬁcs of the process tobetter understand the expected outcomes (e.g., a beta release) andhow they would achieve them (e.g., one day of planning, a certainnumber of weeks on development and the last two weeks on test-ing). Newcomers also needed to learn which step in the process

their team was working on to understand how sensitive their work
was, and the motivation behind certain tasks (e.g., why are we test-ing now?). Although newcomers learned about the speciﬁcs of theprocess mostly by participating in, or observing, the planning ofcurrent and subsequent iterations, newcomers like participant P12noted that: “for the process, it would have been useful to have ahalf-hour [at the beginning] to just explain that up front... I learnedas I was going, which is not as easy as I think having it initially.”
Task Process. Each team has a particular way of performing cod-
ing tasks and some teams even have different coding processes and
inter-team dependencies for different parts of the product. For ex-ample, P5 mentioned that the tools used for testing and issue man-agement and the person performing the code review depended onthe parts of the system she was working on. Newcomers beneﬁtedfrom their previous experience as software developers to learn theirway around the task process, but as P5 said, guided exploration wasoften the most efﬁcient orientation aid: “They started me out [witha] small coaching: ‘... You’re going to make this change; this ishow you’re going to test it; These are the tools that you’re going toneed.’ She sat down with me and she helped me work through.”
Development Environment and Tools. Installing and conﬁgur-
ing the development environment often caused newcomers to get
lost and it also slowed the progress of the newcomers in learningabout the product. Tools unique to the team posed particular is-sues, especially when there was little documentation or help avail-able, because the newcomers had to rely on trial and error to learnthem. Waiting time before getting a fully-working development en-vironment ranged from one week to two months and reasons variedwidely: a long time to get purchase authorization or the proper cre-dentials, severely outdated and incomplete installation documenta-tion, and conﬁguration problems. “I lost like a week or so, but Ithink it is the time that it takes when you don’t know [how] to dothe conﬁguration. ... It was confusing, but not difﬁcult” [P6]. Dif-ﬁculties learning this feature were eased when a colleague servedas a guide to the installation of the tools, or there were up to dateinstructions or the tools were already set up for the newcomers.
Software Conﬁguration Management. Source control was cou-
pled with issue management in seven projects and newcomers had
to learn both systems concurrently, both how to use them and whatthe associated team policies were. The amount of coupling var-ied from informal conventions (e.g., provide the bug number in thecommit comment) to tool-supported coupling (e.g., every commitmust be associated with a documented issue through the develop-ment environment). Tool-supported coupling and strict issue man-agement policies provided useful trails that contributed valuable in-formation to help newcomers learn about the other features of thelandscape (e.g., implementation rationale of a method explained ina bug report). Newcomers beneﬁted from their previous experiencefor the general usage of the SCM systems and generally learned thespeciﬁcs for their projects during their ﬁrst tasks.
2783.3 Team
The inhabitants of a project landscape have various roles and
communicate in ways that are speciﬁc to their project. Newcomers
must learn about the inhabitants and discover the most efﬁcient wayof getting information and help from them.
Roles and Expertise. In the projects we studied, newcomers sought
to learn three dimensions of the roles and expertise of their col-
leagues: (1) seniority, (2) components for which responsible, and(3) technical ﬁelds in which expert (e.g., web client or modelingtechnologies). Understanding this feature is important as newcom-ers need to determine who to ask and who to trust. As P6 said: “Itdepends who you ask and what you ask. ... For example, if I willask something about the architecture of the project and I go withwith the guy that is experienced in Java, then I will have lost anhour trying to explain what I’m asking, ... what I need from him.”
Formal Meetings. The frequency and type of meetings held by the
team is determined by the development process and the team cul-
ture. For example, the scrum agile methodology prescribes dailymeetings, whereas P15’s team held only one-way formal meetingswhere the team members would report their progress to the man-ager to update the schedule. Five participants told us that it was intheir ﬁrst team meetings that they learned more about the roles oftheir colleagues (who answered what questions) and the develop-ment process. The form of these meetings makes a big differenceto how helpful they are to newcomers; meetings that consisted onlyof team members reporting on their progress or answering ques-tions from the client, without being allowed to answer questionsfrom other developers, were unhelpful. On the other hand, scrummeetings where newcomers could ask questions and get proactivesuggestions based on their progress reports were very helpful.
Communication Strategies. Many communication strategies were
used by teams, including live or phone communication, email and
instant messaging. Each team favored one or more in particular.For example, P12 asked most of his questions to his mentor in per-son, whereas P18 used mostly instant messaging for questions.
Communication strategies inﬂuence the richness of the interac-
tion between newcomers and their team members. Participants whoused live or phone communication reported in several instances thatthey received additional useful information beyond what they hadasked for. P5 learned more by visiting her colleague’s ofﬁce thanby asking a question over instant messaging: “I just tried talking topeople [about the books they use], visiting in their ofﬁces. I alsotake a quick look to see what kind of references they have and so,that’s how I found out. And I ask their opinion about those books.”
Assistance/Mentoring Culture. Teams with a proactive approach
to mentoring and assisting newcomers make integration easier. For
example, is was easier to settle in when existing team membersanswered the questions of the newcomers and frequently enquiredabout their progress, assigned a mentor or a “buddy” to the new-comers, and walked the newcomers through their ﬁrst tasks. Teamsthat wait for the newcomer to generate and ask questions make itharder to quickly feel at home. Unsurprisingly, we found this land-scape feature to be the most inﬂuential in how pleasant and efﬁcientthe integration experience was for the newcomer.
Physical Layout. Is the team collocated? If so, does the team work
in cubicles, shared ofﬁces, or private ofﬁces? Collocated teams
showed evidence of presenting a richer communication channel, asexperienced by P5, quoted above. Three other participants sharedan ofﬁce with their mentor or buddy, and they all reported askingquestions in person, beneﬁting from the richness of this channel.3.4 Documentation
The many types of documents produced during the life-time of a
project can help newcomers learn about the project landscape.
Developer-Oriented Documentation. Developer-oriented docu-
mentation encodes the knowledge of the team, such as the low-level
design of the project, and the installation, conﬁguration, testing andbuild procedures. Without such documentation, the knowledge re-mains tacit, and newcomers must rely on other means to obtain it(e.g., communication with team members or trial and error). Whilethis feature of the project landscape should provide a map for new-comers, we found that it often fails to include the appropriate levelof detail, such as design, examples and rationale. With such de-tails, this documentation is very valuable to newcomers, even if notcompletely up to date.
Learning Material. Learning material, such as courses or presen-
tations, was useful to newcomers, but only when it addressed con-
cepts relevant to their tasks (e.g., code structure) and when it wasimmediately applicable, so they would not forget it. Three partici-pants said that they would have liked some time to review learningmaterial once they had acquired more hands-on experience withtheir project to get a deeper understanding of the product.
Repository, Indexes, and Search Capability. The documents in a
project are stored in one or many repositories (e.g., network folder,
teamroom, collaborative web site, version control system), withdiffering access permissions. Developers often put documents intheir personal space or in the code repository. The indexing andsearch capabilities of repositories vary, but they are usually limitedto searching based on title and keywords within a single repository.
3.5 Context
A project landscape is part of a broader context, and, as partic-
ipant P2 said, newcomers seek to understand how their project ﬁts“in the big picture”.
Organization. A project landscape is part of a software com-
pany, an organization within the company, and a physical location.
At IBM, the integration of newcomers is not standardized acrossthe various organizations and the amount and quality of resourcesavailable to newcomers vary considerably. For example, P16 had toattend to a two-week course, but P3 joined his team on the ﬁrst day.Participants new to the organization all reported that it slowed theirinitial experimentation, because they had to ﬁnd their way aroundthe organization ﬁrst (e.g., administrative rules and policies).
Inter-Team Organization. At IBM, many teams typically con-
tribute to a product, and newcomers sought to understand the orga-
nization of the teams to get a more complete view of their projector to determine their own responsibilities. For example, newcom-ers wanted to know which team owned which component, whatcode the newcomer could change, who to ask questions about thecode, or who was using the code the newcomer was writing (im-pact management). Understanding the responsibility of their teamin relation to the responsibilities of other teams in the organizationhelped newcomers understand the scope of their jobs.
4. INTEGRATION FACTORS
Further analysis and categorization of the orientation aids and
obstacles for each of the landscape features encountered by thenewcomers suggests a theory about project integration. It holdsthat three interacting factors primarily account for how, and howeffectively, newcomers settle into a project landscape.
First, through early experimentation with small, product-related
tasks, newcomers experience the project landscape directly and get
279a glimpse of the tacit knowledge shared by team members. This
prepares them for further exploration, and provides them with thepractical context needed to gain an understanding of complex land-scape features.
Second, by gradually internalizing the various structures and
cultures within the project landscape, newcomers can navigate more
efﬁciently and begin to make signiﬁcant contributions that betterdeﬁne their roles in the project. Because knowledge about thestructures and cultures is often tacit, newcomers must rely on land-scape features such as rich communication with team members orthe trails and signposts left by them, such as detailed source andbug history and code examples.
Finally, frequent progress validation allows newcomers and their
colleagues to check that the newcomers are proceeding in the rightdirection, are becoming more efﬁcient, and are not about to getstuck or lost. Good progress validation makes the difference be-tween newcomers who get stuck for long periods of time and new-comers who do not hesitate to ask questions.
These three factors continue to impact newcomers until they are
fully settled in the project landscape. Our participants consideredthemselves fully integrated once they had gone through most of thephases in the development process and made a signiﬁcant changeto the project landscape, such as adding an important feature orimproving the team’s communication structure.
2At the end of the
study, we judged that 12 of the 18 participants had efﬁcient (e.g.,using cost-effective learning strategies) and pleasant (no unneces-sary stress) experiences settling into their project landscapes.
Table 2 shows the orientation aids and obstacles related to each
integration factor, and hence the landscape features that were im-portant for each factor. Four of the orientation aids mentioned bynewcomers seemed to be crucial to their integration: previous expe-rience, examples, mentor and questions to colleagues. These relateto all three factors, and are shown as cross-factor aids in the table.For example, mentors often guided newcomers through the code toget them started, answered their questions about structures and cul-tures, and enquired regularly about their progress. We hypothesizethat these aids are particularly important precisely because they arerelated to all three integration factors. These four aids are men-tioned throughout the following sections on the integration factors.
4.1 Early Experimentation
When we asked participants what information was the most valu-
able in bringing them up to speed, half of them replied similarlyto P1: “For me, it’s really being able to compile your sourcesto run the product ... from that point on, you can easily try tochange things yourself, get some experience.” Participants saidthey learned more efﬁciently by experimenting with the code thanby attending courses or reading documentation. This comes as nosurprise: it is common knowledge that the best way to learn abouta physical landscape is to experience it, and researchers have foundthat experience and mistakes provide the basis for efﬁcient learningin adult education [10]. Early experimentation led to early feedbackby team members, an aid that was especially necessary in softwaredevelopment projects because the landscape was constantly chang-ing and the learning material and aids became outdated quickly,issues not speciﬁcally addressed in adult education theories.
We found evidence that it is possible to deliver code and con-
tribute to the project very early in the integration. For example,P11 committed a bug ﬁx at the end of his ﬁrst day, and P14 submit-ted a bug ﬁx during his ﬁrst week even though he had had no prior
2In some contexts, developers are not expected to make signiﬁcant
changes to the structure of their projects. That was not the case for
the participants in our study, however.experience with the development environment or the programming
language. Newcomers used code and design examples to guidetheir exploration, and said that these helped them to learn aboutnew technologies and their product, and to accomplish their tasks.They found examples mostly in the product’s code and by search-ing the web. They typically copied example code and modiﬁed it.
Early experimentation rarely lasted more than two weeks, but it
made the difference between successful exploration with strong re-lationships and initial feedback, and a solitary journey ﬁxing com-pilation errors and reading mostly unhelpful documentation. How-ever, we observed that applying this principle is challenging in soft-ware development projects because of various obstacles (see Sec-tion 3.2).
General Directions vs. Concrete Exploration. As discussed in
Section 3.4, attending courses and reading general documentation
up front are seldom ideal. There are exceptions. Courses wereappropriate for P6, who could not experiment without backgroundtraining because he knew nothing about the problem domain orthe
programming paradigm. Reviewing documentation before startingwork on code was also helpful to P17, because the documentationpresented both high-level and low-level details of the product, in-cluding code and extension examples. However, all too often new-comers were pointed towards this kind of general documentationfor the wrong reasons: the manager believed that it was the mostappropriate learning activity, the team had not prepared for the par-ticipant’s ﬁrst days with them, or the newcomer could not experi-ment with the code (e.g., waiting for access authorization).
In contrast, newcomers assigned to code-oriented tasks on their
ﬁrst day oriented themselves more quickly, because they immedi-ately started learning about landscape features such as the low-leveldesign and the task process. This naturally sparked questions, lead-ing to further learning. Examples of tasks appropriate for a new-comer were ﬁxing a bug, adding a simple feature, and writing unittests. For junior developers, or when the team was in the midst ofa critical life-cycle phase, a small programming project outside theteam’s direct development path was best.
Initial Guidance. The development environment is a key land-
scape feature, but newcomers often struggled to get to the point
where they could use it to perform even a simple task, as reportedin Section 3.2. Having a team member act as a guide can reducethe newcomer’s wasted time and frustration. We encountered threetypes of walkthroughs: (1) installing the development environmentand compiling the product’s code, (2) providing an overview ofthe code, and (3) performing a complete task. The walkthrough ofparticipant P14 was particularly efﬁcient: “On the ﬁrst day of theproject I had a meeting with the team members where I was giveninstructions on where to go, how to download the source code andhow to get it set up, how to test the product.”
When newcomers talked about walkthroughs, it became clear
that no tool or map could replace the richness of information pro-vided by a human guide. Walkthroughs were good occasions forcolleagues to provide tips and tricks and answer questions, and theyalso helped to build relationships with newcomers. We believe thattools that help with exploration of the project landscape can com-plement, but should not replace, human guides.
Early Feedback. When newcomers experimented early with the
product’s code in the context of a task, their exploration had a well-
deﬁned goal so they could quickly report on their progress and getfeedback, a relationship that we explore more deeply in Section 4.3.This feedback was essential in correcting small mistakes that couldhave blocked progress. For example, once P12 realized that hecould not complete the test case he had been assigned, he imme-
280diately mentioned it to his mentor, who found that the test case
document was outdated and corrected it. Newcomers who wereprevented from experimenting with the system early on also missedopportunities to ask questions and get early feedback during teammeetings, as they tended only to listen.
4.2 Internalizing Structures and Cultures
Once newcomers had performed some early experimentation,
they began to internalize the structures and cultures within the proj-ect landscape by acquiring a deeper understanding of the tacit knowl-edge of their team about the product and the organization (Sec-tions 3.1 and 3.5), and to build stronger relationships with the team(Section 3.3). Newcomers who had done this successfully felt thatthey could handle most tasks with conﬁdence, even if they did notknow everything about their project. P17 said: “I think I know,maybe ﬁve percent of the product. I can adapt and learn it and Iknow how it works overall. And when I have a bug, I know whereto look and what to do. And if there is a feature, I know where toimplement it.” In contrast, the newcomers who struggled the mostto internalize the structures and cultures of their projects had themost unpleasant integration experiences. Whenever a new task wasassigned they felt totally lost and unable to ﬁnd their bearings. Forexample, P6 was assigned a critical task two months after he joinedhis team and, at the time of the interview, he had no idea how longit would take or how he would be able to complete the task.
Internalizing the structures and cultures took considerable time
and effort, and newcomers were generally less supported in theirlong-term learning activities than in their early experimentation.Although developers, in general, are expected to learn by them-selves, we found that small aids, such as technical meetings andgood examples, could make the learning process more efﬁcient.
Tacit Knowledge. Internalization of structures and cultures is par-
ticularly challenging because much of the knowledge that must be
acquired is not recorded explicitly. We found two orientation aidsthat, coupled with trial and error, most helped newcomers with this.
The ﬁrst orientation aid was the trails left by team members as
they traversed the landscape as part of their regular work. Thesetrails were captured in a detailed bug and source history. Newcom-
ers used these to recover the design rationale of particular piecesof code by looking at the bugs and the associated source ﬁles anddiscussions. Newcomers like P1 also used the trails left by teammembers to locate feature implementations: “... seeing the bugsthat are closed so you can see the corresponding changes to it. Thatalready gives you quite a bit so you see, okay this bug is about thatfeature, you have a look at the source corresponding that gives youan easy start to ﬁnd out where are things located.”
Unfortunately, issue tracking systems could not support the in-
vestigation of newcomers when the descriptions of bugs and ﬁxeswere trivial (e.g., “Bug Fixed”) or when the issue tracking systemdid not link the issues to the code changes. Issue tracking systemswere also less useful for newcomers who had to create new featuresor who had complete code examples available.
Another aid to the acquisition of tacit knowledge was technical
meetings between newcomers and their colleagues to discuss the
project structures. Participant P3 found these meetings to be thefastest and the best source of information: “[My mentor] invited usin one of those rooms, showing us, ... the most common scenariosfor the clients... So she [went] through every single button, what itdoes. We asked questions, and stuff like that. She showed us thesource code ...” P12 had informal meetings with his mentor whenshe came by his desk to answer questions; she would often not justanswer the questions, but also walk P12 through the solution andlook at the current code to give pointers. Successful meetings hadthree characteristics in common: (1) they happened frequently (atleast once a week), (2) they were related to the current tasks of thenewcomers, who could then use their newly-acquired knowledgeimmediately, and (3) newcomers could ask questions.
Timing. The order in which newcomers encountered resources
(e.g., documents, courses) or performed tasks largely determined
their usefulness. P11: “... it’s possible someone explained [the ar-chitecture] to me very well on the ﬁrst day; but without having toomuch of a context to put it in, it didn’t really hit home until later...Someone says, ‘Oh yeah, we provide the services’, but really, whenthey say the word ‘services,’ it didn’t really link in my mind withthis particular IT service, Java interface and that’s what they’re talk-ing about. So maybe if instead of getting this information on theﬁrst day, I got it a week or two later, ... it would have connected inmy mind with a lot of things I’d already seen and made more of animpact.”
Technical meetings also had to be properly timed, since some
questions arose only later in the integration experience. For exam-ple, P15 attended many architectural meetings early on and couldwatch recordings of them later, but he eventually had many unan-swered questions, by which time team members who could haveanswered them had moved to another project.
Because the correct timing of the orientation resources seemed
to depend on many variables (e.g., previous experience, learningcapacity, complexity of the project, quality of the resources), webelieve that the best way to get it right is to encourage frequentprogress validation. If the team is well aware of the progress of thenewcomer, it should be able to recommend the pertinent resourcesat the right times. We explore this factor in Section 4.3
Relationships. Newcomers sought to build strong relationships
with team members. Additionally, newcomers learned about the
interests and expertise of their colleagues to know where to directquestions (i.e., who knows what) and who to trust.
All four newcomers who were working remotely voiced their
concern about not being able to build strong relationships with theircolleagues. Physically meeting colleagues and frequently commu-nicating with them was key to building relationships in distributedteams. For example, P1 and P7 mentioned that they could reallystart to work and learn about their product once they had met theircolleagues in person. In contrast, because of travel budget cuts,participant P14 never met his colleagues in person, which he saidhindered the building of durable relationships.
4.3 Progress Validation
Throughout early experimentation and internalizing the struc-
tures and cultures of their projects, newcomers needed to validatetheir progress, to avoid going too far in the wrong direction or beingimmobilized, not knowing how to proceed. Frequent progress val-idation created an environment where newcomers were at ease toask questions and were encouraged to report on their progress. Allnewcomers told us that they preferred to try to resolve issues andﬁnd answers to their questions on their own ﬁrst, but newcomerslike P12, who were on teams employing frequent progress valida-tion, had a pragmatic approach to problem solving: “So it dependswhat I’m working on and the progress I’m making that’ll help medetermine when it’s time to ask somebody or when I should keeplooking. I think you get to a point where you’re just wasting timeand so it’s better in that case just to ask for help.” In contrast, par-ticipants like P11, who were in teams with less progress validation,tried as hard as they could to answer a question before asking acolleague: “I tried to answer by myself as much as I could. I thinkI would always try to at least ‘bang my head’ against the questionfor a little while before I went to a colleague just because even if I
281couldn’t get the answer, the act of trying to get the answer myself
was good learning experience”. These newcomers would typicallystay stuck on a problem for a few hours to a few days.
Frequent progress validation also increased the occasions to re-
ceive proactive suggestions or useful shortcuts. Newcomers appre-ciated these pointers more than the pointers that were presenteden masse in a document or meeting at the beginning of their inte-
gration. Participants without frequent progress validation and suchproactive suggestions had problems because they missed importantinformation they did not know they had to know. Lack of progressvalidation during sensitive tasks also exacerbated these problems.
We found two types of progress validation aids: feedback from
the team and mechanisms allowing newcomers to validate theirown progress.
Team Feedback. Newcomers frequently asked questions to vali-
date their progress. For example, P18 asked questions of his col-
league to ensure that he was following the release process correctly.Newcomers asked many questions about issues that hindered theirprogress: documentation that looked outdated, incorrect behaviorof the product, error messages, etc. Participants P16 and P12 alsomentioned that sometimes, when they asked a question, their col-leagues would enquire about their progress.
Daily scrum meetings were effective for progress validation. Par-
ticipant P2 said: “We had these daily scrums and we would basi-cally say, ‘What are you doing, what are you working on, what didyou do yesterday? Did you have any road blocks or anything, isthere anything that anybody knows about that can help me or con-tribute?”’ Daily meetings ensured that newcomers would not staystuck on a problem for more than a day. They were thus beneﬁ-cial to newcomers who hesitated to ask for help or who tried tosolve problems on their own for too long. Because newcomers alsoreported what they were about to do, team members could pro-vide proactive comments. Finally, because all members reportedon their progress, newcomers learned more about the roles and ex-pertise of their colleagues.
Newcomers who submitted code and design for review found
this progress validation practice useful for two main reasons: con-ﬁdence that what they had done was correct, and pointers and hintson how to better use the product’s code. Newcomers thus discov-ered unexplored but relevant parts of the landscape.
In certain conditions, however, code reviews in particular and
feedback in general were not helpful and could even be frustrat-ing for newcomers. For example, P14’s code was sometimes re-viewed by colleagues who were strong-minded and would only ac-cept code that was similar to the code they had in mind; these re-views involved a lot of rework, yet P14 believed that his solutionwas equivalent to that proposed by the reviewers. P7 was merelytold to “read the book.” Regular meetings in some teams were notuseful to newcomers because the newcomers only answered ques-tions and reported on their progress without getting any feedback.
Many newcomers also experienced a “ﬂoating period” at the be-
ginning of their integration. This is typically a period for them toexplore the product on their own and do their own experiments,with no well-deﬁned goal or hard deadline. All participants whoexperienced a ﬂoating period mentioned that they appreciated hav-ing the time to familiarize themselves with the product. We found,though, that the newcomers who were set clearer goals with clearerdeadlines had more efﬁcient starts: because they had a goal toachieve, they asked questions when they encountered a problemand they could report on their progress, receiving useful feedback.
Self Checking. Feedback from team members was essential for
newcomers because it came from people who knew the projectlandscape well. In addition, we found ﬁve orientation aids that
enabled newcomers to validate their progress on their own.
Some participants used examples from their product as a way
of validating their progress. For example, participant P8 had toimplement the support for a new device, so he looked at the supportfor other devices to better understand the overall architecture andensure that his design would conform to it.
Documents with screenshots allowed newcomers to ensure that
they were using tools properly or that the features they were im-plementing conformed to the requirements. Participant P2 said:“Screen shots make an easy visual checkpoint for the reader toknow, ‘Hey if what I am doing on my screen looks like this thenI know that I am walking down the right path.’ If you just put tex-tual instructions, sometimes you could be three, four steps aheadbefore you realize that you made a mistake somewhere.”
Determining if a document was outdated was challenging for
newcomers, because they knew little about the past and currentstates of the project. One participant used the source history (Sec-
tion 3.2) to validate the relevance and accuracy of documents. Uponrealizing that a tutorial was outdated, he browsed the source historyof the product for the appropriate versions of the referenced classes.
Another mechanism was questionnaires included in documenta-
tion. For example, the documentation explaining the architectureof the product participant P6 worked on contained a questionnaireto assess the knowledge of the reader. P6 found this useful becauseit enabled him to identify the areas that he did not understand well.
Finally, newcomers sometimes documented all the steps they
went through while performing a task, to assess their own progressand to make sure that they would not forget what they had justlearned. Additionally, the newcomers were creating orientationaids for future use, and felt that they were contributing to the team.Participant P7 said: “As we did learn things, we tried to build acommon place for other people to go look so other people wouldn’thave to reinvestigate what somebody else on the team had ﬁguredout”. Unfortunately, this process was time-consuming and couldproduce documents that became outdated quickly. To improve cost-effectiveness, seasoned team members could help newcomers de-cide which steps are worth documenting.
5. QUALITY AND CREDIBILITY
When evaluating the validity of qualitative research, many re-
searchers prefer to use the terms quality (are the ﬁndings innova-
tive, thoughtful, useful?) and credibility (are the ﬁndings trustwor-
thy and do they reﬂect the participants’, researchers’, and read-ers’ experiences with a phenomenon?) [5, p.202]. For these re-searchers, the concept of validity is often associated with quanti-
tative research; the usual threats to validity are inconsistent withqualitative research. In grounded theory, investigator bias is not athreat, but a required attribute: the investigator is the one selectingthe participants, reﬁning the questions, and developing the theory.
Corbin and Strauss provide ten criteria to evaluate the quality
and credibility of grounded theory research [4, p. 305]. We reviewthree criteria and explain how we fulﬁll them.
Fit. “Do the ﬁndings ﬁt/resonate with the professionals for whom
the research was intended and the participants?” This criterion ver-
iﬁes that we did not “invent” anything and that we accurately re-ported what the participants told us. It also requires that the levelof abstraction at which we report our ﬁndings is general enough torepresent the experience of all participants, but not so general thatthe results become meaningless.
To ensure a good ﬁt, as we formulated our theory and categorized
the landscape features, the obstacles and the aids, we tied each ﬁnd-
282ing to at least one participant so it was possible at any moment to
link an observation to a quote from a participant.
We also re-interviewed seven participants at the end of the study,
presenting our ﬁndings and asking them if the ﬁndings resonatedwith their integration experiences. We asked for concrete examplesshowing why their experiences ﬁt within the three factors, or whythey did not. All participants said that the three factors, with theiraids and obstacles, effectively represented their integration expe-riences. Most participants pointed out a few speciﬁc obstacles oraids that had been signiﬁcantly helpful (or unhelpful) as they weresettling into their projects. Two participants also mentioned thatour ﬁndings matched previous integration experiences of theirs.
Applicability or Usefulness. “Do the ﬁndings offer new insights?
Can they be used to develop policy or change practice?” Through
the lens of the education literature, our ﬁndings are not particularlysurprising: e.g., researchers have theorized for a long time that ex-perimentation is an important concept in adult learning [10]. Tothe best of our knowledge, however, there are very few studies thathave been performed on software engineers, especially senior soft-ware engineers, joining an ongoing project. The fact that managersin our initial survey had different stances on the integration of new-comers, and that the integration experiences of newcomers variedgreatly, also indicates that some of our ﬁndings would be new anduseful to them.
Two of the seven participants who participated in our evaluation
interviews asked us if they could distribute the two-page summaryof our ﬁndings to teams around them. They told us that it wouldhave been helpful if their teams had read this summary before theyhad joined because their teams could have avoided the usual pitfalls(e.g., long IDE installation) and adopted helpful practices (e.g., fre-quent progress validation with feedback).
Variation. “Has variation been built into the ﬁndings?” Variation
demonstrates that a phenomenon is complex and that the ﬁndings
accurately represent that complexity. We did not have to speciﬁ-cally ask for counter-examples during our interviews because thebackground of the participants and their projects were so differentthat variation occurred naturally. When we encountered a situationthat did not seem to ﬁt our theory, we always tried to understand thecause of this situation. For example, we explained why, in some sit-uations, a course might be preferable to early experimentation.
6. RELATED WORK
There exists a large body of research on knowledge transfer,
newcomer integration in organizations, and information needs insoftware engineering maintenance tasks. However, to the best ofour knowledge, there is no other study addressing the issue of soft-ware developers who are not new to an organization and who joinan ongoing project.
Begel and Simon observed eight graduate students during their
ﬁrst months of work at Microsoft [1, 2]. They found that mostof the difﬁculties encountered by the new hires came from theirinexperience with a corporate environment. They also found sev-eral patterns that are consistent with the management sciences [9].Though our study concerns integration into a project landscape andnot an organization, we observed similar patterns. For example,Begel and Simon found that newcomers did not know when theywere stuck and insisted on ﬁnding the solution on their own, some-times to prove themselves to their managers. We observed the sameissues with experienced software developers, but we also foundstrategies that teams used to limit the impact of these situations(e.g., daily team meetings). They also found that newcomers per-formed six main activities and that they spent most of their time oncommunication, reading of documentation and bug ﬁxing. We in-directly conﬁrmed this ﬁnding by observing that process activities(e.g., daily team meetings) and rich communication (e.g., walk-throughs), and not tools, were the most helpful orientation aids.Finally, they noted that newcomers complained that, because theywanted to be productive and helpful, they acquired a broad but shal-low understanding of their project and they no longer had time tolearn about the product in depth. A few participants in our studymentioned this issue, but we found that acquiring a deep knowledgeat the beginning of the integration would likely not work (e.g., upfront courses instead of early experimentation) and that technicalmeetings related to the tasks of the newcomers and held later intheir integration could help with this issue.
Sim and Holt interviewed four recently-hired developers at a big
software company and identiﬁed seven integration patterns [15].Because they studied new hires, they observed many issues relatedto organizational integration, but they also found some patterns thatour observations complement. For example, they found that men-toring was an effective strategy to help newcomers get integrated,but that it was inefﬁcient for the team because of the time devotedby the mentor. Based on our observations, however, we believethat, despite the cost, mentoring does proﬁt the whole team becauseit builds strong relationships that have long-term beneﬁt. Strongrelationships with their mentors enabled participants like P8 to getanswers quickly, while the lack of strong relationships with col-leagues probably resulted in long delays for P14 and P15 whenthey had questions. Sim and Holt also observed that the three new-comers who employed a bottom-up approach to understanding aproject (low-level details ﬁrst) were more successful than the new-comer who used a top-down approach (e.g., trying to understandthe architecture ﬁrst). We found that for participants whose earlyexperimentation was efﬁcient, the strategy was slightly more com-plex: they were presented with an overview of the structures (ar-chitecture, inter-team organization, development process) and thenwere given low-level tasks, such as ﬁxing simple bugs. When theteam forgot to present an overview of a major structure, the partic-ipant tried hard to obtain it through questions and reading.
Our study complements these previous studies by categorizing
the landscape features that newcomers needed to learn and by iden-tifying the obstacles and orientation aids encountered by newcom-ers in the context of three integration factors. From a methodolog-ical point of view, our study differs from the previous studies inthe larger number of participants and projects surveyed and in theshorter time spent with each participant.
Berlin conducted a study on the interaction of three mentors and
three apprentices who had to extend a toolkit in a programming lan-guage unfamiliar to them [3]. She found that mentors (1) answeredmore than the initial questions of the apprentices, (2) could recon-struct the rationale from the code and explain it to the apprentices,and (3) interacted in a collaborative way with the apprentices bybeing sensitive to their needs and current understanding of the sys-tem. We observed that effective mentors, but not all mentors, exhib-ited the same characteristics and, in addition, they enquired aboutthe progress of their apprentices. The collaborative conversationstyle was also an important characteristic of effective exchangesbetween our participants and their colleagues. For example, tech-nical meetings were useful when they were in line with the currentunderstanding of newcomers and when newcomers could ask ques-tions, but they were less useful when they occurred too early (e.g.,up-front courses) or when the participants were mostly listening.
Lethbridge et al. [12] conducted a survey of 48 software engi-
neers to ﬁnd out how documentation was used in industry. Theyfound, for example, that documentation was often outdated, butsoftware engineers still thought that high-level documents were
283useful because the underlying concepts (e.g., features, requirements)
were stable. De Souza et al. also conducted two surveys on theuse of software documentation and they found that low-level doc-uments (e.g., data models) were more often used during softwaremaintenance tasks than high-level or overview documents [8]. Ourobservations on newcomers conﬁrm these ﬁndings: the participantsin our study thought that documentation describing the low-leveldesign, even if it was outdated, was useful. We also found thatseverely outdated instructions (e.g., for installation or requestingcredentials) that were not related to underlying concepts were noteffective, and that relying on colleagues was a better strategy.
Ko et al. observed 17 developers to learn about their information
needs when performing maintenance tasks [11]. They summarizedthe results as 20 questions, such as “What code caused this programstate?” and “What have my coworkers been doing?” Sillito et al.conducted two studies on developers performing change tasks [14].They noted 44 general questions that the developers asked whenworking with the code such as “What will the total impact of thischange be” and “Where should this case be handled?” The au-thors found that 66% of these questions were partially supported bytools (and 34% were fully supported). Our participants mentionedthat they asked most of these questions when they were internaliz-ing the structures and cultures of their projects, but, in contrast toseasoned team members, newcomers did not always know the ap-propriate scope (e.g., many components unknown to the newcomercan cause a program state) or they did not know how to use theteam’s tools efﬁciently to answer their questions. Interestingly, ourparticipants needed to interact with other team members to answersome questions that Sillito et al. found fully supported by tools. Forexample, a question like “When is this method called?” could notbe answered by tools because the newcomers did not know whichexternal components depended on their work.
Finally, on the general topic of knowledge acquisition, Newell
and Galliers surveyed 13 projects in different areas (e.g., healthcareand utilities) and found several reasons why knowledge transferamong organizations is problematic [13]. For example, they foundthat lack of concrete experience with a proposed solution blindeddecision makers. Knowles demonstrated how adult learning ben-eﬁts from experimentation [10], and Jones found that the level ofself-efﬁcacy of newcomers (which could be associated with yearsof experience in the industry) inﬂuenced the integration process [9].V on Krogh et al. studied the factors that led newcomers to be suc-cesfully accepted by the community of a freestanding open sourceproject [16]. Our study focused on individuals joining software de-velopment projects; our ﬁndings are in line with the previous workin these research areas and complement it by describing the chal-lenges and workarounds speciﬁc to software engineering.
7. CONCLUSION
When joining ongoing projects, newcomers often face unfamil-
iar and rugged landscapes. Based on a qualitative study of 18 par-ticipants from 18 projects, we provided an initial characterizationof project landscapes and an initial theory of the integration pro-cess. We found, for example, that helpful landscape inhabitantsmake a key difference to how easy it is for newcomers to ﬁnd theirway and settle in. In particular, human guides are invaluable, bet-ter than guidebooks, which often do not provide the precise detailsnewcomers need to make sense of their new surroundings. Exist-ing inhabitants can also affect the landscape by leaving well-wornpaths and signposts, such as issue histories and example code, thatcan then be followed by newcomers as they navigate the landscape.
What about redesigning project landscapes, making them eas-
ier for newcomers to settle into? Could we design more appropri-ate signposts? What about creating useful maps: micro and macroviews that show the relationships between different landscape fea-tures and routes that can be taken? We hope that this study willspark further studies to test our theory and to explore project land-scapes further, as well as research into how to improve them.
