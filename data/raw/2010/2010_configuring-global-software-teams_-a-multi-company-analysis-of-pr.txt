Analysis of Project Productivity, Quality, and Profits
ABSTRACT 
In this paper, we examined the impact of project-level configurational choices of globally distributed software teams on project productivity, quality, and profits. Our analysis used data 
from 362 projects of four different  firms. These projects spanned 
a wide range of programming languages, application domain, process choices, and development sites spread over 15 countries and 5 continents. Our analysis revealed fundamental tradeoffs in 
choosing configurational choi ces that are optimized for 
productivity, quality, and/or profits. In particular, achieving higher levels of productivity a nd quality require diametrically 
opposed configurational choices. In addition, creating imbalances 
in the expertise and personnel distribution of project teams 
significantly helps increase profit margins. However, a profit-oriented imbalance could also significantly affect productivity 
and/or quality outcomes. Analyzing these complex tradeoffs, we 
provide actionable managerial insights that can help software 
firms and their clients choose configurations that achieve desired project outcomes in globally dist ributed software development.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Global software development has become a dominant operational 
model for developing and deliveri ng software-intensive systems. 
Software development organizations continue to expand and disperse geographically in search of lower project cycle-times, the ability to deliver high quality software at a lower cost, and the 
right talent necessary to develop the increasingly more complex 
software systems. However, realizing the benefits of dispersing software development does come with associated costs and challenges. Over the last decade, the negative impact of geographic distribution in softwa re development has been well 
documented (e.g., [4, 7, 13, 16, 22]). Physical separation often 
introduces barriers that hinder software engineers’ ability to 
adequately communicate and coordinate their work as well as stay 
aware of other peoples’ activities [20]. Problems in 
communication, coordination, and awareness [9] lead to longer 
times to complete development tasks [7, 16] as well as more 
errors [12], which ultimately resu lt in more software defects and 
development costs. 
Given the rapid growth of the global software development model 
in spite of the documented theoretical and empirical evidence of 
the pitfalls and challenges of the model, it is important to understand how global software teams are still able to reap benefits from distributed development. Recent research has 
highlighted ways in which some teams have mitigated the 
challenges of global distributed development through appropriate process investments and quality management practices [2, 22]. 
This study takes a step further by examining the relationship 
between the configurational  characteristics of the software project 
teams and project performance. 
Configurational characteristics of distributed software teams 
refers to the structural properties of the geographic dispersion and 
accounts for the different ways in which the developers are 
dispersed, in addition to the well-studied time zone and distance measures (i.e., the spatio-temporal characteristics). Theoretical 
support for the need to study configurational characteristics comes 
from recent organizational studies that have established geographic dispersion as a multi-dimensional construct with each dimension having distinct implications for the psychological, 
social, and organizational proces ses that underlie individuals’ 
ability and willingness to adequa tely communicate, coordinate, 
and collaborate [9, 18, 19].  
There is also an emerging body of empirical evidence supporting 
the call for a more careful consideration of how the nature of work 
distribution impacts critical outcomes in software development 
projects. For example, a very consistent result reported by 
researchers is that development tasks take longer in a distributed setting versus a co-located one (e.g., [7, 16]). However, a software project represents a collection of development tasks and the loss 
in productivity at the task-level could be reduced or overcome by 
increasing the concurrency of proj ect activities. In the context of 
software quality, time zone separation reduces the opportunities for synchronous interaction leading to higher levels of 
misunderstandings and errors [12] . “Nearshoring” (locating teams 
nearer to the customer in terms of time zones) has been proposed as an alternative that alleviates these detrimental effects [5]. Recent work has also shown that the nature of dependencies and

261the ways in which developers are dispersed across the 
development locations is significantly more detrimental to quality than the impact of time zone separation per se [8]. These 
examples illustrate the need to develop a better understanding of 
how the different dimensions  of geographic dispersion jointly  
impact performance outcomes such as development productivity and software quality. 
In this paper, we examine the impact of several configurational 
dimensions of geographic disper sion on the productivity, quality, 
and profit outcomes of distributed software development projects. 
We collected data from 362 projects from four different 
companies. These projects spanned a wide range of programming 
languages, application domain, process choices, and development 
sites spread over 15 countries and 5 continents.   
Our analyses revealed that project configurations that achieve 
high productivity tend to achieve low quality and vice versa, suggesting that managers face a challenging optimizing task when 
configuring their project teams.  Further, imbalances in the 
configurations are often benefi cial to project profitability, 
presenting a complex tradeoff between the three performance outcomes of productivity, quality, and profits. The key 
contributions of this paper are the following: 
1) We take the first step in rigorously establishing the relationship 
between configurational dimensions of dispersion with multiple 
project performance outcomes that are considered jointly. This 
departs from prior work that typically considers each 
performance outcome in isolation, and therefore missing the 
interrelated tradeoffs between different performance outcomes 
and project-level configurations.  
2) We analyzed the complex tradeoffs induced by project 
configurational choices and provide actionable insights that can 
help development managers and clients choose configurations 
that achieve desired outcomes in a distributed software development environment. 
3) We collected and analyzed a large dataset spanning multiple 
companies, programming languages, processes, application 
domains, and geographical locations, which significantly 
improves the generalizability of our results. 
2. GEOGRAPHIC DISPERSION AND 
SOFTWARE PROJECT PERFORMANCE 
As global software development projects become pervasive, the nature of the distribution of development work and its relationship 
to outcomes of distributed projects have gained increasing 
attention from software engineering researchers (e.g., [2, 8, 14, 
16, 21, 22]). This line of research has typically considered the 
spatio-temporal characteristics of work distribution, distinguishing 
between co-located and distributed development using measures 
such as the number of locations involved or the time zone 
separation [7, 12]. A recent stream of research in organizational 
studies has started to examine the multi-dimensional nature of 
distribution by considering conf igurational characteristics of 
distributed teams in addition to spatial and temporal dispersion 
measures [9, 18, 19].  
Spatial dispersion refers to physical separation among the 
engineers participating in a development project, and researchers have typically measured it as the distance between team members.  
The key implication of spatial dispersion is the reduction in impromptu communication, which leads to lower levels of 
awareness of what the distributed project members are doing, the decisions that they are making, or the problems that they might 
have [18, 20]. Such a barrier to communication and awareness 
could result in coordination brea kdowns and software integration 
problems [14, 23], which in turn could lead to longer time to complete development tasks, increase in rework, and/or higher 
numbers of defects [8, 16]. 
Temporal dispersion refers to the time zone differences among 
project members, and its key impact on distributed work is quite 
distinct from spatial dispersion. Temporal dispersion reduces the 
possibilities of synchronous interaction, which is a critical 
communicational attribute for r eal-time problem solving and 
design activities [20]. Managing the flow of information in 
asynchronous interactions can be quite complex.  For this reason, 
temporal dispersion makes misunderstandings and errors 
significantly more likely to happen [6, 12]. On the other hand, 
temporal dispersion may allow distributed groups to accelerate the 
completion of development tasks using approaches such as 
“follow the sun”, i.e., 24 hour round-the-clock development [24].  
Configurational dispersion refers to structural properties of the 
geographic dispersion of teams and projects, and it can be 
disaggregated into three elements: the number of sites involved in 
a project, the evenness of distribution of project members across 
those sites, and the work experience level variations of project 
members at each site. Increasing the number of sites in a project 
could increase the complexity of the coordination effort. The 
coordination challenges could stem from more site-spanning 
dependencies as well as other factors such as diverse national 
cultures, regulatory boundaries and processes [4, 20]. On the other 
hand, if the development effort can be partitioned into 
autonomous units of work without any complex dependencies, 
increasing the number of locations helps concurrent development 
and might not per se translate in to lower project performance. 
The second aspect of configurational dispersion, evenness of 
distribution of team members acr oss locations, influences the 
dynamics of interaction and coordination among development 
locations. For example, an uneven team distribution could 
promote behaviors such as majority influence and conflict, which 
are not conducive for good collaboration [18]. In an imbalanced 
configuration, members of larger  locations might disregard the 
input from members of smaller locations and attempt to impose 
“majority” decisions that are incons istent with the requirements of 
other locations, negatively impacting project outcomes. While 
such problems can be averted if project members are distributed 
evenly across different locations, an even team distribution might 
not make a good business case, especially in the presence of 
significant labor cost differences across the different locations.  
Finally, the third aspect of configurational dispersion is 
experience dispersion, which has not received much attention in 
the literature. However, anecdotal evidence from our field 
observations suggests that it is an important factor affecting 
performance. Experience dispersion refers to how individuals with 
particular skills or levels of e xperience are distributed within the 
various development locations of a project. A concentrated 
presence of domain experts in a particular location could be 
beneficial to achieve good results as experienced engineers tend to 
produce better software faster [3, 10]. On the other hand, such a 
concentration of experts in one location could be associated with 
large numbers of less experienced individuals in other locations, 262which might increase the likelihood of integration-related 
problems and the resulting loss of productivity and quality. 
The discussion of the different dimensions of distribution 
presented in the previous paragraphs highlights two important 
gaps in the literature. First, the impact of the different configurational dimensions of wo rk distribution might be varied 
depending on the unit of analysis. The direction of a particular 
effect at the level of the development task can be different or non-
existent when considering the project as the unit of analysis. Second, we still lack systematic empirical evidence to understand how the various configurational di mensions of distributed teams 
jointly impact project performance. This leads to the two 
interrelated research questions examined in this paper: 
RQ1: How do the configurational dimensions of 
distribution impact the performance (productivity, 
quality, and profits) of globally distributed software 
projects? 
RQ2: What are the team configurations that firms can use 
to mitigate the ill effects of spatio-temporal dispersion, and overcome the challenges of 
distributed software development?  
3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
In order to answer the research questions described above, we 
approached several firms that have adopted globally distributed software development models in their operations. The data 
corresponding to 362 projects, tracked from start to finish, from 
four firms were used in our study. The data we collected were audited by the quality assurance and central process engineering groups of the firms, and hence we can place high confidence in 
the reliability of the archival data. We augmented the archival 
data from the projects with structured interviews and field observations of the processes followed at the firms. Similar to prior research [2, 8, 22] we used a series of econometric models to 
examine the empirical relationship between the work dispersion 
measures and software project performance.  
3.1 Description of Datasets 
We describe the projects and firms in the four data sets in the 
following sections. 
3.1.1 Dataset 1 
The first firm in our dataset is  a development organization that 
specializes in custom software development.  It is privately held and headquartered in the USA with development teams located in 
Europe and India. The firm was certified for ISO 9001:2000 
quality processes, followed the RUP development process model, 
and had an established clientele in USA, Europe, and Japan. We 
collected data on 45 projects executed by the firm between 
January 2007 and December 2009.  The projects involved 
developing payment and billing enterprise solutions for the 
telecommunications industry using the J2EE, .NET, and PHP 
platforms. All the projects were executed using fixed price 
contracts between the firm and its clients. 
3.1.2 Dataset 2 
The second company we collected data from produces business-
to-business solutions for electronic transactions. We collected data 
from 15 projects that were completed between 1999 and 2001. 
This company had 5 development locations distributed across Mexico, Ecuador, Brazil, and Argentina, and utilized agile processes for its development. All development sites followed a 
subset of agile processes with daily builds and periodic short status meetings among the members of the project. All developers 
had access to the same version control system and a task tracking 
system. The organization also used an internal instant messaging tool for communication between de velopers along with standard 
teleconferencing. The projects were built using Java-based 
technologies (Java, J2EE etc.) and fixed price contracts.  
3.1.3 Dataset 3 
Our third data set is from a multi-national company that produces 
complex embedded systems for the automotive industry. The 
software organization used a product line approach for developing its solution offerings. In such a setting, a base version of all the architectural components of the software system is first developed 
and then integrated to form a platform on which specific solutions 
are further developed. This company had 9 development centers located in North America, Europe, India, and Japan. We collected data on 56 projects that were completed between 2005 and 2007. 
These projects involved analyzing requirements of a particular 
customer, determining if the platform needed to be modified, and implementing those necessary changes in collaboration with the engineers that developed the platform. While the India-based 
development center of the firm was successfully assessed as operating at CMM level 5, the projects spread across the different 
development centers followed a RUP process model with 
extensive tailoring at the individual development centers. This set 
of projects used time and material contracts and developed their 
solutions using a mix of C, C++, and Assembly languages. 
3.1.4 Dataset 4 
The fourth company we collected data from is a multi-national 
firm specializing in custom software development with a large client base and development centers in Australia, Western Europe, India, and USA. All the development centers of the firm were 
assessed at CMMI level 5. We were able to collect data on 246 
projects completed by the firm during 2007 and 2008. The projects involved developing custom web-enabled business software in J2EE and .NET platforms for the financial services 
industry.  The projects were executed using fixed price contracts 
with clients with provisions fo r performance-based adjustments. 
3.2 Description of Measures 
We describe the key measures in our data set in this section.  
3.2.1 Dispersion Measures 
As stated earlier, we collected data on the spatial, temporal,  and 
configurational  characteristics of the work dispersion that 
occurred in the observed projects [18]. The data regarding 
development locations and number of developers per location was extracted from the project documentation (modification requests 
reports and change logs), process databases, and human resource 
database at the firms. For each pair of development locations we 
observed in our project, we determined the distance between these 
two development sites (using Google Maps and other map tools) 
to calculate the Spatial Distribution  measure. We determined the 
difference in time zones between the development locations in 
order to calculate the Temporal Distribution  measure. The third 
dimension of distribution, Configurational Dispersion, which is a 
key focus of this study, was assessed using three measures: 
Number of Sites, Personnel Imbalance, and Experience Spread. 
The descriptions, formulas, and examples of how we calculated 
the dispersion measures are shown in Table 1. 263Table 1. Dispersion Measures 
 
3.2.2 Project Performance Measures 
We utilized three project performance measures – productivity, 
quality, and profits.  
Productivity: We measured productivity using the following ratio 
of output and input parameters, where Code Size  is measured 
using KLOC (and Function Points), and Total Project Effort is 
measured using person hours: 
݁ݖ݅ܵ	݁݀݋ܥ	=ݕݐ݅ݒ݅ݐܿݑ݀݋ݎܲ 
ݐݎ݋݂݂ܧ	ݐ݆ܿ݁݋ݎܲ	݈ܽݐ݋ܶ 
Quality:  We measured quality as the delivered code defect 
density as following, where Defects Delivered  were the number of 
defects reported by the client afte r the project had been delivered: 
݁ݖ݅ܵ	݁݀݋ܥ	=ݕݐ݈݅ܽݑܳ 
݀݁ݎ݁ݒ݈݅݁ܦ	ݏݐ݂ܿ݁݁ܦ 
Project Profits: We measured project profits using the following 
measure: 
ݏ݁ݑ݊݁ݒܴ݁	ݐ݆ܿ݁݋ݎܲ	=ݐ݂݅݋ݎܲ −ݏݐݏ݋ܥ	ݐ݆ܿ݁݋ݎܲ
ݏݐݏ݋ܥ	ݐ݆ܿ݁݋ݎܲ 
We intentionally used ratio measures for all the project 
performance measures listed above as this allows us to control for 
the project size, scope, and scale effects across our four 
companies (the ratios normalize the code size, costs, and personnel effort across the different projects in our data set). This allows us to then rigorously compare measures across the four 
companies with a high degree of confidence. 3.2.3 Control Measures 
Other than the dispersion and project performance measures, we 
also collected information on project team size and process 
models followed in the projects. These control measures are 
needed to ensure proper statistical model specification and analysis as these measures are know n to have a significant effect 
on project performance from prior research, but are not the main 
focus of our analysis. Team size and project processes are well 
established as having impact on project performance [15, 17]. These additional variables, along with the 4 firm-level dummy identification variables are used as control measures in our 
empirical models. 
Team size : The total full time equivalent count of personnel 
involved in a project at all development locations is our team size 
variable.  
Process Model : Through structured interviews with team leaders 
and team members, and through our field observations of the 
projects, we gathered information on the process models followed 
in the projects. We encounter ed two development process 
approaches in the projects in our data sets: projects that followed a highly plan-based waterfall or V- model approach for development 
and projects that followed an agile, cyclical or spiral approach to 
development. In our dataset, there was a complete correlation between the waterfall development approach and the adoption of CMM process templates, whereas the projects that followed a 
cyclical or spiral approach to development had hybrid process 
templates based on both agile RUP and CMM. To control for 
these differences in process approaches across the projects we 
created dummy (categorical) variables in our dataset (1= 
structured, waterfall or V-model approach, 0=agile, iterative Dispersion

Firm-Level Controls: Finally, we clustered the projects 
according to their firm-level characteristics, such as the contract 
choice and the programming language used. This allowed us to 
robustly compare results across projects with different firm-level 
characteristics.  
3.3 Description of Empirical Models 
In order to examine the associations between the dispersion 
measures and project performance measures, we developed and 
tested our empirical models. The functional forms of the empirical 
models were derived from prior re search [1, 15, 17, 22] utilizing 
the economic production function view of software development 
(i.e., project performance outcomes expressed as a production 
function of personnel-related, pro cess-related, and project-related 
input variables). Corresponding to the three performance outcome 
measures we studied, the three equations that form our empirical 
models are shown in Equations 1 to 3. It is important to note that 
our modeling approach analyzes the associations between the 
dispersion measures and performance outcomes by jointly 
accounting for the individual effects of various dimensions of 
dispersion, and the performance measures are estimated 
simultaneously accounting for any potential interrelationships 
between them.  
In our dataset the spatial (Separ ation Dispersion) and temporal 
(Time Zone) dispersion measures were highly correlated with 
each other (pair-wise correlation of 0.9 with P-value=0.00). This 
indicates that our data involves East-West geographical 
dispersion, which correlates highly with the Time Zone 
classifications of the world, rath er than North-South geographical 
dispersion. Hence we used only the separation dispersion 
measures in our empirical models to jointly stand for spatio-
temporal dispersion (and omitted the time zone measure).

The summary statistics of the variables in our equations are shown 
in Table 2. We log-transformed two of the dependent variables 
(development productivity and quality) to ensure normality of the variable distributions. We estimated Equations 1 to 3 using Seemingly Unrelated Regression method. This approach accounts 
for the correlation of error terms in the equations (i.e., we assume 
that any external and firm-level events such as technology boom and bust cycles, CEO resignation, etc. would impact all the three 
performance outcomes simultaneously) leading to a more accurate analysis. We also clustered the projects as per the datasets to 
derive robust standard errors and corresponding P-values. Since 
our models posit interrelationships between the performance outcomes, there is a potential for the independent variables to be correlated with error terms of the regression models, an issue 
known as the endogeneity problem. The implication of such a 
problem is the potential for biased estimates resulting in inaccurate inference. Therefore, we tested for presence of endogeneity using the Durbin-Wu-Haussmann test [11], and 
found no evidence of it. We also conducted other regular 
regression diagnostics such as testing for outlier sensitivity (using Cook’s Distance), multicollinearity effects (using Variance Inflation Factors), and verified that our results are robust.

The results of our regression esti mation are presented in Table 3. 
Our empirical models are statistically sound, (i.e., they are statistically significant and they pass all endogeneity, 
multicollinearity and other diagnostic tests) and have good 
explanatory power to explain the associations between the 
dispersion measures and project performance outcomes (Chi-
Squared values are highly significant and adjusted R-Squared 
values are similar or higher than typical values documented in 
prior research).  
Overall, our results indicate that variations in the configurational 
characteristics of distributed team s lead to different performance 
outcomes. For example, from Table 3, we notice that an increase in the number of sites and in the imbalance in personnel 
configurations both boost productivity at the expense of quality 
(the regression value for both these variables is positive (0.44 and 0.76 respectively) and significant for the productivity column and negative (-0.83 and -0.97 respectively) for the quality column). 
On the other hand, an increased spread in experience across the 
sites is associated with improved quality but decreased productivity. We discuss these results in more detail, for each of the three performance measures, in the next sections. 2654

that a “balanced” configuration that balances the tension between personnel imbalance and experience spread has the highest 
productivity. Further, any imbalances should be towards the 
offshore-orientation to minimize the productivity loss. The results 
for quality (Table 6) show that the best quality is achieved when one measure (either experience spread or personnel imbalance) is 
balanced and the other is customer-oriented. This agrees and 
sheds more light onto our regression results, which show opposite effects for the two measures. Finally, Table 7 shows that the highest profits are achieved when both the personnel imbalance 
and experience spread measures are offshore-oriented. This agrees 
well with our regression results and our intuition, as the offshore sites tend to have lower labor costs.  
6. DISCUSSION 
6.1 Choosing a Dispers ion Configuration 
Our results indicate that choosing any specific configuration for a 
globally distributed software project induces fundamental 
tradeoffs between project produc tivity, quality, and profit. 
Fortunately, there appear to be some prescriptions that can be applied for rationalizing the tradeoffs and optimizing performance outcomes, which we discuss in this section. 
6.1.1  Impact of Profit-Orientation 
Our results show that by creating an imbalance of resources across 
the development centers (e.g., more headcount in “cheaper” 
locations) firms are able to improve their profit margins despite 
taking a dent in delivered quality (and the associated warranty and rework costs) and/or productivity (see Tables 5-7 and Table 3).   This is because there is a significant cost arbitrage in software 
development labor costs. Our results show that distributed team 
configurations that depict larger spatio-temporal separation and personnel imbalances are going to be sustained simply because they are profitable to the firm.  Hence, an important next step for 
researchers is to identify mechanisms that can help software teams 
manage the quality and productivity tradeoffs at the team or project-level when they use pr ofit-oriented configurations. 
6.1.2 Managing Tradeoffs 
Given the inherent tradeoffs between productivity, quality, and 
profit, it is important that tradeoff-managing mechanisms are proposed that can help developers and/or clients choose configurations that achieve preferred outcomes. Our work 
provides this in two different ways. First, the prescriptions 
emanating from our regression results in Table 3 and the rank-ordering of configuratio n choices in Tables 5 to 7 can be used to 
choose configurational choices that are optimized for specific 
performance outcomes. Second, we observe that process choice 
can play an important role in determining performance outcomes. For example, teams that are originally configured to boost quality (e.g., lower spatio-temporal disp ersion and personnel imbalances), 
could adopt a shorter planning range and more frequent release 
cycles as compared to the traditional waterfall model in order to 
improve their productivity.  Similarly, teams that are originally 
configured for high productivity (e.g., larger spatio-temporal 
dispersion and experience spreads across locations) could boost 
quality and eventually profitability by incorporating structured 
processes and more disciplined planning.  
Thus, we prescribe a dynamic and context-sensitive software 
development process environment that helps teams to alleviate the tradeoffs induced by specific project team configurations. Table 5. Productivity

6.2 Limitations of the Study 
Our study has limitations worth highlighting. Our study only 
considered dependencies at the team level and not at the 
architectural or code level. Modular structures, for instance, tend 269to exhibit a number of benefits in terms of quality and 
productivity. Therefore, an assessment of the technical coupling along with team level data could provide further insights. Second, 
despite the large number of projects from multiple companies, we 
were not able to examine the joint impact of spatial dispersion and temporal dispersion as these two measures were highly correlated in our dataset (due to our predominantly East-West site locations). 
Further research is required to examine the combined relative 
impact of both dimensions of distribution on development productivity and software quality. Finally, we have not looked at the individual-level leadership, social, and cultural factors that 
could possibly affect team dynamics and configurational choices 
that impact performance outcomes. We defer this investigation to future work. 
6.3 Implications for Future Research 
Our results suggest several areas for future investigation. First, it 
would be useful to understand the ro le that collaborative tools can 
play in reducing the tradeoffs in choosing configurational choices. 
For example, collaborative tools could facilitate easier coordination between locations, thus improving performance outcomes. We would also lik e to study the effect of 
complementary and conflicting process choices across multiple 
geographically distributed locations on various performance 
outcomes. Finally, we have anecdotal evidence through our field 
observations and interviews that project teams often face a need to 
overcome the tradeoffs in performance outcomes by dynamically 
changing their team configurations at different phases in the 
project lifecycle. We plan to investigate these issues in the future. 
7. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have analyzed the performance outcomes of 362 
globally distributed projects from four different companies with 
respect to the configurational characteristics of those projects. We showed that there is a fundament al tradeoff between productivity, 
quality, and profits at the project configurational level. Finally, we 
provided actionable insights for development and client teams to 
choose configurations that help achieve preferred performance 
outcomes and mechanisms for shifting the observed tradeoffs.
