ABSTRACT
JavaScript is widely used for writing client-side web applica-
tions and is getting increasingly popular for writing mobile
applications. However, unlike C, C++, and Java, there are
not that many tools available for analysis and testing of
JavaScript applications. In this paper, we present a simple
yet powerful framework, called Jalangi , for writing heavy-
weight dynamic analyses. Our framework incorporates two
key techniques: 1) selective record-replay, a technique which
enables to record and to faithfully replay a user-selected part
of the program, and 2) shadow values and shadow execution,
which enables easy implementation of heavy-weight dynamic
analyses. Our implementation makes no special assump-
tion about JavaScript, which makes it applicable to real-
world JavaScript programs running on multiple platforms.
We have implemented concolic testing, an analysis to track
origins of nulls and undened, a simple form of taint anal-
ysis, an analysis to detect likely type inconsistencies, and
an object allocation proler in Jalangi . Our evaluation of
Jalangi on the SunSpider benchmark suite and on ve web
applications shows that Jalangi has an average slowdown of
26X during recording and 30X slowdown during replay and
analysis. The slowdowns are comparable with slowdowns
reported for similar tools, such as PIN and Valgrind for x86
binaries. We believe that the techniques proposed in this
paper are applicable to other dynamic languages.

JavaScript is the most popular programming language for
client-side web programming. Advances in browser tech-
nologies and JavaScript engines in the recent years have
fueled the use of JavaScript in Rich Internet Applications,
and several mobile platforms including Android, iOS, Ti-
zen, Windows 8, Blackberry, Firefox OS, support appli-
cations written in HTML5/JavaScript. A key reason be-
hind the popularity of JavaScript programs is that they are
portable. Once written, JavaScript based applications can
be executed on any platform that has a web browser with
JavaScript support, which is quite common in modern day
devices. JavaScript being a dynamic language, also attracts
developers through its exible features that do not require
explicit memory management, static typing and compila-
tion. With a renewed interest in JavaScript, many complex
applications such as Google docs, gmail, and a variety of
games are being developed using HTML5/JavaScript. How-
ever, unlike C/C++, Java and C#, JavaScript is signi-
cantly shorthanded in the tools landscape. The dynamic
and reective nature of JavaScript makes it hard to analyze
it statically [27, 34, 25].
In this paper, we present a dynamic analysis framework,
called Jalangi , for JavaScript. The framework provides a
few useful abstractions and an API that signicantly sim-
plies implementation of dynamic analyses for JavaScript.
The framework works through source code instrumentation
and allows implementation of various heavy-weight dynamic
analyses techniques. Jalangi incorporates two ideas:
1.Selective record-replay , a technique which enables to
record and to faithfully replay a user-selected part of
the program. For example, if a JavaScript applica-
tion, uses several third-party modules, such as jQuery,
Box2DJS, along with an application specic library
called myapp.js, our framework enables us to only
record and replay the behavior of myapp.js.
2.Shadow values , which enables us to associate a shadow
value with any value used in the program. A shadow
value can contain useful information about the actual
value (e.g. taint information or symbolic representa-
tion of the actual value). The framework supports
shadow execution on shadow values, a technique in
which an analysis can update the shadow values and
analysis state, on each operation performed by the ac-
tual execution. For example, a shadow execution can
perform symbolic execution or dynamic taint propaga-
tion.There are a few constraints which dictated the design of
the above techniques in Jalangi .
1. We wanted to design a framework that is independent
of browsers and JavaScript engines. Such a design en-
ables us to design dynamic analyses that are not tied
to a particular JavaScript engine. Independence from
browsers and JavaScript engines also enables us to eas-
ily maintain our framework in the face of rapidly evolv-
ing browser landscape|we do not need to upgrade or
rebuild our framework whenever there is an update of
the underlying browser. We achieve browser indepen-
dence through selective source instrumentation. An at-
tractive feature of Jalangi is that it can operate even
if certain source les are not instrumented.
2. We wanted a framework where dynamic analysis of
an actual execution on a browser (e.g. a mobile
browser) can be performed on a desktop or a cloud
machine. This is important when we want to per-
form a heavy-weight analysis, such as symbolic exe-
cution. A heavy-weight analysis is often impossible
to perform on a resource constrained mobile browser.
Moreover an analysis that requires access to various
system resources, such as le system, cannot be im-
plemented in a browser without signicantly modify-
ing the browser. We address this design constraint
through a two-phase analysis framework. In the rst
phase, an instrumented JavaScript application is exe-
cuted and recorded on a user selected platform (e.g.
mobile Chrome running on Android). In the second
phase, the recorded data is utilized to perform a user
specied dynamic analysis on a desktop environment.
3. A dynamic analyses framework should allow easy im-
plementation of a dynamic analysis. Previous re-
search [31, 20, 8, 6, 21] and our experience with con-
colic testing [13, 30] and race detection techniques have
shown that support for shadow values and shadow ex-
ecution could signicantly simplify implementation of
dynamic analyses techniques. A straight-forward way
to implement shadow values would be to replace any
value, say val, used in a JavaScript execution by an ob-
ject, called annotated value, {actual: val, shadow:
"tainted"} , where the eld actual stores the actual
value and the eld shadow can store necessary infor-
mation about val. To accomodate such replacements,
we modify every operation (e.g. +, *, eld access)
performed by the JavaScript execution because every
value, whether primitive or not, could now be wrapped
by an object. The modied operations rst retrieve the
actual values from the annotated values representing
the operands of the operation and then perform the
operation on the actual values to compute the result
of the operation. This simple implementation would
work if we could modify every operation performed by
a JavaScript engine. Unfortunately, Jalangi instru-
ments only user-specied code. Moreover, Jalangi
cannot instrument native code. Therefore, if we call
array.pop() , where array is an annotated value and
popis a native function, we will get an exception.
Jalangi alleviates this problem by using the selective
record-replay engine: it only records the execution of
the instrumented code and replays the instrumentedcode. Any code that is not and can not be instru-
mented, including native code, is not executed dur-
ing the replay phase. Since Jalangi supports shadow
values and shadow execution during the replay phase,
it will never execute un-instrumented code on anno-
tated values. Thus, Jalangi 's record-replay technique
is necessary for correct support of shadow values and
shadow execution.
InJalangi , we have implemented several existing and
new dynamic analyses:
Concolic testing [13, 30]: concolic testing performs
symbolic execution along a concrete execution path,
generates a logical formula denoting a constraint on
the input values, and solves a constraint to gener-
ate new test inputs that would execute the program
along previously unexplored paths. Our implementa-
tion of concolic testing supports constraints over inte-
ger, string, and object types and novel type constraints.
Tracking origins of null and undefined [6]: this anal-
ysis records source code locations where null and un-
dened values come into existence and reports them if
they cause an error. Whenever there is an error due to
such literals, such as accessing the eld of a null value,
the shadow value of the literal is reported to the user.
Dynamic taint analysis [21, 9]: a dynamic taint analy-
sis is a form of information ow analysis which checks
if information can ow from a specic set of memory
locations, called sources, to another set of memory lo-
cations, called sinks. We have implemented a simple
form of dynamic taint analysis in Jalangi .
Detecting likely type inconsistencies: this dynamic
analysis checks if an object created at a given pro-
gram location can assume multiple inconsistent types.
Sometimes these kind of type inconsistencies could
point us to a potential bug in the program. We have
noticed such issues in two SunSpider benchmark pro-
grams.
Simple object allocation proler: this dynamic analy-
sis computes the number of objects created at a given
allocation site and how often the object has been ac-
cessed. If an allocation site creates too many constant
objects, then it could lead to memory ineciency. We
have found such a problem in one of the web applica-
tions in our benchmark suite.
Jalangi is available at https://github.com/
SRA-SiliconValley/jalangi under Apache 2.0 license.
We evaluated Jalangi on the CPU-intensive SunSpider
benchmark suite and on several user-interaction rich web
applications. Our evaluation results show that Jalangi
has an average overhead of 26X during recording and 30X
during replay. This is better than PinPlay [22] by a factor
of 2X-3X and slower than Valgrind [20]. We also found that
existing dynamic analyses could easily be implemented in
Jalangi .
2. TECHNICAL DETAILS
To simplify exposition of our techniques (and to avoid ex-
planation of the nuances of JavaScript), we use a simpleJavaScript-like imperative language. The syntax of this lan-
guage is shown below.
v; v1; v2; : : : are variable identiers
f; f1; f2; : : : are eld identiers
p; p1; p2; : : : are function parameter identiers
op are operators such as +, -, *, ...
Pgrm ::= ( `: Stmt)
Stmt ::= varv
v=c
v1 =v2opv3
v1 = opv2
v1 = call(v2; v3; v4; : : :)
ifvgoto`
return v
v1 =v2[v3]
v1[v2] =v3
function v1(p1; : : :)f(`: Stmt)g function denition
c::= number
string
undefined
null
true
false
ff1:v1; : : :g object literal
[v1; : : :] array literal
function v1(p1; : : :)f(`: Stmt)g function literal
A program in this language is a sequence of labeled state-
ments. The statements in the language are in three-address
code. ifvgoto `is the only statement that allows condi-
tional jump to an arbitrary statement. A compiler frame-
work can be used to convert more complex statements of
JavaScript into statements of this language by introduc-
ing temporary variables and by adding additional state-
ment labels. For example, control-ow statements, such as
while ,for, can be converted into a sequence of statements
in this language using ifvgoto `. We use the statement
v1 =call(v2; v3; v4; : : :) to represent function, method, and
constructor calls, where v2 denotes the function that is be-
ing called, v3 denotes the this object inside the function,
andv4; : : :denote the arguments passed to the function. We
usev1[v2] to denote both access to an element of an array
and access to a eld of an object.
2.1 Selective Record-Replay
We assume that the user of Jalangi selects a subset of
the JavaScript source in a web application for record-replay.
Jalangi instruments the user-selected source for record-
replay. During the recording phase, the application is exe-
cuted with the instrumented les on a platform of the user's
choice (e.g. a mobile browser or a node.js interpreter). Dur-
ing recording, the entire application is executed, i.e. all in-
strumented and un-instrumented JavaScript les and native
codes get executed. During the replay phase, Jalangi only
replays the execution of the instrumented sections. This
asymmetry of execution in the two phases has two key ad-
vantages:
1. One could record an execution of a JavaScript applica-
tion on an actual platform (e.g. a mobile browser) and
then replay the execution for the purpose of debugging
on a desktop JavaScript engine, such as node.js or a
JavaScript engine embedded in an IDE. The replay
does not require access to any browser-specic native
JavaScript libraries such as libraries for manipulating
the DOM.
2. During replay, since we avoid execution of un-
instrumented code and native code, we can easilyimplement various dynamic analysis that depend on
shadow values and shadow executions.
A trivial way to perform faithful record-replay of an exe-
cution is to record every value loaded from memory during
an execution and use those values for corresponding memory
loads in the replay phase. This approach has two challenges:
1) How do we record values of objects and functions? 2)
How do we replay an execution when an un-instrumented
function or a native function, such as the JavaScript event
dispatcher, calls an instrumented function? Note that we
do not allow the execution of un-instrumented and native
functions during the replay phase. Therefore, we need an
alternative mechanism to execute instrumented functions
that are being invoked by un-instrumented functions dur-
ing recording. We address the rst challenge by associating
a unique numerical identier with every object and function
and by recording the value of those unique identiers. We
address the second challenge by explicitly recording and call-
ing instrumented functions that are being invoked from un-
instrumented functions or are dispatched by the JavaScript
event dispatcher.
We avoid recording of every load of memory based on
the following observation: if we can compute the value of a
memory load during the replay phase by solely executing the
instrumented code, then we do not need to record the value
of the load.
In order to determine if the value of a memory load needs
to be recorded, Jalangi maintains a shadow memory dur-
ing the recording phase. The shadow memory is updated
along with the actual memory during the execution of in-
strumented code. Execution of un-instrumented and na-
tive code does not update the shadow memory. During the
load of memory in the recording phase, if Jalangi nds
any dierence between the value of the actual memory be-
ing loaded and the value stored in the corresponding shadow
memory, Jalangi records the value of such memory loads.
This ensures that correct values are available during the re-
play phase.
Figure 1 shows the instrumentation that Jalangi per-
forms for record-replay. The instrumentation does not
change the behavior of the actual execution. Jalangi intro-
duces a shadow variable v0for every local and global variable
v.Jalangi introduces a local variable p0for every formal
parameter pof an instrumented function. Similarly, for ev-
ery eld fof every object, Jalangi introduces a shadow
eldf0. Note that if v1[v2] denotes access of the eld de-
noted by the string stored in v2, then v1[v2 + \0"] denotes
the access of the corresponding shadow eld.
During the recording phase, Jalangi keeps the actual
memory and shadow memory in sync as much as possible.
Note that a eld of an object may not be in sync with the
corresponding shadow eld if the eld gets updated in na-
tive or un-instrumented code. Whenever a variable or a eld
of an object is updated, Jalangi adds instrumentation to
update the corresponding shadow variable or shadow eld
of the object. For example, v1 =v2[v3] gets modied to
v10=v1 =v2[v3].
The instrumentation performs the following additional
three transformations:
If a local or global variable vor a eld of an ob-
jectv1[v2] is loaded in a statement, we rst call
v0=v=sync(v; v0) or v1[v2 + "0"] = v1[v2] =varv =) varv0
varv
v=c =)v0=v=sync(c)
v1 =v2opv3 =)v20=v2 = sync(v2; v20)

sync(v1[v2]; v1[v2 + "0"]), respectively, before the ac-
tual load. In the recording phase, the function sync
records the value stored in the memory if the values
stored in the actual and shadow memory are dier-
ent (i.e. if the arguments of the sync are dierent).
In the replay phase, sync returns the rst argument
if the corresponding load in the recording phase was
not recorded and returns the recorded value otherwise.
This ensures that in the replay phase, Jalangi gets the
exact value that is loaded during the recording phase.
We replace call(v2; v3; v4; : : :) by
sync(instrCall (v2; v3; v4; : : :)). During the replay
phase, function instrCall invokes call(v2; v3; v4; : : :)
if function v2 is instrumented. Otherwise, it explicitly
calls any instrumented function that is invoked while
executing the un-instrumented or native function
v2. We use the function replay dened in Figure 2
to call instrumented functions whose callers are not
instrumented.We insert the statement enter (v1) as the rst state-
ment of any instrumented function with name, say v1.
In the recording phase, enter (v1) records the value of
the function v1. In the replay phase, instrCall in-
vokes the recorded function if the function is called
from a un-instrumented or native function.
Figure 2 denes the functions sync,instrCall , and
enter , which are inserted by Jalangi instrumentation. The
library maintains an array trace of the recorded values
along with their types. trace[i] stores the value of the
ithmemory load. The array is initialized and populated
during the recording phase and is used in the replay phase.
At the end of recording, trace is serialized to the lesystem
in JSON format. During replay, the serialized le is used to
initialize trace .
Function sync is dened as described before. If the sec-
ond argument of sync is not provided, then we assume that
the second argument is undefined .Jalangi uses the ag
recording to indicate if an execution is meant for recording
or replay. For a recording execution, if the two arguments
ofsync are dierent, then Jalangi records the value and
the type of the value in the sparse array trace . Otherwise,
Jalangi skips recording, i.e. keeps the entry trace[i] un-
defined . If the value of v1insync is restricted to primi-
tive types (i.e. number, string, boolean, undened, or null),
we can simply do trace[i] = v1 . However, the type of
v1could be an object or a function. To handle objects and
functions, sync calls trace[i] = getRecord(v1) , where ge-
tRecord(v1) returns an object whose type eld is set to the
type of v1and valis set to v1ifv1is of primitive type. If
type of v1is a non-null object or function, then we use the
unique numerical id of the object or function as its value to
be recorded. The unique numerical id of a non-null object
or function is stored in its hidden eld *id*. If the object
or function has no unique id, getRecord creates and assigns
a unique numerical id to the object or function.
In a replay execution, if trace[i] isundefined inside a
call of sync, then sync returns the value present in the actual
memory. Otherwise, sync returns the value recorded in the
trace .sync could simply return trace[i] , if the value of
v1insync is restricted to primitive types. Since type of v1
could be object or function, trace[i].type records the type
ofv1andtrace[i].val stores the value or unique id of v1if
v1is of primitive type or object/function type, respectively.
If the type of v1is non-null object or function, we need to re-
turn the object or function that has the unique id recorded in
trace[i].val .sync calls syncRecord(rec, v1) to achieve
this. syncRecord maintains a map, objectMap , from unique
identiers to object/functions. If syncRecord discovers that
the recorded unique id maps to an object/function in the
objectMap , it returns that object/function. Otherwise, if
syncRecord nds that the recorded unique identier has no
map in the objectMap ,syncRecord does the following:
Ifvis a fresh object/function (i.e. which has not
been assigned an unique id in the current execution),
syncRecord assigns the recorded unique id rec.val to
the object vand updates objectMap to remember this
mapping. syncRecord returns the object v.
Otherwise, syncRecord has encountered an undened
value or a stale value. Therefore, syncRecord creates
a mock empty object/function, assigns the recorded id// p e r s i s t t r a c e a f t e r r e c o r d i n g

The function replay plays an important role in the re-
play phase. It ensures that any instrumented function that
got invoked from an un-instrumented or native function, is
called by Jalangi explicitly. The replay function is de-f u n c t i o n AnnotatedValue ( actual , shadow ) f

Figure 3: Annotated Value
pendent on the enter function inserted at the beginning of
every instrumented function. enter records the value of the
function that is currently being executed. It also sets the
eld isFunCall of the record appended to trace totrue. A
true value of trace[i].isFunCall indicates the record ap-
pended to trace corresponds to the invocation of the func-
tion denoted by trace[i].val . Now let us see how this
record is used in the replay phase. Jalangi calls instrCall
in place of any call statement in the code. instrCall , in
turn, invokes call ifJalangi is in the recording phase, or
during replay phase when function fis instrumented. This
ensures that Jalangi executes any function, whether instru-
mented or un-instrumented, normally during the recording
phase, and that Jalangi only executes instrumented func-
tions normally during the replay phase. If the function f
inside instrCall is un-instrumented, then there is a possi-
bility that fcould have called some instrumented function
in the recording phase. In order to replay the execution of
those instrumented functions, Jalangi calls replay .re-
play rst computes the function object by looking at the
next record in the trace and then invokes it if isFunCall is
true. The invocation does not pass any argument because
Jalangi has no record of the arguments being passed to the
function. The arguments get synced inside the function as
they are being read inside the function.
Jalangi starts the replay phase by calling the replay
function instead of calling the entry function of the applica-
tion.
2.2 Shadow Values and Shadow Execution
Jalangi enables a robust framework for writing dynamic
program analyses through shadow values and shadow exe-
cution. A user-dened shadow execution can be performed
byJalangi during the replay phase. Jalangi only per-
forms shadow execution of instrumented code: without in-
strumentation, Jalangi cannot analyze the behavior of un-
instrumented or native code.
In shadow execution, Jalangi allows the replacement of
any value used in the execution by an annotated value . The
annotated value can carry extra information about the ac-
tual value. For example, an annotated value can carry taint
information in a taint analysis or a symbolic expression de-
scribing the actual value in symbolic execution. In Jalangi ,
we denote an annotated value using an object of type An-
notatedValue dened in Figure 3. An object of type Anno-
tatedValue has two elds: the eld actual stores the actualvalue and the eld shadow stores the shadow value, i.e. ex-
tra information about the actual value. A value, say v, in
JavaScript can be associated with shadow value, say s, by
simply replacing vbynew AnnotatedValue (v; s). The pro-
jection function a(v) returns the actual value of v, ifvis an
annotated value and returns votherwise. Similarly, the pro-
jection function s(v) returns the shadow value associated
with vifvis an annotated value and returns undefined
otherwise.
If a JavaScript value is replaced by a user-dened anno-
tated value during an analysis, the built-in JavaScript oper-
ations will fail. For example, if we replace the number value
53 by the annotated value new AnnotatedValue (53; null ),
then addition of this value with another number, say 31,
would result in NaNinstead of 84. To avoid such situa-
tions, we instrument code so that Jalangi performs the
built-in JavaScript operations on the actual values instead
of the annotated values. For example, v1opv2 is re-
placed by a(v1)op a(v2). Similarly, v1[v2] is replaced by
a(v1)[a(v2)]. The instrumentation inserted by Jalangi to
perform shadow execution with shadow values along with
record-replay is shown in Figure 4.
The instrumentation assumes that the global variable
anlys could point to a user-dened analysis object dur-
ing the replay phase. After the execution of a JavaScript
statement, the corresponding method in the anlys object
is called to perform a user-specic analysis. For example,
consider the statement v1 = v2opv3. After the execu-
tion of this statement in the replay phase, Jalangi calls
thev1 =anlys :binary (op; v2; v3; v1) to perform an analysis
specic function for the binary operation op. For example,
ifv2 is the number 53 and v3 is the annotated value new
AnnotatedValue (31;\tainted"), then after the execution of
the actual statement v1 will be 84 and then execution of
v1 =anlys :binary (op; v2; v3; v1) could store new Annotat-
edValue (84;\tainted") in v1 to represent the fact if one of the
operands of a binary operation is tainted, then the result of
the operation is also tainted. Following is another example
in the context of symbolic execution. If v2 is the anno-
tated value new AnnotatedValue (1;"2x1+ 1") and v3 is the
annotated value new AnnotatedValue (3;"x2 x1"), then af-
ter the execution of v1 =anlys :binary (+; v2; v3; v1), where
anlys performs symbolic execution, v1 will be the annotated
value new AnnotatedValue (4;"x1+x2"). Note that in the
symbolic execution, the symbolic expression corresponding
to a concrete value is represented as a string in the shadow
value.
2.3 Example Analysis: Tracking Origin of
null and undeﬁned Values
In Figure 6 we describe a simple dynamic analysis using
the shadow execution framework for Jalangi . The analy-
sis tracks the origin of null and undefined in a JavaScript
execution. If during an execution, access is made to the
eld of a null orundefined value, or if an invocation of a
value which is null orundefined is encountered, the anal-
ysis could report the line number of code where the null or
undefined value originated.
The analysis creates an object anlys , where we dene
the methods literal ,getField , and call. The operations
corresponding to these methods could create null and un-
defined values. Therefore, if the value returned by any of
these operations is null orundefined , we annotate the re-varv =) varv0

3. EXAMPLE
Consider the example JavaScript program in Figure 7. Let
us assume that the entire program is instrumented except
the body of the function foo. The trace generated by an
execution of the program in a browser is also shown in the
Figure. Note that during the recording phase, we create an
unique identier for each of the objects accessed inside the
body of the program. The object document is available in
the browser, but the object never got created in the body
of the program. During the replay, a mock object is created
fordocument anddocument[ \*id*"]is set to 2, an identier
obtained from the recorded trace. document.URL is set to
"http://127.0.0.1/index.html" , a string value obtained
from the trace. During the recording phase, mydoc gets set
to document inside un-instrumented code. Therefore, after
the execution of foo,mydoc will contain the object docu-
ment and the shadow variable mydoc' will still be undefined .
Jalangi will, therefore, record the value of mydoc , when it
is returned from myload . During the replay, Jalangi will
sync the value of mydoc , which it will discover in objectMap .
The value of mydoc will be set to the mock object with id 2
created during the replay. Thus the replay phase will faith-// un i n s t r u m e n t e d

4. IMPLEMENTATION
We have implemented Jalangi in JavaScript. The code
of this framework is available under Apache 2.0 open-source
license at https://github.com/SRA-SiliconValley/
jalangi . In the actual implementation, we do not trans-
form JavaScript into the three-address code described
in Section 2. Rather we modify the AST in place by
replacing each operation with an equivalent function call.
We perform instrumentation ahead-of-time; in future, we
plan to support load-time instrumentation using a proxy.
Handling eval
Jalangi exposes the instrumentation library as a function
instrumentCode . This enables us also to dynamically in-
strument any code that is created and evaluated at run-
time. For example, we modify any call to eval(s) to
eval(instrumentCode(s)) .
Handling Exceptions
Exceptions do not pose any particular challenge in Jalangi
except for uncaught exceptions being thrown from un-
instrumented code. We wrap every function within a try-
catch-nally block. In the catch block, we re-throw the ex-
ception. In the nally block, we call any analysis speciccode corresponding to the function call.
Handling AJAX Calls and Event Handlers
Event handlers and handlers of AJAX calls appear as top-
level function invocations in the recorded trace. If the han-
dlers are instrumented, then the replay function dened in
Figure 2 invokes them in the order in which they were in-
voked in the recorded execution.
In record-replay described in Figure 1, we record any lit-
eral value, any value returned by a function call, and any
function value that is executed. This could still result in
large amount of record data. In our implementation, we
avoid recording any literal value. We only record the return
value of a function, if the function is un-instrumented or na-
tive. Similarly, we avoid recording a function value at the
beginning of the execution of the function, if the function is
called from an instrumented function.
Concolic Testing
We have implemented concolic testing as an analysis in
Jalangi . We store the symbolic expression corresponding
to each concrete value in its shadow value. Concolic execu-
tion takes place during the replay phase: the shadow exe-
cution updates the shadow value of each value. We perform
record-replay execution of the program for each generated
input.
In our implementation of concolic testing, we handle linear
integer constraints and string constraints involving concate-
nation, length, and regular expression matching. We also
handle type constraints and a limited set of constraints over
references. For example, if the type of an input variable
is unknown, we infer the possible types of the variable by
observing the operations performed on the variable.
Dynamic Taint Analysis
A dynamic taint analysis is a form information ow analysis
which checks if information can ow from a specic set of
memory locations, called sources, to another set of memory
locations, called sink. We have implemented a simple form
of dynamic taint analysis in Jalangi . In the analysis, we
treat read of any eld of any object, which has not previ-
ously been written by the instrumented source, as a source
of taint. We treat any read of a memory location that could
change the control-ow of the program as a sink. We at-
tach taint information with the shadow value of an actual
value. Taint information is propagated by implementing the
various operations in the analysis. For example, if any of
the operands of an operation is tainted, then we return an
annotated value which is marked as tainted.
Detecting Likely Type Inconsistencies
The dynamic analysis checks if an object/function created at
a given program location can assume multiple inconsistent
types. It computes the types of object and function values
created at each denition site in the program. Specically,
the analysis associates every object/function value with the
static program location where the object/function value got
created. It also maps each such program location to the
type that the objects/functions created at the location can
assume during the course of the execution. If an object or
a function value dened at a program location has been ob-
served to assume more than one type during the execution,
the analysis reports the program location along with the ob-served types. Sometimes these kind of type inconsistencies
could point us to a potential bug in the program. We have
noticed such issues in two SunSpider benchmark programs.
Simple Object Allocation Proﬁler
This dynamic analysis records the number of objects created
at a given allocation site and how often the elds of the ob-
jects created at a given allocation site have been accessed.
The analysis also tracks if the objects' elds have been up-
dated, that is the analysis tracks if the objects created at a
given allocation site are read-only or a constant. The analy-
sis reports the maximum and average dierence between the
object creation time and the most recent access time of the
object. Time is reported in terms of the number of instruc-
tions being executed. If an allocation site creates too many
constant objects, then it could lead to performance issues.
We have found such an issue in one of the web applications
in our benchmark suite.
Limitations
Jalangi implementation has the following known limita-
tions which can prevent it from doing high-delity replay
in some scenarios. Some of these limitations arise in EC-
MAScript 5. Jalangi will fail to record if a JavaScript
engine disallows access to arguments.callee at the begin-
ning of a function call. This is a problem if an entire
script is made to run in strict mode .Jalangi cannot han-
dle updates made through the setter method of an ob-
ject in ECMAScript 5. Jalangi cannot handle the with
construct properly. Jalangi cannot track implicit type
conversion of externally created objects to primitive types.
JSON.stringify cannot accurately record a oating point
number, which could lead to imprecision during replay. We
believe that these limitations could be addressed in a future
release.
5. EV ALUATION
We next report our results of evaluating Jalangi on sev-
eral benchmark programs. In our evaluation, we focussed on
four aspects: 1) ease of writing dynamic analyses, 2) delity
and robustness of record-replay, 3) performance of Jalangi ,
and 4) programming issues detected during dynamic analy-
ses.
5.1 Ease of Writing Dynamic Analyses
We have written ve dynamic analyses and a condition
coverage tool on top of Jalangi . The condition coverage
tool has 47 lines of JavaScript code, the origin tracker for
null and undened has 61 lines of JavaScript code, taint
analysis has 68 lines of code, the object allocation tracker
has 174 lines of code, the type inconsistency checker has 543
lines of code, and concolic testing has 2225 lines of code.
In comparison, a concolic testing tool for Java with lesser
functionalities had more than 20,000 lines of code. Even
though number of lines of code is not a good measure for
the ease of writing a dynamic analysis, it provides a rough
estimate of the complexity of writing an analysis on top of
Jalangi .
5.2 Fidelity and Robustness
By delity, we mean the similarity between recording and
replay executions. By robustness, we mean the ability ofJalangi to handle a program without introducing any er-
rors or exceptions of its own. To check delity of Jalangi ,
we recoded all the memory loads both in record and replay
phases and checked if the two sequences of loads are the
same. Despite the limitations described in the previous sec-
tion, we managed to run Jalangi without any error on all
programs that we considered for evaluation. and Jalangi
produced exactly the same sequence of memory loads and
followed exactly the same execution paths.
5.3 Performance of JALANGI
We performed record-replay on 26 programs in the
JavaScript SunSpider ( http://www.webkit.org/perf/
sunspider/sunspider.html ) benchmark suite and
on ve web apps written for the Tizen OS using
HTML5/JavaScript ( https://developer.tizen.org/
downloads/sample-web-applications ). The web apps
include annex |a two-player strategy game, shopping
list|which uses local storage API of HTML5, scientic
calculator ,go|a two-player strategy game, and tenframe |
a math-based three-game combo for kids. During the
replay phase of these benchmark programs, we ran three
dynamic analyses: no analysis (denoted by empty ), tracking
origins of null and undened (denoted by track ), and a
taint analysis (denoted by taint ). We report the overhead
associated with the recording and replay phases in Table 1.
The experiments were performed on a laptop with 2.3 GHz
Intel Core i7 and 8 GB RAM. We ran the web apps on
Chrome 25 and performed the replay executions on node.js
0.8.14. We use time system command to measure runtime.
The SunSpider benchmarks have relatively small number
of lines of code, but they perform CPU intensive computa-
tions. The web apps perform both CPU intensive computa-
tions and manipulation of the DOM. We didn't measure the
slowdown of the web apps because these are mostly inter-
active applications. For the SunSpider benchmark suite, we
observed an average slowdown of 26X during the recording
phase with a minimum of 1.5X and a maximum of 93X. On
theempty analysis during the replay phase, we observed an
average slowdown of 30X with a minimum of 1.5X and a
maximum of 93X. Track analysis showed an average slow-
down of 32.75X with a minimum of 1.5X and a maximum of
96X. The slowdown in recording is 2X-3X lower than that
of PinPlay [22] and the slowdown in the analysis phase is
slightly higher than slowdown noticed in valgrind [20], a
heavy-weight dynamic analysis tool for x86. We didn't make
any eort to optimize our implementation, but we believe
suitable optimizations could further reduce the overhead.
For some programs in the SunSpider suite we noticed that
the number values recorded is quite high and recording phase
has higher overhead than replay. This is because these pro-
grams made many expensive native calls. The return values
of those calls were recorded. Replay skipped the execution
of those native calls, so we noticed lower overhead for replay.
InJalangi , if we record every memory load, then we
notice a slowdown of 300X -1000X. Our proposed use of
shadow memory signicantly reduces the number of loads
that we had to record for a faithful replay. The column titled
\% of Loads Recorded" reports the reduction in percentage.
We noticed an average reduction of 6.52% and a median
reduction of 0.73%. Programs doing a lot of native calls and
performing frequent manipulation of the DOM resulted in
large recoding of the memory loads.Based on our evaluation, we are optimistic about the
utility of Jalangi as a tool framework aiding web devel-
opers. We believe that the utility oered by Jalangi is
much more valuable compared to the additional perfor-
mance penalty that the developers observe. Moreover, this
additional penalty would be incurred only during the de-
velopment phase, and the instrumentation introduced by
Jalangi would not become a part of the actual applications
deployed to users.
5.4 Performance of concolic testing
We ran concolic testing on several programs ported from
a concolic testing engine for Java. Even though concolic
testing is not the focus of this paper, we report the results
of running concolic testing on a small program (shown in
Table 2), which has complex string operations involving in-
tegers, string length, regular expression matching, and con-
catenation. This program is a slight variant of the program
used as a case study in [5]. In concolic testing, we only use
the theory of linear integers of CVC3 [4] and model string
operations using this theory. We noticed an average slow-
down of 145X during concolic execution with a maximum
slowdown of 613X and a minimum slowdown of 1.4X. The
recording phases showed a slowdown of 1.2X. The slowdown
in the concolic execution phase is mostly due to the calls to
the SMT solver.
5.5 Issues Detected by Dynamic Analyses
The likely type inconsistency checker noticed that the
function safe_add(x, y) (shown below) in crypto-sha1.js
of the SunSpider benchmark suite is mostly called with both
of its arguments set to number, but at one location it was
invoked with the second argument set to undefined . We
believe that this could be an unintended behavior.
f u n c t i o n safe add (x , y)
f
var lsw = (x & 0xFFFF) + (y & 0xFFFF ) ;
var msw = (x >>16) + (y >>16) + ( lsw >>1 6 ) ;
return (msw <<16)j( lsw & 0xFFFF ) ;
g
The likely type inconsistency checker reported that the
function CreateP (shown below) in 3d-cube.js of the Sun-
Spider benchmark suite is mostly called as a constructor,
but at one location it was invoked as a function. As result
of the function call, the program creates an unnecessary V
eld in the global object. We believe that this call is a pos-
sible programming error.
f u n c t i o n CreateP (X,Y, Z) f
t h i s .V = [X,Y, Z , 1 ] ;
g
The object allocation proler noticed that the method
getValue(place, _board) in the Annex game webapp cre-
ates a constant object containing at least 64 numbers thou-
sands of times. We believe that such unnecessary creation
of the constant object can be avoided by hoisting the object
creation outside the method.

(see [10, 11] for survey of this area). In this section, we

Table 2: Sample code for evaluating per-
formance of concolic testing
the interactions of a web application with its surrounding
execution environment. It then creates a replayable pack-
aged JavaScript benchmark which can execute in the ab-
sence of the surrounding environment. JSBench does not
capture all memory loads or memory loads that could poten-
tially be modied by eval or un-instrumented code. There-
fore, JSBench could function improperly in the presence
of un-instrumented code. Jalangi alleviates this problem
by maintaining shadow memory. Selective record-replay
techniques have been proposed for Java [15, 28]. Unlike
Jalangi , these techniques statically identify the program
locations where values need to be recorded.
PinPlay [22], built on top of dynamic instrumentation
framework PIN [16] for x86, uses ideas similar to shadow
memory [19] to reduce the number of memory logs. Pin-
Play keeps shadow memory, which they call UserMem, in
sync with the actual memory at the byte and word level. In
JavaScript it is not possible to keep track of memory at byte
and word level. Jalangi uses a novel technique based on
unique identiers to record and sync objects and functions
and uses mock objects to mimic behaviors of objects created
outside instrumented code.
Mugshot [18] is another record-replay system for
JavaScript that captures all events in a JavaScript program
and allows developers to deterministically replay past exe-
cutions of web applications. Ripley [33] replicates execution
of a client-side JavaScript program on a server side replica
to automatically preserve the integrity of a distributed com-
putation. DoDOM [23] records user interaction sequences
with web applications repeatedly, executes the applicationunder the captured sequence of user actions and observes its
behavior. WaRR [2] records user interactions with a web ap-
plication and uses the recorded interaction trace to perform
high-delity replay of the web application. In contrast to
these techniques, Jalangi performs selective record-replay
instead of targeting full record-replay of a web application.
The idea of shadow values in the context of x86 binaries
has been previously proposed in [20, 36] and has been used
in several analysis tools [36, 21, 6, 8]. Instead of creating
a separate address space for shadow values, Jalangi wraps
each JavaScript value in an object of type AnnotatedValue .
This simple technique is possible due to the dynamic nature
of JavaScript.
In the recent years, several static [35, 14, 1, 12, 34, 32]
and dynamic analysis [24, 27, 3, 17] tools for JavaScript have
been proposed. Richards et al. [27] observed that dynamic
features are widely used in JavaScript programs. These dy-
namic features make static analysis of JavaScript applica-
tions hard and previous research eorts have either ignored
or made incorrect assumptions regarding these dynamic fea-
tures. Dynamic analysis tools developed for JavaScript
include tools for testing [3, 29], race detection [24], and
security analysis [33]. However, there exists no dynamic
analysis framework for JavaScript similar to valgrind [20],
PIN [16], or DynamoRIO [7] for x86. Jalangi tries to ll
this gap by providing a dynamic analysis framework in which
one could easily prototype and build sophisticated browser-
independent dynamic program analyses for JavaScript.7. REFERENCES
