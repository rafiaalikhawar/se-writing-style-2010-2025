ABSTRACT
In distributed software development synchronized actions
are important for completion of complex, interleaved tasks
that require the abilities of multiple people. Synchronous
development is manifested when le commits by two de-
velopers are close together in time and modify the same
les. Here we propose quantitative methods for identify-
ing synchronized activities in OSS projects, and use them
to relate developer synchronization with eective productiv-
ity and communication. In particular, we dene co-commit
bursts and communication bursts, as intervals of time rich in
co-commit and correspondence activities, respectively, and
construct from them smoothed time series which can be,
subsequently, correlated to discover synchrony. We nd that
synchronized co-commits between developers are associated
with their eective productivity and coordination: during
co-commit bursts, vs. at other times, the project size grows
faster even though the overall coding eort slows down.
We also nd strong correlation between synchronized co-
commits and communication, that is, for pairs of developers,
more co-commit bursts are accompanied with more commu-
nication bursts, and their relationship follows closely a linear
model. In addition, synchronized co-commits and commu-
nication activities occur very close together in time, thus,
they can also be thought of as synchronizing each other.
This study can help with better understanding collabora-
tive mechanisms in OSS and the role communication plays
in distributed software engineering.

Software engineering projects depend on collaboration [19,
24, 30, 31, 45, 51], as almost any non-trivial software re-
quires the eort of multiple developers to design it, imple-
ment features, maintain revisions, and so on. Open Source
Software (OSS) projects are examples of organized software
development where collaboration is essential. Collaboration
is well dened and organized in traditional companies [12,
13, 52], however, its mechanism in OSS projects is still un-
clear to date, although it is considered to play a key role in
the success of many OSS projects [7, 43], such as Apache,
Mozilla, Eclipse, etc. How does collaboration come to pass
in OSS, and why? While lacking formal organization, these
projects do exhibit a social network among the participants
enabling them to accomplish complex tasks [7]. For exam-
ple, often multiple developers work on the same or related
les around the same time, and these activities, or collab-
orations are accompanied by task-coordination via remote
communications, through dierent electronic tools, such as
emails, instant messaging, and web-based applications. So,
collaboration and communication in OSS should be strongly
connected, but how can we quantify that?
Many OSS projects have existed for a long time, e.g.,
more than ten years, and are comprised of large numbers
of les, while their organizations are highly dynamic [6, 16,
34, 41], i.e., developers join and quit frequently. Thus, to
assert that there is a collaborative relationship between two
developers we need more than just evidence that they sim-
ply contributed to the same project or same les; we need
to know whether their activities occurred close together in
time. Note that here we only focus on le-level collabo-
ration [46] in order to observe the generative process of a
project more carefully. A collaboration in OSS projects,
therefore, involves, at the minimum, a pair of developers,
their possible contribution to the same artifacts, and over-
lapping times of contribution. To emphasize the synchrony
of such a collaborative activity and distinguish it from the
traditional denition of collaboration, here we call it syn-
chronous development . Fortunately, most activities of de-
velopers, including code commits and communication, are
all recorded in OSS repositories [4, 5, 27, 50]. These valu-
able data sets provide an excellent opportunity for us to de-
ne synchronous development between developers in an ob-
jective way, to study the relationship between synchronous
development and communication, and further reveal their
eects on productivity in these projects.
Here, we study synchronous development in OSS projects,

ated lines of code (LOC) [28] by developers, and the as-
sociation between developer communication and their syn-
chronous development. Specically, we make a dual contri-
bution. First, we present a theoretical framework to quan-
titatively study synchronous development and communica-
tion, based on intervals of time rich in co-commits and cor-
respondence activities between pair of developers, which we
call, respectively, co-commit bursts, or C-bursts, and email
communication bursts, or E-bursts. Time-series smoothing
and correlation allow us to identify synchronous patterns
across bursts.
Our second, empirical contribution, is in applying the
quantitative framework to data from six OSS projects, with
the following results:
We nd that during a synchronous development more
LOC are generated and fewer are deleted, i.e., the
projects grow faster, less coding eort is expended,
and the coordination is more eective;
We show that synchronous development and commu-
nication are positively correlated and accelerate each
other;
We present a metric to compare communication tools
as eectors on task-coordination between developers;
We provide case studies by analyzing the content of
email messages in support of the quantitative results.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Next, we
discuss our research questions. In Section 3, we present our
methods, followed by the results in Section 4. Then, we dis-
cuss the possible threats to the validity in Section 5, followed
by a section on related work in Section 6. Finally, the paper
is concluded in Section 7.
2. RESEARCH QUESTIONS
The C-burst and E-burst methodology, which we present
in the next section, is useful for quantifying emerging syn-
chronous relationships between actions of participants in
complex distributed systems, like OSS projects. We put
it to use in answering questions related to synchronization
of developers in OSS projects.
To make the case for synchronous development we rst
ask if there is sucient evidence in the data to support the
assertion that synchronous development is more than ran-
dom commits by pairs of developers.
Research Question 1: Is synchronous development
more than a random phenomenon? That is, does it
occur signicantly more frequently in real OSS projects
than it would by chance?
Next, we consider the eects that synchronous develop-
ment might have on eorts expended and on code growth
in OSS projects. In an OSS project, it is plausible that de-
velopers can contribute more when they participate in syn-
chronous development. Here, to quantify this phenomenon,
we follow previous studies and use the lines of code, or LOC,
to measure the eort developers expend as well as the project
sizeand its growth. In a simplied, but easy to quantify,
sense, each commit activity of a developer consists of twoparts: adding new code and deleting old code. If we let
LAddandLDelete denote the LOC added and deleted per
commit, respectively, then the change in LOC, or project
size, for each commit is:
L=LAdd LDelete: (1)
Similarly, we can also dene the eort expended as:
W=LAdd+LDelete: (2)
We note that eort may go into appropriately deleting lines
of code, which may result in a small, if any, size dierence
to the project code. Then, we ask,
Research Question 2: Do projects grow more, in
terms of larger  L, per commit, when developers par-
ticipate in synchronous development? Do developers
expend more or less eort, in terms of  W, during syn-
chronous development?
Software projects are inherently cooperative, which re-
quires many software engineers to coordinate their eorts in
order to produce a large software system [51]. Collaboration
between developers always involves coordination challenges,
which have been studied extensively [22, 25, 30], including
careful interview studies [23]. In OSS, coordination means
respecting others' work while making one's own work more
compatible with theirs. In other words, a developer adding
his lines of code tries not to aect much others' lines. This,
we expect, should be easier done during co-commit bursts.
Research Question 3: Are developers more eec-
tive in coordination, in terms of smaller LDelete per com-
mit, during co-commit bursts than outside of co-commit
bursts?
Communication is vital in making collaboration eective.
Since software developers in OSS projects work from wher-
ever they happen to be, electronic communications, such as
email, rather than traditional face-to-face conversations, are
preferred [47]. The public availability of email traces makes
it possible to analyze the relationship between commit and
communication activities. We have already found that com-
munication and commits accelerate each other in Apache
OSS projects [54]. Since communications are necessary for
collaboration, here it is natural to assume that synchronous
developments accompany communications very closely.
Research Question 4: What is the relationship
between C-bursts and E-bursts? Are more co-commit
bursts always accompanied with more email bursts?
Further, if there exists a positive relationship between the
C- and E-bursts, it is plausible that communication and syn-
chronous development are positively coupled, i.e., having
more of one increases the other.
Research Question 5: Are communication and syn-
chronous development activities positively coupled (in a
dynamic sense)? That is, will increase in one result in
increase in the other, shortly thereafter?2233. METHODOLOGY
Here we describe the mathematical framework we use to
make the concept of synchronous development more prac-
tical, based on time-series of commit and communication
activities of developers.
For an OSS project, we denote by Dthe set of developers
and byFthe set of les. For each developer d2D, let
T(d) be the sequence of their commit times. Since a devel-
oper may submit changes to several les at the same time,
letfi(d)Fthe subset of les to which developer dmade
changes at the i'th commit. For a pair of developers daand
db, we denote by 
( da;db) the sequence of their interleaved
email communications' times. We consider all communica-
tions undirected, thus, 
( da;db)
(db;da), for anyda;db.
We denote by a xed time-window, based on which we
dene the time-series of events we call co-commit bursts , or
C-bursts , and email bursts , orE-bursts .
Co-commit Bursts A co-commit burst, or C-burst, is a
sequence of temporally interleaved commit activities of two
developers such that each commit of the rst developer is
followed closely, within time , by a commit of the second
developer, and of the les the two commits modify at least
one is the same in both. More precisely, in a C-burst se-
quence, for every commit activity of the rst developer, da,
modifying a set of les fi(da) at timeti(da) in the burst,
there is at least one commit activity by the other devel-
operdbon the le set fj(db) at timetj(db) in the burst,
and no such activities outside of the burst exist satisfying
jti(da) tj(db)jandfi(da)\fj(db)6=;.
Based on the above denition we use a one-dimensional
clustering algorithm to identify C-bursts, as follows:
1. For each pair of developers daanddb,a6=b, we denote
byUthe sub-burst set, and set U=;.
2. For each commit of daat timeti(da)2T(da), it is in a
sub-burst if there is at least one commit of dbat time
tj(db)2T(db), such thatjti(da) tj(db)j, and the
same les were changed, i.e., fi(da)\fj(db)6=;. We
group all such commits of db, as well as the commit of
da, into the sub-burst, and record its time interval from
the rst commit to the last in the sub-burst. Then, we
add this sub-burst to U.
3. For all sub-bursts in U, we merge those with over-
lapping time intervals, and update the corresponding
start and end times of the burst.
4. The nal set of C-bursts for daanddbis denoted by
BC(da;db), with the occurrence time of each burst
given by the mean of its start and end times.
We note that the simpler approach of dividing develop-
ers' overlapping active-time intervals into successive time-
windows of the same length, and then checking for commits
to the same les in the same time-windows does not work
in general, as it results in breaking up a synchronous devel-
opment, especially when the synchronous development lasts
for a longer time.
Email Bursts An email burst, or E-burst, is a sequence
of temporally interleaved email communication activities of
two developers, such that the time interval between any two
successive emails in the burst is smaller than some minimal
time, say. Thus, for every pair of developers daanddb,
all their E-bursts are just the subsequences remaining afterexcising all intervals longer than from their sequence of
email communication activities occurring at 
( da;db).
Note that an E-burst is dierent from an email thread [43]
which is the group of emails referring to the same subject. In
contrast, an E-burst is determined by the time that emails
were sent and not their content.
3.1 Comparing Bursts via Smoothed Curves
Work related communications may occur before or after
the commit activities being discussed, as, e.g., plans or con-
clusions, respectively. Hence, C-bursts and E-bursts can
occur at non-overlapping time periods which makes it dif-
cult to gainfully correlate those time-series. In addition,
the bursts are, in general, non-regular time series, and also
discrete, and noisy.
To extract trends and patterns from such challenging time-
series, and at the same time reduce the eect of noise we use
smoothing . This technique reduces complexity in time-series
data and allows for easy comparison of the smoothed curves.
For the C-bursts and E-bursts we use Gaussian smoothing,
based on a symmetric bell curve [38], dened as:
f(x;) =1p
2e(x )2
22; (3)
whereis the position of the peak and controls the width
of the curve. An important character of the Gaussian func-
tion1is that it quickly decreases to zero when xgoes outside
of the range [  ;+].
For every two developers, let  Cand  Ebe the sets of
occurring times of their co-commit and email bursts, respec-
tively. Then, the corresponding smoothed bursts, C-curve
and E-curve , are dened as (jjis set cardinality)
'C(x) =1
j CjX
2 Cf(x;);'E(x) =1
j EjX
2 Ef(x;):(4)
If we let  be the time interval between the minimum
time and maximum time in  C[ E, then the corresponding
centralized curves on the whole  interval are calculated by
C(x) ='C(x) 1
ZU
L'C(x)dx; (5)
E(x) ='E(x) 1
ZU
L'E(x)dx: (6)
Then, we can measure the synchronization between the
two curves by calculating the Pearson correlation coecient
[9], dened as
R=RU
LC(x)E(x)dxqRU
L[C(x)]2dxqRU
L[E(x)]2dx: (7)
Based on this denition, Ris 1 whenC(x)E(x); it is
-1 whenC(x) E(x), and it is 0 when the two curves
are independent of each other.
3.2 Null Models
The values of the Pearson correlation coecients as calcu-
lated by Eq. (7) tell us the magnitude of the synchronization
between synchronous development and communication ac-
tivities of pairwise developers, but they don't specify if the
1We expect that the results will not change much if other
kernel functions are adopted.224Table 1: Basic properties of the six OSS projects.

synchronization is signicant statistically. To calculate the
signicance we conduct simulations to generate randomized
instances of our data.
We simulate random email communication time-series by
randomizing the time intervals between successive activities,
using a method we recently developed [54], summarized here
for completeness: First, for each pair of developers, let their
communications occur at the successive time t1;t2;:::;tn
in reality. Denote the n 1 ordered inter-communication
time intervals by  tk=tk+1 tk, withk= 1;2;:::;n 1.
Then, randomly rearrange them to get a new sequence of
time intervals, denoted by  ta
k,k= 1;2;:::;n 1. Finally,
weld these new ordered time intervals together to get a new
time-series ta

Such simulated email communication time-series have the
same distribution of time intervals as the empirical one. We
generate simulated E-curves with the above, and then cal-
culate the correlation coecients between the real C-curves
and the corresponding simulated E-curves for comparison.
Note that, to make the argument that synchronous de-
velopments occurs more frequently than by chance, we also
randomize the commit activities for each developer by the
same method, while keeping the order of each activity and
the associated les they access. Then, we enumerate the
simulated C-bursts for all pairs of developers and compare
them with the numbers of real C-bursts. In both cases, the
communication or committing activities are randomized one
hundred times.
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We obtained data for 31 OSS projects from the Apache
Software Foundation on March 24th, 2012. For each project,
the commit activities of developers on dierent les are gath-
ered from the corresponding Git repository while the email
communication activities are gathered from the online de-
veloper mailing lists. For each commit activity, we recorded
the developer ID, le ID, le type, the exact submitting time
in seconds, and the numbers of added and deleted LOC in
each le. For each communication activity, we recorded the
sender ID, receiver ID, and the sending time in seconds.
Note that, developers may have multiple aliases, which were
resolved by using a semi-automatic approach [5]. In this
paper, we focus on the six projects with most developers:
Ant,Axis2 java,Cxf,Derby ,Lucene , and Openejb , in order
to get most meaningful statistical results. Several of their
basic properties are presented in Table 12.

4.1 Synchronous Development Is Real
Based on the methods described above, we identify the C-
bursts for each pair of developers. To show that synchronous
development is a signicant emergence rather than a random
phenomenon that developers committed to the same les
at close time just by chance, we created simulated commit
time-series for each developer with our null model. Then,
by the same method, we also generated C-bursts for each
pair of developers based on their simulated co-commit time-
series. We nd that developers exhibit synchronous devel-
opment much more frequently than in the simulated case,
as indicated by the T-test results presented in Table 2. This
answers in the positive Research Question 1 . Note that the
number of C-bursts between a pair of developers is depen-
dent on the time window, e.g., it goes to zero when !0,
i.e., developers cannot commit to the same les at the ex-
actly same time, and it goes to one when !1 , if they
commit to at least one common le over the whole project
history. In reality, there may be several C-bursts for a pair
of developers.
There are some practical limitations on the size of the
burst time-window. It cannot be too narrow, otherwise the
daily work-rhythm and dierent time zones may have a sig-
nicant eect on the results. It also cannot be too wide,
otherwise the development cannot be considered synchro-
nized. Therefore, we chose 1 10 in this paper.225Table 3: The fraction of C-bursts in which at least one .java le was committed to by both developers.

4.2 Synchronous Development, Code Growth,
and Effort
Before we present the main results, it is worthwhile to
rst investigate the le types where synchronous develop-
ments occurred. Generally, there are always dozens of le
types in each OSS project, including .java ,.xml,.txt, and
so on. As expected, most C-bursts involved .java source
les, i.e., most pairwise developers committed to at least
one.java le when they work synchronously. The ratios of
.java les and the coverage ratios of these les on C-bursts
(over all C-bursts) for the six OSS projects under dierent
time-windows are presented in Table 3. We can see that,
besides synchronous development on source code, develop-
ers also spent at least one quarter of their C-burst time on
other kinds of les, e.g., writing documentation. Since .java
les are dominant in these OSS projects and most of the cre-
ations of developers are reected in their contributed source
codes stored in these les, in this part, we will mainly focus
on the eect of synchronous development on .java les.
Here, we also do not consider all the .java les, because
some of them may be committed to by developers separately
all the time and never be committed to by more than one
developer in the same C-burst, and thus they cannot provide
useful information for our study on identifying synchronous
development commit. Therefore, we will just focus on those.java les that were committed to by two or more devel-
opers in at least one same C-burst. For an OSS project,
we gather a list of les such that each is co-committed to
within C-bursts by two or more developers at some times
and committed to by a single developer outside of C-bursts
at some others. Then, we obtain the synchronous and non-
synchronous commit activities for all developers on each of
these les, and calculate the average number of added LOC,
LAdd, deleted LOC, LDelete , and Land Wper commit.
Figure 1 shows the box-and-whisker diagrams of  Ldur-
ing and outside of co-commit bursts, under dierent time-
windows from one day to ten days to visualize their dier-
ences in the six projects. We also use the T-test to ascertain
if the dierences are signicant. The statistical signicance
for each case is marked on the x-axis. E.g., \4*****" on
the x-axis of Figure 1 (a) means that the developers in the
project Antproduce more lines of code per commit during
co-commit bursts, with signicance p < 0:00001 when the
time window is set to = 4.
In general, we can see that for the four of six projects, in-
cluding Ant,Axis2 java,Cxf, and Openejb , the overall code
grows faster during synchronous development, in most cases,
answering largely positively Research Question 2 . More in-
terestingly, we nd that, for those relatively older projects
including Ant,Axis2 java, and Openejb , synchronous de-2261***** 2***** 34***** 5***** 6***** 7***** 8**** 9 10020406080100120

velopment has positive  Lwhile non-synchronous develop-
ment has negative  L, in most cases. For the relatively
younger projects Cxf and Derby , most commit activities,
synchronous or not, have positive  L. This interesting nd-
ing may indicate that these projects are in dierent stages of
development. The less signicant results in Lucene may be
partly attributed to the relatively fewer les and the lower
coverage ratio of .java les on C-bursts in this project. Con-
sidering all types of les together, we can still observe signif-
icantly faster code growth during synchronous development
in that project when = 3;6;7.
Similarly, we considered  W=LAdd+LDelete , as a proxy
for the total eort expended by developers. We found that
for all projects except CxfWwas signicantly smaller dur-
ing synchronous development than at other times. Again,
we hypothesize that the age of the project might be a sig-
nicant determinant to these results, but that needs further
study. We omit the boxplots due to space constraints.
Figure 2 shows the box-and-whisker diagrams of LDelete
during and outside of co-commit bursts, under dierent time-
windows. We can see that, for all six projects, developers
delete signicantly fewer LOC when they participate in syn-
chronous development in large majority of the cases, answer-
ing positively Research Question 3 . Note that we also did
these experiments by considering all types of les together,
and obtained similar results.
4.2.1 Case Study
To illustrate what goes on during synchronous develop-
ment, we looked at the content of emails between a pair of
developers in Derby . They have the most E-bursts that are
close to their C-bursts in the project, i.e., when the time
window is set to be = 1 (day), we nd 84 E-bursts near
and 184 E-bursts far from their C-bursts. An E-burst is
considered near a C-burst if their time periods overlap or
the gap between them is not larger than some threshold.Here, the threshold is set to be 10 days, in order to get a
comparable number of E-bursts near C-bursts. Although
much coordination among developers may not be explicitly
addressed in their emails, we still nd a number of such ex-
amples in the examined emails. We nd that the developers
provide suggestions3to improve the current work in 33/84
E-bursts near C-bursts, while the number signicantly de-
creases to 17/184 for those far from C-bursts. Due to space
considerations we just provide the following two examples.

Case #1 indicates that developers remind each other to do
more related work, and sometimes to add more comments to
make their work more clear for both of them. And case #2
indicates that developers indeed prefer solutions that didn't
require more code changes, i.e., they delete less code. Such
suggestions are provided more frequently when the develop-
ers work synchronously than at other times, in support of
the numerical results on Research Question 2 and Research
Question 3 .
4.3 The Role of Communication
As we established above, synchronous development is more
than a random phenomenon, therefore, communication is ex-
pected to play an important role in this process. In other
words, we expect that more communication is needed to
achieve and maintain synchronous development, and that
these two activities synchronize each other, i.e., they occur
close together in time.
First, by the correlation test for the numbers of C-bursts
and E-bursts, we nd that these values in all the six projects
under dierent time-windows are signicantly correlated with
each other with relatively high correlation coecients ( >0.5)
and small p-values ( <0.00001), as presented in Table 4, an-
swering Research Question 4 . In fact, when we consider all
pairs of developers in the six projects together, the relation-
ship between the number of C-bursts, denoted by NCand
that of E-bursts, denoted by NE, for pairwise developers
can be tted very well with the following linear model:
NC=NE+; (9)
with parameters (95% condence bounds) equal to =
0:2727 (0.2645, 0.2810) and = 0:1331 (0.0369, 0.2293)
when the time-window is set to be = 5 (day), which means
that, on average, we would expect one burst of co-commits
to the same les for every four bursts of email communica-
tions between two developers in these projects. The data
Figure 3: The relationship between the numbers of
C-bursts and E-bursts, where each point is a pair
of developers. All the developers in the six projects
are considered together here and the time-window
is set to be = 5(day). The data are tted by a lin-
ear function and smoothed by moving averages, with
span set to 11. The circled samples are discussed in
the case studies.
and t are shown in Figure 3, where we also show the good-
ness of t, including SSE, R-square, Adjusted R-square, and
RMSE. In addition to the data, on the plot we also show the
data smoothed by moving averages, with span of 11. The
overall, strongly linear, trend, is in support of Eq. (9) being a
suitable model here. The large variance of the original data
suggests that some developers may have unusual behavior,
discussed carefully in our case studies.
Because the number of E-bursts is a monotonically de-
creasing function of the time-window, the parameter may
steadily increase as the time-window increases. For exam-
ple, we nd that this parameter will be = 0:1216 (0.1168,
0.1263) and = 0:3538 (0.3442, 0.3634) when the time-
window is set to be = 1 (day) and = 10 (day), re-
spectively. Since we only consider the strictest synchronous
development that developers must co-commit to the exactly
same les at close times, it is not surprising to observe that
the slope of the linear model is much smaller than 1 even
for a large time-window. This is because, in reality, commu-
nications between developers may be about co-committing
synchronously on functionally related [24], rather than ex-
actly the same les, which we do not consider here.
4.3.1 Case Study
Although the numbers of C-bursts and E-bursts are lin-
early correlated on average, we can still nd pairs of de-
velopers that have extremely high ratios of C-bursts versus
E-bursts, and vice-versa, which may be determined by their
distinct roles in these projects, as indicated in Figure 3.
We selected ve pairs of developers with the highest C-
to E-burst ratios under the condition that the number of E-
bursts is larger than 50, and nd that the associated seven
developers are distributed in two projects, AntandCxf, and
centered by two Apache PMC chairs who spent quite a bit
of time on committing to les in these projects. We present
two of their emails in the following to show that they seem
engaged in commit activities to an extraordinary degree.228Case #3 in Ant[2003/07/16 1:44 PM]
Message: The other possibility is to write a routine of
the type public static le which ......
Reply: I have something close to that almost ready to

Message: I somehow neglected to commit most of what
I thought I committed last night ......
Reply: I gured you were doing something with ...... I

cruise control to stop spamming me .
We also selected ve pairs of developers with the lowest
ratio of C-bursts to E-bursts under the same condition and
at the same time have at least one C-burst. We nd that
the associated nine developers are distributed in Ant,Derby ,
and Openejb . The pair of developers with the lowest ratio
are from Ant and one of them is an adviser rather than a
committer at most time, as described on the Antwebpage:
He has been involved non-stop with the Ant user community
...... He is opinionated, always striving for the best possible
design . His role is also reected in the content of his emails,
one of which is selected as follows.
Case #5 in Ant[2006/10/24 8:56 AM]
Message: Contributor would be anybody who con-
tributes to the project in any way...... not necessarily
code contributions, it could be contributions to docu-
mentation or \just" discussions on the mailing lists.
Reply: Yes, ...... I might contribute ideas and opinion,
but I don't foresee having enough bandwidth for more.
4.4 Synchronous Development and Commu-
nication Are Coupled
Finally, how closely do synchronous development and com-
munication activities follow each other? Recall, we use C-
curves and E-curves as smoothed versions of the correspond-
ing bursts, Eqs. (5) and (6), respectively, and then measure
the synchronization4between synchronous development and
email communication activities by calculating the correla-
tion coecient between the corresponding C-curves and E-
curves, Eq. (7). The value of the correlation coecient tends
to 1 if the numbers of C-bursts and E-bursts are exactly the
same and they occur together at very close times, while it
tends to 0 if these two kinds of activities are independent
from each other.
We calculate the correlation coecients of C-curves and
the corresponding E-curves for all pairs of developers with
numbers of C-bursts and E-bursts both larger than ve for
the six projects, and then compare them with the results ob-
tained from the corresponding simulated curves created by
our null model. The results are presented in Table 5, where
we can see that the correlation coecients in the real case
are indeed signicantly larger than those in the simulated
4The synchronization we discuss here is not the strict syn-
chronization from mathematics, which is always expected to
be realized in innite time.Table 5: T-test for the dierence between the corre-
lation coecients of C-curves and the corresponding
E-curves in the real and simulated cases. Here, only
the pairwise developers with both numbers of C-
bursts and E-bursts larger than ve are considered.

case with relatively small p-values ( <0.00001), which indi-
cates the signicant synchronization between the two kinds
of activities, answering Research Question 5 . Here, it is ex-
pected that the correlation coecients tend to 0 in the simu-
lated case because the random mechanism of the null model
makes the synchronous development and simulated email
communication activities independent from each other. In
this experiment, we set the time-window = 1 (day) and
the curve parameter = 10, and the results are stable to
changes to other appropriate values. Note that correlation
coecient tends to 0 when !0 and tends to 1 when
!1 , thereforecannot be chosen too small or too large.
4.4.1 Case Study
The synchronization between email communication and
synchronous development is also partly reected in the con-
tents of some C-bursts and the accompanied E-bursts be-
tween developers. We manually sample two such cases in
Lucene as examples to see whether the developers discussed
the same les that they both committed to in the C-burst.
The time-window is set to be = 1 (day). The rst C-burst
occurred on Oct 30, 2009, from 12:45 PM to 5:11 PM with
the accompanied E-burst from 9:36 AM, Oct 29 to 9:37 PM,
Oct 30. And the second C-burst occurred from 8:29 AM,
Nov 16 to 3:03 PM, Nov 17 with the accompanied E-burst
from 4:42 PM, Nov 15 to 9:54, Nov 17.
We nd that the two pairs of developers commit to the
same le RussianLowerCaseFilter.java andStandardTokeniz-
erImpl.jex in the respective C-bursts, while the accompa-
nied E-bursts indeed recorded the discussion of the devel-
opers about these les and the related ones. Part of their
discussions in the E-bursts are listed below.

The signicant synchronization between synchronous de-
velopment and email communication indicates that there
are a considerable number of C-bursts that overlap with or
closely follow E-bursts. For a C-burst between two develop-
ers, denote by ts
Candte
Cits start and end time, respectively,
then it is called Email-inspired C-burst if we can nd an E-
burst between this pair of developers with its start and end
time equal to ts
Eandte
E, respectively, satisfying that the
time intervals [ ts
C ;te
C] and [ts
E;te

project, denote by NC

Inspired the average num-
bers of C-bursts and Email-inspired C-bursts between pairs
of developers in the real case, and by NC

age number of C-bursts between the corresponding pairwise
developers in the simulated case. Then, the relative email
usage when developing code with each other synchronously
can be measured by

We nd that developers are more likely to use email to coor-
dinate with each other in Derby andLucene , while the usage
of email is lower in Cxfand Openejb , as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Email use during synchronous develop-
ment.
One of the reasons may be that the latter two projects
provide other communication tools for users conspicuously.
For example, Cxfprovides the link to the Chinese language
CXF User's List available at Google Groups on its web-
site, and Openejb has a communication group on Twitter
(@OpenEJB). However, the higher ratio of email communi-
cations adopted by Derby and Lucene doesn't make the de-
velopers in these two projects easier to generate more lines of
codes when developing synchronously, as indicated by Fig-
ure 1. This phenomenon is interesting and suggests that,
comparing with the other more real-time communication
tools, email may not be the best choice to coordinate the
work between developers.
Note that here the value of PEmay be larger than 1 if
developers frequently communicate with each other by email
and the time-window is large enough. If there are several
alternative communication tools, and assuming one can get
all the communication records, this metric can be used to
measure the tendency of developers to use these tools to
coordinate their work with others.5. THREATS TO VALIDITY
There are a number of threats to this study. The six
OSS projects are selected from the same foundation and are
all written in java, which may limit the generalization of
the results. The methods therefore need to be tested on a
greater variety of OSS projects in the future.
We use LOC per commit, rather than per unit time, to
measure the code contribution of developers as it relates
to synchronous development, because it is much harder to
know the exact amount of time that developers took to write
those lines. We acknowledge that LOC is more about the
eort of developers than the code quality. Ideally, it is bet-
ter to use alternative measurements, e.g., the development
time of tasks [24] and the number of merge conicts, to
check the benets of synchronous development, however,
such measurements are relatively more dicult to obtain.
We believe that as we dened them, code growth,  L, to-
gether with eort,  W, are suitable to measure the eects
of synchronous development given the current data sets, es-
pecially since LOC has been used extensively to measure
the productivity of developers. Thus, LOC per commit is a
proxy of code contribution per developer. Our results indi-
cate that developers indeed become more ecient when they
synchronously collaborate with each other, i.e., contribute to
more code growth with less eort, which is well supported
by the clues found in their emails that developers reminded
each other more frequently to expand the current work and
make fewer changes to the original code when they develop
synchronously.
It may be argued that the code base grows more during C-
bursts because developers collaborate more on code that is of
signicant size or complexity, e.g. adding new features, while
cleaning up code may not require synchronous development,
hence more lines get deleted in solo mode. However, this
assumption is not simple to validate.
Another threat is that we only consider email communi-
cation here, while in fact developers may coordinate their
work via other communication tools. Such incompleteness
of data doesn't inuence the results on RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3,
since they only involve commit activities. However, it may
indeed inuence the results on RQ4 and RQ5 in the fol-
lowing several aspects. For RQ4, the slope of the linear
relationship between the numbers of C-bursts and E-bursts,
and the variance of the original data, as shown in Figure 3,
may be overestimated, since more E-bursts can be expected
when considering more communication records and devel-
opers may have dierent preference to use dierent commu-
nication tools. For RQ5, the positive correlation between
C-curves and E-curves may also be overestimated when de-
velopers are more likely to communicate with each other by
email when collaborating on same les synchronously and
by other tools otherwise.
6. RELATED WORK
Collaboration in Socio-Technical Systems Two in-
dividuals are collaborating if they contribute to the same
component of a particular socio-technical system. E.g., col-
laboration among scientists is mainly reected in their co-
authored papers [39, 40], while among musicians or actors
in their joint performances [18, 49].
Collaboration in OSS projects has dierent levels of mean-
ing due to the hierarchical structure of the artifact. Develop-230ers can be considered to collaborate when they have simply
worked on the same OSS projects [26, 42]. On the other
hand, if we are interested in a particular project and hope
to observe its generative process more carefully, the collab-
oration between developers can be seen in the co-commit
activities on same les in this project [46]. There may also
be other, more general collaborative activities, such as shar-
ing programming knowledge through communication tools
not ocially documented in the project [33], but such con-
tributions are dicult to quantify.
In most of these studies, developers are considered to col-
laborate with each other all the time if they contribute to
the same projects or commit to the same les. In contrast,
here we allow that developers collaborate with each other
at some time and work alone at other times, and quantify
those using C-bursts.
Synchronization in Nature and Society Synchroniza-
tion is a very common phenomenon in nature, underlying
most of the coordination processes on which biological sys-
tems rely, e.g., reies that ash in unison [37] and neural
activities in cognitive processing [17]. Recently, similar syn-
chronization mechanisms were used to explain the formation
of collective opinion [44] and the mimicry of online user ac-
tions [10]. As pointed out by Choudhury et al. , understand-
ing social synchrony can be helpful in identifying suitable
time points for intervention, e.g., viral marketing [10].
One of the most remarkable features of OSS projects is
that voluntary developers can work on the same artifacts re-
motely, which presents extra challenges for the coordination
between them due to the lack of face-to-face communica-
tion [23]. Recently, real-time remote communication tools,
such as Twitter, has been used to coordinate or synchro-
nize the work of developers, meanwhile, OSS sites like Ad-
vogato [32] and GitHub [14] already provide user proles so
developers can better understand the current focus of others,
and, thus, enable them to synchronize their commits.
Social individuals benet from synchronous behaviors [53].
For example, synchronized ashing helps male reies nd
females more frequently [8], while synchronized nonverbal
cues can inuence face-to-face communication in a posi-
tive manner [29]. Dabbish et al. suggested that awareness
of others' work can increase the eciency of coordination
among developers, using case interviews [14]. On the other
hand, Herbsleb et al. [24] described coordination as a dis-
tributed constraint satisfaction problem (DCSP) and found
that dense constraints, in terms of dependencies between de-
velopers or between software components, slow down devel-
opment, but don't signicantly aect productivity. In this
paper, we dene synchronous development between develop-
ers and nd that developers indeed benet from synchronous
development in terms of code contribution.
Communication in Synchronization Processes It is
well-known that communication plays an essential role in
synchronization processes [1], i.e., individuals can acquire
the current states of their neighbors via communication,
and adjust their own states correspondingly. OSS projects
blanket adopt or recommend for adoption to their partic-
ipants communication tools like email, Facebook, Twitter,
etc. [51]. Some researchers even advocate for the creation of
Software Immersion Environments where project artifacts
are arranged in physical 3D space [15], so that developers
can communicate and coordinate more directly, like in a real
world face-to-face communication.There are still debates on the eect of communication on
working eciency. For example, Herbsleb and Grinter [21]
found that lack of communication between software devel-
opers introduced more coordination problems. Gutwin et
al.[20] supported this viewpoint and suggested that dis-
tributed developers do need to maintain awareness of one
another by interviews and analyzing email messages in three
successful OSS projects, i.e., NetBSD ,Apache httpd , and
Subversion . On the other hand, however, it is also argued
that social communication have some negative eect on the
eciency of work-related activities [35], since both commu-
nication and working activities may compete for the time
resources of individuals [36, 56]. As a result, a large number
of companies have begun monitoring the usage of emails or
oce telephones, and employees face consequences for mis-
using them [11]. There is research that focuses on the design
of large systems with smaller communication overhead [2].
Communications are also used to build social networks in
OSS projects [5, 7, 48], evoking the studies to identify the
relationship between social structure and code properties [3,
55]. In this paper, we reveal strong correlation between com-
munication and synchronous development, which can help
to better understand when and how much communication is
necessary for ecient code development in OSS.
7. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we nd that synchronous development is far
more than a chance occurrence and plays an important role
in the development of OSS projects. We identied and quan-
tied the positive eect of synchronous development on the
contributions of developers and quantied its strong corre-
lation with email communication activities. Thus, this work
can help to better understand the role of communication
in the development process. Moreover, we also provide a
plausible metric to characterize the preference of develop-
ers to use a particular communication tool to coordinate
their work. The contrast between larger project growth and
smaller LOC eort expended during synchronous collabora-
tion is an interesting nding, which can inuence the way
distributed development is understood and conducted.
This work can be expanded in several ways. First, syn-
chronous development can be generalized beyond co-commit
to the same les at close time, to include functionally re-
lated les too, based on the dependence relationship be-
tween them. Second, larger-scale synchronous developments
can be revealed by similar methods since we expect that, in
many cases, more than two developers are needed to solve
more complex programming problems. Such a synchronous
development network can provide more information about
the organizational structure and then help to better under-
stand the collaboration mechanisms in large systems. Third,
alternative measurements, such as development time, the
number of merge conicts, and the number of bugs, can be
used to measure the eects of synchronous development on
coordination eciency more comprehensively.
