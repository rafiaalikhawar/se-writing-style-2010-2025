ABSTRACT
As modeling in software and system development becomes increas-
ingly prevalent, many engineers need to collaboratively develop
models spanning many disciplines such as requirements manage-
ment, system design, software, etc. However, integrating modeling
languages for various disciplines is challenging, because UML and
SysML are too complex for many engineers to understand. There-
fore, in complicated engineering processes, engineers with differ-
ent areas of expertise often ﬁnd it difﬁcult to access the same infor-
mation in different domain-speciﬁc modeling environments.
Our approach to address this problem is to share and edit the
models as task-oriented spreadsheets, using a uniﬁed model (in
UML or SysML) and a uniﬁed user interface (in the spreadsheet
program). The formats of the spreadsheets are optimized for var-
ious tasks while the target models remain in a uniﬁed modeling
language. Since the transformation between the spreadsheets and
the models is automated and transparent, users do not have to be
skilled with the modeling languages to edit the spreadsheets.
Using our novel approach, we were able to reduce the errors and
time, and also the difﬁculty for each task without providing special-
ized training for the engineers. A preliminary user study showed
that, by applying the spreadsheet-based approach, we could reduce
the number of errors with less time for typical systems engineering
tasks.

Modeling in many areas such as software, systems, and enter-
prises is maturing [37, 30, 19] because the higher levels of de-
scription during development are important to share information
and collaborate among engineers. For example, systems engineer-
ing must integrate many disciplines when developing large systems
and many engineers with different areas of expertise have to col-
laborate with each other [37]. Typically this involves project man-
agement, requirements management, system design, and domain-
speciﬁc tasks such as mechanical, software, and E/E (Electrical/-
Electronic) engineering.
However, integrating modeling languages for various disciplines
is not easy. Although UML [24] and SysML [25], an extension of
UML for Systems Engineering, are regarded as the most promis-
ing languages to unify modeling information in a single format,
many studies have reported that the complexity of UML is a seri-
ous concern [27, 23, 8, 28, 2]. Petre reported that the majority of
the informants did not use UML partly due to the overhead of un-
derstanding the notation [27]. Moody reported that the visual no-
tations of UML have many problems such as symbol redundancies
and excesses, visual ineffectiveness, and graphic complexity [23].
Dobing et al. concluded that UML is useful for clients and users
to participate in the development and reviews of artifacts, but many
UML components, especially class and activity diagrams, are not
well understood. They also concluded that UML should not be lim-
ited to software professionals, and a greater understanding of UML
in building systems is needed throughout organizations [8].
Although several existing studies addressed these problems by
simplifying the UML metamodel [11, 31], altering the metamodel
requires new modeling tools, new formats for models, and new
model data transformations, all of which are very high barriers to
delivering the new metamodels to the users. In our work, we ad-
dress this issue by introducing a simpliﬁed presentation to edit the
models while the underlying metamodels are unchanged.
We propose a novel approach to share and edit models us-
ing spreadsheets, our SpreadSheet-based Modeling (SSM) . It uses
spreadsheets as simpler notations to create, edit, and browse the
engineering information, and the formats of the spreadsheets are
optimized for various tasks and disciplines while the target models
are kept in a high-level UML or SysML representation. Since the
transformations between the spreadsheets and the uniﬁed models
are automated and transparent, users do not have to take spe-
cial care to conform to the modeling languages when editing the
spreadsheets with our novel modeling tool, the Model Spreadsheet
Platform (MSP) .
Although there are a number of existing CASE (Computer-Aided
Software Engineering) tools supporting import from or export to
spreadsheets, or editing model elements in tables or matrices, suchPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or

as Rational Software Architect, ReqPro, DOORS, and Rhapsody, to
the best of our knowledge, none of them support for interactively
editing both model elements and their relationships in tables by
using spreadsheets (Section 2). Since this feature is vital for SSM,
we illustrate it in Figure 1 with examples.
In the left panel, we show a model and a metamodel of our
model.CarYYY andCarXXX are instances of Car, andBike
Ais an instance of Bike . In addition, all of them are instances
ofVehicle .John andAlice are instances of the User meta-
class. Since the User metaclass owns the Vehicle metaclass,
the instances of User owns the instances of Vehicle as shown
in the diagram. All of the existing software can support limited ta-
bles as shown in (U), (B), and (C). In these tables, each instance has
its own record (row) that shows the attributes of the instance. We
cannot specify the relationships among vehicles and users in these
tables, and we need distinct tables to show instances of each meta-
class. Therefore, developing models by using the existing software
is not practical.
MSP provides a more ﬂexible spreadsheet format as shown in
(Z) by combining (U), (B), and (C) to provide a holistic view. In
this table, we can choose the second column or the third, forth and
ﬁfth columns to select Bike orCar metaclasses. If we change the
name ofAlice in Row 1 to Alicia , all theAlice cells in Lines
2, 3, and 5 are also automatically updated to Alicia in a just-in-
time manner. If we remove Line 1, the CarXXX instance will be re-
moved, and then Line 2 will also be removed. If we remove Line 2,
the dependency of ¿maintainedBy ÀfromCarXXX toAlice
will be removed. Manually maintaining such tables is too cum-
bersome for users. Therefore, interactive editing with automatic
updates is vital for modeling by spreadsheets. Even if we use ﬂex-
ible model transformations to import and export spreadsheets [4],
we need to manually maintain such consistencies in a table, which
is quite inefﬁcient for practical modeling.

Figure 1: Examples of Models and Tables
We summarize the merits of our approach of ﬂexibly-formatted
spreadsheet modeling environment as follows:
Wide Acceptance
Spreadsheets are familiar to most computer users. Almost all
of the project members, both non-technical people and engi-
neers, understand how to use spreadsheets. This means we
need less training for project members to use spreadsheets in
comparison to specialized tools. Although quite a few mod-
eling tools such as Rational Rhapsody and EMF [32] sup-
port tabular user interfaces, the conﬁgurable formats of these
tools are too limited, and the user interfaces discourage many
users. For example, we cannot cut and paste multiple cells
in such tables even though such operations are standard in
spreadsheets.Flexible but Controlled Experience
Although UML provides various sorts of diagrams and a
ﬂexible extension mechanism to describe a vast range of con-
cept for systems development, learning all of the language is
quite difﬁcult. Some researchers proposed adopting a crit-
ical subset of UML [2, 11], which could reduce the learn-
ing costs. This suggests that controlling the user experience
while retaining ﬂexibility is important for the practical use of
UML. SSM allows us to choose an optimized representation
for each model by using tables, matrices, or charts, which can
be integrated into a single workbook to specify a wide range
of systems development. Note that our basic approach is that
the spreadsheet models coexist with the diagrams rather than
replace them. We can choose the best method that matches
each task, since MSP provides real-time synchronization be-
tween the spreadsheets and the models, as addressed in Sec-
tions 3.4 and 4.
Uniﬁed Model
Editing uniﬁed models with various spreadsheet representa-
tions is vital to manage and reuse the engineering informa-
tion. MSP allows spreadsheet users to edit models based on
a MOF (Meta-Object Facility) such as those supported by
UML or SysML. This tool allows designing various spread-
sheet formats and the users can edit the models without deep
knowledge of the modeling languages. They only have to use
the spreadsheet to edit and browse the model information. In
addition, we can use other modeling tools that can access the
uniﬁed models.
We applied our MSP to the actual development of an automotive
transmission system that used four different types of representa-
tions. In Section 3, we describe the development method using
SSM by showing the spreadsheet formats for the tasks. In Sec-
tion 4, we give details about how we handled some selected tasks
with the tool chain using MSP. Section 5 evaluates SSM with an
experiment by executing the tasks covered in Section 3, and dis-
cusses the advantages and the disadvantages of our new approach.
Finally, Section 6 provides our conclusions.
2. RELATED WORK
Our work is built on top of various technologies in the area of
Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) in the sense that we use the
uniﬁed modeling languages to describe engineering information,
and propose a novel modeling tool that automatically offers a user-
friendly experience using spreadsheets with support for collabora-
tion. We classify these approaches based on three aspects: (1) Ex-
isting CASE tools supporting spreadsheets; (2) Automated mod-
eling tools with adaptive or customized user interfaces; and (3)
Model transformations for mapping models to tables.
Regarding (1), as stated in Section 1, we found that many ex-
isting modeling tools including Rhapsody have already introduced
features to edit models in tables or matrices and to import and
export spreadsheet ﬁles. However, to the best of our knowl-
edge, none of the existing tools supports direct editing capabil-
ity via these spreadsheets. While some tools such as Siemens
TeamcenterR°allow users to conveniently edit product information
by automatically importing and exporting spreadsheets [29], users
need to carefully edit the spreadsheets to avoid inconsistencies
because the tools do not synchronize with the data managed by
the tools before importing the spreadsheets. In addition, no tools
support the editing of model elements and their relationships in an
integrated table. MSP is the ﬁrst attempt to implement a spread-
sheet user interface as part of a modeling environment, and thus979we were able to design a ﬂexible spreadsheet format for editing the
models, which is critical for the SSM approach.
In the area of spreadsheet user interfaces and modeling, Gen-
cel [12], ClassSheets [10], and its successor, MDSheet [6] provide
spreadsheet interfaces for UML models. First, these tools are dif-
ferent in scope from our work: they offer frameworks for model-
driven software development for buisiness applications, while our
MSP is intended for engineers who need to work with UML/SysML
models. Second, while ClassSheets models can be transformed
into UML models, they do not support the editing of existing UML
models (though this is mentioned as future work in [10]). In con-
trast, MSP allows users to work with various types of models with
a standard interface: Engineers can open, edit and save model ﬁles
through the spreadsheets with MSP.
For Aspect (2), EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework) [32] and
GMF (Graphical Modeling Framework) [34] from the Eclipse
Project are well known frameworks to support various DSM (Do-
main Speciﬁc Modeling) tools. Developers can design their own
DSM with little effort by using them. Our MSP also uses EMF
internally to manage the logical object model and to generally
support DSMs. TIGER (Transformation-Based Generation of
Modeling Environments) [9] and VMTS (Visual Modeling and
Transformation System) [20] addressed the needs for ﬂexible pre-
sentation frameworks to support multiple views for modeling. The
work is related to ours in the sense that we want to provide an
optimized interface for modeling. However, they do not support
any spreadsheet interfaces.
For Aspect (3), MSP is technically classiﬁed as automated map-
ping between models and spreadsheets. For transparent editing,
MSP also provides bidirectional transformations. Since model
transformation is one of the core technologies in MDA, there have
been many research projects in this area [7]. However, there are
no studies that share our goals other than MDSheet and the related
tools. Although many tools such as the Eclipse M2T Project [35]
and Rational Publishing Engine [13] provide features to present
models as tables by using templates, they only support one-way
transformations and thus do not provide editing functions. Mi-
crosoft Ofﬁce Excel Injector [4] provides a function to transform
between Excel ﬁles as XML documents and models by using
ATL [15], they also lack editing functions.
3. EXAMPLES OF SSM
In this section, we show examples of the spreadsheets and ex-
plain how to edit the models via the spreadsheets. Figure 2 shows
the modeling process used in this example. In each pentagonal
symbol, we show a name and a typical role for the task, because
we assume that various engineering roles are required for this pro-
cess. These tasks can be grouped into two phases. The upper phase
is responsible for managing requirements, and the lower phase is
for developing target systems satisfying the requirements. Since
typically we need different types of people and information for
these two phases, communicating consistenly in uniform informa-
tion presentations throughout the process is challenging. First, in
Section 3.1, we show an overall view of the models of this example.
Next, in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, we explain how we can effectively
use the spreadsheets to describe the models and provide controlled
and efﬁcient user experiences for each role to process each task.
3.1 Example Models
As mentioned in the introduction, we manage all of the engineer-
ing information in SysML, and each process accesses the uniﬁed
repository to edit the information. We use a standard SysML editor
(Rational Rhapsody) and MSP to compare the productivities of thetwo modeling approaches.
The target product was a transmission system for an automo-
bile, which involves multiple disciplines spanning software design,
mechanical engineering, and control systems. We assume many
engineers in the various disciplines collaborate to perform these
tasks. More speciﬁcally, the stakeholders are the sources of the re-
quirements in Requirements Acquisition; the system analysts are
responsible for analyzing the requirements and deriving the func-
tional requirements; the software engineers are responsible for de-
veloping the software design of the system in Design Synthesis;
and the customization engineers are responsible for customizing
the system by tuning the parameters in Customization; and all of
the engineers need to ensure the Traceability by managing the links
among the artifacts during the various tasks.
Note that this example does not include state machine dia-
grams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, nor parametric dia-
grams [25], but MSP can also support such models. Since MSP
regards models as directed graphs, and transforms such graphs into
records by querying the model elements, it covers any types of
models as directed graphs, which we will explain in Section 4. We
had already applied these diagrams to MSP and SSM, mainly for
supporting the Design Synthesis task, where we need to design the
dynamic behaviors and constraints of systems.

Figure 2: General form of the modeling process
In Figure 3, we show the models of this example as diagrams
and spreadsheets. The parts denoted by (UR), (FR), and (SA) are
SysML diagrams of the requirements and blocks. The parts de-
noted by (a-1)-(c-3) are spreadsheet representations. Notice that
Part (X-n) of the diagrams corresponds to Part (x-n) of the spread-
sheets, where X is capitalized and x is lowercase. For example, Part
(A-1) corresponds to Part (a-1).
3.2 Requirements Modeling
In the upper phase, we manage all of the requirements that the
target product must satisfy. In the step of Requirements Acqui-
sition, we collect and list all of the original requirements coming
from the stakeholders, which we call the upper-level requirements.
The input is typically in the form of documents from the stakehold-
ers. In the following step, Requirements Analysis, we identify all
of the functions of the system by deriving the upper-level require-
ments, which we call the functional requirements.
This upper phase needs a comprehensive view of all of the re-
quirements to browse and check them, since any incorrect or miss-
ing requirements in this phase will lead to project failure [3, 36].
For this purpose, we need a ﬂexible tool to analyze and edit many
items, with view-related functions such as sort and ﬁlter to check
the consistency and the coverage of the full set of requirements.
Tabular formats satify these needs and are widely accepted for re-
quirement analysis. The SysML standard [25] deﬁnes an exception
for a tabular format to present the requirements in other ways than a
diagram format, and many requirements management tools such as
Rational DOORS also provide tabular formats to edit requirements.
In SSM, we exploit spreadsheet functions to achieve these aims. In

(a) shows the corresponding requirements in the form of spread-
sheets. (Due to space limitations, we intentionally removed some
requirements from the diagrams.) In this example, MSP shows the
upper-level requirements horizontally (a-1) and the functional re-
quirements vertically (a-2), and displays the ¿derivedReq Àde-
pendencies in the matrix (a-3). At the same time, we can specify
which attributes of each requirement should be displayed in the
conﬁguration of MSP, so we show IDs, Names, Speciﬁcations, and
Kinds and Categories of the tag values of these requirements in this
example.
In this spreadsheet, we can insert or update new columns to
create or update upper-level requirements. Likewise, we can insert
or update new rows to create or update functional requirements
by using standard spreadsheet operations. By setting or clear-
ing an ’X’ value for cells in the matrix, we can create or delete
¿derivedReq Àdependencies. MSP transparently handles al-
most all of the spreadsheet operations such as cut, paste, insert, and
delete, and also provides an import function by inserting entries
from external spreadsheets into the spreadsheet currently being
edited, which are then reﬂected into the model. These functions
are convenient to help input many entries into the models.
Operations that improperly change the layouts of the spread-
sheets will be blocked by MSP with an error message. For example,
moving the positions of tables or matrices, or adding or removing
certain rows in horizontal tables (e.g. Table (a-1)), or adding or re-
moving certain columns in vertical tables (e.g. Table (a-2)) will be
blocked. This feature is important to guide users in correctly edit-
ing the models as spreadsheets, since users would frequently break
the layouts of the spreadsheets without such protection.
3.3 Design Modeling
In the lower phase, we complete the design of the target system
that satisﬁes all of the requirements deﬁned in the upper phase. In
the step of design synthesis, by considering the functional require-
ments, we create speciﬁcations for the component systems by de-
ciding on their architectures and behaviors. This process requires
sophisticated engineering expertise for covering the functions pro-
vided by each component. Since these decisions typically have ma-
jor impacts on the products of the systems engineering [16], we
need to carefully review and verify whether or not the results sat-
isfy the requirements.
In contrast to the upper phase, software engineers have to deal
with relatively more complicated structures and behaviors of the
target systems such as architectures, activities, and states. How-
ever, especially in complex system designs, engineers often need
to reuse existing assets and incrementally improve them. In typical
cases, some templates should already be prepared and engineers
will need to change the existing designs by following these tem-
plates. Therefore, we need a tool that can control the user experi-
ences both for ﬂexible and formulaic editing to ﬁt each situation.
In SSM, we support ﬂexible template design with the spread-
sheets. In Figure 3, Panel (SA) deﬁnes the system architecture
in the block deﬁnition diagram, and Panels (b) and (c) show the
corresponding information in the spreadsheets. Panel (b) focuses
on the hierarchy of the architecture, and Panel (c) focuses on the
¿satisfy Àdependencies between the functional requirements
and the architecture.
In Panel (b), the ﬁrst column (b-1) lists the top level block, the
GearShiftContext in (B-1), the second column (b-2) lists the
second level blocks in (B-2), and the third column (b-3) lists the
third level blocks in (B-3). By using Spreadsheet (b), the engineers
can only create or delete blocks, or change the names of blocks,or change the hierarchy of blocks. They cannot change anything
else in this sheet, such as editing the attributes or dependencies. If
some spreadsheet templates predeﬁne top level components, e.g.
GearShiftContext , engineers can extend them by deﬁning a
new component hierarchy. Unlike diagram editing in which users
can change any model elements, spreadsheet editing can effectively
control the user’s experience. Even if some diagram editing tools
protect users from editing certain model elements, they will not be
able to quickly understand what operations are allowed based on
how they appear in the diagrams.
In Spreadsheet (c), Part (c-1) lists the functional requirements
corresponding to Part (FR), Part (c-2) lists the blocks correspond-
ing to Part (SA), and Matrix (c-3) shows the ¿satisfy Àdepen-
dencies corresponding to Part (C-3). By using this spreadsheet, the
software engineers can check whether or not all of the requirements
are satisﬁed by the design by using a spreadsheet ﬁlter function as
explained in Section 3.2.
For parameter tuning for customization, the beneﬁts of the con-
trolled user experience are large. Since the customization engineers
do not need to change any design artifacts other than the parame-
ters, the modeling tool insures that they focus only on editing the
parameters. In our example, Part (d-1) in the spreadsheet (d) sim-
ply lists the parameters to be edited that are associated with the at-
tributes of the blocks of Part (SA). Part (d-2) shows the calculated
values from the parameters in (d-1) by using spreadsheet equations.
Part (d-3) shows a graph of the values in (d-2). The customization
engineers can concentrate on the parameters and the expected re-
sults by working on this spreadsheet. Spreadsheet modeling is quite
suitable to provide these focused user experiences.
There are limitations in spreadsheet editing, since it does not
present the shape of the structures of the model elements. For ex-
ample, in Figure 3, the engineers can organize the software com-
ponents, which are ShiftController andClutchSignal-
Generator , and place them close together to imply that they
should be grouped. In contrast, in the spreadsheets (b) and (c), such
groupings are not visible. In addition, users can attach more shapes
and ﬁgures to the diagrams to convey their intentions. These fea-
tures of the diagrams are beneﬁcial for engineers to illustrate new
concepts.
3.4 Synchronization of Models and Spread-
sheets
Since our approach is designed to support synergy between
the diagrams and spreadsheets as mentioned in Section 1, MSP
can synchronize the changes between the spreadsheets and mod-
els. When users change the models by using Rhapsody, they
can get the feedback in the spreadsheets, and vice versa. There-
fore, when a system analyst changes some functional requirements
in Sheet (a) in Figure 3 with MSP, the software engineers will
receive the updates by using Rhapsody, allowing them to im-
prove the design models to satisfy the updated requirements, since
many modeling tools support diagram updates (which is called the
populateDiagram feature in Rhapsody).
In a similar way, when users update the models via the dia-
grams, MSP automatically updates the spreadsheets as speciﬁed
by the conﬁguration. For example, if the systems engineers change
the¿satisfy Àdependencies between the requirements and the
blocks in Diagram (FR), the system analysts can see the updates in
Sheet (c).
With this synchronization feature, MSP works well with the ex-
isting modeling environments such as Rhapsody, and this makes
SSM applicable to the iterative processing between Design Synthe-
sis and Requirements Analysis, as shown in Figure 2.9824. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
In this section, we describe the details of MSP that allow us to
implement the examples described in Section 3. In brief, MSP can
be viewed as a modeling environment on top of a spreadsheet that
maps between the data of other models and spreadsheets.
4.1 Overview of MSP
Figure 4 shows the major components, inputs, and outputs of
MSP. It uses a spreadsheet as a presentation component, i.e. MSP
updates cells in spreadsheets to display the model data, and receives
each user’s input from the spreadsheets as change events. In the
current implementation of MSP, we used Microsoft ExcelTM[21]
as the spreadsheet, and thus users see just Excel windows when
editing models.
We call the spreadsheets controlled by MSP “model spread-
sheets” and they allow us to edit model objects through the spread-
sheet UI (User Interface). More speciﬁcally, MSP loads model
objects from a Rhapsody model ﬁle via the Rhapsody API [14]
when a model spreadsheet is opened, and presents the informa-
tion on the spreadsheets. MSP updates the loaded model objects
whenever the model spreadsheets are updated, and MSP saves the
changed model objects in the target model ﬁle when the model
spreadsheets are saved.
We are able to design the model spreadsheet by deﬁning a con-
ﬁguration ﬁle in which we deﬁne the mappings between the logical
tables and the model objects and also the layouts of the tables in the
spreadsheet. MSP transforms the model objects into logical tables
that are deﬁned as collections of records, and then presents these
logical tables in one of three types of layouts: a vertical table, a
horizontal table, or a matrix. MSP uses the ranges of the spread-
sheets feature to synchronize the data with the model, by creating a
range for each table and matrix to catch any changes of the range.
MSP ignores any other changes not in these ranges, and blocks any
operations that try to move or delete these ranges.
MSP automatically maintains the consistency of the spreadsheet
data. This is one of the major reasons why we need model spread-
sheets for SSM, as stated in Section 1.
4.2 Conﬁgurations of MSP
In MSP, a conﬁguration ﬁle speciﬁes how to organize the ver-
tical and horizontal tables and matrices by ﬂexibly querying the
model objects. The major feature for model spreadsheets is to up-
date the spreadsheet information from the updates of the model ob-
jects without conﬂicts, and vice versa. In general, MSP regards
the insertion and deletion of a record as the addition and deletion
of a model element. We will clarify this mechanism by using an
example, which corresponds to the example in Figure 1. We ﬁrst
show an example model in Figure 5 and an example conﬁguration
in Figure 6. In the following sections, we elaborate the features of
MSP: (1) tree-based model-to-table transformation, (2) model edit-
ing via tables, and ﬁnally (3) the formal syntax and semantics of
the conﬁguration.
Figure 4: Arcthitecture Overview of MSP4.2.1 Trees to Construct Records of Tables
MSP uses trees as intermediary data structures to transform
model objects into records. In Figure 7, we show an intermediary
tree and the corresponding table deﬁned in Line 1 in Figure 6. The
lines starting from dim in Figure 6 are called dimensions , by which
we deﬁne the nodes of such trees, called dnodes , by associating
them with the model elements speciﬁed in the path expressions.
Line 2 deﬁnes uDim consisting of the User model elements in
theownedElement1of the root (the Pkg package), which are
Alice andJohn . Each dimension may have an arbitrary number
of columns. A dnode of Dimension uDim has auName column by
extracting the value of the name attribute from the model element
associated with the dnode. As shown in the left panel of Figure 7,
the two dnodes of Dimension uDim associated with Alice and
John under Root were created because Line 1 speciﬁes the main
table starts from the uDim dimension.
Since Line 1 continues (bDim | (cDim, dDim)) , the child
dnode can be either bDim or(cDim, dDim) , which is called an
alternative operation. This means that if the path of bDim , that is
./ownedElement[Bike] , matches,bDim should be applied;
otherwise, if the path of cDim , that is./ownedElement[Car] ,
matches,cDim should be applied, and then dDim will be applied
if it is possible. Therefore, bDim is applied to the Bike A model
element, and cDim is applied to the CarXXX andCarYYY model
elements. Since dDim is applied only to cDim , the dnodes of Di-
mensiondDim associated with DepX andDepY are the children of
the dnodes of CarXXX andCarYYY , respectively.
Next MSP organizes a logical table by translating the path from
the root to each dnode of the dimensions marked as rec, which we
callrec dimensions, into a record, as denoted by the dotted lines
in Figure 7. We do not create distinct records for uDim because
it is not a rec dimension. MSP uses named perspective [1] to
construct a record as a tuple. For example, the ﬁrst record in Fig-
ure 7 is constructed as <uName:Alice, regID: CarXXX,
AT: TRUE> , which comes from the pairs of the name and the
value of the columns. The columns that do not have any values are
called empty columns and are grayed out.
Then MSP lays out these logical tables as named tuples into hor-
izontal (as shown in (a-1) and (c-1) of Figure 3) and vertical tables
(in (a-2), (b), (c-2), and (d)), and matrices (in (a-3) and (c-3)). To
present the records in vertical or horizontal tables, we specify the
cell addresses associated with the column names of the record def-
inition in an Excel template. For example, when we specify the
column names as uName ,bName ,regID ,AT, anddName in this
order in the cell range of B3:F3 , we obtain the vertical table (Z) in
Figure 1. Likewise, when we specify these names in the cell range
ofB3:B7 , we obtain a horizontal table by transposing the rows
and columns of Table (Z). To show these tuples in a matrix, we
combine vertical and horizontal tables with matrix cells by speci-
fying which ﬁelds in a record are shown in horizontal and vertical
tables of the matrix, and which ﬁeld is shown in the matrix cells.
For example, when we specify uName is presented in a vertical ta-
ble,bName andregID are shown in a horizontal table, and AT
is shown in matrix cells, we obtain the matrix shown in Figure 8.2
In this way, by separating the logical table structures and layouts,
MSP can ﬂexibly map the model data into spreadsheets.
Regarding the scalability of MSP, each of the created records cor-
responds to a dnode of rec dimensions. Therefore, roughly speak-

2All the key ﬁelds in the logical table must be speciﬁed in vertical
and horizontal tables of the matrix to ensure more than one tuple is
not assigned to one matrix cell.983/g855/g3/g17/g349/g364/g286/g3

ing, the number of rows in the vertical tables is proportional to the
number of dnodes of rec dimensions, and the sizes of the matrices
are proportional to the squares of these dnodes. Because modern
spreadsheet programs can support more than one million rows [22],
we easily handled more than one hundred thousand model elements
in MSP. Although this is adequate for practical use, MSP should
support a model database or repository for large-scale model edit-
ing, which is future work.
4.2.2 Editing Models via Tables
MSP allows the users to edit the models via tables by translating
(a) insertions, (b) deletions, and (c) updates of records into addi-
tions, removals, and updates of model elements, respectively. As
shown in Figure 7, each dnode is associated with a model element.
We illustrate each of these three operations.
Regarding (a) the insertion of a record, MSP ﬁrst interprets it as
the insertion of some dnode. MSP uses the key columns to iden-
tify which dnode is to be inserted. In Figure 6, uName ,bName ,
regID , anddName are key columns, and each dimension must
have at least one key column to identify the dnode from the values
of the columns. By matching the key columns from the ﬁrst dnode
of the table, we can identify a path through the dnodes from the
root. If the path fully matches an existing path, MSP reports an
error to force the user to input the correct keys in the corresponding
cells to avoid inserting a duplicate record in the table. Otherwise,
MSP identiﬁes a path through the dnodes to be added.
In Figure 9, we show an example of inserting records into the
main table. In Case (I1), since CarZZZ does not match any record

Figure 9: Inserting records into the example table
in the table, a new dnode of Dimension cDim will be created. Note
that users need to input the key columns of one of the dimensions
in the alternative operation to identify it in the insertion record.
Thus, in this case, the bName should not be input even if it is a key
column. After that, by inserting row (I2), a new dnode of dDim
will be created because CarZZZ matches the existing dnode. MSP
allows adding only one dnode of the rec dimension in each record
insertion, because all of the dnodes of the rec dimensions must
have a one-to-one mapping with records. Thus, if we insert row
(I2) before inserting row (I1), MSP will report an error.
After identifying the dnodes to be added, we need to translate
them into the additions of the corresponding model elements. For
this purpose, we deliberately designed the speciﬁcation of a path
expression to derive a model element satisfying a path expression
(see Section 4.2.3 for details). For row (I1), MSP creates a Car
model element to satisfy the path expressions of the cDim , and then
sets the attributes of regID toCarZZZ andATtoTRUE based on
the column deﬁnitions and the ﬁelds of the record. Finally, MSP
adds this model element to the ownedElement of the model el-
ement associated with the parent dnode (which is the John model
element).
When inserting row (I2), we need to add a model element cor-
responding to the dnode of the dDim . In this case, MSP cre-
ates aDependency model element in the ownedElement of
CarZZZ . IndependsOn , we can only set relationships and can-
not add any model elements. Therefore, MSP tries to set the
dependsOn relationship by searching for a model element of the
type ofUser that matches the value of name , which isAlice in
this case. If this fails, then MSP reports the error that it cannot ﬁnd
any reference targets.
Regarding (b) the deletion of a record, since each record has a
corresponding dnode that has a corresponding model element, MSP
simply removes the model element.
Regarding (c) the update of a record, in a similar way, MSP up-
dates the corresponding model elements by considering the column
deﬁnitions and the ﬁelds of the record.
As soon as the models are updated, Rhapsody checks the valid-
ity of the updates, e.g., equality and uniqueness of model element
names, and if any of them are now invalid, MSP reports an error.
If Rhapsody accepts these changes, then MSP updates the tables to
reﬂect the changes. For this purpose, MSP uses the EMF notiﬁca-
tion mechanism [32] to receive the changes in the models.
4.2.3 Syntax and Semantics of Conﬁguration
To deﬁne the syntax of the conﬁguration of MSP, we assume
countably inﬁnite sets of the names of tables, dimensions, and col-
umns, ranging over X, Y , and Z, respectively. Then the deﬁnitions984of table and dimension are then deﬁned as:
T ::= X (table name)
Y (dimension name)
Y"," T (sequence)
T"|" T (alternative)
D ::="rec" ? P ("," C)* (dimension)
C ::="key" ? Z"=" P (column),
where P is a path expression. The bindings of table and dimension
names are given by a single, global set of deﬁnitions of the forms
oftable X = T anddim Y = D , respectively. For simplicity,
in this grammar, we consider only the normal form of table deﬁni-
tions, which is deﬁned as:
table X =X1j:::jXj
table X1=Y1;1; :::; Y 1;k1
:::
table Xj=Yj;1; :::; Y j;kj
To reduce the table deﬁnitions to the normal form, we assume
the sequence, ",", and alternative, "|", operators are associative,
and the sequence operators is distributive over the alternative op-
erator, i.e.,(T1jT2); T3= (T1; T3)j(T2; T3)andT1;(T2jT3)
= (T1; T2)j(T1; T3). Then by considering Yis atomic in the al-
gebra, we obtain the normal form by taking a sum-of-products [17].
For example, Line 1 in Figure 6 can be reduced to:
table main = X1 | X2
table X1 = uDim, bDim
table X2 = uDim, cDim, dDim
whereX1andX2are temporary table names.
Before giving a formal deﬁnition of the path expression, we need
to give a deﬁnition of a model in MSP as:
DEFINITION 1.A model is a tuple M= (W; S; N; V; E; f; n 0),
where WandSare sets of type names and labels, Nis the
ﬁnite set of nodes of the model, Vis a set of values, Eµ
(N£S£N)[(N£S£V)is the edge set, f2N!Wis a
function to map nodes into type names, and n02Nis a root node.
Each named edge e2Eassociates a node with a node or a value.
The path expression is designed based on a subset of the notation
of XPath [5], though we intentionally eliminated many complicated
expressions that prevent editing models via tables. The formal syn-
tax of a path expression is deﬁned as:
P ::="/" (root only)
Pc (otherwise)
Pc ::= "." (current)
"/" A (child 1)
Pc"/" A (child 2)
A ::= S (path element)
S"[" Q"]" (path element with qualiﬁer)
Q ::= Q "," Q (sequence)
W (type name)
S"="V (equality expression)
The semantics of the path expression is given by the matching re-
lation n`x2P, where ois a context node of the match. This
relation is read “Value or node xis matched by Punder the current
nodeo,” and the matching rules are deﬁned as:
n02"/" (ROOT) o`o2"." (CUR)o` 9n2P(n; s; x )2E
o`x2P&"/"s(CHILD )
o`n2P n`Q
o`n2P"["Q"]"(QUALIFIER )
n`Q1::: n`Qk
n`Q1",":::","Qk(SEQ)
w=f(n)
n`w(TYPE)n`(n; s; v )2E
n`s"="v(EQ),
where P&"/" means it adds “/” to P only if P is not “/”.
Notice that we can derive model elements from path expressions.
For this purpose, by not discriminating between type names and
types, we can deﬁne a function g2Q!Wto map qualiﬁers to a
model element type as:
g(q) =8
<
:g(q1)\g(q2)( ifq= (q1; q2))(1)
q ( ifq2W) (2)
> ( otherwise ) (3);
where >is the top type, and it is EObject in EMF. As shown
in Equation (1), we assume that we can obtain the intersection of
types. We also assume f¡1exists, which means we can instantiate
a model element from a type name. If either of these operations
fails, then MSP reports the error that it failed to create a model ele-
ment of that type. Then the derivation rules from a path expression
to model elements can be given as:
"/"! fn0g(INV-ROOT)o`"."! fog(INV-CUR)
o`m2P
o`P&"/"s! f(m; s; f¡1(>))g(INV-CHILD 1)
o`m2P m`Q!E
o`P&"/"s[Q]! f(m; s; f¡1(g(Q)))g [E(INV-CHILD 2)
n`Q1!E1::: n`Qk!Ek
n`Q1",":::","Qk!E1[:::[Ek(INV-SEQ)
n`s"="v! f(n; s; v )g (INV-EQ)
With these rules, starting from path expressions, we can derive the
nodes, edges, and values to be created in the model.
The semantics of a table deﬁnition can be given as model-to-
tree relations, n`T)t, where we assume the set of unranked
and unordered trees, TL, over dnodes, L, deﬁned as L=fÁg [
D£N£R£:::£R, where Áis a root node of a tree and each
R=Z£Vis a pair of a column name and a value. This relation
is read “The tree t is related to the table T under the dnode n.” By
using this relation, we can derive the tree tfrom the model Mand
the table deﬁnition Tbyn0`T)t.
In order to derive these relations, we regard a table deﬁnition T
as a set of trees, i.e.T22TL, which is deﬁned as:
D= Dim( Y)o`l2DNode( l)`T=ft1; :::; t kg
o`l(t1; :::; t k)2Y","T(CHILD )
D= (y; P; c 1; :::; c k)l= (D; n; r 1; :::; r k)
o`n2P8i2 f1; :::; kgn`ci)ri
o`l2D(DIM)985c= (z; P)r= (z; v)o`v2P
o`c)r(COLUMN )
o`t2T1
o`t2T1"|"T2(ALT-1)o`t =2T1o`t2T2
o`t2T1"|"T2(ALT-2),
where Dim (Y)is the dimension named Y, and Node (l)isnfor
l= (D; n; r 1; :::; r k). Then we derive a tree from a set of trees, T,
by adding the root node, which is deﬁned as:
o`T=ft1; :::; t kg
o`T)Á(t1; :::; t k)(ROOT)
5. EV ALUATION
We conducted a preliminary study by comparing the productiv-
ities of the approaches of SSM and General-Purpose-tool-based
Modeling (GPM). Our objectives in this study are to evaluate (1)
whether or not SSM allows a wider range of users to perform typ-
ical modeling tasks, and (2) what errors typical users made with
SSM, compared to those made with GPM, to improve our approach
and MSP.
5.1 Method
We chose seven participants from various disciplines, (1) a sys-
tems engineer, (2) a control system engineer, (3) a database engi-
neer, (4) an application software engineer, (5) an embedded soft-
ware engineer, (6) a veriﬁcation engineer, and (7) a project man-
ager, to cover a wide range of roles in practical engineering projects
by following the research so that we would cover more roles rather
than increase the number of participants [18]. Three of the par-
ticipants (the systems engineer, the application software engineer,
and the veriﬁcation engineer) had more than ﬁve years of experi-
ence in SysML modeling, and the rest had less than three years of
experience. All of the participants were familiar with Excel and
Rhapsody.
Our research involved about two hours of work for each partic-
ipant. First, we explained the diagrams and spreadsheets shown in
Figure 3, and provided a short tutorial on editing models by using
MSP and Rhapsody, which typically took thirty minutes, and then
gave a task script for predeﬁned tasks with MSP. After a ﬁfteen-
minute break, each participant performed the equivalent tasks with
Rhapsody. This order was intentionally determined because we
wanted to estimate the worst-case performance of SSM by giving
a handicap to GPM for the task-learning effects. Finally, we con-
ducted an interview to get detailed feedback.
We designed these tasks by reducing typical tasks in automo-
tive development to reﬂect practical usage, since for such complex
product development, we need to make small changes to reduce
the impacts of each change. We used an automobile transmission
SysML model consisting of about 100 blocks and 50 requirements,
and asked each participant to perform four tasks. The ﬁrst task was
to create ﬁve requirements, each of which consists of an ID, Name,
Speciﬁcation, Kind, and Category. The second task was to cre-
ate six requirements by deriving from the ﬁve requirements created
in the ﬁrst task by using the ¿derivedReq Àdependencies. The
third task was to edit seven SysML blocks by using compositions,
and then create seven ¿satisfy Àdependencies for the prede-
ﬁned requirements. The fourth task was to manage the traceability
among the blocks and requirements by moving two dependencies
and creating three new dependencies with the ¿satisfy Àstereo-
type.5.2 Results and Discussion
Figure 10 shows the results of the experiments. These results
show that SSM is more efﬁcient in both time and accuracy than
GPM, although the number of errors the participants made varied.
In our detailed analysis, the error ratios of the numbers of errors are
45.5% in SSM and 22.7% in GPM. By using the 95%-conﬁdence
intervals, the number of errors in SSM is 1:4§1:3while that in
GPM is 5:4§2:4. Regarding the working time, the error ratios are
11.8% in SSM and 6.9% in GPM. By using the 95%-conﬁdence
intervals, the time in SSM is 1,152 §271 seconds while that in
GPM is 2,273 §313 seconds.
Our main interest in this study is to understand possible bar-
riers for users to develop models in GPM and SSM. Figure 11
shows the analysis of the errors in both approaches. This indi-
cates that the errors in SSM were only simple mistakes such as
misspellings or incorrect names, or incorrect relationships, while
the errors in GPM had a wider spectrum of errors, presumably
due to the complexity of SysML. For example, in GPM, two users
who had less experience in SysML modeling used ¿derive À
instead of ¿deriveReqt À. The other three users missed the
¿satisfy Àstereotype. In UML/SysML, setting proper stereo-
types seems to take a long time. Both the expert and novice users
used reversed directions for dependencies, which also seems to
confuse many UML/SysML users. Four users set incorrect require-
ment IDs and put data in incorrect slots because checking for the
proper data in many different slots in SysML requires careful atten-
tion.
Figure 11: Analysis of the reasons for the errors. The sizes of
the charts are proportion to the numbers of errors in SSM and
GPM approaches, as shown in the left side of Figure 10
.
In contrast, these results show that SSM is more efﬁcient, es-
pecially when the tasks can be clearly formulated. The conﬁgura-
tions of MSP work as templates to guide users to edit the appro-
priate models. For example, since the dependencies between the
upper level requirements and the functional requirements must be
¿derivedReq À, this rule should be predeﬁned in the conﬁgura-
tion. Likewise, we should prepare spreadsheets to encourage users
to ﬁll¿satisfy Àdependencies for all of the functional require-
ments. As stated in Section 5.1, since we chose the typical and
well formulated tasks that are executed by many engineers in ac-
tual automotive development, they ﬁt with the SSM approach. This
reﬂects our intention to apply modeling technologies to the area
where many engineers in different disciplines work in established
processes.
In the interviews with the participants, we received three ma-
jor suggestions for improvements with SSM: (i) In SSM they were
able to concentrate on editing the optimized spreadsheets, while in
GPM they had to also consider the design of the diagrams and the
details of SysML to achieve the goals; (ii) SSM provided the op-
timized spreadsheet formats to indicate the appropriate operations,986/g1004/g1005/g1006/g1007/g1008/g1009/g1010/g1011

while GPM could only provide some templates for the diagrams
and these were not sufﬁcient for the users to effectively under-
stand the required operations; and (iii) To work with the compli-
cated links (especially for the tasks involving Design Synthesis and
Traceability Management), the users needed too much time to ﬁnd
the appropriate arrows, while in SSM they easily found these links
by using the ﬁlters and sort functions.
These results and feedback implicated that the advantages of
SSM came mainly from two factors: (a) the views were optimized
for each task and (b) the efﬁciency of the spreadsheet UI. Separat-
ing these two factors leads to further research topics in modeling
environments since (a) means that we should compare SSM with
task-optimized user interfaces in the existing modeling tools; and
(b) means that we should invent a generic spreadsheet-based mod-
eling environment and then compare the productivity to the exist-
ing modeling tools. Although both of these areas have not yet been
studied, both approaches are suggestive to improve modeling tools.
We presume from our experiment that the errors shown in Figure 11
would be reduced by Factor (a) because task-speciﬁc views can re-
duce the complexity of UML/SysML, and the time for modeling
is mainly reduced by Factor (b) because spreadsheets and Excel UI
have been improved by many developers and are quite popular with
many users compared to the existing modeling tools. For example,
although Rhapsody provides advanced “Find/Replace” features to
search for names, tag values, etc., users need to carefully specify
which model information should be in the scope. In contrast, since
MSP only shows model information in cells, users can easily use
the search and replace features of Excel to edit models.
Regarding the efﬁciency of veriﬁcation, both approaches have
strengths and weaknesses. With GPM, we can check any kind of
model element without any special conﬁguration, while MSP re-
quires some extended conﬁguration data to handle some of the data
as a spreadsheet. This implies that if the model contains unexpected
errors, we cannot ﬁnd some of these errors in SSM. However, in
SSM, it is less likely that such bad data will be input compared
to GPM. When checking for inconsistencies in the model informa-
tion, MSP is better for browsing the large numbers of items. As
the users reported in (iii), since the presentations with a general-
purpose tool are less well organized, they require more effort to
check the consistency compared to MSP.
With SSM, we need a conﬁguration ﬁle for each task to cus-
tomize the formats of the spreadsheets, while in GPM we need less
work to prepare the templates of the diagrams. Thus, the conﬁgu-
ration costs for SSM are larger than for GPM. However, when we
need to deploy selected methodologies for a large number of team
members, this overhead is less signiﬁcant compared to the trainingoverhead in GPM.
We conclude that the SSM approach ﬁts well with development
based on more established technologies, where all of the tasks and
processes must be rigorously deﬁned and thoroughly veriﬁed. In
contrast, the GPM approach is suitable for research and experimen-
tal work, where many tasks are not deﬁned in advance and depend
on the situation.
6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
We proposed spreadsheet-based ﬂexible modeling for develop-
ing systems, an application in which many experts in different dis-
ciplines have to collaborate with each other. We applied this ap-
proach to the four main tasks of systems development: (1) Require-
ments Acquisition, (2) Requirements Analysis, (3) Design Synthe-
sis, and (4) Customization. We were able to design an optimized
user experience on top of spreadsheets that enhanced productivity
compared to generic UML/SysML Modeling tools. We did this by
considering what information each user needs.
Our approach reduced the time and the errors for the typical
modeling tasks in systems development. In our experiment, our
approach was faster and more accurate than using general-purpose
tools, In addition, we received feedback that they were able to per-
form the tasks with fewer errors.
We think this spreadsheet-based modeling approach has great
potential to improve productivity in modeling by integrating var-
ious technologies such as Validation and Veriﬁcation (V&V) and
cloud-based scalable collaboration.
Regarding V&V , currently MSP itself supports only key con-
straints and Rhapsody checks the other constraints as discussed in
Section 4.2.2. By integrating with a more general validation sys-
tem such as EMF validation [33], we can specify a wider range of
constraints for efﬁcient model editing.
Regarding cloud collaboration for large scale model develop-
ment, we are now continuing to work on incorporating OSLC
(Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration) [26] to support col-
laborative ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) and PLM
(Product Lifecycle Management) to cover more processes beyond
modeling throughout the development process.
