ABSTRACT
Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is becoming a major
software framework for building complex distributed sys-tems. Reliability of the service-oriented systems heavily
depends on the remote Web services as well as the unpre-
dictable Internet. Designing eﬀective and accurate reliabil-
ity prediction approaches for the service-oriented systemshas become an important research issue. In this paper,
we propose a collaborative reliability prediction approach,which employs the past failure data of other similar users topredict the Web service reliability for the current user, with-out requiring real-world Web service invocations. We alsopresent a user-collaborative failure data sharing mechanismand a reliability composition model for the service-orientedsystems. Large-scale real-world experiments are conducted
and the experimental results show that our collaborativereliability prediction approach obtains better reliability pre-
diction accuracy than other approaches.

etc. The ability to predict reliability of service-oriented sys-tems early at the architecture design phase can help to re-
duce re-engineering cost and to produce more reliable sys-
tems.
Software reliability prediction is a task to determine fu-
ture reliability of software systems based on the past fail-ure data [17]. Various software reliability prediction mod-
els, such as Musa’s execution time model [20], Putnam’smodel [22], Rome Laboratory model [10], and so on, havebeen proposed for predicting software reliability by observ-
ing, accumulating, and analyzing previous failure data. Tra-
ditionally, comprehensive testing schemes are conducted onthe software systems to collect failure data and to makesure that the reliability threshold has been achieved before
releasing the software to the customers or end users. How-ever, reliability of a service-oriented system not only relieson the system itself, but also heavily depends on the remoteWeb services and the unpredictable Internet. Inﬂuenced bycommunication links, diﬀerence service users may experi-ence quite diﬀerent reliability performance on the same Webservice. Web service evaluation [29] from the client-side isusuallyrequiredforassessingperformanceoftargetWebser-vices. However, traditional exhaustive testing becomes diﬃ-
cult and sometimes even impossible for the service-oriented
systems due to: (1) Web service invocations may be chargedsince the Web services are owned and hosted by other orga-nizations. Even if the Web service invocations are free, ex-
ecuting a large number of Web service invocations imposescosts for the service users and consumes resources of the ser-viceproviders; and(2)itistime-consumingandexpensivetoconduct evaluation on all the service candidates, since theremay exist a lot of alternative Web service candidates in theInternet with similar or identical functionalities. However,without comprehensive evaluation, we cannot collect suﬃ-cient past failure data of the Web service components. It is
thus diﬃcult for the system designer to determine whether
the service-oriented system is reliable enough for release.
Thepreviousreliabilitypredictionmethodsforcomponent-
based systems [7, 11, 13, 31] and service-oriented systems [4,14] are mainly focused on system-level compositional anal-ysis. These approaches assume that reliabilities of the indi-vidual components/Web services are known. The detailedprocedures for obtaining the component reliabilities are usu-ally ignored. A few approaches [6, 12, 23], which considercomponent-level reliability prediction, are mainly designedfor traditional component-based systems. We argue that re-liability prediction for service-oriented systems is more chal-
35lenging, because: (1) there is a lack of internal information
of the service components, since the remote Web servicesare provided by other organizations without any design and
implementation details; and (2) diﬀerent service users may
obtain diﬀerent performance from a same Web service, sincethe Web service performance is greatly inﬂuenced by com-
munication links.
Without suﬃcient past failure data, without internal in-
formation of the service components, and inﬂuenced by the
unpredictablecommunicationlinks, itisthusmuchmoredif-ﬁcult to make accurate reliability prediction on the service-oriented systems than traditional component-based systems.To attack this challenge, we propose a collaborative reliabil-ity prediction approach. The idea is that the Web service
reliability for the current service user (service user is usuallydesigner of the service-oriented system, not end-user of thesystem) can be predicted by employing past failure data ofother similar service users. A service user is selected as asimilar user with the current user if he/she has experienced
similar reliability performance on the same set of commonly-
invoked Web services. By our approach, reliabilities of Webservice components can be predicted even if the current userdoesnotinvokethesecomponentspreviouslyandhasnoideaon their internal information.
Complementary to the existing reliability prediction ap-
proaches [4, 7, 11, 13, 14, 31], which mainly focus on systemlevelcompositionalanalysis, thispaperfocusesonbothcom-ponent level reliability prediction and system level reliabilitycompositional analysis. The service component reliabilities
obtained from our framework can be employed by other pre-vious reliability prediction approaches. Our reliability pre-diction framework can be employed at the early phase of
system development to help produce more reliable system.
More importantly, it can also be employed at runtime toenable optimal system reconﬁguration.
The contributions of this paper are twofold:
•Firstly, a collaborative framework is proposed for pre-dicting reliability of service-oriented systems. Diﬀer-entfrompreviousreliabilitypredictionapproaches, ourapproach employs past failure data of similar serviceusers for making reliability prediction for the currentservice user.
•Secondly, extensive experiments are conducted usingreal-world Web service dataset, which contains 1.5 mil-lions real-world Web service invocation results from
150 distributed service users on 100 real-world Web
services. Our real-world Web service dataset has beenpublished online
1, which provides detailed experimen-
tal information for future research and makes our ex-
periments reproducible.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
introduces a collaborative framework. Section 3 presents
our collaborative reliability prediction approach. Section 4describes our implementation and experiments. Section 5introduces related work and Section 6 concludes the paper.

fail. Thevalueoffailureprobabilityisintheintervalof0and
1. Figure 1 shows an example of a simple service-oriented
system which is presented as a service ﬂow . The service ﬂow
in Figure 1 includes a set of abstract tasks ( t1,...,t6) with
certain control ﬂow structures ( sequence, loop ,a n d paral-
lel). For each abstract task, an optimal candidate will be
selected from a set of functionally equivalent Web servicecandidates. An execution plan is obtained by composing
the selected Web services ( s
1,...s6), which will be invoked
to implement the abstract tasks. Similar to work [32], we
assume that the alternative service candidates are available.
The problem of obtaining the functionally equivalent Web
service candidates, which has been discussed by a lot of pre-vious work [24, 33], is out of the scope of this paper.
Reliability of the service-oriented system highly depends
on the selected Web services. Our approach employs past
failure data from other similar service users to predict thefailure probabilities of Web services for the current serviceuser. Therefore, mechanisms are required for enabling pastfailure-data collection from diﬀerent service users.
A user-collaborative mechanism is proposed in our previ-
ous work [39] for Web service recommendation. This mech-
anism can also be applied to the Web service past failuredata collection. The design of this user-collaborative mech-anism is inspired by the recent success of YouTube
2and
Wikipedia3. The key idea is that, instead of contribut-
ing videos ( YouTube ) or knowledge ( Wikipedia ), the ser-
vice users are encouraged to contribute their individually
observed Web service past failure data. By contributingmore past failure data on the used Web services, the serviceusers can obtain more accurate failure probability predictionof the Web services which they do not use before, since morecharacteristics of the current service user can be discovered
from the provided data. By this way, the service users areencouraged to contribute their observed past failure-data.
To speedup the process of Web service failure data con-
tributions, client-side middleware can be designed for theservice users to automatically record the failure informationof Web service invocations and contribute this informationto a centralized server to exchange for failure probability
prediction services. Detailed middleware design can be re-

3. RELIABILITY PREDICTION
For an abstract task in a service ﬂow, an optimal Web ser-
vice needs to be identiﬁed from a set of functionally equiv-
alent candidates for executing the task. The most straight-
forward way is to comprehensively evaluate all the service
candidates and select out the best performing one. However,as discussed in Section 1, it is time-consuming, expensive,and sometimes even impossible to make comprehensive eval-uation on all the candidates.
Another approach is to employ the Web service past fail-
ure data observed by other service users for predicting the
Web service performance for the current user. For exam-ple, for the new service users, who do not invoke any Webservices previously, the performance of a Web service canbe indicated by its average failure probability (
pi), which is
deﬁned as:
pi=1
mm/summationdisplay
a=1pa,i, (1)
wherepa,iis failure probability of Web service candidate i
observed by the service user a,mis the number of service
users, and piis the average failure probability of the Web
service candidate i. Based on the average failure probability
values of the service candidates, the best performing candi-
date can be determined.
However, since service users are in diﬀerent geographic lo-
cations and are under diﬀerent network conditions, the cur-
rentusermaynotbeabletoexperiencesimilarfailureproba-
bility performance as the average failure probability . In case
that the service users have invoked some Web services previ-ously, we can take advantage of the past invocation informa-tion to enable more accurate failure probability predictionon the uninvoked Web services. Our collaborative reliabilityprediction approach is designed as a four-phase process asshown in Figure 2. In phase 1, we calculate the similarity
of the service users with the current user based on the pastfailure data of their commonly-invoked Web services. Then,in Phase 2, a set of similar users are identiﬁed. After that, inphase 3, the invocation failure probabilities of Web services
are predicted for the current user by using the invocation
failure probabilities observed by similar users. Finally, inphase 4, the reliability of the service-oriented system is pre-dicted by aggregating the failure probabilities of the servicecomponents. Details of these phases are presented at Sec-tion 3.1 to Section 3.4, respectively.
3.1 Phase 1: Similarity Computation
We assume that there are mservice users, nWeb ser-
vices, and the relationship between users and Web servicesis denoted by an m×nmatrix. Each entry pa,iin the
matrix represents the failure probability of Web service i
observed by the service user a.pa,i=nullif useradid
not invoke Web service ibefore. Pearson Correlation Coef-
ﬁcient (PCC), which has been widely used in a number of
recommendation systems [27], is employed for the similarity
computation. PCC employs the following equation to com-
putes the similarity between service user aand service user
ubased on their commonly invoked Web services:
Sim(a,u)=/summationdisplay
i∈Ia∩Iu(pa,i−pa)(pu,i−pu)
/radicalBigg/summationdisplay
i∈Ia∩Iu(pa,i−pa)2/radicalBigg/summationdisplay
i∈Ia∩Iu(pu,i−pu)2,
(2)
whereIa∩Iuis a set of commonly invoked Web services by
both user aand user u,pa,iis the failure probability of Web
serviceiobservedbytheserviceuser a,a n dparepresentsthe
average failure probability of all the Web services invoked by
usera. The similarity Sim(a,u) of two service users is in
the interval of -1 and 1, where a larger value indicates higher
similarity.
Similar to the above approach, we also employ PCC to
calculate the similarity between Web service iand Web ser-
vicejby using:
Sim(i,j)=/summationdisplay
u∈Ui∩Uj(pu,i−pi)(pu,j−pj)
/radicalBigg/summationdisplay
u∈Ui∩Uj(pu,i−pi)2/radicalBigg/summationdisplay
u∈Ui∩Uj(pu,j−pj)2,
(3)
whereUi∩Ujis a set of service users who invoke both the
Web services iandj,a n dpiis the average failure probability
of Web service i, which can be calculated by Equation (1).
3.2 Phase 2: Similar User Selection
After calculating and ranking the PCC similarity values
between the current user and other users, a set of similar
users can be identiﬁed by setting a parameter Top-K, which
indicates that kusers, which have larger PCC values than
others, will be selected as similar users. In reality, a service
user may have limited number of similar users and the dis-similarusers(e.g., withnegativePCCvalue)maybeselected
when the number of similar users is less than k. However,
including dissimilar users will greatly inﬂuence the predic-
tion accuracy. In our approach, the service users who havenegative correlation (negative PCC values) with the currentuser will be excluded.
To predict a missing entry p
u,iin the failure probability
matrix, a set of similar service users S(u) can be identiﬁed
37by:
S(u)={a|Sim(u,a)≥Simk,Sim(u,a)>0,a/negationslash=u},(4)
whereSimkis thekthlargest PCC value with the current
useru,Sim(u,a)>0 is to exclude the dissimilar users, and
Sim(a,u)canbecalculatedbyEquation(2). Asetofsimilar
Web services S(i) with the current Web service ican also
be identiﬁed by:
S(i)={k|Sim(i,k)≥Simk,Sim(i,k)>0,k/negationslash=i},(5)
whereSimkis thekthlargest PCC value with the current
Web service iandSim(k,i) can be computed by Equa-
tion (3).
3.3 Phase 3: Failure Probability Prediction
Employingthesimilarusers, theuser-basedapproaches[2]
(named as UPCC) predict the missing value pu,iby the
following equation:
pu,i=pu+/summationdisplay
a∈S(u)wa×(pa,i−pa), (6)
wherepuandpaare average failure probabilities of diﬀerent
Web services observed by user uanda, respectively, and
wais the signiﬁcant weight of the similar user a,w h i c hi s
deﬁned as:
wa=Sim(a,u)/summationtext
b∈S(u)Sim(b,u). (7)
Equation 7 ensures that a user with higher similarity has
strongerinﬂuenceonthevalueprediction(largerweight wa).
Similar to the user-based approach, employing the similar
Web services S(i), item-based approaches [25] (named as
IPCC) predict the missing value pu,iby:
pu,i=pi+/summationdisplay
k∈S(i)wk×(pu,k−pk), (8)
wherepiandpkare average failure probabilities of the Web
serviceiandkobserved by diﬀerent service users, respec-
tively, and wkis the signiﬁcant weight of the similar Web
servicek, which deﬁned as:
wk=Sim(i,k)/summationtext
j∈S(i)Sim(i,j). (9)
The predicted values by Eq. (6) and Eq. (8) may not fall
in the probability range of 0 to 1. The predicted value is setto be 0 when it is smaller than 0, and set to be 1 when it islarger than 1.
Due to the sparsity of the m×nfailure probability matrix,
predicting failure probability only by similar service users
(UPCC) or similar Web services ( IPCC) will potentially ig-
norevaluableinformationthatcanmakethepredictionmore
accurate. To address this problem, the prediction results by
the user-based approach (Equation (6)) and the item-basedapproach (Equation (8)) can be combined to fully utilizethe information of both similar users and similar Web ser-vices [39]. When S(u)/negationslash=∅∧S(i)/negationslash=∅, we employ both the
similar users and similar Web services to predict the missing
value by employing the following equation:p
u,i=λ×(pu+/summationdisplay
a∈S(u)wa×(pa,i−pa))+
(1−λ)×(pi+/summationdisplay
k∈S(i)wk×(pu,k−pk)),(10)
whereλ(0≤λ≤1) is a user-deﬁned parameter for deter-
mining how much the missing value prediction relies on the
similar users or the similar Web services.
In practice, a missing pu,ivalue may not have similar
users or similar items. To predict the missing value as
accurate as possible, when S(u)/negationslash=∅∧S(i)=∅, our ap-
proach only employs the information of similar users for
making prediction. In this case, our approach degrades to
the user-based approach as shown in Equation (6). WhenS(u)=∅∧S(i)/negationslash=∅, we only use the information of similar
items for making prediction. In this case, our approach de-
grades to the item-based approach as shown in Equation (8).WhenS(u)=∅∧S(i)=∅, there are no similar users or
similar Web services. Consequently, we predict the p
u,iby
employing the following equation:

wherepuis the average failure probability of diﬀerent Web

andpiis the average failure probability of Web service iob-

tion(11)includesfoursituations: (1)When pu/negationslash=null&pi/negationslash=

diction; (2) when the target Web service is never invoked
by any service users, and the service user has invoked other
Web services previously ( pu/negationslash=null&pi=null), we use
theUMEAN pufor making prediction; (3) in case a new
service user who did not invoked any Web services previ-
ously, but the target Web service has been invoked by other
users (pu=null&pi/negationslash=null), we use the IMEAN pifor
making prediction; and (4) when pu=null&pi=null,w e
cannot provide any prediction since there is no information
available.
3.4 Phase 4: Reliability Aggregation
In a service ﬂow, compositional structures describe the
order in which a collection of abstract tasks are executed.There are four types of basic compositional structures, i.e.,
sequence, branch, loop ,a n d parallel[30]. These basic struc-
tures are included in BPMN [21] and can be mapped to
BPEL [19] easily. Similar to the work in [5, 33, 38], weassume independent task failure in the service ﬂow. The ef-
fect of error propagation (e.g., the problem studied in [9])is not considered in this paper. The aggregation of compo-nent failure probabilities of these compositional structuresis introduced in the following:
•Sequence. The tasks in a sequence structure are ex-
ecuted one by one. The sequence structure fails if anyof its sub-task fails. The composed failure probability
38of a sequence structure is calculated by
p=1−n/productdisplay
i=1(1−pi), (12)
wherenis the number of sequential tasks and piis the
failure probability of the ithtask.
•Branch. In the branch structure, only one branch will
be executed for each execution. The composed failure
probability of the branch structure is calculated by
p=1−n/summationdisplay
i=1bi(1−pi), (13)
wherenis the number of branches, piis the failure
probability of the ithbranch, and biis the execution
probability of the ithbranch (/summationtextn
i=1bi= 1).
•Loop.The composed invocation failure probability of
the loop structure is calculated by
p=1−n/summationdisplay
i=0li(1−p1)i, (14)
wherep1is the failure probability of the task in the
loop structure, liis the probability of executing the
loop for itimes,nis the maximum looping times, and/summationtextni=0li=1 . W h e n n= 0, the composed invocation
failure probability is 0 since the task is not executed.
In this paper, we assume that the values of n(maxi-
mum looping times) and liare provided by the system
designer (e.g., the designer can simulate the service
ﬂow for a lot of times and record that approximate
values).
•Parallel. All tasks are executed at the same time in
the parallel structure, where each branch has an exe-
cution probability of 1. A parallel structure is counted
as a failure if any of the parallel branches fail in execu-tion. The invocation failure probability of the parallelstructure is calculated by:
p=1−
n/productdisplay
i=1(1−pi), (15)
wherepiis the probability that the ithparallel branch
will fail.
These basic compositional structures can be nested and
combined in an arbitrary way. For calculating the aggre-
gated failure probability of a service ﬂow, we decompose theservice ﬂow to the basic compositional structures hierarchi-cally. As shown in Figure 3, ﬁrstly, the failure probabilities
of the basic compositional structures T
1andT2are calcu-
lated by using the corresponding formulas introduced above.
Then, the failure probability of T3is calculated by employ-
ing the failure probabilities of t5andT2. Finally, the failure
probability of the whole service ﬂow can be obtained by us-ing Equation 12 and the failure probabilities of t
1,T1,T3,
andt6.
By the above approach, we obtain the aggregated failure
probability of the service ﬂow. To predict the reliability of
the service ﬂow, we adopt the commonly used exponential
reliability function [17]:
R(t)=e−γ×t, (16)Serv i ce  Plan
t 1 T 3 t 6 T 1t 1t 5
t 2 t 6
t 3 t 4T 1
T 2
t 1 T 1 t 6
T 2t 5T 3
Figure 3: Failure Probability Composition
whereγ(failure-rate ) is the number of failures of the service
ﬂow during a certain time duration, and ti st h et i m ep e -
riod for which the reliability is to be calculated. The valueofγcan be calculated by p×f, where pis the composed
failure probability of the service ﬂow fis the execution fre-
quency of the service ﬂow (e.g., number of executions per
hour). Therefore, we obtain the following equation for thereliability prediction for a service ﬂow:
R(t)=e
−p×f×t. (17)
By the above approach, designers of the service-oriented
systems are able to predict reliabilities of the systems early
at the architecture design phase. Moreover, after the systemreleased, the prediction of system reliability can be dynam-ically updated when the performance of the service compo-nents is changed.
4. EXPERIMENTS
4.1 Experimental Setup
Our real-world Web service performance dataset (pub-
lished at www.wsdream.net ) is employed for experiments.
This dataset inlcudes 100 publicly available Web services
located in more than 20 countries and 150 distributed com-
puters from Planet-Lab [8]. The service users (distributedcomputer from Planet-Lab) observe, collect, and contributethe failure data of the selected Web services to our central-
ized server, which is implemented by JDK, Eclipse, Axis2
4,
Apache Tomcat, Apache HTTP Server, and MySQL. Each
service user executes about 100 invocations on each selected
Web service and the invocation failures are recorded. The
failure probability of a Web service obtained by a serviceuser can thus be obtained. Failure probabilities by all the100 Web services observed by all the 150 service users canbe presented as a 150 ×100 failure probability matrix.
To study the failure probability prediction performance,
we compare our prediction approach (named as Hybridfor
ease of presentation) with four other approaches: user-mean
(UMEAN), item-mean (IMEAN), user-based approach us-ing PCC (UPCC) [2], and item-based approach using PCC
(IPCC) [25]. UMEAN employs the average failure probabil-
ity of the current service user on other Web services for the
4http://ws.apache.org/axis2
39prediction, while IMEAN employs the average failure prob-
ability of the Web service observed by other service usersfor the prediction. UPCC only employs similar users for
the failure probability prediction, while IPCC only employs
similar Web services for the prediction.
The 150 service users are divided into training users and
testing users in our experiments. Failure probabilities of the
training users are stored in our centralized server to makeprediction for the testing users. To make our experimentmore realistic, we randomly remove entries of the trainingusers to make the training matrix sparser. Since the testingusers usually only employ a small number of Web services,we also randomly remove entries of the testing users. Dif-ferent prediction approaches are employed for predicting the
failure probabilities of the removed entries. The original val-ues of the removed entries are used as the expected valuesto study the prediction accuracy.
The well-known Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics are employed to mea-
sure the prediction accuracy of diﬀerent approaches. MAE
is deﬁned as:
MAE=/summationtext
u,i|pu,i−/hatwidepu,i|
N, (18)
wherepu,idenotes the expected failure probability value of
Web service iobserved by service user u,/hatwidepu,idenotes the
predicted failure probability value, and Ndenotes the num-
ber of predicted values. RMSE is deﬁned as:
RMSE=/radicalBigg/summationtext
u,i(pu,i−/hatwidepu,i)2
N, (19)
where smaller RMSE (or MAE) values indicate better pre-
diction accuracy.
4.2 Comparison of Prediction Accuracy
Table 1 shows both the MAE and RMSE results of diﬀer-
ent prediction approaches employing 10% and 20% density
training matrix. In the third row of Table 1, the numbers
10, 20 and 30 represent diﬀerent given numbers , which are
the number of failure probabilities provided by the testing
users.
Table 1 shows that our prediction approach obtains better
prediction accuracy (smaller MAE and RMSE values) in all
the experimental settings. Table 1 also shows that MAE andRMSE values of the Hybridapproach become smaller with
the increase of given number from 10 to 30. This observa-tion indicates that the prediction accuracy can be improvedby providing more Web service failure probabilities. Withthe increase of the training user number from 100 to 140,
the prediction accuracy also has signiﬁcant enhancement,since larger training matrix provides more information forthe missing value prediction. When the density of the train-ing matrix is increased from 10% to 20%, the predictionaccuracy is also enhanced, since denser training matrix pro-vides more information for the missing value prediction.
From Table 1, we also observe that the item-based ap-
proaches (IMEAN, IPCC) outperform the user-based ap-proaches (UMEAN, UPCC) in all the experimental settings.This observation indicates that similar Web services providemore useful information than the similar users for the miss-ing value prediction.
4.3 Studies on Parameters4.3.1 Given Number
Given number indicates the number of Web service failure
probabilities given by the current testing user. To study the
impact of the given number on the prediction results, we
vary the given number from 5 to 50 with a step value of 5.
We set training user number = 100, Top-K = 10, training
matrix density = 10% and 20% in the experiments.
Figure4showstheexperimentalresults, whereFigure4(a)
and 4(b) employ the 10% density training matrix for the
missing value prediction, while Figure 4(c) and 4(d) employthe20%densitytrainingmatrix. TheexperimentalresultsofFigure4showthat: (1)thepredictionaccuracyofthe Hybrid
approach is enhanced slightly. This observation indicatesthat by providing a small set of observed Web service failureprobabilities, the service user can obtain good prediction
accuracy for the remanding Web services; (2) the predictionperformance of the IMEAN approach is not inﬂuenced by
the change of given number , since it does not employ the
given failure probabilities for the missing value prediction;and (3) our Hybridapproach outperforms other approaches
consistently.
4.3.2 Training Matrix Density
The prediction accuracy is also inﬂuenced by the training
matrix density. To study the impact of the training matrix
density on the prediction results, we vary the density from5% to 50% with a step value of 5%. We set training user
number = 100, Top-K = 10, given number = 10 and 20 in
the experiments.
Figure5showstheexperimentalresults, whereFigure5(a)
and 5(b) employ given number of 10, and Figure 5(c) and
5(d)employgivennumberof20. TheexperimentalresultsofFigure 5 show that: (1) the prediction accuracy of Hybridis
signiﬁcantly enhanced when the matrix density is increasedfrom 5% to 10%. With the increase of matrix density, thespeed of accuracy enhancement slows down. This observa-tion indicates that the prediction accuracy will be enhanced
by collecting more past failure data from diﬀerent service
users to make the training matrix denser, especially whenthe matrix is sparse; (2) the performance of UMEAN is not
inﬂuenced by the density of training matrix, since it doesnot employ the information of the training matrix for themissing value prediction; and (3) the Hybridapproach still
outperforms other approaches consistently.
4.3.3 Training User Number
To study the impact of the training user number on the
prediction results, we vary the training user number from 20
to 140 with a step value of 20. We set Top-K = 10 in the
experiments. Figure 6 shows the experimental results under
diﬀerent experimental settings, where Figure 6(a) employsgiven number = 10, matrix density = 10% , Figure 6(b) em-
ploys given number = 20, matrix density = 20% , Figure 6(c)
employs given number = 30, matrix density = 30% , and Fig-
ure 6(d) employs given number = 40, matrix density = 40% .
The experimental results of Figure 6 show that: (1) the
prediction accuracy of Hybridis enhanced stably with the
increase of training user number under all the experimen-
tal settings. This observation indicates that by encouragingmore service users to contribute their Web service past fail-ure data, the prediction accuracy can be improved stably.
On the other hand, if we are able to provide accurate Webservice failure probability prediction for the service users,

more service users will be willing to contribute their ob-
served Web service failure data to exchange for more ac-curate missing value prediction service; and (2) the Hybrid
approach also outperforms other approaches consistently.
4.3.4 Top-K
To study the impact of the Top-Kparameter on the pre-
diction results of the Hybridapproach, we vary the value
ofTop-Kfrom 2 to 20 with a step of 2. Figure 7(a) and
7(b) show MAE and RMSE results under the experimentalsettings of training matrix density = 50%, given number =
10, 20, and 30, train user number = 100 . Figure 7(c) and
7(d) show MAE and RMSE values under the experimentalsettings of training matrix density = 10%, 20% and 30%,
given number = 50, training user number = 100 .
Figure 7 shows that (1) the prediction accuracy stops to
enhance when the Top-Kis larger than a certain value (e.g.,
6 for given 10, 10 for given 30, and 12 for given 50). (2) The
prediction performance will not decrease with the increaseof the Top-Kvalue, since we exclude dissimilar users with
negative PCC values from the Top-Kset. This observation
indicates that by using our enhanced Top-Kalgorithm, we
can simply set the value of Top-Kto a large value for ob-
taining better prediction performance.
4.3.5 Parameter λ
The experimental results of Table 1 show that item-based
approaches outperform the user-based approach in our Web
service failure probability dataset, indicating that diﬀerentdatasets may inherit diﬀerent data distribution and correla-tioncharacteristics. Ourpredictionapproachisadaptabletodiﬀerent datasets by providing a parameter λ.W h e nλ=1 ,
we only extract information from the similar users. Whenλ= 0, we only consider the similar Web services. When
0<λ<1, we combine the information from both similar
users and similar Web services based on the value of λ.T o
study the impact of λon the prediction result of our ap-
proach, we vary the value of λfrom 0 to 1 with a step value
of 0.1. We also set Top-K = 10 andtraining users =100 in
the experiments.
Figure 8(a) and 8(b) show the MAE and RMSE results of
given number 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 with 10% training matrix
density, while Figure 8(c) and 8(d) show the experimentalresults with 20% training matrix density. Figure 8 showsthat the value of λimpacts the recommendation results sig-
niﬁcantly. Suitable λvalues will provide better prediction
accuracy, since it enables properly combination of the user-
based method and the item-based method.
Anotherinterestingobservationisthattheoptimal λvalue
(the minimal MAE and RMSE values of the curves in Fig-ure 8) shifts from left to right when the given number isincreased from 10 to 50. For example, in Figure 8(c), the
optimalλvalue of given 10 is 0.1, while the optimal λvalue
of given 50 is 0.6. This observation indicates that the opti-malλvalue is inﬂuenced by the given number . The similar
Webservicesaremoreimportantthansimilaruserswhenthegiven number is small. With the increasing of given number,
the similar users become more important. This observationis reasonable, since with limited user-given Web service fail-ure values, the UMEAN prediction method, which employthemeanoftheuser-givenfailureprobabilitiestopredictthe
failure probability of other Web services, has higher prob-
ability to be inaccurate. This will inﬂuence the prediction
performance of UPCC, which employs the UMEAN valuefor the missing value prediction as shown in Equation (6).

5. RELATED WORK AND DISCUSSION
A great deal of software reliability prediction models have
been proposed for stand-alone software systems, such as
Musa’s execution time model [20], Putnam’s model [22],
Rome laboratory models [10], Jelinski’s model [15], Little-
wood’s models [16], and so on. More and more reliabil-ity prediction approaches are also proposed for component-based systems and service-oriented systems [4, 7, 11, 13, 14,31]. However, most of these previous approaches focus on
system-level reliability compositional analysis and assumethat the component reliabilities are known. Diﬀerent fromthese approaches, our collaborative reliability prediction ap-proach focuses not only on system-level reliability aggrega-tion, but also on component-level Web service failure prob-
ability prediction.
A few approaches [6, 12, 23], which consider component-
level reliability prediction, are mainly designed for tradi-
tional component-based systems. Goseva-Popstojanova etal. [12] calculate reliability risk of a component by the com-ponent complexity and the levels of its failures. Reussneret al. [23] compute component reliability by the reliabili-ties of its services, which are assumed to be known. Boththese approaches require internal information of the compo-nents for making component reliability prediction. Cheunget al. [6] predict the component reliability at architecture de-sign phase by exploiting behavioral models from sources ofinformationavailableatdesigntime. Diﬀerentfromwork[6],
which tries to predict reliability of a component which is
not implemented yet, our work targets at predicting relia-
bilities of remote Web services which are implemented andprovided by other organizations. Moreover, work [6] doesnot need to consider the inﬂuence of communication linkssince the components are usually invoked locally in tradi-tionally component-based systems. Our approach addresses
the inﬂuence of communication links by employing collabo-
rative ﬁltering for reliability prediction, which signiﬁcantly
enhances the reliability prediction accuracy for the service-
oriented systems.
Collaborative ﬁltering is the process of ﬁltering for in-
formation using techniques involving collaboration among
multiple agents. Various collaborative ﬁltering techniquesare widely adopted in recommender systems [3, 18]. The
most studied approaches include user-based approaches [2]and item-based approaches [25]. In the environment of ser-vice computing [34], it is possible to collect and make use ofthe past failure data of Web services from diﬀerent serviceusers. To take advantages of these collected data, this paperapplies the collaborative ﬁltering techniques [2, 18, 25, 39]
to attack the challenging research problem of reliability pre-
diction of service-oriented systems. As far as we know, thecollaborative reliability approach of this paper is diﬀerentfrom all previous reliability prediction models.
In our current design, the collaborative reliability predic-
tion approach mainly focuses on service-oriented systems,since the Web services are usually publicly accessible andare invoked by a lot of service users. Therefore, it is possi-ble to obtain the past failure data of Web services from dif-ferent service users. Our approach can further be extendedto component-based systems, other distributed computingplatforms, and cloud computing platforms, in case that thereusable components are employed by other users previously
and the past failure data can be obtained from these users.

when a Web service is popular with a lot of users and past
failure data.
User-collaboration anduser-contribution are major char-
acteristics of Web 2.0. In our previous work, the idea of
user-collaboration has been employed for Web service re-
liability evaluation [35, 37] and Web service recommenda-
tion [39]. In this paper, similar idea is employed to collect
data from service users and to make reliability prediction ofthe service-oriented systems for the system designers. By
our approach, the collected data from other users are em-ployed for making reliability prediction for the current userwithout requiring real-world Web service invocations.
6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Inthispaper, weproposeacollaborativereliabilitypredic-
tion approach for service-oriented systems. The main idea
is to exploit the past failure data of the similar users for pre-
dicting Web service failure probabilities for the current user.
The predicted failure probabilities of the elementary Webservices are composed using diﬀerent compositional struc-tures to predict the reliability of the whole service-orientedsystem. The comprehensive experimental analysis shows the
eﬀectiveness of our collaborative reliability prediction ap-proach.
When aggregating the failure probabilities of the service
components, we assume service component failures are inde-
pendent, In most cases, this assumption is reasonable, since
Web services are usually deployed on separate severs of dif-ferent organizations. The physical and electrical isolation
ensures that Web service failures are independent. However,in some special cases, failures of Web services may have cor-relation (e.g., two Web services running on the same server,error propagation, etc.). We will address this Web servicefailure correlation problem in our future work.
Our on-going research also includes exploring failure cor-
relation between diﬀerent Web services, collecting more past
failure data on more Web services, and investigating the op-timalλvalue in diﬀerent experimental settings.
