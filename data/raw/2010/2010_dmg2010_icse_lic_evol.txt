ABSTRACT
Free and open source software systems (FOSS) are distribu-
ted and made available to users under diﬀerent software li-
censes, mentioned in FOSS code by means of licensing state-
ments. Various factors, such as changes in the legal land-
scape, commercial code licensed as FOSS, or code reused
from other FOSS systems, lead to evolution of licensing,
which may aﬀect the way a system or part thereof can be
subsequently used. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor li-
censing evolution. However, manually tracking the licensi ng
evolution of thousands of ﬁles is a daunting task.
After presenting several cases of the eﬀects of licensing
evolution, we propose an approach to automatically track
changes occurring in the licensing terms of a system. Then,
we report an empirical study of the licensing evolution of si x
diﬀerent FOSS systems. Results show that licensing under-
went frequent and substantial changes.

Copyright 2010 ACM 978-1-60558-719-6/10/05 ...$10.00.As software systems evolve, so do licenses. Although soft-
ware licenses have gained prominence in the media, thanks
for example to the work of the Free Software Foundation; li-
censing evolution has received little attention from resea rch-
ers despite its many potential harmful consequences on soft -
ware reuse. An interesting example of such phenomena is
the licensing evolution of IPFilter [20], which prevented i ts
redistribution as part of the OpenBSD kernel. A side-eﬀect
of this evolution was the creation of PF by OpenBSD devel-
opers as an alternative to IPFilter1.
Licensing, copyright, and intellectual property determin e
what can and cannot be reused, and potentially impacts the
architecture of a system. A typical scenario in which li-
censing evolution monitoring becomes vital is as follows. A
company creates a product— e.g., a hand-held multimedia
player—that incorporates some FOSS components/applica-
tions, e.g., a Unix kernel, the player, plus several codecs.
The critical situation arises when there is the need for up-
dating a component ( e.g., a codec) but its license changed
(e.g., from BSD to GPL) and its new license prevents its dis-
tribution, thus requiring to completely re-think the way th is
codec is connected to the player [10]. Consequently, develo p-
ers must carefully analyze the overall licensing compatibi lity
of all the included components. This compatibility analysi s
is usually done manually, or semi-automatically, by verify ing
that all bundled source ﬁles and binaries have been released
under compatible licenses [19]. Unfortunately, as illustr ated
by the IPFilter case, this analysis is not a one-time activit y:
each modiﬁcation to any bundled component may involve
licensing statements and thus impact its use/integration.
The harmful consequences of licensing evolution stem from
the nature of open source development: “this method of de-
velopment can be worrisome from an intellectual property
standpoint because it creates multiple opportunities for c on-
tributors to introduce infringing code and makes it almost
impossible to audit the entire code base” [1]. Such conse-
quences will become more prominent because (1) the United
States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that
redistributing software systems in violation of the terms o f a
free software license constitutes a copyright infringemen t [17]
and (2) the sizes of modern software systems prevent man-
ual analysis, e.g., Mozilla grew from 4,845 ﬁles in release M3
(March 1999) to 12,436 in release 1.7.13 (September 2004).
Therefore, there is a need for methods and tools to (semi-)
automatically audit a system for its license and for changes
in its licensing statements across releases.
1http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/The license (or licenses) under which a ﬁle is made avail-
able is usually contained inside blocks of comments at its
beginning. We refer to such comments as the licensing state-
ment of a ﬁle. We distinguish between licenses andlicensing
statements because a licensing statement may either contain
the license itself ( e.g., BSD license) or the name of the li-
cense and a reference to where it can be found ( e.g., the
Eclipse Public License). In this paper, we are interested in
changes to the licensing of source code, i.e., the analysis of
changes occurring within licensing statements, while lice nse
evolution concerns the evolution of a license per se ,e.g., the
evolution of the GPL from v2 to v3. A change to the licens-
ing statement might be a change to the name of the license
(when the statement refers to its name) or a change to the
license itself (when the license is in the statement).
This paper ﬁrst motivates the problem of analyzing the
evolution of licensing statements by providing several exa m-
ples of changes in licensing and their consequences. Then, i t
suggests that the only means to avoid negative consequences
is to monitor licensing evolution automatically. It propos es
an approach to automatically track the licensing evolution
of systems, identifying changes in licenses and copyright
years. Finally, it reports an empirical study analyzing the
licensing evolution of six widely-adopted FOSS systems: Ar -
goUML, Eclipse-JDT, the FreeBSD and OpenBSD kernels,
the Mozilla Suite, and Samba. The study shows that licens-
ing evolution is a frequent and relevant phenomenon in many
systems and that, while FOSS developers are concerned with
licensing issues, they manage, evolve, and update licensin g
statements in diﬀerent ways. For example, some systems,
e.g., Mozilla and Eclipse-JDT, have moved from more re-
strictive to less restrictive licenses while others have mo ved
in the opposite direction. Copyright years are updated fol-
lowing diﬀerent patterns in diﬀerent systems.
To the best of our knowledge, no previous work investi-
gated the licensing evolution of FOSS systems. Thus, the
contributions of this paper are as follows:
•We show that keeping track of licensing changes is im-
portant by reporting several cases where changes in
open-source licenses had major consequences in soft-
ware usage and integration;
•We propose a method to track licensing changes . The
method is based on textual analysis of licensing state-
ments extracted from source code ﬁle and on the usage
of the FoSSology licensing classiﬁcation tool [11].
•We report an empirical study showing the extent and
frequency of licensing changes by analyzing the licens-
ing evolution of six open source systems: ArgoUML,
Eclipse-JDT, the FreeBSD and OpenBSD kernels, the
Mozilla Suite, and Samba.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 shows several
cases in which licensing changes impacted software usage
and integration. Section 3 describes the licensing analy-
sis process. Section 4 describes our study and the process
followed to mine data from the six chosen FOSS systems.
Section 5 presents the empirical study results. Section 6
discusses the results along with threats to validity. After a
discussion of related work in Section 7, Section 8 concludes
and outlines directions for future work.
2. LICENSING EVOLUTION
A dual relation exists between license evolution and chan-
ges in licensing statements. Licensing statements are chan gedto allow developers using the license that better ﬁts their
needs and–or users’ needs. Such changes occur by modify-
ing the licensing statements of the system ﬁles to refer to
a diﬀerent license, to a new version of the original license,
or to update the license when it is included in the licens-
ing statements. Therefore, licensing changes depend on the
availability of ﬁtting licenses. We ﬁrst illustrate licens e evo-
lution and then licensing evolution using real-world cases .
2.1 License Evolution
License evolution is driven by many factors. On the one
hand, copyright owners want licenses to adapt to the new
legal landscape and include their speciﬁc requirements. Fo r
example, the Netscape Public License, the IBM Public Li-
cense, and the Apple Public Licenses were created to satisfy
their organizations’ requirements. On the other hand, user s
want licenses to adapt to their needs, often by becoming
less restrictive, e.g., the original BSD license (also known as
4-clauses BSD) evolved towards its less restrictive 3-clau ses
and 2-clauses variants. Some licenses evolve towards more
restrictive ones, such as the changes made to the General
Public License (GPL) version 2 to avoid hardware locks and
digital rights management, which led to the GPL v3. In
other cases, licenses evolve due to external pressures. For ex-
ample, the evolution of the license of Mozilla from Netscape
Public License (NPL) to Mozilla Public License (MPL) v1.1
was triggered by the opposition of the open-source commu-
nity to some of the terms in the NPL. This evolution re-
ﬂected an interest of the Mozilla Foundation, the copyright
owner of Mozilla, to address its users’ concerns.
Table 1 shows some of the most commonly used FOSS
licenses, the rationales for their evolution, and where app li-
cable, the other licenses on which they are based. With a
large number of available licenses, among which 65 are cer-
tiﬁed by the Open Source Initiative, it is not surprising tha t
licensing statements evolve.
2.2 WhenLicensingEvolutionaffectsSoftware
Usage: FiveCases
We now report cases in which licensing evolution was trig-
gered by a speciﬁc requirement and inﬂuenced the way in
which the system is used. Table 2 summarizes these cases.
Case1: OpenBSDIPFilter Replacement.
In 2001, the author of IPFilter, a ﬁrewall package used by
OpenBSD, added an extra sentence to the licensing state-
ment of each ﬁles of IPFilter and, hence, to the IPFilter
license. According to the author, this sentence was a clariﬁ -
cation to the terms of the license but developers of OpenBSD
considered this a new condition, incompatible with the li-
cense of OpenBSD. OpenBSD developers decided to replace
IPFilter with a new OpenBSD-based implementation [12].
Changing the license of FOSS system might result in users
no longer being able to reuse the software.
Case2: Java.
Until November 2006, one of the major problems to in-
clude Java in Linux distributions was its license. The licen se
of Java JDK v1.2 included the following sentence: “Except as
speciﬁcally authorized in any Supplemental License Terms,
you may not make copies of Software, other than a single
copy of Software for archival purposes.” This requirement
disallowed the inclusion of Java in Linux distributions. Co n-Table 1: Examples of how some open source licenses have evolv ed over time.

Java Java-speciﬁc License GPL v2 with CLASSPATH exception It allows modifying and updating Java

nally both LGPLv2.1 and GPLv3Project Harmony, a replacement of QT, was abandoned
MySQL LGPL v2.1 GPL v2 It prevents PHP systems to connect to MySQL
sequently, for many years, end-users had to manually down-
load and install Java. Sun Microsystems worked with the
Free Software Foundation (FSF) and released Java 5.0 under
the GPL v2 with an addendum known as the CLASSPATH
exception [9]. This change in the licensing of Java had two
major implications: ﬁrst, Java could from then on be mod-
iﬁed and updated under the GPL v2, without interference
by Sun; and, second, Java programs could be released under
any license as long as they satisfy the conditions stated in
the CLASSPATH exception.
Changing the license of a system can promote and ease
the distribution and reuse of a software system.
Case3: Mono.
Mono2is a framework produced by Novell to support the
.Net API (and thus Microsoft software systems) under oper-
ating systems diﬀerent than Microsoft Windows. Originally ,
the project was distributed under the GPL v2. According
to Mono developers, this license created a potential proble m
when running .Net systems because they could be consid-
ered derivative works of Mono and, hence, required to be
also released under the GPL v2. Consequently, Mono de-
velopers changed its license to MIT/X11, a simple FOSS
license that allows its use along systems distributed under
any commercial or FOSS license [18]. According to Mono’s
project leader, this change was also required by HP as a
condition for its participation as a contributor to the proj ect
[21]. Thus, .Net systems can use Mono regardless of their
respective licenses.
2http://mono-project.comA change to a more permissive license (and in particular,
allowing commercial derivative works) may increase the siz e
of the community of contributors to a FOSS system.
Case4: QT.
QT is a library of GUI widgets, originally developed by
Trolltech, bought by Nokia in 2008. QT was ﬁrst released
under a non-open source but free license, called the FreeQT
License, and a commercial license. QT became the basis for
KDE, the desktop suite for Unix systems. Many objected
to the use of a non-open source library as the basis of a
major open-source system, including Richard Stallman. To
address these issues, QT v2.0 was released under a new li-
cense, called the Q Public License. The Q Public License
was approved by the Open Source Initiative but deemed in-
compatible with the GPL by the FSF [7]. According to the
FSF, because many application in KDE are licensed under
the GPL, this incompatibility makes their use of QT a vio-
lation of their own license (the KDE project disputed this
view). Consequently, the GNOME project was started as a
QT-free alternative to KDE, while the Harmony project was
started to implement a replacement of QT to be licensed un-
der the GPL. Trolltech changed the license of QT v3 to the
GPL v2. The Harmony Project was no longer necessary and
abandoned [15]. When Nokia acquired Trolltech, it changed
the license of QT v4.6 to a dual LGPL v2.1 and GPL v3.
Changing the license of FOSS system towards a more per-
missive might cause the abandonment of a competing system.
Case5: MySQL.
In 2004, MySQL AB changed the license of its client li-braries from LGPL v2.1 to GPL v2. This change was in-
tended to prevent industrial companies from using the li-
braries within proprietary products without paying for a
commercial license. Unfortunately, it had also unintended
consequences: PHP systems were no longer able to connect
to MySQL because the PHP license is incompatible with
the GPL v2. MySQL addressed this problem by adding the
MySQL FOSS License Exception to the GPL v2 [9].
Changing the license of a FOSS system might have unin-
tended or undesirable consequences to its legitimate users .
Lessonsfrom theseﬁvecases.
We illustrated using ﬁve cases, summarized in Table 2,
that changes in licensing can have various consequences (ex -
pected and unexpected). Thus, developers and their orga-
nizations should be aware of licensing changes and their po-
tential eﬀects. FOSS development encourages the contribu-
tions of many developers, who can willfully or inadvertentl y
change licensing statements. Therefore, an approach to an-
alyze licensing changes in source code is needed.
3. LICENSING ANALYSISMETHOD
The analysis of licensing changes takes as input source
code ﬁle revisions extracted from version control systems
(such CVS or SVN) and the corresponding change logs. It
consists of four steps: the ﬁrst step extracts licensing sta te-
ments from ﬁles, the last three collect data to analyze how
the statements changed. Without loss of generality, we limi t
our analysis to .java ﬁles for Java systems; .hand.cfor C
systems; and, .h,.c, and.cppﬁles for C++ systems. We
also analyze changes occurring to copyright owners’ names,
as presented in another paper [3].
Step1: Extractinglicensingstatements.
We extract the licensing statement of a ﬁle as its ﬁrst two
blocks of comments, where a block is a sequence of consecu-
tive comments with no source code in between. We created
our own comment extractor based on a comment-removal
tool adapted to export comments instead of removing them3.
We consider the ﬁrst two blocks of comments because li-
censing statements are very often interleaved with #include
directives, preprocessor macros, or package declarations .
Step2: Identifyingchangesin licensingstatements.
Licensing statements are usually English text, thus we
cannot compare the licensing statements in two ﬁle revi-
sions using a line diﬀerencing tool, such as diff. Therefore,
we compare licensing statements of subsequent ﬁle revision s
by indexing them using Information Retrieval Vector Space
Models and by comparing their models using the cosine sim-
ilarity [6]. In this step, we are interested in anychange,
therefore we use all alpha-numeric words, neither pruning
stop words nor performing stemming.
3Our comment extractor can be downloaded from http://
turingmachine.org/~dmg/comments-1.0.tar.bz2Step3: Classifyinglicenses.
As in our previous work [8], we detect the license(s) of
each ﬁle (a licensing statement can contain multiple licens es)
using the license identiﬁcation tool in FoSSology 1.0.0 [11 ],
which detects licenses using the Binary Symbolic Alignment
Matrix (bSAM) pattern matching algorithm. For each ﬁle,
we ﬁrst classify the license(s) in its ﬁrst revision. Then, w e
perform the classiﬁcation every time the cosine between the
licensing statements of two subsequent ﬁle revisions is les s
than 0 .99. We choose 0 .99 for two reasons: ﬁrst, FoSSology
is very slow (it might take more than a minute to analyze a
source code ﬁle even on a fast computer); second, a manual
inspection of the classiﬁcations shows that, for higher cos ine
values, changes did not aﬀect the legal implications of the
licensing statements.
Step4: Identifyingchangesin copyrightyears.
We extract copyright years from licenses by mining nu-
meric sequences of two or four digits, matching years be-
tween 1990 and 2009. Our heuristics can detect single years
and year ranges, e.g., 1998–2001, which we convert into a
series of years: 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001. We prune years
automatically inserted by CVS and SVN ($Id$ tags) or fol-
lowed by time, which should not occur in copyrights.
4. EMPIRICALSTUDY
Thegoalof this study is to analyze licensing evolution,
with the purpose of investigating how developers change li-
censing statements in source code ﬁles. The quality focus is
related to the kind of changes occurring in licensing state-
ments. The perspective is of researchers who want to gain
insights on when and how licensing statements are changed
to understand the relevance and impact of licensing changes .
It is also of practitioners who want to realize the extent and
importance of licensing evolution.
Thecontext consists of the CVS or SVN repositories of six
FOSS systems: ArgoUML, Eclipse-JDT, the FreeBSD and
the OpenBSD kernels, Mozilla, and Samba. The systems
have diﬀerent sizes, are developed with diﬀerent program-
ming languages (C, C++, and Java), and belong to diﬀerent
domains: ArgoUML is a Java-based UML modeler; Eclipse-
JDT an extensible development environment in and for Java;
FreeBSD and OpenBSD are kernels of two open Unix oper-
ating systems in C/C++; Mozilla is a suite comprising a
Web browser, an email client, and other Internet utilities i n
C/C++; Samba is a ﬁle and printer service inter-operating
between Unix and Windows operating systems in C. Table
3 reports characteristics of the six systems, while Table 4
shows the distribution of the licenses in their ﬁrst and last
releases. Only Samba licensing statements never changed.
We choose systems diﬀerent from those illustrated in Sec-
tion 2.2 for three main reasons. First, this choice gives us
is the possibility of analyzing long revisions histories, w hich
are not available for systems such as MySQL or Java. Sec-
ond, while the cases reported in Section 2.2 motivated our
study by showing that licensing changes impact software us-
age, this study investigate the extent and relevancy of li-
censing changes, i.e., whether they often occurs during a
software lifetime. Third, this choice allows us to analyze
large systems, such as the OpenBSD and FreeBSD kernels,
Eclipse-JDT, and Mozilla, in which it is possible to observe
a wide variety of licensing changes.Table 3: Main characteristics of the six systems.

RQ1: How frequently do the licensing statements of source
ﬁles change? This research question is preliminary to the fol-
lowing questions. It aims at providing overall, quantitati ve
data on the frequencies with which licensing statements are
modiﬁed by developers across ﬁle revisions. Also, it inves-
tigates whether such a frequency signiﬁcantly diﬀers among
systems.
RQ2: To what extent are ﬁles changing their licenses? This
research question investigates whether licensing evoluti on
corresponds to moving to a completely diﬀerent license, e.g.,
from BSD towards GPL, or to adding a new license to a ﬁle
already licensed, e.g., from BSD towards a disjunctive BSD
and GPL license.
RQ3: How are copyright years changed in licensing state-
ments? Speciﬁcally, we investigate whether, when a ﬁle is
changed in a given year, its copyright statement contains
such a year. We also investigate if ﬁles reporting a particul ar
year in their copyright undergo signiﬁcantly more changes
during that year than ﬁles that do not report it.
5. RESULTS
This section reports the results of our empirical study to
answer the previous research questions. Data for veriﬁcati on
and replication are available on-line4.
5.1 RQ1: Howfrequentlydothelicensingstate-
ments ofsourceﬁles change?
Figure 1 shows the box-plots of change frequencies for
the licensing statements of the ﬁles belonging to the six
systems, counted as the fraction of commits that involved
changes in their licensing statements. Figure 1(a) shows th e
box-plots of change frequencies related to any change oc-
curring in the licensing statements while Figure 1(b) only
considers substantial changes, changes for which the simi-
larity with respect to the previous ﬁle revision is below 0.9 9.
The box-plots for changes below 0.99—the threshold used
to trigger FoSSology classiﬁcations in RQ2—is very similar
to Figure 1(a), thus it is not shown.
To statistically compare whether the change frequencies
signiﬁcantly diﬀer among systems, we test the null-hypothe sis
H0: the average change frequencies among systems does not
signiﬁcantly diﬀer . Results related to all changes, in Fig-
ure 1(a), indicate that the change-proneness signiﬁcantly
diﬀers among systems ( p-value <0.001 using Kruskal-Wallis
test); OpenBSD, ArgoUML, and FreeBSD, having a higher
licensing change-proneness than the other systems. In par-
ticular, OpenBSD and ArgoUML licensing statements change

Figure 1(b), results are diﬀerent: there is still a signiﬁca nt
diﬀerence among systems (p-value <0.001) but Mozilla has
the higher licensing change-proneness.
We conclude that licensing statements dochange and that,
therefore, it is interesting to study their changes in more
details by answering the following research questions.
5.2 RQ2: To what extent are ﬁles changing
their licenses?
Table 5 shows the counts of the most frequent license
changes occurring in the six systems. It shows that ﬁles
that had their licenses changed between two revisions and
excludes ﬁles that have had the same license(s) since their
ﬁrst revision. Each system has diﬀerent changed patterns.
ArgoUML : Table 4 shows that the licenses of ArgoUML
ﬁles are essentially the same in its ﬁrst and last version.
The results in Table 5 support this observation. There are
only few ﬁles that changed their licenses from None to the
‘UC Regents free with copyright clause’-style , which is a per-
missive license that imposes very few constraints.
Eclipse-JDT : Table 4 shows that no ﬁle in its ﬁrst version
had a license. As time progressed, licenses have changedTable 5: Changes of license types.

fromNone to CPL v0.5, CPL v1.0, and, ﬁnally, EPL v1.0.
The growing number of ﬁles updated from one license to the
next reﬂects the growth in number of the ﬁles. This change
pattern is consistent with Table 4: in the last analyzed re-
lease, almost all ﬁles were licensed under the EPL v1.0.
FreeBSD : as reported in [8], the ﬁles of FreeBSD and Open-
BSD use a very large number of licenses (albeit most of
them are variants of the BSD license, including the 2- and
3-clauses variants). This use is reﬂected in Table 4 and in
the license changes in Table 5. We observe that the licenses
are moving towards the less restrictive 2- and 3-clauses BSD
licenses. FreeBSD itself is available under a 2-clauses BSD
license.
OpenBSD : OpenBSD is a fork of FreeBSD; it is not surpris-
ing that its license changes are similar to that of FreeBSD.
The major diﬀerence is that OpenBSD is available under a
3-clauses BSD license while FreeBSD under 2-clauses BSD.
This diﬀerence is reﬂected in Tables 4 and 5, where OpenBSD
has more transitions towards 3-clauses BSD licenses while
FreeBSD has more towards 2-clauses BSD. There are also
many ﬁles that changed from having a license to None.
Mozilla : Mozilla has seen a natural progression from NPL
towards the current disjunctive GPL v2 and MPL v1.05. It
has moved from the original NPL v1.0 to the v1.1 (equiv-
alent to the MPL v1.1) plus the GPL. We were surprised
to also observe a change in the opposite direction: on Jan
19, 2001, 1,111 ﬁles were changed from GPL/MPL to NPL.
This change was reverted few hours later. The correspond-
ing defect (#98089) states that there was a bug in the script
responsible for changing the license.
Samba : Table 4 shows that Samba has had almost no
changes in its licenses; it has always been released under
5Mozilla is currently licensed under a disjunctive license c on-
sisting of the GPL v2, the MPL v1.0, and the LGPL v2.1;
FoSSology is not able to detect the LGPL in this case.Table 6: Relationship between ﬁle changes and copy-

are likely ﬁles that were originally inserted without a lice nse
and later ﬁxed.
5.3 RQ3: Howarecopyrightyearschangedin
licensing statements?
Figure 2 reports the percentages of ﬁle revisions, for each
systems, where the ﬁles that underwent at least one change
in a particular year also had a copyright year added or mod-
iﬁed in their licensing statements.
ArgoUML andEclipse-JDT —the two analyzed Java sys-
tems—started with a (relatively) low percentages of ﬁles
with years updated, about 70% for ArgoUML and above
50% for Eclipse-JDT. Then, the percentages increased to-
wards 80% for Eclipse-JDT and close to 100% for ArgoUML.

its history before this change.ting of copyright years than the two Java systems, with a
relatively higher number of update in the ﬁrst year, above
50% for FreeBSD, below 40% for OpenBSD.
Mozilla is similar to FreeBSD and OpenBSD but with a
lower percentages of updates, starting from 20% in the ﬁrst
year and then decreasing towards 10%.
Samba has percentages of changes of copyright years higher
in the ﬁrst three years, above 50%, then lower in the subse-
quent years, below 40%.
We also assess whether ﬁles containing a year in the copy-
right underwent a higher number of changes in that year
than other ﬁles. We test the null hypothesis: H0: the num-
ber of changes, during one year, for ﬁles reporting such a
year in their copyright does not signiﬁcantly diﬀer from the
number of changes occurring to other ﬁles .
Table 6 shows descriptive statistics for the two groups of
ﬁles,p-values resulting from the Mann-Whitney, two-tailed
test used for the comparison, and the Cohen deﬀect size [2],
indicating the magnitude of the diﬀerence. The eﬀect size
is deﬁned, for independent samples, as the diﬀerence be-
tween the means, M1andM2, divided by the pooled stan-
dard deviation σof both groups σ=p
(σ2
1+σ2
2)/2,i.e.,
d= (M1−M2)/σ. It is considered small for d ≥0.2, medium
for d≥0.5 and large for d ≥0.8. Results indicate that the dif-
ference is always statistically signiﬁcant ( p-value <0.01),
i.e., ﬁles exhibiting a change in their copyright year un-
derwent signiﬁcantly higher number of changes during that
year. The eﬀect size is always small or even negligible, but
for OpenBSD where it is medium. This analysis was re-
peated by counting lines added/removed instead of the com-
mits and consistent results were found.
6. DISCUSSION
Changes to licensing statements account for a large pro-
portion of the changes occurring to source code ﬁles. Our
results show that, for three of the six systems (ArgoUML,
FreeBSD, and OpenBSD), licensing statements changed in
about 60% of the ﬁle revisions (median value), while for the
other systems (Eclipse-JDT, Mozilla, and Samba), the me-
dian frequency is between 20% and 40%. However, small
changes are most frequent and more substantial changes
only occur on a small percentage of ﬁle revisions—below
20%. Yet, in some cases, we found that even relatively small
changes meant a transition towards a diﬀerent license ( e.g.,
a change from a CPL 1.0 to EPL 1.0 requires a change in
only two words: Common toEclipse andcpltoepl).
By relating what we discussed in Section 2 about license
evolution with results shown in Table 5, we can observe that
some of the analyzed systems have changed their licenses in
ways similar to which these licenses have evolved. The IBM
Public License evolved into the CPL v0.5, the CPL v1.0,
and, ﬁnally, the EPL v1.0. Our results show how the licens-
ing of Eclipse-JDT followed that evolution. The diﬀerences
between the original IBM Public License and the EPL are
minor and primarily divided in two areas: ﬁrst, IBM has
relinquished control of these licenses to the Eclipse Found a-
tion; and, second, clariﬁcations are made regarding patent s
and the ways in which the Eclipse Foundation accepts source
code contributions [4].
Similarly, Mozilla has seen its licenses changing from the
original NPL to a combination of MPL and the GPL. The
NPL guaranteed to Netscape the right to distribute the
source code under any condition and license, regardless ofwho contributed to the source code. This license allowed to
release Netscape 6 as a proprietary system. The MPL re-
moved this asymmetry between Netscape and other contrib-
utors, allowing to re-distribute the source code if it remai ned
under the MPL. Mozilla’s most recent changes highlight an-
other important fact: the Mozilla Foundation is aware of
the constraints imposed by incompatible software licenses .
In an attempt to deal with this problem, they have licensed
Mozilla source code under any of three licenses: the MPL
v1.1, the GPL v2+, and the LGPL v2.1+. The user can
select the license that best ﬁts her purpose.
In both Eclipse-JDT and Mozilla, licensing changes rigor-
ously followed the evolution of the licenses. This is not sur -
prising: the CPL and the EPL were created for the Eclipse
Foundations’s projects; the NPL and MPL for Mozilla Foun-
dation’s projects. In both cases, the actual changes to the
license are minor and answer concerns of the communities
of each of the Foundations.
FreeBSD and OpenBSD are more eclectic in their license
changes. This is probably the result of a very heterogeneous
community of contributors, and the result of code that is
frequently imported from external sources (as we reported
in [8]). Nonetheless, we can see a clear pattern moving from
the old BSD-4 clauses license to the more permissive BSD-3
and BSD-2 licenses.
Some other systems—such as ArgoUML and Samba—
have kept the same licenses over the entire analyzed time
span. In the few cases in which the licensing statement
of ﬁles changed in these systems, licensing statements were
added to the ﬁles, i.e., a change from None to the usual
license. The implications of the changes in licenses for eac h
of the projects is diﬀerent. In ArgoUML, the change is from
None to a simple license. We presume that at some point
its authors realized the importance of including a license.
The numbers of times that systems have changed their
licenses varies. We observed that Eclipse-JDT has used four
diﬀerent licenses and Mozilla two. These numbers show the
willingness of the Eclipse and Mozilla Foundations to adapt
the licensing statement of their systems to their users’ nee ds.
Changes in copyright years followed diﬀerent patterns in
diﬀerent systems: in ArgoUML and Eclipse-JDT, years were
almost always updated, with increasing updating percent-
ages, reaching values above 80%. We found lower and de-
creasing percentages in the other systems: the percentages
are higher during the ﬁrst year when the ﬁles are created
with licensing statements. Also, we found that ﬁles for whic h
the copyright years were updated underwent higher numbers
of changes: when developers perform substantial changes to
a ﬁle, they also update copyright years. Copyright regu-
lations (and in particular, the copyright regulations of th e
USA) require the copyright notice to include the year of the
publication of new code. Although this requirement is not
mandatory to grant copyright protection, failing to proper ly
update the copyright year when substantial changes occur
would allow an infringer to claim “innocent infringement”.
In some systems, Eclipse-JDT for example, it is possi-
ble to notice commits explicitly targeted to copyright year s
updates. For example, the commit done on 2003-03-12,
12:22:01 by dmegert says “Updated copyrights”, or the com-
mit done on 2004-01-13, 15:48:41 by jlanneluc says“Updated
copyrights to 2004”.6.1 Threats to Validity
This section discusses the main threats to the validity of
our study. Construct validity threats concern the relation
between the treatment and the outcome. They can be due
to our measurements, i.e., the way we extracted licenses,
classify them, and identify their changes. We extracted li-
censes using an already-existing approach [8, 10]. We have
considered the ﬁrst two blocks of consecutive comments in a
ﬁle as its licensing statement to reduce the risk of missing a
license. It can be therefore possible that we included in our
study comments not belonging to a license. However, such
a measurement error would only aﬀect RQ1. It would not
aﬀect the results of the other questions, because the clas-
siﬁcation of the license is unlikely to be aﬀected by more
text than the license itself. As reported in [11], the licens e
classiﬁcation performed by FoSSology has some imprecision ,
particularly in complex licensing statements, e.g., it did not
detect the LGPL in the disjunctive license of Mozilla. Nev-
ertheless, from the inspections we made, such an imprecisio n
is mostly limited to discern among variants of licenses em-
bedded in the licensing statement, e.g., among BSD licenses.
We have added new licenses [8] and submitted defect reports
to FoSSology to improve its classiﬁcation. Our experience
with FoSSology is positive but needs to be empirically evalu -
ated to properly assess its accuracy. We could not ﬁnd cases
where a license dramatically changed due to small textual
changes: a manual validation shows that that any change in
the license types—even the transition from CPL to EPL—
yields a textual similarity between the previous and the new
licensing statement lower than the threshold of 0 .99.
Threats to internal validity do not aﬀect this study, being
an exploratory study [22]. For the same reason, threats to
conclusion validity are also not important, although we used
statistical tests where appropriate and made sure that the
conditions for their applicability held.
Threats to external validity are related to the generaliz-
ability of our ﬁndings. Our study concerns a reasonably
large variety of six systems, developed in diﬀerent program -
ming languages, belonging to diﬀerent domains, and experi-
encing diﬀerent kinds of evolutions, e.g., systems developed
from scratch (ArgoUML and Samba) and others that orig-
inated in industry (Eclipse-JDT and Mozilla). Yet, it is
necessary to replicate this study on other systems, in parti c-
ular industrial systems, to conﬁrm its generalizability an d
to study the use of FOSS code in industrial systems.
Regarding reliability validity ,i.e., the possibility of repli-
cating this study, we have detailed the data extraction pro-
cess and the source code and changes for the six systems are
available from their CVS/SVN repositories. Furthermore,
we made available the extracted data and tools used in this
study.
7. RELATED WORK
To the best of our knowledge, only few recent works specif-
ically dealt with licensing evolution. This section discus ses
related work concerning the analysis of licenses and the evo -
lution of source code comments, because licensing state-
ments are a particular kind of comments.
Licenses impose constraints and thus can be deﬁned as
logical formulae constraining what can and cannot be done
with a system. Software licensing patterns have been re-
cently studied by German et al. [10] using such a formal-ization of licenses. They introduced several legal pattern s,
along with examples of occurrences of these patterns. In a
previous work [8], we presented a study of the inﬂuence of
software licenses on code migration between the FreeBSD,
Linux, and OpenBSD kernels. Our ﬁndings support the hy-
pothesis of a preferential code ﬂow induced by permissive
licenses from FreeBSD and OpenBSD towards Linux.
Because licenses are contained in licensing statements,
the analysis of licensing evolution or of comment evolu-
tion are similar in their approaches and tools. Fluri et
al.[5] investigated comments and code co-evolution by an-
alyzing three FOSS systems (ArgoUML, Eclipse-JDT, and
Azureus). They found that (i) new code is not much com-
mented, (ii) most of the comments refer to class and method
declarations, and (iii) comments are consistently updated
with their associated code. Jiang and Hassan [14] exam-
ined the evolution of comments in PostgreSQL considering
comment additions and deletions. They found that, on aver-
age, the percentage of commented functions remain constant
except for some variations due to developers’ commenting
style. Lawrie et al. [16] measured the quality of identiﬁers
by measuring the extent of their relations to words occurrin g
in comments. They found that, in general, full identiﬁers
ensure better comprehension than abbreviation, although
there are exceptions. Ying et al.[23] studied the use of com-
ments as a means of communication among Eclipse devel-
opers. They discovered that comments are not only used to
help understanding the code but also to communicate tasks,
activities, and to assign tasks to other team members. Hin-
dleet al. [13] discovered that many of the largest commits
correspond to changes to the licenses or copyright owners
of ﬁles. We share with these previous works the heuristics
used to identify comments and to compare them using infor-
mation retrieval methods, although we speciﬁcally focus on
comments related to licenses, i.e., on licensing evolution and
changes to copyright years. Finally, a related paper by Di
Penta and German [3] studied changes occurring to copy-
right owners’ names and found that explicit contributors
and copyright owners are often added to licensing statement
during larger changes, although the number of changes they
performed is not higher than that of other committers.
8. CONCLUSION
As several cases occurring in the open-source world sug-
gest, licensing changes can have an impact on the software
lifetime, or even on other, competitor, software systems.
This paper proposed a method to track the evolution of
software licensing and investigated the relevance of licen s-
ing evolution on six FOSS systems. Most noticeably, we
observed license changes, from one license to another, li-
cense additions, e.g., ﬁles without license were updated with
a license, and license modiﬁcations. For large systems like
Eclipse-JDT, Mozilla, or the BSD kernels, the amount and
frequency of licensing changes would make diﬃcult their
manual analysis, thus highlighting the usefulness of an aut o-
matic analysis method. Finally, we investigated changes oc -
curring to copyright years and found that they are updated
to protect new code when substantial changes are made to a
source code ﬁle. We consequently brought evidence on the
evolution of software licensing, which suggests that this ﬁ eld
of analysis should be further studied to better understand
its impact and rationale.
Future works will be devoted to study the licensing evolu-tion in entire software distributions, with the aim of relat ing
changes in licensing of some components/products with thei r
removal in subsequent versions of the distribution, and wit h
the adoption of alternative products (as in the cases of IP-
Filter or QT). We will also investigate on a very large sample
of FOSS systems the evolution of their licensing statements ,
i.e., how diﬀerent kinds of FOSS licenses are adapted over
the time to cope with weaknesses or limitations of older li-
censes, and to characterize licensing evolution patterns i n
diﬀerent categories of software systems.
