ABSTRACT
Software development organizations have adopted open source
development practices to support or augment their software devel-
opment processes, a phenomenon referred to as inner source . Given
the rapid adoption of inner source, we wonder what motivates
software practitioners to contribute to inner source projects. We
followed a mixed-methods approach–a qualitative phase of inter-
views with 20 interviewees, followed by a quantitative phase of an
exploratory survey with 124 respondents from 13 countries across
four continents. Our study uncovers practitioners’ motivation to
contribute to inner source projects, as well as how the motivation
differs from what motivates practitioners to participate in open
source projects. We also investigate how software practitioners’
motivation impacts their contribution level and continuance inten-
tion in inner source projects. Based on our findings, we outline
directions for future research and provide recommendations for
organizations and software practitioners.

1 INTRODUCTION
Open source software (OSS) has been making an enormous im-
pact on the software industry. OSS is recognized to be capable
of delivering high-quality software products with a fast develop-
ment cycle [ 12]. Software development organizations have widely
adopted OSS in a variety of ways, e.g., integrating OSS components
into proprietary software products [ 20] and leveraging OSS tools
as part of software development processes [ 17]. In addition to the
∗Corresponding author.adoption of OSS, numerous software development organizations
have shown a significant interest in adopting OSS development
practices to exploit the benefits of OSS [ 61]. The use of OSS devel-
opment practices within organizations is called inner source . Inner
source allows universal access to the development artifacts inside
an organization [ 39,48]. Thus, everyone within the organization
can potentially become contributors to inner source projects. Unlike
traditional software development within an organization, contrib-
utors of an inner source project do not belong to a single team or
organizational unit.
The growth of inner source adoption led to the emergence of a
number of studies on inner source. Prior studies investigate the chal-
lenges of inner source adoption, e.g., cultural transition [ 2,27] and
competing tensions among stakeholders within organizations [25,
62,63,70]. Researchers also propose frameworks [ 14,27,55,61,65],
tools [ 8,38] and models [ 16,68,70] to support practices of inner
source software development. Nevertheless, there has been little
focus on investigating what motivates software practitioners to
contribute to inner source development. An understanding of soft-
ware practitioners’ motivation is of essential importance to attract
the participation of more practitioners and sustain inner source
development.
To address this gap, we followed a mixed-methods approach to
investigate software practitioners’ motivation to contribute to inner
source development. We started with semi-structured interviews
with 20 software practitioners with experience in inner source
development, who have an average of 8.1 years of professional
experience in software development. Through the interviews, we
qualitatively investigated the motivation that drives software prac-
titioners to participate in inner source development, as well as their
experience in inner source development. We further performed an
exploratory survey with 124 software practitioners from 13 coun-
tries to quantitatively validate the motivation and practices that
are uncovered in our interviews. We investigated the following
research questions:
RQ1. What motivates software practitioners to participate
in inner source projects?ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore Wan et al.
Software practitioners are motivated by both internal motiva-
tion1, e.g., helping others , and external motivation2, e.g., job re-
sponsibility , to contribute to inner source development. The survey
respondents report stronger agreement on internal motivation than
on external motivation. The survey respondents who contribute to
utility-oriented projects show stronger motivation for sharing than
those who contribute to service-oriented projects3.
RQ2: How does the motivation of software practitioners dif-
fer when they contribute to inner source development com-
pared with open source development?
In comparison with open source development, software practi-
tioners tend to have higher motivation for software improvement
andjob responsibility when they contribute to inner source develop-
ment. Meanwhile, they show lower motivation for funwhen they
participate in inner source development.
RQ3: How does motivation influence the contribution level
and continuance intention of software practitioners in inner
source development?
The level of job responsibility motivation is positively correlated
with the contribution level of software practitioners in inner source
development. The levels of all measured motivators are positively
correlated with the intention of software practitioners to be in-
volved in inner source development in the future, where the corre-
lations vary from moderate to weak.
Based on our findings, we discuss implications and provide prac-
tical lessons for attracting and retaining software practitioners for
inner source development. In summary, we make the following con-
tributions: (1) We identify 14 motivators of software practitioners to
contribute to inner source development based on a mixed-methods
approach; (2) We highlight the differences between inner source
and OSS motivations; (3) We provide practical implications for sus-
taining inner source development, and outlined future avenues of
research; (4) We provide the interview guide, questionnaire, and
survey responses publicly accessible for future investigation by
others4.
2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Research on Inner Source
Prior research presents a steady stream of case studies with organi-
zations and companies that have adopted inner source programs,
including Alcatel-Lucent [ 26,27], DLR [ 54], DTE Energy [ 58], Er-
icsson [ 65], Google [ 71], Hewlett-Packard [ 14,42], IBM [ 5,68],
Kitware [ 40], Microsoft [ 3,45], Nokia [ 39], Philips Healthcare [ 70],
and SAP [ 48]. These studies report specific inner source programs
of various organizations and companies. The specific inner source
programs could be further classified into two models, infrastructure-
based inner source and project-specific inner source, according to
the classification framework of inner source introduced by Gurbani
1Internal motivation: people stand behind a behavior out of their interests and val-
ues [51].
2External motivation: people do a behavior for reasons external to the self [51].
3Utility-oriented projects fill an immediate need in functionalities; service-oriented
projects provide stable and robust services to end-users of the inner source software;
exploration-oriented projects make innovation accessible to the inner source commu-
nity. [7].
4https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6367434et al. [ 27]. For instance, IBM and Microsoft adopted infrastructure-
based inner source programs, where a central group provides suit-
able inner source infrastructure and individuals and teams within
an organization/company can run their own inner source projects.
Philips Healthcare and Alcatel-Lucent adopted project-based inner
source programs, in which an organizational unit (a core team)
takes responsibility for a specific inner source project. Organiza-
tions and companies implement different inner source development
practices in terms of participatory reuse, collaborative development,
self-selection of tasks, and volunteering [ 7]. In addition, some stud-
ies propose metrics to quantify inner source development practices,
e.g., size of an inner source program [ 14,39,48,65] and inner source
collaboration [6, 26].
Inner source allows universal access to development artifacts
throughout an organization/company [ 39,48]. Thus, everyone
within the organization/company can potentially become contrib-
utors to inner source projects. Gurbani et al. [ 26] suggest that
multiple roles are involved in the community of an inner source
project. The initiator of an inner source project assumes the role of a
benevolent dictator . Some contributors become experts in the course
of development, who are further promoted to be trusted lieutenants .
The benevolent dictator and trusted lieutenants form a core team
of an inner source project. Additional roles of contributors may
emerge to tail the implementation of inner source to a particular
context [27].
The motivation of contributors to participate is of essential im-
portance to the success of software development projects [ 74].
Nonetheless, there is no existing study that systematically explores
the motivation of software practitioners to contribute to inner
source development. In this work, we quantitatively analyze soft-
ware practitioners’ motivation to contribute to inner source devel-
opment, and further investigate the relationship between motiva-
tion and contribution level and continuance intention of software
practitioners.
2.2 Research on Motivations in Software
Engineering
Motivation has been the object of studies in a variety of areas
for a long time [ 59], including software engineering. In software
engineering, the motivation of software practitioners has been in-
tensively studied since the 1980s. Proper management of motivation
could help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity, as
well as avoid human resource turnover, budget overflow, and de-
livery delays [ 4,18]. Sharp et al. [ 56] provide an overview of the
motivation models in software engineering, based on which, they
propose a new model. More recently, Sach et al. suggest a trend
towards more socially oriented motivation in software engineer-
ing via interviews with 13 professional software engineers [ 52].
França et al. [ 19] present a variety of factors that influence work
motivation and job performance in software engineering.
Due to the high degree of autonomy, intrinsic motivation, and
self-determination of OSS contributors, motivations in software
engineering may not apply to OSS development [ 49]. Thus, mo-
tivation to contribute to OSS has been extensively studied since
the 2000s. Some researchers conducted broad surveys to collectWhat Motivates Software Practitioners to Contribute to Inner Source? ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore
OSS contributions [ 23,30]. Other researchers conducted surveys fo-
cused on motivations of specific OSS communities, e.g., Linux [ 31]
and Apache [ 28,49]. In addition, prior studies investigate the moti-
vation of specific groups of OSS contributors, e.g., newcomers [ 29],
one-time code contributors [ 37], quasi-contributors [ 60], and stu-
dents [57].
In 2012, Von Krogh et al. [ 69] provided a literature review of
studies on the motivation for participation in OSS development.
They identified ten categories of motivations, grouped as intrinsic,
internalized-extrinsic, and extrinsic motivations. Intrinsic motiva-
tion moves the person to act for the fun or challenge entailed rather
than in response to external pressures or rewards [ 51]. In contrast,
extrinsic motivations are based on outside incentives when people
change their actions due to an external intervention [ 21]. Devel-
opers can also internalize extrinsic motivations in a way that they
are perceived as self-regulating behavior rather than external im-
positions [ 13,49]. These internalized extrinsic motivations include
reputation, reciprocity, learning, and own-use. Researchers also
investigated the relation between motivation and other factors, e.g.,
retention [ 72], task effort [ 32], intention to contribute [ 73], and
contribution level [ 41]. Most recently, Gerosa et al. [ 22] replicate,
and extend previous research on motivation to contribute to OSS,
and investigate the shift of motivation.
Considering inner source is the use of open source development
practices within organizations, in this work, we investigate the
difference in motivations when software practitioners contribute
to inner source compared with open source development.
3 METHODOLOGY
Our research methodology followed a mixed-methods approach, as
depicted in Figure 1. We collected data from two different sources5:
(1) We interviewed 20 software practitioners with experience in
inner source development, and derived a list of statements and
potential answers for survey questions from the results of inter-
views; (2) We surveyed 124 respondents with experience in inner
source development. To preserve the anonymity of participants,
we anonymized all items that constitute Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) before analyzing the data, and further considered
aliases as PII throughout our study (e.g., we refer to the interviewees
as P1 - P20).
3.1 Interviews
The left part of Figure 1 describes the process of interviews.
3.1.1 Participant Selection. We recruited full-time software prac-
titioners with experience in inner source development from tech
companies (e.g., Alibaba, Huawei, and Tencent). Interviewees were
recruited by emailing our contact in each company, who dissemi-
nated the news of our study to their colleagues. Volunteers would
inform us if they were willing to participate in our study with no
compensation. 20 volunteers contacted us and participated in the
interviews. In the remainder of this paper, we denote these 20 in-
terviewees as P1 to P20. The 20 interviewees have an average of 8.1
years of professional experience in software development (min: 4,
5The interviews and survey were approved by the relevant institutional review board
(IRB). Participants were instructed that we wanted their opinions; privacy and sensitive
information would not be intentionally mentioned.Table 1: Interviewees with “extensive” experience in a par-
ticular job role.

max: 20, median: 6.5, std: 4.2), and an average of 2.6 years of expe-
rience in inner source development (min: 0.5, max: 8, median: 2.0,
std: 2.0). Table 1 summarizes the interviewees who perceived them-
selves as having “extensive” experience (in comparison to “none”
and “some” experience) in a particular job role.
3.1.2 Protocol. The first author conducted a series of face-to-face
interviews with the 20 software practitioners. Each interview took
30-45 minutes. The interviews were semi-structured and made use
of an interview guide6.
The interview comprised three parts. In the first part, we asked
some demographic questions about the experience of the inter-
viewees in software development. The questions covered various
aspects of experience, including years of experience, tenure7, pro-
gramming languages, job roles, and experience in open source
development. In the second part, we asked the interviewees about
their specific experience in inner source development. Specifically,
we asked: (1) how many projects they have participated in; (2) what
roles they have played in the projects; (3) how much time per week
they spend contributing to their primary project. In the third part,
we asked open-ended questions about the motivations to contribute
to inner source. This part aims to allow the interviewees to speak
freely about their opinions without the interviewer biasing their
responses. At the end of each interview, we thanked the interviewee
and briefly informed her of our next plans.
3.1.3 Data Analysis. We conducted a thematic analysis to process
the recorded interviews by following the steps below:
Transcribing and Coding. We transcribed the recordings of the
interviews as the interviews proceeded, and developed a thorough
understanding by reviewing the transcripts. The first author read
the transcripts and coded the interviews using NVivo qualitative
analysis software [ 1]. To ensure the quality of codes, another author
verified initial codes created by the first author and provided sug-
gestions for improvement. After incorporating these suggestions,
we generated a total of 468 cards for codes - 21 to 35 cards for each
coded interview. After merging the codes with the same words or
meanings, we have a total of 127 unique codes. We noticed that
when our interviews were drawing to a close, the collected codes
from interview transcripts reached saturation. New codes did not
appear anymore; the set of codes was considered stable.
Open Card Sorting. Two of the authors then separately analyzed
the codes and sorted the generated cards into potential themes
for thematic similarity (as illustrated in LaToza et al.’s study [ 35]).
The themes that emerged during the sorting were not chosen be-
forehand. We then use the Cohen’s Kappa measure [ 9] to examine
the agreement between the two labelers. The overall Kappa value

between the two labelers is 0.81, indicating substantial agreement
between the labelers. After completing the labeling process, the two
labelers discussed their disagreements to reach a common decision.
To reduce bias from the two authors sorting the cards to form initial
themes, they both reviewed and agreed on the final set of themes.
Eventually, we derived 14 statements that describe the motivation
of software practitioners to contribute to inner source development,
and options for survey questions regarding inner source practices.
3.2 Survey
The right part of Figure 1 describes the process of our online survey.
3.2.1 Recruitment of Respondents. We spread the survey to a broad
range of companies from various locations worldwide. No identify-
ing information was required or gathered from our respondents. To
get a sufficient number of respondents from diverse backgrounds,
we followed a multi-pronged strategy to recruit respondents:
•We contacted professionals from various companies around
the world and asked their help to disseminate our survey
within their organizations. Specifically, we sent emails to our
contacts in Alibaba, ByteDance, Google, Hengtian, Huawei,
Tencent and other companies, encouraging them to dissemi-
nate our survey to their colleagues. By following this strategy,
we aimed to recruit respondents in the industry from diverse
organizations.
•We sent an email with a link to the survey to 2,562 practition-
ers who contributed to 25 open source repositories initiated
by tech companies and hosted on GitHub (e.g., tensorflow
andangular ) and solicited their participation. We aimed to
recruit OSS contributors who have inner source experience
in addition to professionals working in the industry. Out of
these emails, five emails received automatic replies notifying
us of the absence of the receiver; two emails indicated the
receivers left their organizations.
3.2.2 Protocol. We conducted an IRB-approved anonymous on-
line survey to validate and quantify the observations from the
interviews and literature. We followed Kitchenham and Pfleeger’s
guidelines for personal opinion surveys [ 33] and used an anony-
mous survey to increase response rates [ 67]. Respondents have
the option to specify that they prefer not to answer or do not un-
derstand the description of a particular question. We include this
option to reduce the possibility of respondents providing arbitrary
answers.
We piloted the preliminary survey with six practitioners with
inner source experience, who were different from our interviewees
and survey takers. We obtained feedback on (1) the length of the
survey, and (2) the clarity and understandability of the terms. Wemade minor modifications to the preliminary survey based on the
received feedback and produced a final version. The collected re-
sponses from the pilot survey are excluded from the presented
results in this paper.
To support respondents from China, we translated our survey
to Chinese before publishing the survey. We chose to make our
survey available both in English and Chinese because English is
an international lingua franca, and Chinese is the most spoken
language. We expected that a large number of our survey recipients
are fluent in one of these two languages. We carefully translated our
survey to make sure there exists no ambiguity between English and
Chinese terms in our survey. Also, we polished the translation by
improving clarity and understandability according to the feedback
from our pilot survey.
3.2.3 Survey Design. The survey includes different types of ques-
tions, e.g., multiple-choice and free-text answer questions. The po-
tential answers and statements of multiple-choice questions were
derived from the results of our interviews. We include an “ I don’t
understand ” option in case some questions are not applicable to the
experience of respondents, or respondents had a poor understand-
ing.
The survey consists of three sections, grouping questions by
topic to minimize the cognitive load on participants and allow them
to consider the topic more deeply [ 36]. Specifically, the following
sections have been captured in the survey (the complete question-
naire is available online as supplemental material8):
Demographics. We collected demographic information about the
respondents to allow us to (1) filter respondents who may not un-
derstand our survey, i.e., respondents without any experience in
inner source development, (2) break down the results into groups.
Based on the selections of respondents, we could exclude invalid
responses and divide the survey respondents into various groups.
To focus the respondents’ attention on a particular inner source
project, the survey asked respondents to answer following ques-
tions according to the experience with their primary inner source
project.
We received a total of 327 responses, and first excluded two
responses made by non-software practitioners who described their
job roles as sales and legal affairs. We then excluded 191 responses
made by respondents who claimed that they do not have experience
in inner source development. We further excluded 10 incomplete
responses from 10 respondents who have experience in inner source
development but selected the “I don’t understand” option for one to
two questions out of seven questions. The seven questions receive

one to three “I don’t understand” responses in total. In the end, we
had a set of 124 valid responses.
Our survey respondents reside in 13 countries across 4 continents
as shown in Figure 2. Note that only 28 out of the 124 respondents
reported their current country of residence because it is optional
to answer the relevant question. The top four counties in which
respondents reside are China (12), France (3), United States (2), and
Netherlands (2). As presented in Table 2, our survey respondents
are diverse in terms of age, gender, tenure, job role, professional
experience, and experience in OSS development.Experience with Inner Source. This section investigates the spe-
cific inner source experience of software practitioners, specifically,
project objective, governance model, role(s), contribution level, and
continuance intention in inner source development. The questions
include:
•What best describes the objective of the primary inner source
project you contribute to? (Exploration-oriented / Utility-oriented
/ Service-oriented)
•How is your primary inner source project governed? (By a
single organizational unit / By multiple organizational units /
By all organizational units)
•What best describes the role(s) you play in your primary inner
source project?
•How much time per week do you spend contributing to your
primary inner source project? (0-5 hours per week / 5-10 hours
per week / 10-20 hours per week / >= 20 hours per week)
In terms of the third question, we provided two dimensions of op-
tions for roles, project-centric roles and community-centric roles,
as suggested in [ 66]. In terms of the project-centric roles, an inner
source contributor can be Coder ,Project Manager , and System Ad-
ministrator . As for the community-centric roles, an inner source
contributor can be Founder ,Advocate ,Mentor ,Strategist ,Treasurer
andWriter . The fourth question is commonly used in OSS studies
as a proxy for participant contribution [44].
To understand the continuance intention of software practition-
ers, we further asked respondents to state how strongly they agree
or disagree with the statement “ I look forward to being involved
in inner source development in the future ” on a 5 level Likert-scale
(strongly disagree ,disagree ,neutral ,agree ,strongly agree ). The con-
struct is used in a previous study [ 34] to measure continuance
intention of software practitioners in OSS development.
Motivation to Contribute to Inner Source. This section focused
on motivation to contribute to inner source projects. The motiva-
tion items were extracted from our interviews and presented as
statements to which respondents were asked to state how strongly
they agree or disagree on a 5 level Likert scale ( strongly disagree ,
disagree ,neutral ,agree ,strongly agree ). In addition, we asked re-
spondents to specify any other motivations that were not included
in our questionnaire. More details about the questions and format
are available in Section 4, along with the corresponding results.
3.2.4 Data Analysis. We analyzed the survey results based on the
question types. For multiple-choice questions, we reported the
percentage of each option is selected. In terms of free-text answer
questions, we followed an inductive approach in which two authors
separately performed open card sorting and regularly discussed
emerging themes until an agreement was reached. For Likert-scale
questions, we conducted multiple analyses as below:
Factor Analysis. To identify meaningful clusters of closely related
motivation items, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis to
analyze the Likert-scale ratings of the survey questions with respect
to motivation. Specifically, we first used the fa.parallel function
in the psych R library to select the optimal number of factors for
factor analysis. We then used principal axis factor analysis in the
psych R library [ 47] to group related motivators with a cut-off point
of|0.4|for factor loadings. As a result, we reduced a large set ofESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore Wan et al.
motivators into a small set ( factors ) while retaining the majority of
original information [64].
Comparison. To compare with OSS motivations (RQ2), we used
the survey data in a recent study on OSS motivations by Gerosa et
al. [22]. The study conducted a survey of 242 OSS contributors to
measure OSS motivations using 21 Likert-scale questions. The 21
Likert-scale questions capture ten categories of OSS motivations,
namely, Ideology ,Altruism ,Kinship ,Fun,Reputation ,Reciprocity ,
Learning ,Own-Use ,Career , and Pay, as proposed by Von Krogh et
al. [69]. In terms of the comparisons across subgroups of our survey
respondents, we classified our respondents into different subgroups
based on their characteristics.
We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for Likert-scale answers
to perform comparisons. All statistical tests assumed a p-value
<0.05as a significant level. Benjamini-Hochberg correction was
applied to adjust p-values in multiple comparisons. In addition,
we used Cliff’s delta to measure the magnitude of the differences
because Cliff’s delta is reported to be more robust and reliable than
Cohen’s delta [ 50]. The magnitudes are assessed with the thresholds
as specified in [ 50]: if|𝛿|<0.147, the effect size is negligible; if
0.147≤|𝛿|<0.33, the effect size is small; if 0.330≤|𝛿|<0.474,
the effect size is medium; and otherwise the effect size is large.
Correlation Analysis. We conducted correlational analyses to
explore the associations between Likert-scale ratings of motivation
and other variables in our survey results. Given ordinal variables
were involved, we used Spearman correlational analysis to evaluate
the associations.
3.2.5 Evaluation of Data Quality and Measurement Model. We eval-
uated the quality of collected survey data, followed by an evaluation
of the measurement model of motivations.
Sampling Adequacy. Before applying exploratory factor analy-
sis [10] on our survey data, we checked the suitability of the data for
factor analysis. Specifically, we calculated two statistical measures
for our constructs related to motivations, i.e., Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
measure of sampling adequacy (KMO) and Bartlett’s test of spheric-
ity [15]. The result of KMO (0.9) is well above the recommended
threshold 0.6 [ 15], which indicates that sampling is adequate and
factor analysis is appropriate for our survey data. The Bartlett’s
test of sphericity is highly significant at 𝑝<0.001, which indicates
that factor analysis could be worthwhile.
Internal Consistency Reliability. Internal consistency reliabil-
ity refers to the extent to which the items are consistent with one
another. We use Cronbach’s 𝛼[11] as a measure of internal con-
sistency. The Cronbach’s 𝛼values for our motivation items score
well above the recommended threshold 0.7 [ 24], with all 14 items
scoring between 0.92 and 0.94.
4 RESULTS
We explained the results of three research questions that investigate
the motivation of software practitioners to contribute to inner
source development.
4.1 Motivation to Contribute to Inner Source
Projects (RQ1)
We identified 14 motivators from our interviews as shown in Ta-
ble 3. In our interviews, the 20 interviewees mentioned an average

of 4.6 motivators (min: 2, max: 7, median: 4.5, std: 1.6). Job respon-
sibility (Q3) is the most frequent theme to emerge as a motivator
to contribute to inner source projects, discussed by 13 of the 20
interviewees. 12 out of the 20 interviewees mentioned learning
new things (Q9) as their motivators to participate in inner source
projects, which is the second most frequent theme for motivation
in our interviews.
In the questionnaire, we asked the respondents “I contribute to
the (primary) inner source project because ...” and presented the 14
motivators derived from our interviews. As shown in Figure 3, the
top three motivators are helping others (Q5), sharing (Q6), and belief
in effectiveness of inner source (Q4). Specifically, 94%, 96% and 90% of
our respondents agree (or strongly agree) with the three motivators,
respectively. It is worth noting that the top three motivators are re-
spondents’ internal motivations. Meanwhile, external motivations,
i.e.,job responsibility (Q3) and support from managers/leaders (Q2),
are reported less important than internal motivations.
We further used exploratory factor analysis to investigate un-
derlying structure of the 14 identified motivators. The exploratory
factor analysis suggests that 13 of the 14 motivators load on two
factors; one motivator (Q12) did not conform to any particular fac-
tor. The factor loadings for each motivator are presented in the
last two columns of Table 3; loadings less than 0.40 are not shown
in the table for ease of presentation. Factor loadings indicate how
strongly each item correlates with its underlying factor. We labeled
the two factors as internal motivation (Factor 1) that reflects the
belief and desire of a software practitioner, e.g., helping others (Q5)
andsharing (Q6), and external motivation (Factor 2) that comes from
outside an individual, e.g., support from managers/leaders (Q2) and
job responsibility (Q3).
Difference in Motivation across Roles in Inner Source Projects.
Our survey respondents take a broad variety of project-centric
roles [ 66] in inner source projects. Specifically, 121 out of 124 re-
spondents reported that they take an average of 1.3 project-centric
roles in their primary inner source projects (min: 1, max: 3, me-
dian: 1, std: 0.6). 106, 31 and 26 respondents participate in inner
source projects as Coder ,System Administrator andProject Man-
ager, respectively. Note that 34 respondents (27.4%) take 2 and more
project-centric roles in inner source projects. We further exploredWhat Motivates Software Practitioners to Contribute to Inner Source? ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore

the differences in distributions of Likert responses for motivations
between coders and non-coders of inner source projects. Although
non-coders reported slightly higher ratings across the 14 motiva-
tors than coders did (1.07x), no statistically significant differences
exist between these two subgroups.
Meanwhile, our survey respondents participate in inner source
projects with a broad variety of community-centric roles [ 66]. 103
out of 124 respondents reported that they take an average of 2.5
community-centric roles in their primary inner source projects
(min: 1, max: 6, median: 2, std: 1.4). Particularly, 63, 53, 49, 45, 38
and 4 respondents participate in inner source projects as Mentor ,
Advocate ,Writer ,Founder ,Strategist , and Treasurer , respectively.
70 respondents take 2 and more community-centric roles in inner
source projects. The top 2 community-centric roles 18 non-coder
respondents take are Strategist (9) and Mentor (8). We further ex-
plored the differences in distributions of Likert responses for moti-
vations between respondents with and without community-centric
roles. Although respondents with community-centric roles reported
higher ratings (1.10x) than those without community-centric roles,

no statistically significant differences exist between these two sub-
groups.
Difference in Motivation across Types of Inner Source Projects .
Our respondents contribute to diverse types of inner source projects,
in terms of objectives and governance models as shown in Figure 4.
The majority of our respondents (54%) have contributed to utility-
oriented projects. In the meantime, most of our respondents (61%)
reported that their primary inner source projects are governed byESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore Wan et al.
a single organizational unit. Note that 3 respondents selected Other
and explained that their projects are governed by individuals.
We further examined if statistically significant differences exist
in motivations across contributors of various types of inner source
projects. The results indicate that statistically significant difference
exists in the sharing motivator (Q6) between contributors of utility-
oriented projects and those of service-oriented projects ( 𝑝=0.03),
with a small effect size ( 𝛿=0.33).
4.2 Comparison of Motivation: Inner Source vs.
Open Source (RQ2)
In RQ2, we compared what motivates practitioners to contribute to
inner source projects with what drives them to participate in open
source projects. Previous studies have extensively investigated the
motivation of practitioners to contribute to open source projects.
Thus, we use the survey data from a most recent study, Gerosa
et al.’s work [ 22], for the comparison. Gerosa et al. conducted a
survey of 242 OSS contributors to measure OSS motivations using
21 Likert-scale motivation items.
We started by qualitatively studying the relationship between
our motivation items identified in RQ1 (as shown in Table 3) and
those in Gerosa et al.’s work. For each motivation item, we coded the
corresponding survey question by removing words related to inner
source. With the codes of survey questions, we identified the related
OSS motivators as described in Gerosa et al.’s work. Finally, we
identified 9 common motivators of software practitioners as listed
in the first two columns in Table 4. The 9 common motivators were
distributed across 7 out of 10 OSS motivation categories proposed
by Von Krogh et al. [ 69]. The uncovered three categories include
Ideology ,Reciprocity andLearning . Note that we identified learning
new things (Q9) as a motivator to contribute inner source projects.
Given that we did not find a match for Q9 in Gerosa et al.’s work,
we did not conduct further comparison for the learning motivation.
We then investigated the differences in Likert ratings for the 9
common motivators as shown in Table 4. The two Likert Distribution
subcolumns present the distributions of ratings for motivators to
inner source and open source development. For the Likert distribu-
tions, the leftmost bar indicates strong disagreement, the middle bar
indicates neutrality, and the rightmost bar indicates strong agree-
ment. For example, most software practitioners strongly agreed
that they contribute to inner source projects because of their job
responsibility (Q3), but strongly disagreed that they are “paid to
contribute” to open source projects.
TheP-value column indicates whether the difference in the agree-
ment for each motivator is statistically significant. The table is
sorted by the p-values with Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Statis-
tical significant differences at a 95% confidence level are highlighted
in green (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-values <0.05).
TheEffect Size column indicates the magnitude of difference in
the agreement for each motivation. We used Cliff’s delta to measure
effect sizes. Effect sizes are additionally colored on a gradient from
blue to orange based on the magnitudes of difference as referring
to the interpretation of Cliff’s delta: blue color means the former
group is more likely to agree with the statement, and orange color
means the latter group is more likely to agree with the statement.Based on the observed statistically significant differences in mo-
tivations, we can say with some certainty that:
•Software Improvement and Job Responsibility : Software
practitioners tend to have significantly higher levels of soft-
ware improvement (Q10) and job responsibility (Q3) motiva-
tions to contribute to inner source projects than to open
source projects, with large effect sizes ( 𝛿=0.613and𝛿=
0.574).
•Fun: Software practitioners tend to have a slightly lower
level of motivation for fun(Q8) to dedicate time to inner
source projects than to open source projects, with a small
effect size ( 𝛿=−0.218).
•Unavailability of Software and Sense of Belonging : Soft-
ware practitioners tend to have slightly higher levels of un-
availability of software (Q12) and sense of belonging (Q7)
motivations to contribute to inner source projects than to
open source projects, with small effect sizes ( 𝛿=0.214and
𝛿=0.205).
4.3 Effect of Motivation on Contribution Level
and Continuance Intention (RQ3)
RQ3 explores whether motivation is predictive for the contribu-
tion level and continuance intention of software practitioners in
inner source development. Specifically, we conducted correlation
analyses to estimate the impact of the motivators identified in RQ1
on contribution level and continuance intention of software prac-
titioners. We measured the contribution level as hours per week
software practitioners spent on their primary inner source projects;
and the continuance intention as the agreement level to a statement
in our survey describing their intention to contribute to future inner
source development.
Contribution Level. As shown in Figure 5(a), the distribution of
hours spent on their primary inner source projects is skewed, as our
respondents reported. 59 out of 124 respondents (47.6%) spend less
than 5 hours per week on their primary inner source projects. On
the contrary, 16.9% of our respondents spend more than 20 hours per
week. We further investigated the relationship between financial
rewards and contribution levels of practitioners in inner source
projects. 12.1% of our respondents reported that they have received
extra pay beyond their salaries to work on inner source projects.
Software practitioners with extra pay tend to dedicate more time
per week to inner source projects than those without extra pay.
However, the difference is not statically significant according to
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
Continuance Intention. Most of our respondents (83.9%) strongly
agree or agree that they are willing to involve in future inner source
development as shown in Figure 5(b). We noticed that 20 out of 124
respondents (16.1%) were neutral or disagreed when asked if they
plan to make future contributions to inner source projects. The
20 respondents with no/low continuance intention contribute to
various types of inner source projects as shown in Figure 6. Among
the 20 respondents with no/low continuance intention, 5 participate
inexploration-oriented projects governed by a single organizational
unit. We notice that two contributors out of five in service-oriented
projects governed by multiple organizational units show no/low
continuance intention.What Motivates Software Practitioners to Contribute to Inner Source? ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore

with no (low) continuance intention participate.
We further assessed the relationship between financial rewards
and the intention of software practitioners to contribute to future
inner source development. Although the practitioners with extra
pay show stronger intention to continue making contributions to
inner source projects in the future than those without extra pay, the
difference is not statistically significant according to the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test.

as weak, 0.40-0.69 as moderate, 0.70-0.89 as strong, and 0.90-1.00 as
very strong correlation.
We observed that statistically significant correlations exist be-
tween motivation and contribution level, as well as between moti-
vation and continuance intention:
•Effect on Contribution Level. The levels of the job respon-
sibility motivation (Q3) are positively correlated with the
weekly contribution of software practitioners to the inner
source projects. However, somewhat unexpectedly, the levels
of other measured motivators are not significantly correlated
with the levels of practitioners’ weekly contribution.
•Effect on Continuance Intention. The levels of all 14 mea-
sured motivators are positively correlated with the intention
of software practitioners to contribute to future inner source
development. The belief in effectiveness of inner source moti-
vation (Q4) shows the greatest correlation ( 𝜌=0.61) with
continuance intention among the 14 motivators. In addi-
tion to the motivator Q4, the levels of other 10 motivatorsESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore Wan et al.
(e.g., career development ) are moderately correlated with
continuance intention. A statistically significant but weak
correlation exists between three motivators (e.g., Reputation )
and continuance intention. Note that the job responsibility
has the smallest correlation ( 𝜌=0.31) with continuance
intention among the 14 motivators.
5 DISCUSSION
We reflect our findings from the research questions, delving into
factors that can help in attracting and retaining software practition-
ers for inner source development. We also highlight the avenues of
future research.
Internal Motivation. Software practitioners are motivated by
their belief in effectiveness of inner source to contribute to inner
source projects (RQ1). Specifically, 90% of the survey respondents
strongly agree or agree that they contribute to inner source projects
because “adoption of inner source can benefit my company / or-
ganization” (Q4). On the other hand, this motivator is positively
correlated with the continuance intention of software practitioners
in inner source projects, with the greatest correlation coefficient
across the motivators (RQ3). The results implies that the cultural
shift for adopting inner source development may directly impact
the success and sustainability of inner source projects. In order to
achieve “effectiveness” and “buy-in” of practitioners, it is essen-
tial to demonstrate the benefits of inner source first. A previous
study [ 6] claimed that organizations usually lack measurement ca-
pabilities for evaluating inner source initiatives to communicate
the benefits. Future studies could put more effort into providing
metrics to evaluate the improvements due to the adoption of inner
source.
Compared to open source development, software practitioners
tend to have a significantly higher level of software improvement
motivation to contribute to inner source development (RQ2). The
improvement of software requires a community of users and devel-
opers within an organization so that the software project can benefit
from organization-wide input and continuously evolve. However,
the organizational units within an organization may aim for differ-
ent goals and have different priorities. Thus, the organization could
perform a certain level of coordination to guide the improvement
of inner source software.
External Motivation. Thejob responsibility motivation was bot-
tom ranked in our survey results (RQ2). Specifically, 70% of our
survey respondents strongly agree or agree that they contribute to
inner source projects because “contributing to inner source is my
job responsibility” (Q3). The low rank of external motivations are
observed in previous OSS studies (e.g., [ 22] and [ 28]). At the same
time, the job responsibility motivation was the only variable among
the identified motivators positively correlated with the contribution
level of software practitioners, but with the weakest correlation
with the continuance intention of practitioners (RQ3). Job responsi-
bility could enable software practitioners to dedicate time to inner
source development, but has a weak impact on their continuance
intention. Organizations may provide more flexibility to their em-
ployees, e.g., flexibility for task selection [ 65], to retain contributors
and enable inner source communities to flourish.As another external motivation, support from managers/leaders
shows a moderate positive correlation with the continuance inten-
tion of practitioners (RQ3). The support from managers or leaders
is more likely to lead to software practitioners’ sustainable contri-
bution in inner source development.
Financial Incentives. We expected extra pay beyond the salary to
affect the contribution level and continuance intention of software
practitioners, but no statistically significant difference is introduced
by extra pay (RQ3). This may be because we only have a limited
number of respondents (15 out of 124) who contribute to inner
source projects with extra pay. Future studies could explore the
effect of financial incentives on contribution level and continuance
intention in inner source development.
Variety in Roles. 85.5% of our respondents (106 out of 124) take
Coder as their project-centric roles (RQ1). Only 14.5% of the re-
spondents joined their primary inner source projects by taking
non-coder roles. The percentage of non-coder contributors in inner
source projects is lower than the percentage (18.9%) in OSS projects
as reported in Gerosa et al.’s work [ 22]. We observed that most
of the non-coder contributors take core community-centric roles,
e.g.,Strategist andMentor . Future work could investigate whether
various roles in inner source development play different from those
in open source development.
The prevalent existence of community-centric roles in inner
source development (RQ1) is in line with the findings from OSS
studies [ 66]. Thus, organizations may define an entry path in terms
of community-centric roles for newcomers.
6 THREATS TO VALIDITY
Internal Validity. The interviewees were selected by a contact at
each tech company. The procedure partially alleviates the threat of
selection bias beacause the interviewer has no contact with inter-
viewees before the interviews. The threat of selection bias would
always be present when the interviewees were not fully randomly
sampled. However, given that our interviews include practitioners
with various job roles and from different companies, the threat has
limited effect. Some of our respondents may have a poor under-
standing of the questions. To reduce the impact of this issue, we
included an “I don’t understand” option in the survey and ignored
responses marked as such. We also dropped responses that were
submitted by people whose job roles are none of these: software
development, testing, and project management. Two of the authors
translated our survey to Chinese to ensure that respondents from
China could understand our survey well. To reduce the bias of pre-
senting the survey bilingually, we carefully translated our survey
to ensure there is no ambiguity between English and Chinese terms.
We polished the translation by improving clarity and understand-
ability according to the feedback from our pilot survey.
Construct Validity. In our interviews, the evaluation apprehen-
sion was ameliorated by the anonymity of the interviewees, as
well as the guarantee that all the information obtained during the
interviews would be used only by the researchers. The interviewer
might have influenced the interviewees by asking specific ques-
tions. To mitigate this risk, we used open-ended questions to elicit
as much information as possible. The interviewees may have a dif-
ferent understanding of the questions than what we had intended.What Motivates Software Practitioners to Contribute to Inner Source? ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore
To minimize this aspect, we encouraged the interviewees to ask
questions at all times. Our survey results are based on respondents’
self-reported responses, which may be subject to bias and not ex-
actly represent reality. We followed recommendations to reduce
social-desirability bias by ensuring respondents’ anonymity [43].
Our study made a direct comparison of the responses to matched
survey questions regarding motivators between two surveys, ours
and Gerosa et al.’s [ 22] from their replication package9. To match
survey questions between the two surveys, two authors removed
context related words, e.g., inner source and open source, and coded
the survey questions. They discussed the codes and agreed on the
matched questions between the two surveys. The matched survey
questions between the two surveys tend to capture a common mo-
tivation. Nonetheless, the differences in the wording of matched
survey questions may influence the responses respondents would
give in unintended ways, and further introduce bias to the com-
parison of survey data. To minimize the unintended effects from
wording, we followed a guideline for defining survey items pro-
vided by the BRUSO model [ 46], making sure that the survey items
are brief, relevant, unambiguous, specific and objective. We also
conducted a pilot survey to collect feedback and further improve
the clarity and understandability of survey items.
Conclusion Validity. The interviews were conducted at differ-
ent locations and each interview was done in one session. Thus,
answers were not influenced by internal discussions. To ensure
that the interview instrument is of high quality to obtain reliable
measures, we conducted several pilots to improve the questions and
layout of the interview guide prior to conducting the interviews.
We did our best to randomly select survey respondents from both
tech companies and open-source projects. Our survey respondents
come from 13 countries across 4 continents who are working in
various job roles with a wide range of experience.
External Validity. To improve the generalizability of our findings,
we interviewed 20 interviewees from various companies. We further
surveyed 124 respondents from 13 countries across four continents
who are working for various companies or contributing to open-
source projects that are hosted on GitHub, in various job roles.
7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This work followed a mixed-methods approach to explore software
practitioners’ motivation to contribute to inner source projects. We
identified 14 motivators that drive practitioners to participate in
inner source development, as well as several statistically significant
differences between the identified motivators and OSS motivators
that motivate practitioners to participate in open source projects.
Besides, we observed several statistically significant correlations be-
tween the identified motivators and software practitioners’ contri-
bution level and continuance intention in inner source development.
Future work could put efforts into investigating other factors that
impact practitioners’ contribution and continuance intention in in-
ner source projects, and leveraging the factors to design strategies
to sustain and grow inner source development.
