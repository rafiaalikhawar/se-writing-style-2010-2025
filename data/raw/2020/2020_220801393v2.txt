ABSTRACT
Reliance on third-party libraries is now commonplace in con tem-
porary software engineering. Being open source in nature, t hese
libraries should advocate for a world where the freedoms and op-
portunitiesofopensourcesoftwarecanbeenjoyedbyall.Ye t,there
is a growing concern related to maintainers using their inﬂu ence
tomakepoliticalstances(i.e.,referredtoasprotestware ).Inthispa-
per,we reﬂect on theimpact of world politicsonsoftwareeco sys-

showthreecaseswhereworldpoliticshashadanimpactonaso ft-
ware ecosystem, and how these incidents may result in either be-
nign or malignant consequences. We further point to speciﬁc op-

1 INTRODUCTION
Contemporary software is not built in isolation. With the em er-
gence of third-party libraries, and massive software repos itories,
now more than ever developers are able to quickly adopt func-

Evidence of the impact of libraries is seen with the growing s ize
of NPM with more than one million packages [22], for example,
andthegrowing supportfortheseecosystems,e.g., GitHub’ s2020
acquisitionof NPM.1
Problemsarisewhenamaintainerfeelsempoweredtosabotag e
their own projects, thus weaponizing their library as prote stware,
e.g., with the intention to make users of their library aware of
some political stance, or situation. Responses from practi tioners
to such protestware have been mixed. According to a develope r
blogthatwaslaterrepublishedbytheIEEEComputerSociety [11],
practitioners have expressed their concerns, stating that “It’s ill-
considered and user-hostile, and can trivially go wrong. We aponiz-
ing open source to inject malware, no matter how well intenti oned,
is still injecting malware”. Others question whether this is Open
Source anymore, as a OSS licence clearly states that there sh ould
be “No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups. The license mu st
notdiscriminateagainstanypersonorgroupofpersons ”[17].Theof-
ﬁcial statement from the Open Source Initiative (OSI) commu nity
laystheresponsibilitytomaintainers,statingthat“ Protestisanim-
portantelementoffreespeechthatshouldbeprotected.Ope nnessand

2 MOTIVATING CASES
In this section, we discuss three cases where protestware ha s had
an impact on a software ecosystem. Speciﬁcally, we focus on t he
WarinUkraine,andthreediﬀerenteﬀectsthatresultedfrom main-
tainersmakingapoliticalstance.Theﬁrstcaseinvolves th emalig-
nanteﬀectsofprotestware.Thesecondcaseisabenigncasew here
protestwarehadnomaliciousintenttoharmtheusersofalib rary.
In the last case, we take a look at a case where sanctions were
placedonaccounts thatwere relatedtoworldpolitics.
2.1 Case1: MalignantProtestware
A developer of the JavaScript library node-ipc [6], which is used
by the popular vue.js framework, deliberately introduced a criti-
cal security vulnerability that, for some netizens, would d estroy
theircomputers’ﬁles.Thelibraryisfetchedaboutamillio ntimesa
week fromtheNPMregistry,and isdescribedasan“inter-pro cess
communication module for Node, supporting Unix sockets, TC P,
TLS, and UDP”. Seemingly, the maintainer intentionally cha nged
hiscodetooverwritethehostsystem’sdata,thenchangedth ecode
to display a message calling for world peace, as a protest aga inst
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. GitHub declared this a critic al vul-
nerability, which was trackedas CVE-2022-23812[1].
The malicious code was intended to overwrite arbitrary ﬁles
dependent upon the geo-location of the user’s IP address, at tack-
ingsoftwareinspeciﬁclocations.Concretely,theaﬀected versions
10.1.1and10.1.2ofthelibrarycheckwhetherthehostmachi nehas
anIPaddressinRussiaorBelarus,andifsooverwritesevery ﬁleit
could with a heart symbol. Version 10.1.3 was released soon a fter
withoutthisdestructivefunctionality,while10.1.1and1 0.1.2were
removed from theNPM registry.
There was a strong response from the community, including
frustrations that led to insightful discussions. One examp le from
a contributor on the GitHub Discussions channel is shown be-
low [2]:
I’mveryhappytoseethattheprinciplesandcharacter
ofmanyintech(FOSSespecially)remainclearenough
torecognizehowcompletelywrongthiswas.Ofcourse,
if the marketplace of current thingskeeps hammering
away at this, it will beneﬁt a small number of corpo-
rate giants(misplacedtrust/safety). I hopewe all start
seeingthesepatternsaswegrapplewithageneralblur-
ringoflinesbetweentoolsformarketingandweaponry.It’sessentialtoask: what’stheoutcomeandwhobene-
ﬁts? I liketoask the faux ideologues“who agreeswith
you?”“Isn’titstrangehowwell alignedyouare witha
smallnumberofveryvisible,inﬂuential,andpowerful
organizations?”“What’stheﬁghtandwhoisonwhich
side, again?” It’s about competency, not power. Power
feedsand is fueled by egocentrism(plainly,weak van-
ity).Competencycomesfromdiscoveringyournatural
giftsandapplyingthem.
Another user from that Github Discussion quoted how this af-
fectedtheOpenSourceCommunity[2]:
The trust factor of open source, which was based on
goodwillofthedevelopersisnowpracticallygone,and
now, more and more people are realizing that one
day,theirlibrary/applicationcanpossiblybeexploited
to do/say whatever some random dev on the internet
thoughtwas ‘therightthingtodo’.
The maintainer defended his module on GitHub, saying “this i s
all public, documented, licensed and open source”. Earlier , there
weremorethan20issuesﬂaggedagainstnode-ipcaboutitsbe hav-
ior.Someofthecommentsreferredtothecreationas “protestware,
whileothersmightcall itmalware” .
2.2 Case2: Benign Protestware
We present two cases where the protestware does not have mali -
cious intent, but aims at increasing awareness. For the ﬁrst case,
the same maintainer of the node-ipc library then created the pea-
cenotwar library [8]. As explained by the maintainer, it ser ves as
a non-violent protest against Russia’s aggression. Instea d of mali-
ciousdeletionofﬁles,themoduleaddsamessageofpeaceonu sers’
desktops[9].Themaintainer was quotedin theREADMEﬁle2:
I pledgethat thismodule,to the best of myknowledge
and skills, does not do any damage to anyone’s data.
If you do not like what this module does, please just
lock your dependencies to any of my work or other’s
whichincludesthismodule,toaversionyouhavecode
reviewed and deemed acceptable for your needs. Also,
please code-review your other modulesfor vulnerabili-
ties.
Whenaccepted,this codewas included:
1variable "putin_khuylo " {
description = "Do you agree that Putin doesn 't
respect Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial
integrity ? More info : https :// en . wikipedia . org / wiki/
Putin_khuylo ! "
3type = bool
default = true }
Another example is given by a maintainer of the terraform mod -
ulesforAWSwhoaddedtheirownprotestinthelicenceﬁle,wi th
“Additionalterms ofuseforusers from Russia and Belarus”[ 10]:
Byusingthecodeprovidedinthisrepositoryyouagree
withthe following:
- Russia has illegally annexed Crimea in 2014 and
2https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/peacenotwarIn Warand Peace:
The Impactof World Politicson So/f_twareEcosystems ESEC/FSE 2022,14 - 18November,2022, Singapore
brought the war in Donbas followed by full-scale in-
vasion of Ukrainein2022.
- Russia has brought sorrow and devastations to mil-
lions of Ukrainians, killed hundreds of innocent peo-
ple, damaged thousands of buildings, and forced sev-
eralmillionpeopletoﬂee.
These two libraries are examples of protestware that are not
intended to be malignant, compared to the case described in t he
previous section.
2.3 Case3: Developer Sanctions
The third case is not related to a single library maintainer, but af-
fectsasoftwareecosystemmorebroadly.Wereporttwoinsta nces.
The ﬁrst is the decision of MongoDB not to sell its products to
Russian buyers [33],using thefollowingstatement:
ThebreadthofthenewsanctionsfromtheUSandinter-
nationally is unprecedented,and MongoDB has taken
action tocomplywith them.We will not sell our cloud
servicestocustomersinRussiaandBelarusandwewill
not sell any more MongoDB software to customers in
Russia or Belarus.
MongoDB’s decision appears to hinge on an interpretation of
Western sanctions that say SaaS subscriptions represent a s ale. In
order to comply with sanctions, MongoDB decided it should no t
continuetooﬀeritswares,noteven asaservice.Interestin gly, Or-
acle also stated on Twitter3that it is ending support for Russian
users, Even Microsoft joined Apple and SAP in suspending sal es
in Russia.4
In another instance of developer sanctions, at ﬁrst GitHub s us-
pended Russian accounts. According to a blog post from a deve l-
oper [5], “suspending an account” on GitHub meant deleting a ll
activityforauser—whichresultsin(1)everypullrequestf romthe
suspended account being deleted, (2) every issue opened by t he
suspended account being deleted, and (3) every comment or di s-
cussion from the suspended account being deleted. In eﬀect, the
user’sentireactivityandhistoryevaporated.Thebiggeri ssuewas
thatGitHubhadnotprovidedanywarningtothelibrarymaint ain-
ers. As explained bya maintainer ina blogpost[5]:
I recently took over as a lead maintainer for two pop-
ularprojectsintheAppledevelopercommunity,Quick
and Nimble. I just released version 5.0 of Quick a few
days ago. During the week leading up to the release,
I was reviewing and merging many pull requests. But
when it came time to write the release notes, I noticed
verybizarrebehavior.Mysteriously,somepullrequests
weredeleted.Poof.Gone.ThenIrealizedthatanentire
contributor’s presence had disappeared — all of their
commentsonissuesweremissing,alloftheissuesthey
opened were gone, all of the pull requests they opened
hadvanished.Everypieceofactivityrelatedtotheuser
wasgone.
GitHublater reached outtothis maintainer, lettingthem kn ow
that it had restored the missing pull requests, issues, comm ents,

pended.User proﬁleswerealsorestored,althoughGitHubdi dnot
speciﬁcallymentionthat theaccountshad beensuspended[4 ].
3 OTHER MAINTAINER STANCES
TheWarinUkraineisnottheﬁrsttimethatopen-sourcemaint ain-
ers have used their opensource libraries as a platformfor pr otest.
For example, Faker.js5and Colors.js6created problems for users
of Amazon’s Cloud Development Kit. Big companies, critics h ave

HisstancewasmadeclearintheREADMEﬁle:“Takethisasanop -
portunitytosendmeasix-ﬁgureyearlycontractorforkthep roject
and have someoneelsework onit”[3].
These cases show that protestware is not only relevant in the
context of political conﬂicts, but has a long history of capt uring
and communicatingtheopinions ofopensourcemaintainers.

AsdiscussedinSection3,thereisanecdotalevidencefromb logs
and developer discussions on the topic, yet there have been v ery
few research studies that articulate the impact of protestw are on
software engineering. From these motivating cases, the fol lowing
questions about the possible implications have emerged. We dis-
cusseachofthesepotentialimplicationsbelowinturn,and suggest
tenresearch questionsthatcouldformthebasisoffuturere search
projects.
4.1 Dissectingthestatusquo of protestware
Evidence from this paper shows the thin line that exists betw een
protestware and malware. As mentioned by the OSI community,

inclusivitybeingcornerstonesofthecultureofopensourc e.How-
ever,vandalizing opensourceprojectsthreatens anypossi bleben-
eﬁt, and might damage the projects and contributors respons ible.
Our ﬁrst four research questions target the potential of pro test-
ware.
(1) How eﬀective is protestware at communicating political
messages?

(2) Whatistheimmediateimpactofprotestwareonasoftware

(3) Who is aﬀected by protestware, and what relationship do
they have withtheprotestwaremaintainer, if any?
(4) What mitigation strategies do projects use for securing or
repairing their supply chains, and how eﬀective are those
mitigationstrategies?
Throughin-depthstudiesofcasessuchastheonesintroduce din
Section 2, we proposeresearch questions aimed at understan ding
the statusquoof protestware,to buildthefoundations for f urther
workonincreasingresilienceandtrustinsoftwareecosyst ems.We
proposetosurveydevelopersthatrelyonthemodiﬁedprojec tsto

traditional software engineering research, but we can inve stigate
whether the message is received as intended, and what its imm e-
diate consequences are. Who is aﬀected? A small number of de-
velopers who have a working relationship with the acting mai n-

gate which strategies other players in a software ecosystem have
employed to work around protestware and/or mitigate its imp act,

future.
4.2 Increasing supplychain resilience
Inresponsetotheattacksonsupplychains,theLinuxFounda tion’s
partner group – Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF),
Google,andMicrosoftjoined forces toworkwithsecurityex perts
and use automated security testing to improve open-source s ecu-
rityinaprojectcalledtheAlpha-OmegaProject[7].Thisis aglobal
eﬀort to secure code, and has sparked other eﬀorts such as wea k
links analysis [32]. Hence, our next three research questio ns are
related tothesupplychain.
(5) Howeﬀective areredundancies insupplychains atincrea s-
ing resilience?
(6) Howdochangeswhichturnlibrariesintoprotestwarediﬀ er
fromother softwareevolution?
(7) Howaccuratelycanweautomaticallydetectprotestware ?
Eﬀorts to increase supply chain resilience could form a spec -
trum from manual eﬀorts to minimise the impact of protestwar e
by reducing the reliance on external libraries [30] or intro duc-
ing redundancies into supply chains [14] to automated tools for
protestware detection and mitigation, similar to vulnerab ility de-
tection [21]. To pave the way for automated detection and mit i-
gation, we propose research questions related to unique cha rac-
teristics of patches which turn a library into protestware ( e.g.,
are such patches ‘surprising’ to a language model trained on past
patches?[12])aswellasautomatedprediction,borrowingm ethods
from thedefect predictionliterature[29].4.3 Managing trustandresponsibility
Prior work has established that the success of a library is ba sed
on the library itself, which involves the assumption of a mod -
ule’s functional and non-functional correctness. For inst ance, sys-
tem maintainers need to trust the reliability of non-functi onal at-
tributes such as security and stability of an adopted librar y [18].
Thistrustincomponentsiswell-knowninotherﬁelds,sucha sDe-
pendable and Secure Computing [15, 16, 31]. However, we argu e
thattrustalsofallsbackonthemaintainer.Theﬁnalthreer esearch
questionsareaimedat maintainers andtheir roleinanecosy stem
as awhole.
(8) What are the responsibilities of maintainers, as percei ved
byotherstakeholders in a softwareecosystem?
(9) How does protestware aﬀect trust into a library and entir e
ecosystems?
(10) Howis protestwareregulatedat ecosystem level?
Recentanecdotes,suchasaFortune-500companyunabashedl y
requestingacurlmaintainer’simmediateresponseaboutth eLog4J
vulnerability [27], highlight the current confusion about what ex-
actlyaretheresponsibilitiesofagreatopen-sourcemaint ainer[13].
Therecentemergenceofprotestwareonlyaddstothisconfus ion—
do maintainers act irresponsibly if they use open source for po-
litical action? We propose to capture the perceptions of diﬀ er-
ent players in a software ecosystem about these responsibil ities
and how protestware can aﬀect trust in single libraries or en tire
ecosystems. It is important that software ecosystems are re silient
tothreatsagainsttheirculture,thusbecomingsustainabl e[20].As
mentioned in Section 1, open source licences contain statem ents
about discrimination [17], but they are not explicit about p rotest-
ware.Wealsoproposetoinvestigate howcodesofconduct[28 ]at
projectand ecosystem level canplay a rolein regulating the man-
agement ofprotestware.
5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Protestsareapowerfulwayforpeopletomaketheirvoices he ard.
They can be used to call attention to injustices, and to deman d
change. In the world of open source software, protests take t he
form of “protestware”. This is software that is released in p rotest
