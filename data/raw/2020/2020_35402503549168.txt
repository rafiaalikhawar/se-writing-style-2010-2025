athink-aloud , or providing a vocal explanation of their problem-
solving approach to potential employers [ 35]. Think-aloud has a
major impact on software engineering hiring decisions. According
to tech consultant Scott Hanselman, interviewers often look for
łthoughtfulness, analysis, patience, calm, and humilityž in think-
aloud [25]. In addition, Refael Zikavashvili, co-founder and CEO of
Pramp1ÐanonlineplatformforpracticingtechnicalinterviewsÐ
describes the significance of think-aloud stating, łmore important
than the solution is how [candidates] work at getting the solu-
tion.ž Further, interview guides from companies like Google and

Unfortunately,supervisedthink-aloudoftenhasadverseandneg-

2 METHODOLOGY
A technical interview is a hiring assessment that involves job-
seeking candidates completing think-alouds and expressing techni-
cal skillsin front of potential employers. To understand the impactof supervised think-aloud on technical interview performance, we
comparetraditionaltechnicalinterviewenvironments(ourcontrol)
with asynchronous technical interviews (our treatment). In this
section, we describe our research questions, experimental settings,
andthedatacollectedandanalyzedtomeasurethedifferencesof
participants’ communicationandcoding abilitiesineachsetting.
2.1 Research QuestionsandHypotheses
Tounderstandtheimpactofasynchronicityintechnicalinterviews,
we investigatedthe following research questions:
RQ1: What are the effects of asynchronous technical in-
terviewson think-aloud performance?
To observe candidates’ thought process during hiring evalua-
tions, interviewers ask them to think aloud while solving program-
ming problems. Think-aloud, as a communication skill, is essential
for evaluating candidates in technical interviews [ 13]. To inves-
tigate whether asynchronicity impacts the quality of candidates’
communication ability, we compared think-aloud informativeness
and stress indicators in asynchronous technical interviews against
traditional whiteboard interview settings with synchronous in-
terviewersupervision.Wespeculatethatasynchronoustechnical
interviews are less stressful due to their ability to increase privacy
forcandidatesandeliminatedirectsupervision[ 10].Thus,wehy-

2.4.2 Traditional Whiteboard Interviews. To investigate how su-
pervised think-aloud impacts communication ability, we compared
students’ submitted screencast recordings to data collected from
Behroozi et al.’s [ 10]public whiteboard setting . The whiteboard
setting resembled a traditional technical interview, where student
participants stood at a whiteboard to complete a programming
challenge (Q5) without knowledge of the problem beforehand, and
performed a supervised think-aloud in front of an observing re-
searcher (see Figure 1-b). Participants were similarly given sample
test cases, prohibited from using external resources, and permitted
to use any coding language. They had to complete the task within
a 30 minute time limit, and were encouraged to verbalize their
thoughtprocesses as if participatinginareal jobinterview.
Allparticipantswhocompletedthetechnicalinterviewtaskin
the public whiteboard setting within the given time limit were
included in this research experiment ( 𝑛=24). In each session,

3.1 MeasuringThink-Aloud
To answer RQ1, we analyzed think-aloud by examining commu-
nication quality while also observing speech patterns to identify
possible sourcesofstressorcognitive load.3.1.1 Quality. Toevaluatethink-aloudquality,weanalyzedspeech
pattern informativeness and evaluated thoughts vocalized in the
asynchronous andsynchronous technical interviewsettings.
Informativeness. Think-aloudprovidesinsightintocandidates’
thoughtprocessesthroughcommunicationbetweeninterviewees
and interviewers. Yet, not all vocalized thoughts associated with
problem-solving are worthy of communication, and verbalizing all
thoughts is not the same as communicating the thought process.
Furthermore,complexthoughtprocessescauseindividualstouse
more filler words, or non-informative vocalizations, to seem less
stressedduringuncertain pausing moments [ 1,32].
To measure the informative parts of speech vocalized by par-
ticipantsineachsetting,weextractednon-fillerwordsusingthe
VoiceActivity Detector(VAD)modulefromGoogle’s open-source
WebRTC3codetoconvertspeechtotext.VADutilizesaGaussian
Mixture Model (GMM) to detect human voice in the presence of
background noiseśsuch as keyboard typing or marker noise while
writing on a whiteboard. As the recordings contained relatively
long periods of silence, we also removed silent moments by con-
vertingaudiorecordingsinbothsettingsintoa16bitPulse-code
modulation (PCM). We then sent 30-millisecond long frames using
aslidingwindowtechniquetoVADtofilterouttheframesthatdid
not contain human voice. Finally, we used the Google Web Speech
API4to convertspeechto textoneachchunkinrecordings.5

To rate the thought vocalization of participants, two authors
acted as evaluators to retroactively analyzeaudio recordingsfrom
both settings. A 5-point Likert scale ranking was implemented
to assess the effectiveness of participants’ think-aloud during their
interviewÐintheanalysis,ratingsof4orhigherwereconsideredef-
fective,3orlowerwereconsideredineffective.Thisscoringreflects
thetypical binary feedbackcandidatesoftenget whilecompleting

think-aloud, we used criteria based on communication expecta-
tions during technical interviews from industry employers [ 21],
including engagement ,ortheconfidenceandarticulatenessinwhich
participantsexpresstheirtechnicalknowledge(i.e.howeasyitwas
tofollow),and smoothness ,ortheclarityandconsistencyoftheir
think-aloud while solving the problem (i.e., avoiding long periods
of silence). Then, the two coders came together to discuss their
individual rankings and come to an agreement on the quality of
participants’ think-aloud.
3.1.2 Stress. Speechcanbeaffectedby stress,apsychologicalstate
in response to task demand or fear [ 26]. To understand the impact
ofthetechnicalinterviewsettingsonspeech,weanalyzedspeech
patterns, such as speechrateandthe presenceofstresscues.
Speech Rate. According to the National Center of Voice and
Speech (NCVS),7theaverageconversation ratefor English speak-
ers in the United States is approximately 150 words per minute.
However,stressfulconditionshavebeenshowntoimpacthuman
speech rate. For instance, stress can increase speech rate and word
productivity inhumans[ 14]. Onthe otherhand,humansmay slow
their talking speed by adding pauses [ 23] or increasing usage of
filler words [ 32] during stress-inducing activities, such as public
speaking [ 53]. Research suggests secondary tasks, such as a techni-
cal interviewproblem-solvingtasks,require attentionalresources
that impact the spatiotemporality of vocal systems and can reduce
speechrateandfluency[ 3,14,17ś19,49].

To measure stress cues in speech, we collected one-minute sam-
plesfromthebeginning,middle,andtheendofeachvoicerecording.
To avoid biased evaluations, the raters were blinded from the inter-

the extent of stress in participants’ voice using a 5-point Likert
scale(1 being NotatAllStressed and5 being ExtremelyStressed).
Then, they reported voice features that influenced their perception
of participants’ stress during think-aloud. The common features
taken into consideration were: shortness of breath, mouth dryness,
shaky voice, faster or slower than normal rate of talking, higher or
lower than normal voice pitch, and usage of non-informative filler
words.WecategorizedparticipantswithLikertrankingsofthree

3.2 MeasuringTechnical Performance
ToanswerRQ2,weobservedtechnicalaspectsofinterviewsinclud-
ingproblem-solvingstrategies andsolutions’code quality.
3.2.1 Problem-Solving Strategies. To study problem-solving strate-
gies, we analyzed participants’ adoption of beneficial technical
interviewactivitiesbeforeandafterprogramming.Thesebestprac-
tices were derived from hiring teams, programming blogs, and
resourcesto helpusersprepare for interviews.
Defining Approach before Coding. This strategy refers to
technical interview candidates outlining their approach to solving
a programming challenge question before starting to write code.
Duringtechnicalinterviews,planningandexplainingtheapproach
to solve a coding problem before starting to code provides benefits
forparticipants.Forexample,freeCodeCamprecommendsintervie-
wees should łcommunicate your approach to the interviewer even
before you start to codež [ 45] to validate the approach with hiring
managers, FullStack Academy notes describing approaches before
coding provides insight into your thought process and increases
understanding for interviewers [ 52], and Scaler suggests large tech
companieslikeGoogle, Amazon,andFacebook arelookingforcan-
didateswithłthepatienceandintellecttoanalyzetheproblemat
handthoroughlybefore jumping intoprovidingasolutionž[ 42].
To analyze this in our study, we observed recordings to deter-
mine whether participants clearly explained their approach before
startingtheproblem-solvingprocesswithcodeorpseudocodein
each setting. We investigated participant recordings to analyze
theirthink-aloudanddeterminewhentheybegantowritecodefor
theirassignedproblem.Participantswhoprovidedapreliminary
algorithm to approach the problem before starting to write the
program, even if their algorithm changed during the actual coding,
were indicatedto have adoptedthis problem-solvingstrategy.
Checking Code against Test Cases. After completing the
code for technical interview programming questions, resources
indicate interviewees should test their solution to validate their
approach.Ingeneral,testingisvitalforensuringsoftwareworks

correctly [ 50]. Testing is also an important step for validating solu-
tionsduringintechnicalinterviews.Forexample,TechInterview
CoachandGoogleSoftwareEngineerAnthonyD.Maysarguestest-
ingissomethingintervieweesshouldłalwaysžandłabsolutelyneed
to dož during technical interviews [ 34]. Similarly, Ibrahim IrfanÐa
former developer at Google and Facebook and co-founder of the
Superpowered app8Ðemphasizes the importance of testing your
codeduringinterviewsstating,łThebiggestpieceofadviceIcan
give you here is to test your code, not your algorithm. Go through
the exact code you wrote down. This is especially important in
whiteboardinterviewswhere you can’t run your codež[ 29].
To explore the impact of interview settings on participants’ test-
ingtheirsolutionagainsttestcases,wemanuallyanalyzedinter-

tialsolutiontotheprogrammingquestion.Thosethatwentthrough
an input and produced an output value to verify their approach
after completing a solution were regarded as implementing this
technicalinterviewproblem-solvingstrategy,regardlessofwhether
ornot theirsolution wascorrect.
3.2.2 Code Quality. To evaluate code quality, we used industry
standards for evaluating candidates. Specifically, we measured the
correctnessandcomplexityofparticipants’solutiontoensureasyn-
chronous technical interviewssustaintechnical performance.
Correctness. Weevaluatedparticipantcodesolutionsineach
setting with the specific test cases provided to participants. Table 2
summarizes the coding questions along with the test cases used
to evaluate solutions. The screencast participant solutions were
evaluated on test cases based on their randomly assigned question
fromQ1-Q4,whilethewhiteboardparticipantsfromBehroozietal.’s
study were evaluated against Q5 (see Table 1). To analyze program
correctness, we manually translated all of the solutions from each
setting into program code, filling in incomplete or incorrect syntax
whennecessary.Then,weexecutedtheprogramswiththegiven
input values to determine if the output of the code matched the
expected output of the test cases provided. We scored participants
in each setting based on the percentage of test cases passed out
of the total number of test cases to indicate how well completed
solutions metthe requirements ofthe originalproblem.
Optimality. Althoughwedidnotrequireanoptimalsolution,
wedidexaminetheprogramssubmittedbyparticipantsineachset-
ting to determinetheirperformancebased on runtimecomplexity,

lutions provided by participants into executable code and analyzed
the time complexity of programs by observing the data structures
and algorithms utilized. In general, employers expect efficient code
with low complexity during technical interviews [ 35]. Thus, we
evaluate optimality as a metric to determine the number of partici-
pantswhoprovidedthe mostoptimal solution ineachsetting.

6 DISCUSSION
Our findings demonstrate that asynchronous technical interviews
have considerable advantages for candidates, including improv-
ing their think-aloud quality (Section 4.1.1) and reducing stress
(Section4.1.2), allowing more accurate communication about their
problem-solving abilities. Further, we found asynchronicity im-
provedtechnicalperformancebyhelpingcandidatesadoptbetter
problem-solvingstrategies(section 4.2.1)andproducemorecorrect
andoptimalprogrammingsolutions(section 4.2.2).Theseresults
are consistent with findings by Behroozi et al. [ 6,10], who show
that privacy benefits candidates’ performance. In contrast to pri-
vate interviews, we believe this approach can enhance technical
interviewprocessesbyallowingemployerstohaveamoreaccurate
evaluation ofcandidates’thoughtprocesses andcoding abilities.
However, we recognize naively incorporating asynchronous
technical interviews into current software engineering hiring pro-
cessesisnotfeasiblewithoutfurtherconsideration.Forinstance,
contemplating potential communication and ethical concerns aswell as other trade-offs to implementing this approach in industry.
To that end, we aim to provide guidelines for improving think-
aloudqualityandwhilepreservingtechnicalperformanceduring
technical interviewsbasedonour results.
6.1 Communication Trade-offs
To navigate the tension between facilitating candidate privacy and
asynchronicityinourapproachwhilemaintainingthenecessary
interviewer-intervieweeinteractionsduringtechnicalinterviews,
wediscusstrade-offsandoffertacticsforincorporatingthesecon-
cepts into the communication and technical aspects of software
engineeringhiring processes.
6.1.1 Follow-up Questions. One potential concern with removing
synchronous communication during technical interviews is the
loss of dialogue between interviewers and interviewees. In asyn-
chronous technical interviews, candidates submit recordings of
problem-solving sessions to be retroactively reviewed by potential
employers.Whilethissignificantlyimprovescommunicationand
technical aspects of candidates’ interview performance, this ap-
proachcriticallyremovestheopportunityfortheinterviewertoask

Guidelines. Our results show that asynchronicity enhanced can-
didates’ communication ability by significantly increasing infor-
mativenessandeffectivenesswhilereducingstress.However,ad-
ditional modifications to asynchronous technical interviews can
accommodate further dialogue to gain increased insight into candi-
dates’ problem-solving approaches. For example, when reviewing
a recording, interviewers can add comments or questions at spe-
cific points in the video, which can then be clarified by the author
retroactively.Anotherapproachmightinvolveprovidingadditional
guidelinesto candidates up front with the coding problemabout
what should be discussed, such as identifying deficiencies with
solution or describing alternative approaches. These guidelines
could even be interspersed, such that the candidate must submit
therecordingfirst,andthensubmitasecondrecordingthatincludes
answers to the follow-upquestions.
6.1.2 SoftSkillsand CompanyEvaluations. Further,theasynchro-
nousnatureofourapproachpreventsinterviewersfromevaluating
candidates’softskills,ornon-technicalandinterpersonalabilities
ofpotentialemployeesinparticularcontexts[ 27],whicharecrucial
for software engineering work [ 33]. For example, in asynchronous
technical interviews employers are unable to inquire to learn more
aboutinterviewees’background,experiences,personality,andchar-
actertodeterminetheirfitfortherole.Fromcandidates’perspec-
tives, asynchronous technical interviews prohibits interviewees
fromasking questions to interviewersto evaluate companyculture
andexpectedresponsibilitiesforroles.Similartohowemployers
evaluatethesoftskillsofcandidatestodeterminetheirfitforde-
velopment teams,these conversationsalso play a vital role for job
seekers to make decisions aboutculture fitif offeredaposition.
Guidelines. Toincorporatesoftskillsandcompanyevaluations
with asynchronous technical interviews, we suggest employers
vary interview types throughout the software engineering hir-
ingpipeline.Think-aloudisoftenusedtogaugecandidates’abil-
itytoclearlycommunicateandperformaproblem-solvingwalk-
through [ 21]Ðhowever, this is often wrongly conflated with evalu-
ating soft skills.Instead, we argue thatan asynchronous approach
would allow for assessment of a problem-solving walk-through
whileseparatetraditionalbehavioralinterviewsorhigh-levelde-
sign questions would be more appropriate for assessingsoftskills
andteamfit.Forexample,atNetflix,someinterviewersincorporate
a short technical presentation on any topic as part of the interview
process. Further, separate sessions could be used for candidates
to learn about the culture of organizations and expectations for
roles. Thus, by including various types of interview formats in a
hiring pipeline,a morecomplete,accurate,and fairassessment of
candidates can be obtained.
6.2 Ethical Trade-offs
Incorporating privacy and asynchronicity into technical interview
processes could also introduce ethical dilemmas. We introduce
several moral predicaments for both employers and candidates,
and provide guidelines to prevent dishonesty and corruption from
implementing asynchronous technical interviews in software engi-
neeringhiring processes.6.2.1 Cheating. Onecomplicationofintegratingasynchronicity
into technical interviews is the potential for candidates to cheat.
We found that removing evaluator presence significantly improved
candidates’technicalperformanceÐleadingparticipantstoproduce
more precise and optimal code. However, without synchronous in-
terviewer supervision it would be difficult to prevent interviewees
from potentially looking up answers or using external resources
while solving programming challenges. Cheating ultimately in-
hibitsemployersfromgettinganaccurateevaluationofcandidates’
knowledge,skills,andabilitiesto make hiring decisions.
Guidelines. To prevent cheating in asynchronous technical in-
terviews, we suggest formatting hiring evaluations to better reflect
realisticjob settings.Forinstance, onesoftwareengineer declares
łIhaveaconfessiontomake.Icheatatmyjob.Icheatallday,every
day...IfoundthiswebsitecalledStackOverflowthathassomany
answerstoproblemsIruninto.SometimesI’lljustcopythecode
directly from the site, without typing it out again myself! Some-
times I even just walk up to colleagues and straight up ask them
for help with a problemž [ 40]. With screencast recordings, employ-
ershavetheabilitytoviewallresourcesutilizedbyinterviewees
duringcodingtasks,inadditiontoobservingtheirproblem-solving
abilities. Thus, we posit incorporating actual software engineering
affordances into technical interviews, including permitting the use
ofexternalresources,canmitigatetheimpactofcheatingintech-
nical interviews and enhance how candidates are evaluated and
assessedfor software engineeringpositions.
6.2.2 InvasionofPrivacy. Anotherethicaltrade-offforasynchro-
nous technical interviews is, despite the increase in privacy for
candidates, an invasion of candidate privacy by employers. For
instance,withrecentshiftstoonlineeducation,onlineproctoring
systemssuchasProctorio9havebeenemployedtopreventcheating
by monitoring students completing work remotely and without
in-person supervision from teachers. However, users frequently
question the legality of Proctorio and claim the system violates
privacy rightswithfeaturessuch as browserlockingandwebcam
accessÐleading to outcries from students, instructors, and privacy
advocacygroups[ 4].Similarpracticeshavebeenimplementedin
softwareengineeringhiringprocesses.Forexample,Amazonhas
used ProctorU,10another online proctoring platform, during on-
line job assessments to gain access to interviewees’ microphone,
mouse,webcam,andbrowsertoobstructonlineactivity,shutdown
runningapplications,blockscreenshots,andtrackhead,eye,and
mouthmovements[ 31].OnecandidatebloggedabouttheirAmazon
software development engineer interview experience, noting łthe
normalization ofprivacy violation has never felt more realž[ 39].

6.3 OtherConsiderations
6.3.1 Time Commitment. Finding qualified candidates is a sub-
stantial investment, and hidden costs spent on interviewing and
evaluatingcandidatesquicklyaddup[ 16].Incommunicationswith
CoderPad,11apopularonlineplatformforlivecodinginterviews,a
common concern with interviewers across companies is the raw
time they have to spend with candidates is highly disruptive to the
workweekÐanengineercanbeinvolvedinasmanyas3ś7inter-
views a week. Likewise, for candidates the amount of practice, and
sheernumberofinterviewstheymustundergocaninvolvemany
months of workÐleading to biased assessments and frustration for
softwareengineersonthejobmarket[ 8].Overall,thetraditionalin-
terviewprocessrequireshugetimecommitmentsfrombothparties,
whileyielding alowplacement rate.
Guidelines. Asynchronoustechnicalinterviewsofferauniqueop-
portunitytoreduceeffortandtimeinvolvedintechnicalinterviews.
If support for asynchronous technical interviews is integrated into
online platforms, such as CoderPad, then several opportunities for
automation and time-saving could be gained. First, automated test-
ing of code could filter out low-performing candidates, allowing
for manual effort to be focused on more promising candidates. Sec-
ond, automated annotation of the recording (e.g., marking audio
hotspots) could guide interviewers to salient parts of the interview
to review or revisit. Finally, for candidates, a few recorded asyn-
chronous technicalinterviewsinacentralizedplatformcould be
used to apply to multiple positions rather than performing each
interview manually. Thus, a candidate would be able to maintain a
liveportfoliooftheirproblem-solvingprocessratherthanhaving
to demonstratetheseendlesslyper interview.
6.3.2 RelationshiptoOtherAssessments. Finally,itisworthconsid-
ering how asynchronous technical interviews fit in relationship to
other common interview formats. In addition to traditional white-
board interviews, other hiring assessment formats such take-home
tests andcoding quizzes alsoexist.
Theclosestassessmentstoasynchronoustechnicalinterviews
are take-home tests, with a few critical differences. In a take-home
test,acodingproblemisassignedtoacandidatetobecompleted
withinacertaintimeframe,andthenreturnedtotheinterviewer
byadeadline[ 46].Forexample,inarecenttake-hometestprovided

vertisedaheadof time. Similarly, AutoIterative12offerstake-home
tests where candidates have two weeks to develop a feature in a
production environment, correct against edge cases, and optimize
their solution and performance score. Take-home tests are often
laudedfortheirrealistictasksettings,andcompaniesimplementing
similar practices are praised for łhiring without whiteboardsž [ 44];
however,common complaintsfromcandidatesinclude the longer
time commitment required [ 48], and interviewers are unable to as-
sess communication skills via think-aloud. Further, quizzes remove
interactionsbetweeninterviewersandintervieweeswhileassessing
candidates’ knowledge and abilities in unrealistic software engi-
neeringenvironments.Asynchronous technicalinterviewsoffera
mechanism for candidates to demonstrate their problem-solving
andcommunicationskillswithin ashortertime period.

Supervised think-aloud in technical interviews unnaturally syn-
chronizes problem-solving with communication. The result is a
