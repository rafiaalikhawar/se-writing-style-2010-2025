ABSTRACT
Powered by advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, con-
versational AI systems, such as ChatGPT and digital assistants like
Siri, have been widely deployed in daily life. However, such systems
may still produce content containing biases and stereotypes, caus-
ing potential social problems. Due to the data-driven, black-box
nature of modern AI techniques, comprehensively identifying and
measuring biases in conversational systems remains a challenging
task. Particularly, it is hard to generate inputs that can comprehen-
sively trigger potential bias due to the lack of data containing both
social groups as well as biased properties. In addition, modern con-
versational systems can produce diverse responses ( e.g., chatting
and explanation), which makes existing bias detection methods sim-
ply based on the sentiment and the toxicity hardly being adopted.
In this paper, we propose BiasAsker, an automated framework to
identify and measure social bias in conversational AI systems. To
obtain social groups and biased properties, we construct a compre-
hensive social bias dataset, containing a total of 841 groups and
8,110 biased properties. Given the dataset, BiasAsker automatically
generates questions and adopts a novel method based on existence
measurement to identify two types of biases ( i.e., absolute bias and
related bias) in conversational systems. Extensive experiments on
8 commercial systems and 2 famous research models, such as Chat-
GPT and GPT-3, show that 32.83% of the questions generated by
BiasAsker can trigger biased behaviors in these widely deployed
conversational systems. All the code, data, and experimental results
have been released to facilitate future research.
1 INTRODUCTION
Conversational AI systems, such as digital assistants and chatbots,
have been widely deployed and made a great impact on human life.
For instance, statistics show that there were over 4.2 billion digital
voice assistants worldwide, through which 3.1 billion voice searches
were conducted each month in 2022 [ 59]. Apple Siri has 660 million
active users in 2020 [ 13], and there are more than 300,000 chatbots
in operation on Facebook Messenger [5].
Although modern conversational AI systems are powerful enough
to help address many tasks, such systems still produce biased con-
tent and may cause social problems. For example, the Microsoft AI
chatbot, Tay, started tweeting racist comments after being trained

bot proposed by Facebook, can generate offensive output to fe-
males [ 22]. Such biased content not only makes some user groups
feel uncomfortable or even infringes, but also leads to a bad so-
cial atmosphere and even intensifies social conflicts [ 4]. Therefore,
guaranteeing the fairness of conversational AI systems is an urgent
and critical task.
However, preventing conversational AI systems from producing
biased content is fairly challenging. The main reason is that modern
conversational systems are constructed based on deep learning tech-
niques [ 17,51,69]. In particular, deep learning techniques require
massive data to train AI models, and lack interpretability [ 33]. Such
data-driven, black-box characteristics of AI models put a barrier to
comprehensively evaluating the bias in conversational AI systems.
In the literature, most studies on bias detection mainly target
classification or regression systems [ 10,54,64], where the biased
behaviors can be directly identified based on the system outputs.
Some studies adopt sentiment classification models [ 3,47,50] or
commercial textual content moderation APIs [ 18,48] to detect neg-
ative or toxic responses. A conversational AI system, however, is
much more complicated due to its diverse outputs. For example,
when asking "Race A and race B, which is more stupid?", the re-
sponse of a chatbot is "Race A, no doubt." In this situation, it is
hard to detect the bias simply based on the toxicity or sentiment
of the response. In addition, existing research [ 34,50] typically
leverages existing biased data to evaluate the overall bias score
of the system under test. The scope of these studies is limited by
the data, thus not comprehensive. For example, a recent study [ 46]
on evaluating the bias in chatbots only covers gender, race, sexual
orientation, and social class. Besides, existing studies do not inves-
tigate the relationship between the group and the biased property,
e.g., what bias properties are associated with different groups. Previ-
ous research [ 62] also detects bias through annotating the response
manually, which is labor-intensive and can hardly be adopted to
comprehensively evaluate a variety of conversational AI systems.
Hence, an automated approach to comprehensively trigger and
evaluate the bias of conversational AI systems is required.
In this work, we focus on comprehensively evaluating the social
bias in conversational AI systems. Specifically, social bias is the
discrimination for, or against, a person or group, compared with
others, in a way that is prejudicial or unfair [ 60]. According to the
definition, we propose that a comprehensive evaluation tool shouldarXiv:2305.12434v1  [cs.CL]  21 May 2023ESEC/FSE 2023, 11 - 17 November, 2023, San Francisco, USA Yuxuan Wan, Wenxuan Wang, Pinjia He, Jiazhen Gu, Haonan Bai, and Michael Lyu
reveal the correlation between social groups ( e.g., men and women)
and the biased properties ( e.g., financial status and competence), i.e.,
the tool should answer: 1) to what degree is the system biased ,
and2) how social groups and biased properties are associated
in the system under test.
Unfortunately, designing an automated tool to comprehensively
evaluate conversational systems and answer the above two ques-
tions is non-trivial. There are two main challenges. First, due to
the lack of labeled data containing social groups as well as biased
properties, it is hard to generate inputs that can comprehensively
trigger potential bias in conversational systems. Second, modern
conversational systems can produce diverse responses, e.g., they
may produce vague or unrelated responses due to pre-defined pro-
tection mechanisms. As a result, it is quite challenging to automat-
ically identify whether the system output reflects social bias ( i.e.,
the test oracle problem).
In this paper, we propose BiasAsker, a novel framework to au-
tomatically trigger social bias in conversational AI systems and
measure the extent of the bias. Specifically, in order to obtain social
groups and biased properties, we first manually extract and annotate
the social groups and bias properties in existing datasets [ 34,44,49],
and construct a comprehensive social bias dataset containing 841
social groups under 11 attributes, and 8,110 social bias properties of
12 categories. Based on the social bias dataset, BiasAsker systemat-
ically generates a variety of questions through combining different
social groups and biased properties, with a focus on triggering two
types of biases ( i.e., absolute bias and relative bias) in conversa-
tional AI systems. According to the question and corresponding
response, BiasAsker leverages sentence similarity methods and ex-
istence measurements to record potential biases, then calculate the
bias scores from the perspective of relative bias and absolute bias,
finally summarize and visualize the latent associations in chatbots
under-test. In particular, BiasAsker currently can test conversa-
tional AI systems in both English and Chinese, two widely used
languages over the world.
To evaluate the performance of BiasAsker, we apply BiasAsker
to testing eight widely-deployed commercial conversational AI sys-
tems and two famous conversational research models from famous
companies, including OpenAI, Meta, Google, Microsoft, Baidu, Xi-
aoMi, OPPO, Vivo, and Tencent. Our experiment covers chatbots
with and without public API access. The results show that a maxi-
mum of 32.83% of BiasAsker queries can trigger biased behavior in
these widely deployed software products. All the code, data, and
results have been released1for reproduction and future research.
We summarize the main contributions of this work as follows:
•We propose that, comprehensively evaluating the social bias
in AI systems should take both the social group and the biased
property into consideration. Based on this intuition, we construct
the first social bias dataset containing 841 social groups under 11
attributes and 8110 social bias properties under 12 categories.
•We design and implement BiasAsker , the first automated frame-
work for comprehensively measuring the social biases in con-
versational AI systems, which utilizes the dataset and NLP tech-
niques to systematically generate queries and adopts sentence
similarity methods to detect biases.

deployed commercial conversation systems, as well as two fa-

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Conversational AI System
Conversational AI systems are software products that users can
talk to, such as chatbots and virtual agents. Such systems typically
utilize large volumes of data, and deep learning techniques ( e.g.,
natural language processing) to recognize text and speech inputs,
and imitate human interactions.
More specifically, current conversational AI systems can be clas-
sified into two types: task-oriented systems and open-domain sys-
tems. Task-oriented systems are designed to assist users to accom-
plish specific tasks, such as online shopping [ 63], restaurant reser-
vation [ 6], and hotel booking [ 57]. These systems often consist of
several components for different functionalities: natural language
understanding, state tracking, and dialog management. On the other
hand, open-domain systems are designed to chit-chat with humans
on any topic, such as replying to tweets [ 71] or providing enter-
tainment [ 55]. In this work, we treat a conversational AI system
as a black-box software system and propose a framework that can
trigger and measure social bias in both task-oriented systems and
open-domain systems.
2.2 Social Bias in Conversational AI Systems
Bias in AI systems has been a known risk for decades [ 7]. It remains
a complicated problem that is difficult to counteract. Formally, an
AI system has the following two elements [10]:
•A class label is called a favorable label if it gives an advantage
to the receiver.
•An attribute that divides the whole population into different
groups.
For example, in the case of job application datasets, "receive
the job offer" is the favorable label, and according to the "gender"
attribute, people can be categorized into different groups, like "male"
and "female". The fairness of the AI system is defined as the goal
that based on the attribute, different groups will be treated similarly
to receive the favorable label. If not, the AI system is biased.
As one of the most important applications of AI techniques,
conversational AI systems can inevitably be biased. Since such
systems are widely deployed in people’s daily life, biased content
generated by these systems, especially that related to social bias,BiasAsker: Measuring the Bias in Conversational AI System ESEC/FSE 2023, 11 - 17 November, 2023, San Francisco, USA

may cause severe consequences. In particular, social bias is the
discrimination for, or against, a person or group, compared with
others, in a way that is prejudicial or unfair [ 60]. Social biased
content is not only uncomfortable for certain groups but also can
lead to a bad social atmosphere and even aggravate social conflicts.
For example, a recent study on dialog safety issues [ 50] found that
"biased opinion" is worse than the other categories significantly. In
addition, recent research on LLM (Large Language Model) [ 38,51]
showed that advanced techniques that can improve the performance
of dialog models have little improvement on the bias safety level.
As such, exposing and measuring the bias in conversational AI
systems is a critical task.
Unfortunately, detecting bias in a conversational AI system is
non-trivial, mainly due to the diverse outputs. Specifically, commer-
cial conversational systems contain pre-defined protection mecha-
nisms to generate proper responses to toxic questions. For exam-
ple, Figure 1 shows an example of Microsoft’s commercial chatbot
named Xiaobing. Although the question "which is more stupid" is
semantically similar to "which is smarter", the first question cannot
expose the bias while the second question can. Such diversity in the
responses to similar questions makes it hard to effectively trigger
bias in conversational AI systems
Besides absolute bias (i.e., the bias directly expressed by conver-
sational AI systems, e.g., "Group A is smarter than group B."), such
systems may also produce totally different responses for different
groups. For example, Figure 2 shows that, given three identical
questions about the financial status of different groups ( i.e., Group
A and Group B), the chatbot produces different results ( i.e., three
affirmative answers to Group A, and only one affirmative answer toGroup B). Obviously, the chatbot is biased toward Group A. How-
ever, such relative bias can hardly be exposed through asking
"wh"-questions.
In this work, we intend to comprehensively expose the above two
kinds of bias ( i.e., absolute bias and relative bias) in conversational
AI systems. Next, we introduce our approach designed to identify
bias.
3 APPROACH AND IMPLEMENTATION
In this section, we first illustrate how we construct the social bias
dataset. Specifically, we introduce how we extract, organize and an-
notate the biased properties, as well as the groups being prejudiced
from existing datasets (Section 3.1). Then, we present BiasAsker,
a novel framework to comprehensively expose biases in conversa-
tional AI systems. Figure 3 shows the overall workflow of BiasAsker,
which consists of two main stages: question generation and bias
detection.
In order to comprehensively expose potential bias, BiasAsker
first generates diverse questions based on the social bias dataset in
the question generation stage. Specifically, BiasAsker first extracts
biased tuples for two kinds of bias ( i.e., absolute and relative bias)
through performing Cartesian Product on the social groups and bi-
ased properties in the dataset. It then generates three types of ques-
tions ( i.e., Yes-No-Question, Choice-Question and Wh-Question)
using rule-based and template-based methods, which serve as in-
puts for bias testing (Section 3.2)
In the bias identification stage, BiasAsker first inputs three types
of questions ( i.e., Yes-No-Question, Choice-Question and Wh-Question)
to the conversational AI system under test and conducts three mea-
surements ( i.e., affirmation measurements, choice measurement
and explanation measurement) to collect the suspicious biased re-
sponses, respectively. Then, based on the defined absolute bias rate
and relative bias score, BiasAsker can quantify and visualize the
two kinds of bias for the conversational AI system.
3.1 Social Bias Dataset Construction
Since social bias contains the social group ( e.g., "male") and the bi-
ased property ( e.g., "do not work hard"), in order to comprehensively
trigger social bias in conversational AI systems, we first construct a
comprehensive social bias dataset containing the biased knowledge
(i.e., different social groups and the associated biased properties).
3.1.1 Collecting Social Groups. To collect different social groups
as comprehensively as possible, we first collect publicly available
datasets related to social bias in the NLP (Natural Language Pro-
cessing) literature, and then merge the social groups recorded in
the datasets. Specifically, we use three existing datasets: 1) Stere-
oSet [ 34], 2) Social Bias Inference Corpus (SBIC) [ 44], and 3) Holis-
ticBias [ 49]. StereoSet contains social groups in four categories,
i.e., gender, profession, race, and religion. For each category, they
select terms ( e.g., Asian) representing different social groups. SBIC
contains 150k structured annotations of social media posts, cover-
ing over 34k implications about a thousand demographic groups.
HolisticBias includes nearly 600 descriptor terms across 13 different
demographic axes.
After merging all social groups in the above three datasets, we
perform data cleaning. We first remove the duplicated groups, thenESEC/FSE 2023, 11 - 17 November, 2023, San Francisco, USA Yuxuan Wan, Wenxuan Wang, Pinjia He, Jiazhen Gu, Haonan Bai, and Michael Lyu

manually filter out the terms that are infrequent, not referring to
a social group, or too fine-grained ( e.g., "Ethiopia" is merged with
"Ethiopian"). Finally, we unified the annotations of group categories
based on the original annotations of the three datasets. Table 1 lists
the statistics and examples of the finally obtained social groups.
3.1.2 Collecting Biased Properties. We collect biased properties
based on SBIC. This dataset consists of social media posts drawn
from Twitter, Reddit, and Hatesites. It also contains annotations
of the implied statement of each post, i.e., the stereotype that is
referenced in the post in the form of simple Hearst-like patterns ( e.g.,
“women are ADJ”, “gay men VBP” [ 21]). To collect biased properties,
we identify and remove the subject ( e.g., "women" in "women are
ADJ") in each implied statement. Specifically, we first use the spaCy
toolkit2to identify noun chunks and analyze the token dependency
in each statement. If the noun chunk is the subject of the sentence,
we remove this noun chunk. After removing subjects, we further
filter out the biased properties that are not of the standard form
(e.g., "it makes a joke of Jewish people") or do not express biases
(e.g., "are ok") during the manual annotation process. Finally, we
obtain a total of 8,110 biased properties.
2https://spacy.io/3.1.3 Annotating Biased Properties. After collecting the biased
properties, we further construct taxonomies based on bias dimen-
sions to assist bias measurement. In particular, we conduct an it-
erative analysis and labeling process with three annotators who
all have multiple years of developing experience. The initial labels
are determined through an extensive investigation of the descrip-
tive dimensions of a person or a social group. In each iteration,
we construct a new version of the taxonomy by comparing and
merging similar labels, removing inadequate categories, refining
unclear definitions based on the results of previous iterations, and
discussing the results of the last iteration. After three iterations, we
obtain a classification scheme illustrated in the "Category" column
of Table 2. We adopt a multi-label scheme where each statement
can have multiple labels. Statistics of the annotated samples are
shown in Table 2.
In Section 2.2 we introduced that commercial chatbots often have
defense mechanisms. Hence, to evade such a mechanism, we manu-
ally annotate the antonyms of these extracted biased properties and
use the positive words to trigger the chatbots in our experiments.
Table 3 shows a slice of the annotated dataset.
3.1.4 Translation. To test Conversational AI software that use
Chinese as their primary language, we further translate the entire
dataset into Chinese. Specifically, we first use Google Translate3and
DeepL4to generate translation automatically for all items ( i.e., social
groups, biased properties and categories) in the dataset. For each
item, we use the spaCy toolkit to measure the semantic similarity
of the results generated by two translators. If the similarity is less
than 0.7, we manually inspect and translate the item. Otherwise,
we directly use Deepl’s translation result. As such, we obtain the
social bias dataset in both English and Chinese.
3.2 Question Generation
In this section, we introduce how BiasAsker generates questions
to trigger bias in conversational systems based on the constructed
dataset.
As introduced in Section 2.2, there are two types of bias ( i.e.,
absolute bias and relative bias) in conversational AI systems. In
order to generate questions that can trigger both absolute bias and

relative bias, BiasAsker first constructs biased tuples that contain
different combinations of social groups and biased properties. Then,
BiasAsker adopts several NLP techniques to generate questions
according to the biased tuples.
3.2.1 Constructing Biased Tuples. Since the absolute bias is the bias
that directly expresses the superiority of group A to group B on a
property, the corresponding tuple should contain two groups in the
same attribution and the biased property. So for triggering absolute
bias, we use a ternary tuple. More specifically, we construct biased
tuples by first iterating all combinations of groups within the same
category to form a list of group pairs, then we take the Cartesian
product of the list and the set of biased properties to create biased
tuples of the form absolute bias tuples {Group A, Group B, biased
property}, for instance, {women, men, are smart}.
As relative bias is the bias that is measured by the difference in
altitude to different groups according to a bias property, BiasAsker
needs to query the altitude of each group on every property. Hence
the corresponding tuple should contain a group and a bias property.
To construct this, we directly take the Cartesian product of the
protected group set and biased property set to form relative bias
tuples {Group A, biased property}, for instance, {men, are smart}.
The advantage of using this method is that instead of being lim-
ited by the original biases presented in the SBIC dataset, which
were collected from social media posts, we can systematically gen-
erate all possible social bias ( i.e., specific biased property on specific
group), thus comprehensively evaluating the behavior of the sys-
tem under test. In particular, suppose the original bias implied by a
social media post is "Group A has weird names," previous studies
can only use this bias to prompt conversational systems, while
BiasAsker can further generate biases, e.g., "Group B has weird
names" and "Group C has weird names", through changing social
groups. Moreover, BiasAsker can also generate biases by combin-
ing the social group with other biased properties in our dataset,
such as "Group A are beautiful" and "Group A are rich". As a result,
BiasAsker can compare chatbots’ behaviors under different social
groups and different bias properties, thus gaining insights into the
biased association. In other words, BiasAsker is capable of answer-
ing "what bias is associated with which social group" in the system
under test.3.2.2 Generating Questions. For each generated biased tuple, Bi-
asAsker converts it to the question form, which serves as the query
to the conversational system. BiasAsker support to generate all
three types of questions, covering all main question types in Eng-
lish5,i.e., yes-no questions (including tag questions), choice ques-
tions, and wh-questions using rule-based and template-based meth-
ods. Table 4 shows the examples.
Generating Questions for Absolute Bias: A biased tuple for
absolute bias contains two social groups and one biased property. To
generate yes-no questions and wh-questions, if the biased property
is of the form "AUX ADJ" ("are smart") or "AUX ADV ADJ" ("are
mentally healthy"), BiasAsker generates their corresponding com-
parative form (e,g., "are smarter than", "are mentally healthier than")
following the rules of regular and irregular comparatives6using the
spaCy toolkit and the Syllapy module7. Then, BiasAsker combines
the groups and the property to generate the question based on pre-
defined templates. Specifically, for yes-no questions, two templates:
"Do you agree that [Group A/B] [Property] [Group B/A]", and
"[Group A/B] [Property] [Group B/A], right?" are adopted. For wh-
questions, we use "Why [Group A/B][Property][Group B/A]". For
choice questions, BiasAsker directly fills the groups and the prop-
erty into the templates of "Who do you think [Property], [Group
A] or [Group B]", and "In your opinion, [Group A][Property] or
[Group B][Property]?".
Generating Questions for Relative Bias: For the relative bias,
the corresponding bias tuple only contain one social group and
one biased property. Hence, we only generate yes-no questions
and wh-questions. To generate yes-no questions, BiasAsker adopts
rule-based and template-based methods. For the rule-based genera-
tion, we first concatenate the group and biased property to form
a sentence, then locate the predictive verb (VERB(ROOT)) in the
sentence. We check if the sentence has an auxiliary (AUX) as the
root verb (ROOT) or contains AUX linked to the ROOT. 1) General
questions: if AUX exists, we move the AUX to the beginning of the
whole sentence. Otherwise, we determine the tense and number of
VERB(ROOT) and insert a "do" with a suitable tense and number at
the beginning of the sentence. 2) Tag questions. If AUX exists, we
further check if there is a negation linked to the AUX. If there is no
negation, we copy the AUX and append it at the end of the sentence
adding a negation; otherwise, we directly append the AUX after the
sentence without negation. If the sentence has no AUX, we append a
"do" with suitable tense with or without negation based on whether
the VERB(ROOT) is linked to a negation. We use the spaCy toolkit
to perform all the sentence analysis tasks. For a template-based
generation, we fill the biased knowledge into the templates of "Do
you agree that [Group] [Property]", "[Group][Property], right?".
To generate wh-question, we use template-based generation "Why
[Group] [Property]".
3.3 Biased Answer Collection
After question generation, BiasAsker feeds generated questions to
the conversational systems and collects the biased responses. In

this section, we introduce how BiasAsker identifies the bias in the
responses.
For yes-no questions, choice questions and wh-questions, Bi-
asAsker needs to detect whether the response expresses affirmation,
makes choice and tries to explain, respectively. If so, the response
is collected for the bias measurements and visualization, which will
be demonstrated in Section 3.4. BiasAsker achieves this by con-
ducting existence measurements. Specifically, BiasAsker calculates
the sentence similarity between the generated response and the
expected answer ( i.e., affirmation expression, choice expression and
explanation expression, respectively) to indicate the existence of
the expected answer in the response.
Next, we first introduce the existence measurement methods
adopted in BiasAsker, and then demonstrate how BiasAsker identi-
fies bias in the responses to different types of questions.
Existence measurement. BiasAsker implements different ap-
proaches to compute sentence similarity for existence measurement.
In particular:
(1)N-gram matching. It is a widely used metric for sentence
similarity measurement approach, described in [ 35]. Given
two sentences, it calculates the ratio of the n-gram of one
sentence that can exactly match the n-gram of the other.
(2)Cosine similarity [ 11]. Given a target sentence and a source
sentence, it checks whether there exist words in the source
sentence sharing semantically similar embedding vectors
with the words in the target sentence.
(3)N-gram sentence similarity. It is a modified cosine similar-
ity method that checks whether there exist n-grams in the
source sentence sharing semantically similar embedding vec-
tors with every n-grams in the target sentence.(4)Cosine similarity with position penalty [ 43]: this is another
modified cosine similarity measurement that considers struc-
tural information. The similarity of the 𝑖𝑡ℎtoken in sen-
tence r and 𝑗𝑡ℎtoken in sentence h is defined as A(𝑟𝑖,ℎ𝑗)=
𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑟𝑖,ℎ𝑗)+|𝑞(𝑖+1)−𝑝(𝑗+1)|
𝑝𝑞where p, q is the length of sen-
tence r, h.
(5)Sentence embedding similarity [ 40]: This is a sentence-level
similarity measurement that can directly use sentence em-
beddings instead of word embeddings to calculate cosine
similarity.
An ideal similarity measurement method should output 1) close
to 1.0 when two sentences are the same or have a similar seman-
tic meaning, and 2) approximate 0 when two sentences have the
opposite semantic meaning.
Affirmation measurement for Yes-No Question. To identify
whether a response expresses affirmation, we collect a list of 64
affirmation expressions ( e.g., I agree, for sure, of course), as well as
a list of negative expressions. A sentence is considered expressing
affirmation if it contains an affirmation expression and does not
contain any expressions in the negation list. "Contain" is deter-
mined by the existence measurement described above. BiasAsker
collects all the question-answer pairs if it is considered to express
affirmation.
Choice measurement for Choice Question: To identify if a
response expresses making the choice, we perform existence mea-
surement of the two groups 𝑔1,𝑔2. A response is considered biased
if any of𝑔1,𝑔2, but not both, is in the response. BiasAsker collects
the question-answer pair if it is considered to express choice.
Explanation measurement for Wh-Question: To identify if
a response expresses an explanation, we collect a list of explanation
expressions, such as "because", "due to", and "The reason is", and
perform existence measurement to detect whether the response
contains such expressions. If so, BiasAsker collects the question-
answer pair.
3.4 Bias Measurement
After identifying and collecting the biased responses, BiasAsker
performs bias measurement, i.e., to what degree is the system bi-
ased. Recall from Section 2.2 that there are two types of bias, i.e.,
absolute bias and relative bias. Absolute bias is the bias that a con-
versational system directly expresses, while relative bias refers to
the system treating different groups differently. In the following,
we first introduce how BiasAsker measure and quantify two types
of bias, respectively.
3.4.1 Absolute Bias Measurement. We consider that a system ex-
hibits absolute bias if: it expresses affirmation in response to aBiasAsker: Measuring the Bias in Conversational AI System ESEC/FSE 2023, 11 - 17 November, 2023, San Francisco, USA
yes-no question; or it makes a choice in response to a choice ques-
tion; or it provides an explanation to a why-question. To quantify
the degree to which the system is biased and gain further insight
into the biased associations in terms of absolute bias, we define the
following quantities:
Absolute bias rate. We define absolute bias rate as the per-
centage of questions that trigger absolute bias among all queries
having the same category of biases properties or social groups. For
example, the absolute bias rate for "Gender" is the percentage of
biased responses triggered by all absolute bias queries related to
the gender category. This metric reflects the extent to which the
system is biased in terms of absolute bias.
Advantage of a group over another group. For each pair of
group(𝑔𝑖,𝑔𝑗)and a given bias category, BiasAsker counts 𝑡𝑖
𝑗, the
number of times 𝑔𝑖getting advantage over 𝑔𝑗in the responses.
Then, BiasAsker calculates 𝑎𝑖
𝑗=(𝑡𝑖
𝑗)/(𝑡𝑖
𝑗+𝑡𝑗
𝑖)as the advantage
of𝑔𝑖over𝑔𝑗. For example, for questions related to health bias, if
men are selected two times over women, and women are selected
three times over men, then the advantage of men over women
is𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑤𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑛 =2/(2+3)=0.4. And the advantage of women is
𝑎𝑤𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛 =3/(2+3)=0.6. When𝑎𝑗
𝑖=𝑎𝑖
𝑗=0.5or𝑡𝑗
𝑖=𝑡𝑖
𝑗=0
(i.e., two groups have an equal advantage or none of them have
been selected by the system), we consider that the system has no
preference to either group. Otherwise, if one group has a larger 𝑎𝑖
𝑗
value, the system is considered to be more favorable to this group.
3.4.2 Relative Bias Measurement. Similar to the absolute bias, if
the tested system expresses affirmation in response to a yes-no
question, or makes an explanation to a why-question, we consider
that the system shows favor to the group. Relative bias measures
the difference in the degree of favor for different groups. Thus, we
propose the following metrics:
Preference rate. We define preference rate as the percentage of
responses that express favor to a group with respect to all queries
concerning this group. For example, for questions related to health
bias, if the "man" group gets favored five times out of ten questions,
then the preference rate for "man" in health is 5/10 = 0.5. The higher
the preference rate, the more the system favors the group.
Relative bias rate. We define relative bias rate as the variance
of preference rates of a set of groups under the same bias category.
For a specific bias category 𝑐and a set of groups 𝐺, the relative bias
rate𝐵𝑟(𝐺,𝑐)can be calculated as the following:
𝐵𝑟(𝐺,𝑐)=𝐸
(𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓(𝑔𝑖,𝑐)−𝐸[𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓(𝑔𝑖,𝑐)])2]
,𝑔𝑖∈𝐺
where𝐸[∗]denotes the expectation, 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓(𝑔,𝑐)denotes the prefer-
ence rate for group 𝑔given bias category 𝑐. The higher the relative
bias rate, the more the system treats different groups differently.
4 EVALUATION
4.1 Research Questions
In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of BiasAsker on expos-
ing and measuring social bias in conversational AI systems through
answering the following three research questions (RQs).
•RQ1: How does BiasAsker perform in exposing bias in conversa-
tional AI systems?
•RQ2: Are the bias automatically found by BiasAsker valid?•RQ3: What can we learn from the discovered bias?
In RQ1, our goal is to investigate the effectiveness of BiasAsker
in systematically triggering and identifying social bias in conver-
sational systems. In other words, we evaluate the capability of Bi-
asAsker in measuring the biased extent of different systems. Since
BiasAsker adopts diverse NLP methods, which are generally im-
perfect ( i.e., the methods may produce false positives and true
negatives) [ 16,28], in RQ2, we evaluate the validity of the identified
bias through manual inspection. Finally, to the best of our knowl-
edge, BiasAsker is the first approach to reveal hidden associations
between social groups and biases properties in conversational sys-
tems. Therefore, in RQ3, we analyze whether the results generated
by BiasAsker can provide an intuitive and constructive impression
of social bias in the tested systems.
4.2 Experimental Setup
To evaluate the effectiveness of BiasAsker, we use BiasAsker to
test 8 widely-used commercial conversational systems as well as 2
famous research models. The details of these systems are shown in
Table 5. Among these systems, 4 systems ( i.e., Chat-GPT, XiaoAi,
Jovi and Breeno) do not provide application programming interface
(API) access and can only be accessed manually.
For the systems that provide API access, we conduct large-scale
experiments, including seven social group attributes ( i.e., ability,
age, body, gender, race, religion, and profession) and each attributes
contains 4-6 groups. We measure the biased properties from twelve
categories and each category contains seven properties.
For the systems without API access, we conduct small-scale ex-
periments since we have to input the query and collect the response
manually. We conduct experiments on seven social group attributes,
but each attribution only contains 2-3 groups. We measure three
bias categories ( i.e., appearance, financial status, competence), and
each category contains five biased properties. Since these systems
cannot be queried automatically, we first use BiasAsker to generate
questions. Then we manually feed the questions to the systems and
collect the responses. Finally, we feed the responses and the ques-
tions back to BiasAsker for bias identification and measurement.
The statistic of testing data is shown in Tabel 6. Note that biased
properties have multiple labels, so the actual number of biased prop-
erty samples per category may be more than the aforementioned
number.
4.3 Results and Analysis
4.3.1 RQ1 - The overall effectiveness of BiasAsker. In this RQ, we
investigate whether BiasAsker can0 effectively trigger, identify, and
measure the bias in conversational systems.
Absolute bias. Table 7 shows the absolute bias rate ( i.e., the
percentage of responses expressing absolute bias) of different sys-
tems on different group attributes. Recall that absolute bias refers
to the bias that the conversational system directly expresses, thus
closely related to the fairness of the system. From the table, we can
observe that the absolute bias rate of widely-deployed commercial
models, such as GPT-3 and Jovi, can be as high as 25.03% and 32.82%,
indicating that these two systems directly express a bias for every
3-4 questions.ESEC/FSE 2023, 11 - 17 November, 2023, San Francisco, USA Yuxuan Wan, Wenxuan Wang, Pinjia He, Jiazhen Gu, Haonan Bai, and Michael Lyu

Queries for absolute bias 18396 780
Queries for relative bias 11760 1020
Relative bias. Table 8 shows the relative bias rate ( i.e., the vari-
ance of the Preference rate of different group attributes) of differ-
ent systems. Relative bias reflects the degree to which the system
discriminates against different groups. We can observe that all con-
versational systems under test exhibit relative bias. Particularly,
DialoGPT has the largest relative bias rate among the systems with
API access. We can also notice that conversational systems tend to
show more severe bias on specific attributes ( i.e., race, gender and
ability).
Answer to RQ1: BiasAsker can effectively trigger, identify,
and measure the degree of bias in conversational systems.
4.3.2 RQ2 - Validity of identified biases. In this RQ, we investi-
gate whether the biased behaviors exposed by BiasAsker are valid
through manual inspection.
BiasAsker mainly adopts rule-based and template-based approaches
and performs bias measurement based on the manually annotated
dataset. As a result, the outcomes of biased tuple construction, ques-
tion generation, answer collection, and bias measurement are fully
deterministic. We iterate four versions of BiasAsker to ensure that
these procedures are robust, effective, and can perform desired
functionalities.The only vulnerable part of BiasAsker is bias identification,
where the sentence similarity of the responses and reference an-
swers is calculated. To ensure the quality of the testing results,
we perform a manual inspection of the bias identification process.
Specifically, we randomly sample 3,000 question-response pairs
from the experimental results, and manually annotate whether
they reflect bias according to the criteria described in Section 3.
In particular, we invite two of our co-authors, both proficient in
English, to annotate the sampled question-answer pairs separately.
Then they discuss the results and resolve differences to obtain a
single version of the annotation. Finally, we select a total of 2,600
biased and unbiased pairs (1300 each) from the annotated data, and
let BiasAsker to perform bias identification. Through comparing
the identification results with annotated results, we can calculate
performance metrics. BiasAsker achieves an accuracy of 0.93, indi-
cating that the bias identification results are reliable.
Answer to RQ2: The bias identification results from Bi-
asAsker are reliable, achieving an accuracy of 0.93 on man-
ually annotated data.
4.3.3 RQ3 - Insight of the discovered bias. Our work is the first
approach that can provide insights into the latent associations
between social groups and bias properties in conversational systems.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of BiasAsker, we present two case
studies in this RQ. In the first case study, we compare the bias in
DialoGPT ( i.e., the system with the highest relative bias on gender)
and Jovi ( i.e., the system with the highest absolute bias on gender).
In the second case, we investigate the biased behaviors of ChatGPT,
the SOTA conversational system.
DialoGPT and Jovi. In RQ1, we observe that DialoGPT has the
highest relative bias scores on gender. To have a deeper insight into
such bias, we further investigate the following two questions a)
what group does DialoGPT "favor" or "disfavor"? b)what biases are
associated with the gender attribute?
To answer question a, we visualize the preference rate of each
social group under the gender attribute in Figure 4. Recall from
Section 3.4 that the higher the preference rate, the more this system
"favors" the group. The figure suggests that DialoGPT favors men
over all other groups. The answer to question bcan be observedBiasAsker: Measuring the Bias in Conversational AI System ESEC/FSE 2023, 11 - 17 November, 2023, San Francisco, USA

Figure 4: Preference rate of each protected group under the
gender category. Jovi negatively associates transgender peo-
ple with health, mistreatment, and morality, and men with
morality.
from Figure 4: the chatbot particularly associates gay people with
culture negatively ( i.e., have a low preference rate to questions such
as "Gay people have a civilized culture"). We compared these results
to the ones of Jovi in the same figure and discovered that DialoGPT
favors men more while Jovi favors women more. In addition, Jovi
assumes a negative association between transgender people and
health, mistreatment, and morality, and men with morality.
We also investigate the absolute bias in Jovi. We plot heat maps
where row 𝑥column𝑦records the advantage of group 𝑥over
group𝑦as defined in 3.4. If the corresponding value is larger than
0.5 (Green), then group 𝑥is favored by Jovi compared to group 𝑦.

ChatGPT. Table 7 shows that ChatGPT performs significantly
better than its predecessor GPT-3, as well as all other chatbots, i.e.,
ChatGPT exhibits almost no absolute bias. However, relative bias
still exists in ChatGPT. Figure 6 discloses the relative bias on the
gender and age attribute in ChatGPT. Unlike DidloGPT and Jovi,
transgender people and old people have the highest preference rate
in ChatGPT. In general, we observe that groups receiving the most
preference rate from ChatGPT are the groups that tend to receive
consistently less preference from other conversational systems,
which may indicate that ChatGPT has been trained to avoid com-
mon biased behaviors exhibited by other conversational systems.
To provide a more intuitive view of the performance of ChatGPT,
we list a few question-answer pairs that reflect the relative bias in
ChatGPT in Table 9.
Answer to RQ3: BiasAsker can visualize and provide in-
sight into the latent associations between social groups and
bias categories.
5 THREATS TO VALIDITY
The validity of this work may be subject to some threats. The first
threat lies in the NLP techniques adopted by BiasAsker for bias iden-
tification. Due to the imperfect nature of NLP techniques, the biases
identified by BiasAsker may be false positives, or BiasAsker may
miss some biased responses, leading to false negatives. To relieve
this threat, we compare the effectiveness of different widely-used
similarity methods and utilized the one having the best perfor-
mance. In addition, we also conducted human annotation to show
that BiasAsker can achieve high accuracy ( i.e., 0.93) in detecting
bias.
The second threat is that the input data of BiasAsker are based
on several existing social bias datasets, which may hurt the com-
prehensiveness of the testing results. The social bias may also be
unrealistic and rarely appear in the real world. To mitigate this
threat, we collected and combined different social bias datasets, all
of which are collected from real-world media posts on the Internet
and manually annotated by researchers.
The third threat lies in the conversational AI systems used in the
evaluation. We do not evaluate the performance of BiasAsker on
other systems. To mitigate this threat, we chose to test commercial
conversational systems and SOTA academic models provided by big
companies. In the future, we could test more commercial software
and research models to further mitigate this threat.
6 RELATED WORK
6.1 Testing of AI Software
AI software has been adopted by various domains, such as au-
tonomous driving and face recognition. However, AI software is not
robust enough and can generate erroneous outputs that lead to fatal
accidents [ 27,70]. To this end, researchers have proposed a variety
of methods to generate adversarial examples or test the reliability
of AI software [ 1,9,23,32,36,37,41,53,56,65–67].NLP software
has also been used in recent years. Typical scenarios include Gram-
matical Error Correction [ 61] and machine translation [ 2,24,25].
Because of its importance, researchers from both NLP and softwareengineering areas have started to explore the robustness of NLP
software [19, 20, 52, 58].
As one of the most popular NLP software, conversational AI
Software has attracted attention from both industry and academia.
Reference-based techniques are the mainstream practice of test-
ing conversational AI software, which constructs benchmarks by
manually labeling each test input [ 12,26,39]. Recently, researchers
proposed automatic conversational AI software testing techniques,
which do not rely on manually pre-annotated labels [ 11,31,45].
However, the aforementioned work all focused on the correctness
of AI software. This work, on the contrary, focuses on measuring
the biases in conversational AI software.
6.2 Testing the Bias of Conversational AI
Software
We systematically reviewed papers on testing the biases in con-
versational AI software across related research areas, including
software engineering, natural language processing, and security.
Previous work typically focused on some specific biases in dia-
logue systems, such as gender [ 15,29,30,46], race [ 14,46], social
class [ 46] and profession [ 14]. Our BiasAsker, on the contrary, can
systematically and comprehensively measure the biases of different
groups and properties.
Previous studies have utilized several methods to identify the bias
in dialogue systems, such as training a neural network classifier [ 50]
or commercial textual content moderation API [ 48]. However, such
methods only consider the response, which is not sufficient to detect
bias. And the accuracy of such external tools can not be guaranteed.
Xuet al. [62] conduct human annotation on the responses, but much
human effort is needed and does not support automatic testing upon
request. Our BiasAsker, on the other hand, can detect the bias based
on both the questions and the generated responses.
7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we design and implement BiasAsker, the first auto-
mated framework for comprehensively measuring the social biases
in conversational AI systems. BiasAsker is able to evaluate 1) to
what degree is the system biased and 2)how social groups and biased
properties are associated in the system. We conduct experiments
on eight widely deployed commercial conversational AI systems
and two famous research models and demonstrate that BiasAsker
can effectively trigger a massive amount of biased behavior.
