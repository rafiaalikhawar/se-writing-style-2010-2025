1 INTRODUCTION
CodeReviewAutomation isanessentialactivitytoreducehuman

havebeenconductedoncodereviewautomation,or bots,andlotsof
open-source projects use automation tools to support code review.
This automationallows developerstofocus onunderstanding the
intention of code changes, and spend more time discussing the
architectural designordomain-specific problems.
Inspiteofitsconvenience,codereviewautomationinreal-world
industry faces several challenges. Samsung Electronics manufac-
tures many types of electronic devices such as mobile phones, net-
workequipment,smartTVs,andhomeappliances.Therefore,many
projects in Samsung are different in their development environ-
ments,domains,sizes,programminglanguages,andprocesses.The
automation ismore challenging inthesesettings.
Thefirstchallengeisthevarietyofdevelopment environments.
Forexample,eachdevelopmentgroupusesdifferentreviewsystem

Every day, in Samsung Electronics , approximately ten thousands of
review requests are created from more than 10,000 projects, and
about 1.4 million lines of code are added and about one million
removed.
Thelastchallengehastodowiththediversityofdevelopment

forthispurpose.Forexample,therearesometeamsthatperform
static analysis as part of Continuous Integration (CI), but other
groups use the tools during the integration testing phase. Some
groupsareusingJavaandKotlinasprogramminglanguages,but
most are using C/C++. Therefore, different tools are required for
differentlanguages.
In order to overcomethesechallenges, we developed Code Re-
view Bot, a unified code review automation system for Samsung
Electronics . It supports various review systems that are used in
thecompany.Inaddition,itprovidesavarietyofservicessuchas
code change size measurements in review requests, typo checks,
potentialdefectdetection, andcoding style checks.
We conducted a survey to collect feedback from developers,
as well as a quantitative analysis how much the automation re-
ducestheireffortsbyexaminingthenumber andlengthofreview
comments.Over70%ofdevelopersaresatisfiedwithoursystem,
accordingtothe survey. Mostdevelopersagreed that CodeReview
Botis helpful for improving their code quality. Also, almost all
respondents thought code review automationcould reduce 30% of
their efforts. More than 60% of defects were fixed, as our system
motivateddevelopers to focusonimprovingcode quality.
Key contributionsare:
•We present Code ReviewBot ,anautomaticcodereview sys-
tem. It provides a unified interface and a unique user experi-
ence inthe code reviewactivity.
•CodeReviewBot isscalable,socanprovidefeedbackforeach

•CodeReview Bot supportsvarioustypesofanalyses,includ-
ingcommitsizemeasurements,typochecks,potentialdefect
detection, coding style checks, reporting unit tests, test cov-
erage measurements, and architecture metrics visualization.
•We evaluated our system qualitatively and quantitatively.

2 CHALLENGESINCODE REVIEW
AUTOMATION AT SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS
Automatingcodereviewhelpstoimproveproductivity,butadapting
automation to large-scale industries can be challenging. In this
section, we discuss the challenges associated with automating the
process,especiallywithin SamsungElectronics.
2.1 VarietyofDevelopmentEnvironments
Considering the complex environments in large organizations, it is
essentialfor code reviewautomation systemsto be designedwith
great care. We use many programming languages, two different
sourcecodemanagementsystems,andseveralreviewsystemsat
SamsungElectronics.
Variousprogramminglanguagesareusedinthecompany.39%
of developers use C/C++, 31% use Java/Kotlin, 17% use Python, 7%
use JavaScript (including TypeScript), and 4% use C# and so on. An
automation systemshould be ableto handle this variety.
We also use two kinds of source code management systems
(SCMs):GitandPerforceHelixCore.Developmentteamschoose
SCMsbasedonfactorssuchasprojectsizes,targetplatform,andbuild environments. Perforce Helix is a centralized tool with pow-
erful branch-out functionalities and versioning features suitable
for product lines in large-scale projects. On the other hand, Git is a
distributedsystemthatsupportsmoreagiledevelopmentprocesses
ratherthanPerforceHelix.
Moreover,weutilizeseveralcodereviewsystems:GitHub,Gerrit,
and Helix Swarm. Some teams use Perforce Helix as their SCM, so
they should conduct the code review using Helix Swarm. Other
teamsuseGitandGitHubfortheSCMandthecodereviewsystem,
respectively. There are also a number of teams that use Gerrit as
their review system to develop Tizen platform or Android apps,
because they are working with public open-source developers who
are familiar withthat system.
2.2 FrequentReviewRequests
In addition, the frequent request for code reviews makes it difficult
toautomatetheprocess.Especiallyforlarge-scaleindustries,perfor-
mance and rapid response are the key requirements of automation
tools[16].
InSamsungElectronics,thousandsofreviewrequestsarecreated
inadayfrommorethantenthousandprojects,andabout1.4million
lines of code are added, and one million lines are removed every
day.Themediannumberoflinesaddedandremovedis35and8,
respectively.Themeanvalueforaddedlinesis1,373withastandard
deviation of 8.70 and that for removed lines is 757 with a standard
deviation of4.75.
2.3 DiversityofProcesses
Dueto2.1and2.2,thedevelopmentprocessesvaryamongteams.
Differentprogramminglanguages require differenttoolsforstatic
analysis.Pylint,forexample,isusedforanalyzingPythoncode,and
FindBugs is used for Java. Different review systems also involve
differntContinuousIntegration(CI)tools.ToolsusedinSamsung
Electronicsandtheircharacteristics are as follows.
•Staticanalyzers Staticanalysistoolstrytofindusefulin-
formationsuchaspotentialdefectsusingonlysourcecode.
The tools are not only used by open-source projects, but
alsobymanyindustriesinpracticetovalidateandverifythe
codebaseinspiteoffalsepositives[ 3,13].Wealsouseopen-
sourcestaticanalyzers(e.g.,Cppcheck,Pylint,FindBugs,etc.)
as well as private in-house ones.
•Unit testing tools Unit tests are used to ensure that the
softwarebehavesasintended.Thetoolsforrunningunittests
andcheckingtestcoveragevarybyprogramminglanguages.
The way we show the test results for developers varies by
reviewsystemstoo.
•Architecture metrics instrument The use of software
architecture metrics is generally considered as desirable for
project management and evaluation [ 9]. We measure the
metrics with private in-house tools. The metrics provide an
overview of architectural attributes related to reliability and
maintainability.
•Open source license validator Open source license vio-
lation becomes one of the most important issues. We also
checkcompliance issueswithprivate validation tools.

•Codingstylechecker Codingstylecheckersdetectviola-
tionsofdeveloper-defined orpre-defined rules.These tools
allow projects to keep consistent aesthetics. Some tools also
suggestpatchestocomplywiththerule.Likestatictools,dif-
ferent programming languages require different style check-
ers,anddifferentreviewsystemsrequiredifferentkindsof

may analyze source code in the head commit of the pull request to
provide useful insights for reviewers. On the other hand, review

3 CODE REVIEW BOT: AUTOMATICCODE
REVIEW SYSTEM
We developed a code review automation system for Samsung Elec-
tronics,CodeReviewBot (CRB),whichhelpstocreateaunifiedcode
reviewprocessregardless ofthe toolsandsystems.
Designgoalsof Code Review Bot are as follows:
(1)(Extensibility) Oneofourmajorgoalsistomake CRBaseasy
aspossibleforqualitytooldeveloperstoservicetheirtoolsto
different review systems. This is achieved by abstracting all
the review systems used in the company as Abstract Review
System,andprovidingunifiedAPIs.
(2)(Convenience) CRB provides an accessible user interface for
developers to configure the options of the services they use.
We try to simplifying the complex configuration of all the
tools in use with a few clicks. In addition, for all review
systems,CRBgives its feedbackinaconsistent way.
(3)(Scalability) Inordertohandlethemassiverequestsforre-
view in Samsung Electronics , CRBshould be scalable. We
accomplishthisbydistributingtherequestsamongseveral
workers andprocessing eachtaskasynchronously.
3.1 OverallArchitecture
Figure1showsanoverallarchitectureof CRB.Whenadeveloper
creates a review request using a review system, the review system
triggersCRBtostart analyses.Receivingthe request, eachservice
ofCRBinspectscodechangesfromthereviewrequestandgener-
ates review comments including its analysis results. The developer
confirms comments via the review system by herself and checks
detailedinformationfrom CRB.Withthehelpof CRB,reviewersare
abletoconcentrateonunderstandingsemanticsofthecodechange
andmakereviewcommentswithoutworryofsimpleerrorssuch
as typos,potentialdefects,orcoding convention violations.
Themainfeatureof CRBisaconnectionbetweenreviewsystems
and services, each of them is located on both sides of CRBback-
end.Adaptermodule takes a role of communication between a
reviewsystemand CRB.Duringtheinformationexchange, Abstract
ReviewSystem componentabstractsconcretereviewsystemsand
encapsulatestheir detail. Abstract Review System providescommon
interfaces for every review system and lets CRBeasily extend new
kindsofsystems.
Invocation of analysis services and scheduling between ser-
vices are controlled by Distributed Task Queue Worker module. Theworker controls an execution order and aggregates analysis results.
Moreover, it is designed for parallel processing to boost up the
performance of CRB. To meet the requirement, the worker compo-
nentisimplementedwith Celeryśasimple,flexible,andreliable
distributed system for Python language [ 27]. Moreover, services
need to be activated or turned off during an operation with a small
amount of effort. Thus, we designed Pluginscomponent based on a
microservice architecture style [ 25] for scalability and extensibility.
Figure2illustratesthepluginarchitectureof CRB.Eachplugin
matches a relevant analysis service . Plugins are categorized based
on theinvocation timing , thecommunication protocol between a
plugin and a relevant service, and the execution type ś synchronous
orasynchronous .Eachcategorydefinesdefaultbehaviorssuchas
an interpretation of a request, a service invocation, and a response
generation.
Starting points of services are classified into three categories:
whenareviewrequestiscreated( 𝑆1),whenotherserviceshavebeen
finished (𝑆2), or when code fragments have been merged ( 𝑆3). End-
pointsareseparatedintotwogroups: synchronousanalysis ,waiting
forthefinishofservicesincetheanalysistimeisshortenough( 𝐸1),
orasynchronous analysis , receiving an asynchronous result from
aservice via callbacksbecause ofthelongtime-consuminganaly-
sis (𝐸2.) Based on the characteristics of services, we defined plugin
classes:RestSyncPlugin (𝑆1and𝐸1),RestAsyncPlugin (𝑆1and𝐸2),Af-
terAnalyzedPlugin (𝑆2),andAfterMergedPlugin (𝑆3).AsallAfterAna-
lyzedPlugins andAfterMergedPlugins are executed in synchronous,
wedidnotdefine AfterAnalyzedAsyncPlugin andAfterMergedAsync-
Plugin.
ConfigurationManager moduleisalsolocatedinsidethebackend.
Thecomponentmanagessettingsandconfigurationsofeachproject
and service. The configurations are managed by users via CRB
Frontend.CRBFrontend providesauserexperiencefordevelopers
to change preferences of their own projects. A developer can add a
newproject, select services tobe applied, andset in detail options
withasmall amount ofefforts.
3.2 Extensibility
Weintroducean AbstractReviewSystem toimprovetheextensibility
ofreviewsystems.EachreviewsystemhasitsownAPIswithwhich
one can retrieve information about a generalreview request, code
description, or code fragments. Moreover, writing a review com-
mentorcreationofcodechangesuggestioncanbealsoachieved
via the APIs. An abstract review system, which is located inside
CRB backend, is an abstraction of those APIs. It provides common
interfacesand bridges interfaceswith correspondingAPIs of each
reviewsystem.Forinstance,whentheabstractreviewsystemre-
ceives arequest towrite acomment, regardless of review systems,
CRBcan write a comment to the review system by using an API
of the abstract review system. CRBcan easily address new type of
reviewsystemwiththe helpof the abstract reviewsystem.
Nevertheless,somevariationpointsinreviewsystemstillremain.
For instance, rendering comments containing HTML or markdown
maybeunavailableforsomereviewsystemssuchasGerrit.GitHub
providesanAPItoretrievethelistofreviewersbutHelixSwarm
does not. It is important for the abstract review system to judge

3.3 Convenience

easily configure the optionsofthe services withafewclicks.
InAddition, CRBreturnseachfeedbackinaconsistentwayto
eachreviewsystem.Dependingonthesortoffeedback,analyses
services are as follows:
•Inlinecommentservices Feedbackofsomeservicesare
delivered as inline comments. These services include Po-
tential Defects service,Typoservice, and Open-Source
Validation . Defects detected by each tool are listed, and
CRBindicates each line in which a defect has been found.Developers are able to identify problems and fix them more
quickly with the aid of CRB. Project managers can easily
turnonandoffeachservicethemselvesandsetconfiguration
withlittledifficulty.
•Summarycommentservices TheReviewability service
measureschangemetrics(e.g.thenumberofchangedfiles
orlines,etc.)andprovidesthemtoreviewers. TestCover-
ageservice and Architecture Maturity service both run
unit testing and code metrics measurements and provide
information regarding overall code quality to developers.
It is unfortunate that dynamic and static analysis for the
measurementrequiresmoreeffortfromtheprojectmanager
duringtheconfiguration. CRBlessensthehumaneffortby
providing 1) utility functionality for gathering test results
andtransformingthemintoaunifiedformatformainstream
test frameworks and 2) pre-defined containers that can be
usedfor running the metric measurements.
•Codesuggestionservices Therearesomeservicesthatsug-
gest code changes to resolve certain issues. Coding Style
servicechecksstyleviolations,andsometimescreatesare-
view request to fix those violations. The reason for this is
that many coding style tools reconstruct the entire target
file to comply their style, so inline comment feedback is not
always sufficient for resolving violations. Typoservice also
creates a code fix suggestion and helps developers easily
correctmisspells.
•CI-basedservices Someservicesrequireexecutionenviron-
ments to get their results, which means they need build sys-
tems orContinuousIntegrationsystems.These servicesin-
cludePotentialDefects ,ArchitectureMaturity ,andTest
Coverage services. They uses Docker, Jenkins or GitHub
Actions to build or test the submitted codes. Some divisions
made their own build systems, so CRBtriggers to start by
using the systems. Or, other divisions use CI systems which
are triggered by review systems directly such as GitHub Ac-
tions.Atthattime, CRBdoesnotbehaveanything,butwaits
the results ofCIsystems.

3.4 Scalability
One of the most painful points in applying a review automation
system to a large-scale industry is the performance problem by the
lack of scalability. A large-scale project sometimes consumes huge
amount of resources in analyses and execution time explosion may
burden developers. We applied a microservice architecture style to
CRBtoovercomethelimitation.Themicroservicearchitectureis
knownas agoodsolution for ascalablesystem[ 12].
Each services are deployed in physically separated nodes and
communicate with relevant plugins via HTTP protocol. Param-
eters and environments are shared via Redis[17], a distributed
in-memorydatabaseandainvocationschedulingis performedby
Celery[27], a distributed task queue. Each service operation is
processedindependently inparallel.
Deployment based on microservices achieves high level of scala-
bilityinaserviceexpansion.Separationofservicesfromtheplat-
form(i.e. CRBbackend)makesthescalingoutandupinconvenient
way andCRBsuccessfully adapted into Samsung Electronics with-
outperformance problems.
3.5 Status ofUsage
CRBhas been applied in Samsung Electronics for about two years
from2019.Morethaneightthousandreviewrequestsfrom6,439
projectshavebeencreatedduringtheperiodand2.7millionservice
executions happened. As the registration date of each project is
different, to compare the portion of review systems and frequently
executed services, we choose a single month (August 2021) and
calculatedthe statistics.

and Wessel et al. found that developers are also willing to get code
review metrics and additional information such as analysis results
(without having to go to another tool) followed by reducing main-
tenanceeffortfrom acode reviewautomation tool[ 30].
Respondentsexpectedseveralbenefitsfrom CRB(𝑄5)aslisted
inFigure 5. We can see that similar results have been shown with
priorstudies,and CRBcoversmanypartsofdevelopers’expecta-
tions.Finally,developerschoosethemostusefulservices( 𝑄6)inthe
followingorder: PotentialDefects ,Typo,CodingStyle ,Architecture
Maturity, andTest Coverage . Responses indicate that developers
and reviewers are satisfied with code review automation in quality
assurances andmaintainability.
RQ1. More than 70% developers are satisfying with CRBes-
pecially in the context of code quality improvement. Most
of them feel that about 30% of code review effort may be
reducedwiththe helpofcode reviewautomation.
4.4 Motivating Quality Improvementby
Automation
RegardingRQ2,weperformeda quantitativeanalysis oncodefixes
related to defects and alarms found by CRB. By answering about
thequestion,whether developersaremotivatedbyautomationor
not, we maysee the attractioneffectof CRB.

31.12% and the rate from Gerrit is 22 .78%. On the other hand, fix
rate from GitHub is only 5 .51% ś 793 requests over 14,384 requests
contain typosdetectedby CRB.

again because fixing the alarms are easy, clear, and there will be
littlepossibilityofintroducingsideeffects.However,sincepotential
defectsdetectedbyacertainstaticanalysistool,developersareused
to explicitly run CRBagain to confirmthe result from the tool.
To complement the difference among review systems and ser-
vices, we filtered out analysis results when CRBwere executed just
onceinareviewrequest.Found†andFixrate†ofTable3indicate
the adjusted total number of typo and the adjusted fix rate, respec-
tively. Adjusted fix rate of GitHub is 72 .62% but adjusted fix rate of
the other review systems are lower than GitHub. For all the review
systems, we found that at least half of typo-detected requests were
fixed.

RQ2. Developers are strongly motivated to improve code
quality from CRB. More than 60% defects andwarnings are
immediately fixedbydevelopers.
4.5 EncouragingReviewers
To investigate RQ3, we collected two kinds of data ś 1) average
counts of code review comments by the weekly and 2) average

RQ3. We can not say that CRBreduces code review effort
dramatically.Some development divisionshows significant
differences in the code review size but the others do not.
Reviewers usually tend to affect by the policies and develop-
ment release cycle of their development division more than
the automation.
5 DISCUSSION AND THREATS TO VALIDITY
Although CRBprovides unified interfaces for numerous review
systems, variancesinrendering review commentsbyeachreview
system are still remain. Reviewers might be more attracted by a
prettywrittenreviewcommentwithMarkdownorHTMLmarkups.
ReactivenessfromGitHubmaybehigherthanotherreviewsystems
becausetheyonlyallowaplaintextorasimplemarkup.Itwould
beaninterestingresearchtopiconwhatkindsofdifferencesamong

Thereisaninternalvalidityinmeasuringthequalityimprove-
ment motivation by CRBat section 4.4. In this study, we compared
thechangeofdetecteddefectcountsafterapplying CRBtoshow
howeffectively CRBattracteddevelopers,butdevelopersofsome
projects already use several kinds of static analysis tools them-
selves. Thus, the evaluation results may not reflect the direct effect
ofCRBintheviewofqualityassurance.Differentenvironmentsand
buildsystemsofeachprojectsmakeobstaclestoinvestigatehow
many developers start to use code analysis tools newly, not CRB.
Nevertheless, we still believe that CRBsuccessfully attracts quality
improvement of source code because the convenience of CRBobvi-

of the architecture, it is not easy to directly apply CRBto open

6 RELATED WORK
Static analysis is an efficient method to find out defects, and apply-
ing static analyzers in review automation is effective to improve
productivity. Singh et al. showed that about 16% of code review
comments can be covered by static analysis tool [ 26]. From the
caseofGoogle,Sadowskietal.provedthatprovidingstaticanalysis
results to developers in the code review phase is better than the
testphasebecausedevelopersarenotwillingtomodifymatured
code after testing and release [ 21]. Facebook also applies a static
analysisInferin the review process [ 8]. Developers on Facebook
were opened to fix the alarms and 70% of them were solved [ 10].
Static analyses are essential for code review automation, and Code
Review Bot has been foundedonstaticanalyses.
Code review automation, named a Bot, is also widely adopted in
open source communities [ 29]. Balachandran suggested ReviewBot ,
a review automation system based on static analyses, and success-
fullyshowedthefeasibilityofadaptingtotherealworld[ 5,6].In
this study, we developed Code Review Bot that provides several
services based on the static analysis, testing, and fix suggestions
andfoundits usefulnessinthe industrialarea.
Googleimplemented Tricoder,anovelsourcecodeanalysisframe-
work [23] and melted it into their workflow [ 23]. Microsoft also
combines several quality assurance tools into a framework and
performsanalysiswith CodeFlow [7].Rosie[19]isafullyautomated
review assistant that traverses whole repositories by itself and
cleansupthecodebaseandfixesdefectsautomaticallyinGoogle.
Code Review Bot takes a role of quality assurance automation in
SamsungElectronicsbasedondevelopers’ reviewrequests.
Defect prediction is one of the most important next research
topics ofCode Review Bot .JITBot[15] successfully showed the fea-
sibilityofjust-in-timedefectprediction[ 14]inpracticebyadapting
into GitHub. One of the most interesting and impressive contri-
butions of JITBotis providing reasons to users with the help of

7 CONCLUSION
We introduced a unified code review automation system, Code
Review Bot . We have achieved extensibility and scalability for intri-
cate,various,anddiversedevelopmentenvironmentsinSamsung
Electronics by using our abstract review system. We have been
operating the system over two years for more than 10,000 projects,
andsharedsomelessons learned.
We investigated both quantitative and qualitative analyses on
satisfaction,usage,andeffectiveness.Mostofthe developerswere
satisfiedwith CodeReviewBot .Qualityassuranceserviceswerethe
mosthelpfulone,anddevelopersrapidlyandactivelyrespondedto
more than60% ofreviews.
Webelievethatthecodereviewautomationhelpsnotonlyforthe
quality of source code, but also for the rapid and worthwhile code
review activities of reviewers. We plan to study on the correlation
amongservices,reviewsystems,andusersreactions.Wehopeto
