ABSTRACT
WithDeepNeuralNetwork(DNN)beingintegratedintoagrowing
number of critical systems with far-reaching impacts on society,
there are increasing concerns on their ethical performance, suchas fairness. Unfortunately, model fairness and accuracy in manycases are contradictory goals to optimize during model training.
To solve this issue, there has been a number of works trying to
improvemodel fairnessby formalizingan adversarialgame inthe
model level. This approach introduces an adversary that evaluates
the fairness of a model besides its prediction accuracy on the main
task, and performs joint-optimization to achieve a balanced result.
In this paper, we noticed that when performing backward prop-agationbasedtraining,suchcontradictoryphenomenonarealso
observableonindividualneuronlevel.Basedonthisobservation,
wepropose FairNeuron ,aDNNmodelautomaticrepairingtool,
to mitigate fairness concerns and balance the accuracy-fairness
trade-offwithoutintroducinganothermodel.Itworksondetecting
neurons with contradictory optimization directions from accuracy
andfairnesstraininggoals,andachievingatrade-offbyselective
dropout.Comparingwithstate-of-the-artmethods,ourapproach
is lightweight, scaling to large models and more efficient. Our eval-
uation on three datasets shows that FairNeuron can effectively
improve all models’ fairness while maintaining a stable utility.

Deepneuralnetworks(DNNs)aregraduallyadoptedinawiderange
of applications, including image recognition [ 37], self-driving [ 19],
andnaturallanguageprocessing[ 38,39].Oneofthemosttrendy
applications is decision-making systems, which requires a high
utility DNN with fairness. As examples, artificial intelligent (AI)judge [
8] or human resource (HR) [ 9] try to judge who should
get a loan or interview. These systems should provide objective,
supposedly consistentdecision basedon the givendata, although
thereareoftensocietalbiasinthesedata[ 59].Wewishthesesys-
temscouldcounteractunfairdecisionmadebyhumans,butthey
still exhibit unfair behavior which affects individuals belonging to
specific social subgroups. The COMPAS system is an example. It
predictsrecidivismofpretrialoffenders[ 23],andcontinuestomake
decisions that favor Caucasians compared to African-Americans.Such bias has made very negative societal impacts. Therefore, itis crucial to have systematical methods for automatically fixing
fairness problems in a given DNN model.
Intuitively, fairness problems happen when a model tends to
make different decision for different instances which only differ-
entiated by some sensitive attributes, such as age, race and gender.
Dependingonspecifictasks,theprotectedorsensitiveattributes
can vary. Similarly, there are different fairness notations defined
in existing DNN literature, e.g., group fairness [ 28], individual fair-
ness [26], and max-min fairness [ 36,45]. According to existing
study [23,43], thesefairness definitions arecorrelated with each
other.Inpractice,weusuallyconsiderafewrepresentativeones,i.e.,demographicparity,demographicparityrateandequalopportunity.
In this paper, we also consider these.
Existing DNN training frameworks, e.g., TensorFlow and Py-
Torch [10,52], have provided no support for fairness problems

lems [47,48,72]. There are existing fairness fixing frameworks,

to solve. Moreover, such methods usually require using a more
complex model training protocol, which is heavyweight.
We observe that the essential challenge of fixing model fairness

fairness problems. It works by first identify conflict paths with a
neural network slicing technique. Conflict paths refer to the paths
thatcontainalotofneuronsthatselectsensitiveattributestomake
predictions rather than distinguishable ones. Then, we leverage
such paths to cluster samples by measuring if they can trigger the
selection of sensitive attributes. Lastly, we retrain the model by

2 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
2.1 Fairness
Depending on concrete task specifications, fairness can have dif-
ferent notations [ 21]. These notions can be categorized into two
groups:individualfairness[ 26,67],whichmeasuresif individuals
inthedatasetistreatedequallybythelearnedmodel;andgroupfairness [
28,35], which concerns about whether subpopulation
with different sensitive attributes are treated equally. For example,
foranonlineshoppingrecommendationsystem,allcustomersin
thedatasetshouldbetreatedequally,whichasksforindividualfair-
ness.ForanAIpoweredhiringsystem,applicantswithsensitive
attributes (e.g., different genders) should be treated equally, which
is a typical case of group fairness.
Beforediscussingdifferentfairnessnotations,wefirstdefinea
set of notations. We denote the sensitive attribute as 𝑆and other
observable insensitive attributes as 𝐴. We assume that the subpop-
ulationwith 𝑆=1isthedisadvantagedgroup,andtheprivileged
group is the subpopulation with 𝑆=0. Also, we represent the true
label as 𝑌, and the predicted output, i.e., positive/negative as ˆ𝑌
which is a random variable depending on attributes 𝑆and𝐴.ˆ𝑌=1
andˆ𝑌=0 are the positive and negative outcomes, respectively.
Followingsuchnotations,wecandefinecommonlyuseddifferent
fairness notations as follows:
Demographicparity(DP) .Demographicparity,orstatisticalpar-
ity,isoneoftheearliestdefinitionsoffairness[ 26].Itviewsfairness
as different subpopulations (i.e., 𝑆=0 and 𝑆=0) should have an
equal probability of being classified to the positive label. Formally,
demographic parity measures the probability differences between
different groups:
𝐷𝑃=/barex/barex𝑃(ˆ𝑌=1|𝑆=0)−𝑃(ˆ𝑌=1|𝑆=1)/barex/barex(1)
In an ideal case, we say that a model is when 𝐷𝑃=0, which
indicates that the prediction output ˆ𝑌and sensitive attribute 𝑆are
statisticallyindependent.Ifso,theoutputisnotaffectedbythesen-
sitive attribute, and hence the model is not biased towards certain
valuesof thesensitive attributeshowing fairnessinprediction. In
practice, 𝐷𝑃=0ishardtogetandweviewamodelasfairwhen
𝐷𝑃≤𝜖where 𝜖is a threshold value that is determined by real
world tasks and requirements.

Demographicparity ratio (DPR) .Demographicparityratio,or
disparateimpact,issimilartodemographicparity.Thekeydiffer-
ence is that it represents the equality or similarly of prediction on
different groups as a ratio (instead of a substitution). Formally, it is
defined as:
𝐷𝑃𝑅=𝑃(ˆ𝑌=1|𝑆=1)
𝑃(ˆ𝑌=1|𝑆=0)(2)
Likedemographicparity, 𝐷𝑃𝑅=1indicatesafairmodelinthe
ideal case, and in practice, we say a model is fair when 𝐷𝑃𝑅≥𝜏
where 𝜏isthefairnessthreshold. Moreover,italsofocuseson the
probability of different groups being classified to the positive label.
ThekeydifferenceisthatDPRmeasuresthedifferencesinaratio.
This is because its origins are in legal fairness considerations for
selectionprocedureswhichtheParetoprinciple,a.k.a.,the80%rule,
iscommonlyused[ 28].Tomakeadirectcomparisonwith80%,DPR
calculated the ratio instead of substitution.
Equalopportunity(EO) .AlimitationofDPandDPRisthatthey
donotconsiderpotentialdifferencesincomparedsubgroups.Equal
opportunity(EO)overcomesthisbymakinguseoftheFPR(false
positive rate) and TPR (true positive rate) between subgroups [ 35].
Formally, EO is defined as:
𝐸𝑂=/barex/barex𝑃(ˆ𝑌=1|𝑆=0,𝑌=1)−𝑃(ˆ𝑌=1|𝑆=1,𝑌=1)/barex/barex(3)
A model achieves EO fairness when 𝐸𝑂=0, namely, the pre-
diction is (conditional) independent of the sensitive attribute 𝑆.I n
practice, we say an model is EO fair when 𝐸𝑂≤𝜈and here, 𝜈is
the fairness threshold value.
Besidesthesediscussednotions,therearemanyotherfairness
definitions,suchasfairnessthroughunawareness(FTU)[ 44],dis-
parate treatment[ 15], disparatemistreatment [ 65], counterfactual
fairness[44],ex-antefairnessandex-postfairness[ 29],etc.Friedler
et al. [30] compareddifferent notations and measuredtheir correla-
tionsontheRicciandAdultdatasets.Resultsshowthatdifferent
notationshavestrongcorrelationswitheachother.Asaresult,most
work usually pick a few representative ones. Following existing
related work, we choose three most common notations, i.e., DP,
DPR [26], and EO [35] in our study.
2.2 Improving DNN Fairness
Many machine learning algorithms including DNNs suffer from
the bias problem. Namely, the model can make a decision based
on wrong attributes. For example, a biased hiring AI may make ad-
missions based on applicants’ gender information. Such issues can
be caused by the biased training data or the algorithm itself. DNN
hasshowntobeabiasedalgorithm,andpotentiallytrainedDNN
models can make unfair predictions despite its high accuracy. This
canleadtosevereproblemsespeciallywhenDNNsarebecoming
more and more popular including applications like AI judge [ 8],
AIbasedauthentication,AIHR[ 9],etc.Forexample,COMPAS,a
popular system that predicts the risk of recidivism, claimed that
“black people re-offend more” [ 3]; the first beauty contest robot,
Beauty.AI[ 2],“founddarkskinunattractive”[ 7];andtheMicrosoft
chatbot Tay became a racist and sex-crazed neo-Nazi [ 4]. Biased
AIs in such systems can lead to severe ethical concerns, potentially
threatening our daily life and economy. As a response to this issue,existingworkhasproposedmethodstoimproveDNNfairnessby
removing such bias.
FAD.Adeletal.[ 11]proposedafairadversarialframeworkFAD,
which leverages gradient reversal [ 31] (which acts as an identity
function during forward propagation and multiplies its input by
-1 during back propagation) to fix model fairness problems. The
authors introduced an adversarial network to encode fairness into
themodel:apredictornetwork F𝑃andanadversarynetwork F𝐴.
The goal of the predictor is to maximize accuracy in ˆ𝑌while the
adversarynetworktriestomaximizefairnessinprotectedattribute
𝑆. For fairness fixing, we need a new model architecture which
can: (i) predict the true label 𝑌, and (ii) not be able to predict the
sensitive attribute 𝑆:
𝐿F𝑃=𝐿𝐶𝐸−𝛼𝐿F𝐴(4)
where 𝐿F𝑃,𝐿𝐶𝐸,𝐿F𝐴denote the predictor loss, predictor logistic
loss (a.k.a., CE loss) and the adversary logistic loss, respectively.
The hyperparameter 𝛼regulates the accuracy-fairness trade off.
After that, it uses a post-training process to align TP (true positive)
and FP (false positive) across all classes by adjusting class-specific
thresholdvaluesoflogitswithaROCanalysisintroducedbyHardt
et al. [35].Ethical Adversaries
. Delobelle et al. [ 25] proposed the ethical ad-
versaries framework to solve the fairness problem. The framework
hastwoparties,theexternaladversary,a.k.a.,thefeeder,andthe
reader, which represents the protected attribute 𝑆. It is an iterative
trainingprocedures,duringwhicheachpartyinteractswitheach
other. The readeris trained with thetarget label atthe same time,
and each time, it evaluates if the training has bias or not. If so, it
propagatestherelatedgradientbacktothenetwork.Thefeedercan

find adversarial examples that can be used in the adversarial train-
ing.Duringthisadversarialtraining,thetargetlabel(i.e.,maintask
ofthemodel)andthefairnessgoalisadjustedbyahyperparameter
𝜆, which is similar to the FAD framework.
Pre-/Post-processingMethods .FADandEthicalAdversariesare
online methods which solves the fairness issue during training.
There are other methods that leverages pre-processing or post-
processing to solve this problem, e.g., reweighing [ 41], and re-
ject optionclassification (ROC[42]). Reweighing assignsdifferent
weights to input samples in different group to make the dataset
discrimination-free(pre-processing).ROCgivesfavorableoutcomes
to unprivileged groups and unfavorable outcomes to privilegedgroups in a confidence band around the decision boundary with
the highest uncertainty (post-processing).
2.3 Motivation and Basic Idea
Limitations of existing work. Existing work has a few limita-
tions. Firstly, they introduce another model as the adversary in the
trainingprocedure.Inheritingfromexistingadversarialnetworks,
training such models is not easy. Problems like mode collapse [ 22],
failingtoconverge[ 50],andvanishinggradientsarequitecommon
in such a model structure. This will require extra efforts in solv-ing such problems. Secondly, there is no guarantee that trainingsuch adversary networks willalways converge fornow. There is
atheoretical guaranteethatGAN (generativeadversarynetwork)

equilibrium [ 33]. However, FAD and Ethical Adversaries empiri-
callyobservethatmodelaccuracyandfairnessmayconflictwith
each other in some cases and may not conflict with each other
in other cases. On one hand, this shows that there exist models
that are both accurate and fair. On the other hand, it also indicates
thatthedesignedadversarytrainingisnotazero-sumgame,and
there is no guarantee to show the existence of Nash equilibrium
in thisgame. Asa result,existing workcan failto convergewhen

fairnessproblemshasnotbeenmitigatedfromtheseperspectives.
Elazar and Goldberg made an empirical observation on leakage of
protectedattributesforneuralnetworkstrainedontextdata,which
can also demonstrate this conclusion [27].
WhybiashappensinaDNNtraining? Based on existing litera-
tures and our experiences, we make a few key observations that
are important for us to develop our method.
Observation I:Optimizing accuracy anddifferentfairnessobjectives
canbecontradictory toeachother,butnotalways.Existingwork[ 11,
25]hasshownthataccuracyanddifferentfairnessgoals(e.g.,DP,
DPR and EO), including different fairness goals themselves, can be

todirectionswithhigherfairness.Thegoodnewsisthatexisting

importance is represneted by weights in the DNN.
Now, we can use our observations to explain why bias happens
in training a deep neural network. When training a DNN, the opti-
mizertriestopickimportantfeaturesbasedongradientinformation.
When updating individual neurons, it may encounter cases where
the fairness and accuracy optimization subjects are pointing to
differentdirections.Ifitonlyconsidersaccuracyasitstraininggoal,
it will select the direction that optimizes the accuracy the most
which can lead to low fairness. Furthermore, we know that the
gradient information is calculated based on given samples. If we
are able to detect such samples, we can potentially fix the problem
by enforcing the optimizer to pick the correct set of features.Ouridea. Basedonourobservations,wearguethatitisnotneces-
sarytointroduceanadversarythatdetectsthepotentialconflictsof
optimizing the accuracy and fairness. Instead, we first monitor the
training process to detect neurons whose accuracy and fairness op-
timization get conflicts with each other. Then, we identify samples
that causes such contradictory optimizations. Lastly, we enforce
the optimizer to decide a balanced optimal direction that optimizes
both accuracy and fairness. By doing so, we remove the need of
introducinganadversary.Itsimplifiesthetrainingprocedureand
is more lightweight compared with existing solutions.

3.1 Overview
Workflow. Figure1presentstheworkflowof FairNeuron .Ittakes
abiasedmodel anditstrainingdata asinputs,andoutputsa fixed
model.Firstly, FairNeuron performs neuralnetworkslicing,which
detects neurons and paths that have contradictory optimization
directions.NoticethatbecauseofthedenseconnectionsofDNN,
suchneuronsaretypicallyconnectedwitheach,passingthebiased
features from one layer to the next. As such, we do this in the path
granularity. In this step, we leverage a neuron slicing technique
whichperformsadifferentialanalysistoidentifythetargetpaths.
Next, we leverage such paths to identify the samples that cause
such effects, known as the sample clustering. After this step, we
canseparatethesamplesintotwoclusters,biaseddatasamplesand
benignsamples.Lastly,weperform selectiveretraining toenforce
the model to learn unbiased features. Essentially, for samples in
differentclusters,wehavedifferenttrainingstrategies.Forsamples
in the benign data cluster, we do not change anything, while for
samples in the biased cluster, we enforce detected neurons to con-
sideralargersetoffeaturesandweighthemtolearn allfeatures
that are important for prediction rather than the biased ones.
Algorithm. The overall algorithm of FairNeuron is presented
inAlgorithm1,denotedasProcedure FairNeuron .Asmentioned
before, it takes a biased model BiasedModel and training dataset
TrainDataset as inputs, and outputs a fixed model, referred to as
NewModel in the algorithm. In the main algorithm, FairNeuron
analyze the relationship between dataset and model by gettingactivation paths of each input sample (line 1-5). After acquiring

Figure 1: Overview of FairNeuron.
First,FairNeuron getstheaveragebehaviorofaneuron,bylever-
aging its activation values. The behavior of a neuron can be repre-
sented in many ways, and in FairNeuron , we use the most simple
andnaiverepresentation,itsaveragedactivationvalue.Specifically,
FairNeuron calculatestheaverageactivationvaluesoftheneuron
for a given dataset, which is usually the training dataset.
Then,FairNeuron performsa forwardanalysis tounderstand
the diversity of a neuron behavior. Similar to the first step, we also
use the activation values of a neuron to represent the behavior
oftheneuron.Inthisstep,wefeedindividualinputstotheDNN,
and record the activation value differences between the average
activation and the value for this concrete input. By doing so, we
canestimatethecontributionsofeachneurontotheoutputfora
given sample. This helps us to identify neurons that contain biased
features.
Afterwards,weobtainpathsthatcontainbiasedfeatures.Notice
that a DNN is a highly connected network, and as a layered struc-
ture, behaviors of a single layer will be passed to the next layer.
Becauseofthis,biasedfeatureswillbeaccumulatedinthisnetwork,
and asa result,neurons inthe last fewlayers willcontribute alot
tothebiasedprediction.Ontheotherhand,theseneuronsdonot
denote the root cause of such bias. To completely fix the neuron
network,itisimportanttoidentifythewholechainofsuchprop-
agation. So we comprehensively consider neurons and synapses
andcalculatetheircontributions,andbacktrackthesecontributions
in the network. We show the detail of this phase in the proce-dureGetActivationPath in Algorithm 1. Starting from the output
neuron,weiterativelycomputethecontributionsoftheprevious
neurons (line 19-22), which is similar to the backward propagation.
Then,wesortthemindescendingorder(line23),andaddthekey
synapses and corresponding neurons into the path set (line 24-29).
Todetermineifasynapseisakeysynapseornot,weneedtocalcu-
late whether the sum of all the synapses that are connected to the
samesuccessorneuronisstilllessthanthethreshold.Thethreshold
isdeterminedbytheactivationvalueofsubsequentneuronsand
the hyperparameter 𝛾.
Lastly, we identify conflict paths, namely paths that contain fea-
tures causing the biased prediction. Based on our observations, weknowthatwhenmakingpredictions,themodelusesthebenignfea-
ture set to make predictions for benign samples and use the biased
feature set to make predictions for biased samples. Consideringthat a neuron represents a set of features, we know that biasedsamples are activating neurons/paths that are different from theothers. Notice that biased paths/neurons takes a relatively small
portion of the whole neural network. Otherwise, the network will
makepredictionsonalotofbiasedfeatures,leadingtolowaccuracy.
Based on this intuition, we obtain such conflict paths by analyzing
the frequencyof the activatedpaths. More specifically,weset the
activationfrequencyofthemostfrequentlyactivatedpathasthe
standard, and compare the activation frequency of each path with
it. If the activation frequency of a certain path is less than a cer-tain percentage of the standard (determined by
𝜃), then it can be
considered as a conflict path.
Example. Assume the biased model is a simple neural network
showninFigure2.Theweightvalueshavebeenlabeledonthecor-respondingsynapsesinFigure2(a).Firstweperformpathprofiling,
and the results are set to 0 for simplicity. Then we feed a sample
(3,1)intothemodel,andcalculateitsrelativeactivationvalueon
eachneuron.Takethetopneuronofthesecondlayerasanexample,
its relative activation value is 3 ×2+1×(−1)−0=5, as shown
inFigure2(c).Finallywebacktrackthecontributionsofsynapses

As shown in Algorithm 1, 𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝐿𝑖𝑠𝑡 is a list which contains each

memoryand1NVIDIATITANVGPUrunningtheUbuntu16.04
operating system.
4.1.2 Datasets. Weevaluatedourmethodonthreepopulardatasets:
the UCI Adult Census, COMPAS, and German Credit.
•UCI Adult Census. The UCI Adult Census was extracted
from the 1994 Census bureau database, gathering 32,561
instancesrepresentedby9featuressuchasage,education
and occupation. The gender is considered as the sensitive
attribute.
•COMPAS. The COMPAS system is a popular commercial
algorithmusedbyjudgesforpredictingtheriskofrecidivism,
and the COMPAS dataset is a sample outcome from the
COMPASsystem.Theraceofeachdefendantisthesensitive

•German Credit. This is a small dataset with 600 records
and20attributes.Theoriginalaimofthedatasetistogive
anassessmentofindividual’screditbasedonpersonaland

4.1.3 Models. Inourexperiment,webuiltafully-connectedneural
network with three hidden layers for each dataset respectively. For
theCOMPASandtheGerman Creditdataset,eachhiddenlayeris
composedof32neurons,whilefortheUCIAdultCensusdataset,
each hidden layer is composed of 128 neurons due to its larger
encodedinput.Thedetailsofthemodelsusedintheexperiments
are shown in Table 1.
We use the softmax activation function for Census and German
Credit to achieve binary classification, and the linear activation
functionforCOMPAStogetrecidivismscores.Werandomlysep-
arate the dataset into the training, validation, and test sets, by a
ratio of 7:1:2, respectively. The neural network is trained by the
Adam optimizer with 𝛽1=0.9,𝛽2=0.9999, and initial learning
rate𝑙𝑟=0.01, which is scheduled by a factor of 0.1 when reaching
a plateau.
4.1.4 Hyperparametertuning. Toobtainthesuitablehyperparam-
eters 𝜃and𝛾, we run a parallel grid search for hyperparameters
to optimize training loss function. We sample 𝜃between the in-
terval[10−4,1]proportionally, and sample 𝛾between the interval
[0.5,1].Followingthestandardpracticeinmachinelearning,the
gridsearchisperformedonasmallsubsetdrawnfromthetraining

4.1.5 Metrics and baseline methods. We compare our algorithm
with other popular in-processing state-of the-art fixing algorithms,
such as FAD [ 11] and Ethical Adversaries [ 25]. Besides, we also
comparedwiththerepresentativealgorithmsoftheothertwokinds
of fixing algorithms, reweighing in pre-processing [ 41] and Reject
Option Classification in post-processing [42].
We aim to answer the following research questions through our
experiments:
RQ1: How effective is our algorithm in fixing bias model?RQ2: How efficient is our algorithm in fixing bias model?RQ3: How parameters affect model performance?RQ4: How our algorithm perform in image datasets?
4.2 Effectiveness of FairNeuron
ExperimentDesign: Toevaluatetheeffectivenessof FairNeuron ,
wetestthefollowingmodels:thenaivebaselinemodel,modelsfixed
by FAD, by Ethical Adversaries, and by FairNeuron . Due to the
randomness in these experiments, we ran the training 10 times to
ensurethereliabilityofresultsandenforcedthesefixingalgorithms
tosharethesameoriginaltrainingdataset.Tomeasuretheeffec-tiveness of
FairNeuron , we compare the performance between
FairNeuron and the other algorithms in terms of both utility and
fairness. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the three components
ofFairNeuron (i.e. neural network slicing, sample clustering and
selectivetraining),weconductedadetailedcomparisonbetween
our algorithm and other popular works.Results:
The details of the comparison results are presented in
Table4.Thefirstcolumnliststhethreedatasets.Thesecondcolumn
shows the different algorithm. The third column lists the utility,and the remaining columns list the fairness criteria. The model
utilitiesareevaluatedbybinaryclassificationaccuracy(Acc),and
thefairnessperformancearemeasuredbydemographicparity(DP),
demographicparityratio(DPR),andEqualopportunity(EO).The
best results are shown in bold.
Analysis: The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our algorithm. Firstly, FairNeuron can effectively fix the fair-
ness bias of all models trained on different datasets. Secondly,
FairNeuron achieves the highest utility among all models with
fairness constraints, and even surpasses the naive model on COM-
PAS and Credit.
Table4showsthefairnessimprovementofnaivemodelsonCen-
sus,CreditandCOMPAS,respectively. FairNeuron improvesDPR
by 98.47%, 157.23%, and 3895.23%, mitigates fairness problem by
69.69%,21.12%and38.95%intermsofEO,and74.68%,2.08%,96.19%
in terms of DP. Compared with the other algorithms, FairNeuron
achieves the best fairness performance on Census and COMPAS.However, the EO and DP results of
FairNeuron on Credit is not
satisfactory.Afterourcarefulanalysis,wefoundthatourneuron
network slicing is not fully functional since Credit only has 600
instances.Thus,howtoimprovetheutilityofmodelstrainingon
such small datasets will be one of our future works.
Besides,Table4demonstratesthat FairNeuron haslittleimpact
on model utility after a successful fairness fixing, and even has
theadvantageofincreasingaccuracybyfixingfairnessproblems.

evensurpassesthenaivemodelontheGermanCreditandCOMPASdatasets.Thedetailedaverageaccuracychangeis-0.83%,1.36%,and
28.66%. We found that it is mainly because FairNeuron improves
the utility by mitigating the overfitting problem in model training
procedures, and the size of Census dataset is relatively large, so its
overfitting problem is unobvious.
In summary, FairNeuron can effectively fix the bias training
procedures, and has little impact on the model utility while im-
proving the fairness performance significantly. Then we prove the
effectiveness of each step in FairNeuron separately.
4.2.1 Effectiveness of neuron network slicing. Figure 4 shows a
example of the distribution of abnormal paths. Here, the maximum
of path activation statistics is 47, and we assume 𝜃=0.03, so the
threshold is 1.41,as the green lineshows. We can seethat most of
non-zero paths are concentrated near 1, but the proportion of their
correspondingsamplesisnothigh.Thesepathsaretheabnormal
paths detected by our approach.
Figure 4: Result of neuron network slicing. The blue step line
presents the probability density function of path activation statis-tics,theredlinepresentstheaccumulationofsampleratio,andthegreen line presents the threshold.
4.2.2 Effectivenessof sampleclustering. Todemonstrate theeffec-
tiveness of sample clustering, we compare the fixing performance
betweenoursampleseparationandtherandomclusteringmethods.
We set the number of randomly-obtained abnormal samples to be
the same as that of FairNeuron.
Table 2 reports the performance of different clustering methods.
With our method, the average accuracy is improved by 6.68%, and
the fairness performance has also been greatly improved, which
are 96.19%, 97.67% and 38.95% of DP, DPR and EO, respectively.

4.2.3 Effectiveness of selective training. To show the effectiveness
ofselectivetraining,weprovideacomparisonamongpuredropout,
pure ordinary and selective training.
Table 3 presents the results of different training approaches.
Selectivetrainingsurpassestheordinarytrainingby38.96%,98.22%,
97.43% and 91.50%, while surpassing the pure dropout trainingby 22.27%, 96.19%, 97.55% and 38.95% in Acc, DP, DPR and EO,
respectively. It confirms that the selective training in FairNeuron
can achieve high accuracy and fairness.
4.3 Efficiency of FairNeuron
Experiment Design: To evaluate the efficiency of FairNeuron ,
we measured the time usage of ordinary training, Ethical Adver-
sariesand FairNeuron trainingonallthreedatasets.Weperformed
10trialswhichusesrandomtraining/testdatasplitting,naivemodel
training,hyperparametertuningandmodelrepairing(forEthical
Adversariesand FairNeuron )andcomputedtheaverageoverhead
toavoidrandomness.Table5presentshowmuchtimeittakesto
complete its fixing for each method. For Ethical Adversaries, it
shows the time for per iteration in 50 iterations. For FairNeuron ,
it shows the time usage per trial. We also recorded the time usage
of each step in FairNeuron . Results and analysis are presented
below.Table 5: Time to train a model.

Results: Table 5 shows the comparison of time usage among ordi-
narytraining,EthicalAdversariesand FairNeuron training.The
firstcolumnliststhethreedatasetsandtheremainingcolumnsshowthedifferenttrainingmethods.Onaverage,
FairNeuron takes5.39
times of ordinary training and 55.49% of Ethical Adversaries.
Table 6 reports the time costs of each step. The first column also

Analysis: Forordinarytraining,theruntimeoverheadallcomes
fromthetrainingprocedure,butfor FairNeuron ,thehyperparam-
eterstuningaccountsforalargerratioofthetotaltimeusage,as
showninTable6.So FairNeuron takesonlylessthantwiceofthe
timeusageofordinarytrainingonlargedatasetslikeCensus,but
on small datasets like the German Credit dataset, it takes relatively
a long time. If FairNeuron tries more times, the average time will
be reduced because the hyperparameters tuning is only conducted
once.
Overall,FairNeuron is more efficient than Ethical Adversaries
infixingmodels,withanaveragespeedupof180%.
4.4 Effects of Configurable Hyperparameters
FairNeuron leveragestwoconfigurablehyperparameters, 𝜃and
𝛾,tofixfairnessproblems.Thehyperparameters 𝛾representsthe
threshold of neuron activation, and its value affects the complexity
of the path. As its value decreases, more neurons and synapses
areincludedinthe path,resultinginamorecomplex path.And 𝜃
represents the threshold of neuron network slicing. The lower is
the𝜃, the fewer paths are classified as abnormal.
We conduct a comparison experiment of these hyperparameters.
𝜃varies between the interval [10−4,1]and𝛾varies between the
interval[0.5,1]. Note that we use logarithmic coordinates for 𝜃
since its value is sampled proportionally.
Figure 5 shows how hyperparameters assignments will affect
the performance. Based on our results in comparison with thenaive model and Ethical Adversaries, we can conclude that our
algorithmdoesperformbetteronthistaskandisnotsensitiveto
hyperparameters assignments except for EO (Figure 5(c) & (g)). By
increasingtheweightofEOinhyperparametertuninglossfunction,
we can constrain its fluctuations.

4.5 Performance on Image Datasets

method in fixing models on image datasets, which has not done
by baseline methods due to their inefficiency. In our experiment,
we leverage a 4-layer fully-connected NN trained on MNIST [ 5]
andResNet-18[ 37]trainedonCIFAR-10[ 1],compare FairNeuron
with the naive model and random dropout. We use Class-wise
Variance (CV) and Maximum Class-wise Discrepancy (MCD) as
fairness metrics.Results:

conflict path detection has been used for interpretability. Wang et
al. [63] proposed a method to interpret neural networks by extract-
ing the critical data routing paths (CDRPs), and they demonstrated
its effectiveness on adversarial sample detection problem. Qiu et

et al. [73] apply the dynamic slicing on deep neural networks.Fairness of ML
. With the increasing use of automated decision-
making approaches and systems, fairness considerations in ML
havegainedsignificantattention.Researchersfoundmanyfairness
problems with high social impact, such as standardized tests inhigher education [
24], employment [ 34,57,61], and re-offence
judgement[ 16,17,20,51].Besides,governments(e.g.theEU[ 62]
and the US [ 54,55]), organizations [ 49], and the media have called
for more societal accountability and social understanding of ML.
To address the concern above, numerous fairness notions are
proposed.Inhighlevel,thesefairnessnotionscanbesplitintothree
categories: (i)individual fairness, whichrequires that similarindi-
vidualsshouldbetreatedsimilarly[ 26,46,67];(ii)groupfairness,
whichconcernsaboutwhethersubpopulationwithdifferentsen-
sitive characteristics are treated equally [28, 35, 70]; (iii) Max-Minfairness, which try to improve the per-group fairness [36, 45, 69].
Fairnesstestingisalsoanimportantresearchdirection,andits
approachesmostlybasedongenerationtechniques.THEMIS[ 14]
considersgroupfairnessusingcausalanalysisandusesrandomtest
generation to evaluate fairness. AEQUITAS inherits and improves
THEMIS, and focuses on the individual discriminatory instances
generation[ 60].Later,ADFcombinesglobalsearchandlocalsearch
tosystematicallysearchtheinputspacewiththeguidanceofgradi-
ent[71].SymbolicGeneration(SG)integratessymbolicexecution
and local model explanation techniques to craft individual discrim-
inatory instances [12].
The ML model needs to be repaired after the fairness problem is
found.Theseapproachescanbegenerallysplitintothreecategories:
(i)Pre-processingapproaches,whichfixthetrainingdatatoreduce
the latent discrimination in dataset. For example, the bias could be
mitigatedbycorrectinglabels[ 40,70],revisingattributes[ 28,41],
generatingnon-discriminationdata[ 58,64],andobtainingfairdata
representations[ 18].(ii)In-processingapproaches,whichrevisethe
training of the bias model to achieve fairness [ 66,68]. More specifi-
cally, these approaches apply fairness constraints [ 26,66], propose
an objective function considering the fairness of prediction [ 68],
or design a new training frameworks [ 11,64]. (iii) post-processing
approaches, which directly change the predictive labels of bias
models’ output to obtain fairness [35, 53].
