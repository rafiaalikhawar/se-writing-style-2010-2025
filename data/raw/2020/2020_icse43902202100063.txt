Abstract —Developers frequently move into new teams or
environments across software companies. Their onboarding ex-
perience is correlated with productivity, job satisfaction, and
other short-term and long-term outcomes. The majority of the
onboarding process comprises engineering tasks such as ﬁxing
bugs or implementing small features. Nevertheless, we do not
have a systematic view of how tasks inﬂuence onboarding. In
this paper, we present a case study of Microsoft, where we
interviewed 32 developers moving into a new team and 15
engineering managers onboarding a new developer into their
team – to understand and characterize developers’ onboarding
experience and expectations in relation to the tasks performed
by them while onboarding. We present how tasks interact with
new developers through three representative themes: learning,
conﬁdence building, and socialization. We also discuss three
onboarding strategies as inferred from the interviews that
managers commonly use unknowingly, and discuss their pros
and cons and offer situational recommendations. Furthermore,
we triangulate our interview ﬁndings with a developer survey
(N = 189) and a manager survey (N = 37 ) and ﬁnd that
survey results suggest that our ﬁndings are representative and
our recommendations are actionable. Practitioners could use
our ﬁndings to improve their onboarding processes, while re-
searchers could ﬁnd new research directions from this study
to advance the understanding of developer onboarding. Our
research instruments and anonymous data are available at

I. I NTRODUCTION
Onboarding is a process where new members adjust to
their new surroundings and acquire the behaviors, attitudes,
and skills necessary to fulﬁll their new roles and function
effectively as a member of a team [1]. A large number of
developers change teams or start new positions every year
but are not productive for months because onboarding can
be overwhelming [2], [3]. A developer often undergoes a
high amount of cognitive overload of working on a new
system, faces social challenges of belonging to a new team
and company, and deals with the pressure of proving oneself
in a new environment. Such stress inﬂuences a developer’s
happiness, retention, and productivity, but could be managed
by good onboarding strategies and automated support; mean-
while, ill-designed onboarding processes could cause a vast
waste of company resources and talents. Therefore, improving
developer onboarding crucial [4].Developers onboard a new team with tasks, such as software
development and maintenance. Through tasks, new developers
learn about the new system, socialize with the team, build con-
ﬁdence, and gain the team’s recognition. However, we lack an
understanding of how tasks inﬂuence onboarding in software
development teams. Hence, we propose the following research
question: RQ1. How do tasks inﬂuence a new developer’s
onboarding experience in software development teams?
We answer this research question with an exploratory case
study, which allows us to examine tasks and onboarding
without any existing theory. Besides, there are two obser-
vations that justify this method. First, onboarding is mul-
tidimensional. There are conventional measurements, such
as productivity [5] and socialization [3]. However, mental
states, such as a developer’s conﬁdence, motivation, and stress
level [6], are important indicators as well. Therefore, we view
the choice of onboarding tasks as a design decision that
balances various consequences and objectives in a speciﬁc
situation. Second, onboarding is a long process with many
stakeholders. Onboarding could take over six months [2],
[3], even for developers from within the company [7]. And
situations are fast changing in this process. For example, the
task of documenting a method call may help a new developer
to understand the team’s workﬂow and tools; as the developer
learns, such simple tasks quickly become inappropriate, and
the developer needs more challenging tasks to keep motivated.
Therefore, we believe the onboarding process is continuously
evolving.
We also aim to uncover some commonly used strategies
in practice to assign tasks when onboarding new developers.
Our understanding of tasks and onboarding will help us
analyze these strategies, and we can further provide practical
suggestions for researchers and practitioners to understand
and improve onboarding processes. Formally, we propose the
following research question: RQ2. What task-assignment
strategies should be used in order to facilitate a positive
onboarding experience in software engineering teams?
We use interviews and surveys to answer the two research
questions, where we get exploratory ﬁndings from interviews
and test these ﬁndings with surveys. We interviewed 32 devel-
opers who had recently joined a new team and 15 managers
who had recently had a new developer, allowing us to collect
inputs from both sides of onboarding processes. Our interviews

revealed how software development tasks inﬂuence some
important aspects of onboarding processes, such as learning,
socialization, and the new developer’s conﬁdence. Besides,
we uncovered three onboarding strategies that managers com-
monly use to onboarding new developers. We use surveys
to get feedback from a broader audience regarding interview
ﬁndings. We collected survey responses from 189 developers
and 37 managers. Survey results suggest that our interview
ﬁndings are representative of onboarding experiences and that
the three strategies can represent a majority of onboarding
strategies in practice.
Our case study leads to several recommendations that man-
agers or organizations may use to improve onboarding pro-
cesses. These recommendations are validated by our surveys
as actionable and useful. Managers can also beneﬁt from our
discussions about the three onboarding strategies. We compare
the pros and cons of the three strategies so that practitioners
can choose their strategy that best ﬁts their scenarios.
This paper is organized in the following way. Section II
describes our method. Section III presents our interview ﬁnd-
ings. Section IV shows survey results that validate our inter-
view ﬁndings in Section III. Section V discusses our work’s
connections with previous studies. Section VI addresses some
threats of validity, and Section VII concludes this paper with
some future research directions.

questions.
A. Subjects and Research Site
This study was conducted at the US division of Microsoft, a
major tech company with more than 100,000 employees. Mi-
crosoft has thousands of new hires and internal transfers every
month making it a good research site to study onboarding.
Besides, Microsoft has multiple divisions, each with relatively
distinct businesses, cultures, and onboarding practices. We
conducted our study from two divisions (Division A and
Division B) to improve the generalizability of our ﬁndings.
Division A focuses on service and software development,
while Division B has both software and hardware businesses.
Both divisions have a large number of software engineering
teams.
We focus on software development teams; a team has one
engineering manager (manager) and several software devel-
opers (developers) with a goal of delivering products and
services. All teams are atomic; there is no sub-team within
a team. A manager’s goal is two-fold: (i) help team members
grow in their roles; (ii) provide technical leadership to the
team, keeping the developers on track to deliver priorities and
maintaining good team health and productivity. Accordingly,
a manager’s job includes planning and negotiating, assigning
tasks, evaluating, and resolving inter and intra-team conﬂicts.
Managers decide how tasks are assigned to developers withina team and Microsoft has no standard strategy for task
assignment. For example, some managers choose to follow
Agile methods and developers get their tasks following the
order of priority, but some managers may choose to assign
tasks directly to developers. In our interviews, all developers
clearly understand the meaning of managers.
Our analysis is grounded on tasks. A typical task is an item
from the team’s task board, deﬁned and scoped to 1-4 weeks;
some exploratory tasks are time-boxed to 1-2 weeks. In our
interviews, some developers mentioned tasks customized for
onboarding, such as ﬁxing and updating documentation; these
tasks are also deﬁned and time-boxed. We found that both
developers and managers understand the meaning of tasks
well.
Company Microsoft maintains a Person database that con-
tains historical details about each employee’s personal (e.g.,
date of joining, title, job description, seniority level and
years in the company), the team (e.g., product group, team
members, manager, and leadership chain), and geographic
(city, building) details. To ﬁnd subjects, researchers queried
thePerson database to identify: developers who had recently
joined a new team , and developer managers who had had
a new developer joined recently. For interviews, we sampled
developers who joined a new team between April 1st, 2019,
to July 1st, 2019 (in the past three months of this study)
and developer managers who had a new developer between
January 1st, 2019 to July 1st, 2019 (in the past six months of
this study). For surveys, we set 6 months as the threshold
for both developers and developer managers. We ﬁltered
results to keep only software developers or software developer
managers who work at the same location (US Headquarter)
as researchers. This process yielded 397 developers and 1167
developer managers for interviews and 1629 developers and
754 developer managers for surveys. Some demographics of
interview and survey subjects are presented in Table I and
Table II.
B. Interviews
We conducted a pilot study comprising of six developer
interviews prior to the formal study. Pilot interviews were un-
structured, focusing on the developer’s onboarding experience
and tasks. From the pilot study, we found constructs1that
were closely related to onboarding; these ﬁndings are used to
design interview guides.
1) Design: To understand how tasks inﬂuence onboard-
ing, we focus on 1) the context of onboarding, such as
the developer’s prior experience, 2) tasks, such as a task’s
complexity and expected results, and 3) constructs inﬂuenced
by tasks, such as learning and conﬁdence. For developers,
we ask participants to describe a task and ask follow-up
questions about how the task inﬂuence the other constructs.
For managers, we ask participants to describe how they assign
tasks, such as their expectations and evaluations. Interview
questions can be found in the supplementary material.
1We use constructs to refer to artifacts, such as documentations, processes,
such as meetings, mental feelings, such as conﬁdence, and metrics, as learning.
614Fig. 1: An illustrative overview of our research process. We get exploratory ﬁndigns from interviews and test these ﬁndings
with surveys. Interview questions are designed to measure tasks and each task’s role in onboarding. Interview transcripts are
coded into themes (ﬁndings); Table III gives a complete view of our interview ﬁndings and Section II-B3 has more details
about the coding process. Surveys triangulate our ﬁndings with a broader audience. Survey questions are derived directly from
our interview ﬁndings.

2) Administration: We randomly sampled subjects from the
pool described in Section II-A and contacted each subject
through emails to schedule the interview. Each interview took
30-60 minutes, administrated by at least two researchers and
audio/video recorded. One researcher read informed consent to
the participant and collected the participant’s verbal consent
before the interview. Interviews were led mostly by one re-
searcher and transcribed by the other. Researchers consolidated
interview notes right after the interview.
3) Analysis: We followed the coding process from con-
structivist grounded theory [8], [9] to code interviews. One
researcher ﬁnished the coding process through a spreadsheet
of transcript lines. Researchers consolidated ﬁndings after each
coding step and decided focuses for the next step together. Af-
ter focused coding, researchers discussed the emerged themes
to be used for theoretical coding with other domain experts,including other researchers, developer team leaders, and senior
managers from Microsoft that speciﬁcally work in the domain
of improving developer productivity. While this exercise did
not result any signiﬁcant changes in the emerged themes but
helped induce more conﬁdence in the themes and avoid bias.
Initial coding. We coded interview transcripts line-by-line
into topics, tasks, constructs. We used three topics (pre-task for
contexts of tasks, task-related for speciﬁc tasks, task sequences
for the ordering of tasks)for developer interviews and two
additional topics (goals and measurements) for developer
interviews. Furthermore, we assigned each task-related line
a descriptor, such as priority and complexity. An initial list
of descriptors was obtained from previous reports, expert
suggestions, and our pilot interviews, and continuously revised
in the coding process.
Focused coding We coded at task level in focused coding,

characterizing each task with a reduced set of codes, such as
the quality of support and social interactions, as presented in
Fig. 2. The list of codes used in focused coding was identiﬁed
as the most relevant and frequent by researchers in initial
coding; a complete list of codes and their meanings could
be found in the supplementary material.
Theoretical coding We focus on three themes in theoretical
coding: learning, conﬁdence, and social interactions. The three
themes frequently appear in interviews and are representative
of onboarding experiences. Therefore, presenting tasks and
their interactions with onboarding under the three themes
covers artifacts (learning), mental status (conﬁdence), and
interpersonal dynamics (social interactions). We believe other
interactions, such as how tasks motivate new members, are
similar to one of the three themes. Besides the three themes,
we analyzed each developer’s onboarding experience and
each manager’s onboarding design to understand onboarding
strategies. We have summarized three onboarding strategies
from analyzing tasks coded in focused coding. We further
analyze the pros and cons of each onboarding strategy in
theoretical coding.
C. Surveys
1) Design: After we coded interviews, we created sur-
veys to collect broad feedback to some speciﬁc interview
ﬁndings and onboarding practice recommendations, and thethree onboarding strategies. As Fig. 1 suggests, the developer
survey contains questions derived from our interview ﬁndings
in Table III and Section III-B. It has two sections. 1) The ﬁrst
section asks developers to choose a strategy, from the three
strategies listed in Section III-B, that best describes their recent
onboarding experience or “None of the above”; developers
can explain their choice with an open-response questions. 2)
The second section has four question groups, corresponding to
three themes and a theme of mentors ; we add mentors because
mentors are critical for learning, building up conﬁdence, and
creating social connections. Each question group contains
Likert-scale questions that ask developers to rate their level of
agreement to some statements, ending with two open-response
questions for developers to explain their choices and provide
recommendations. For example, participants are asked
Based on you recent on-boarding experience, to what
degree do you agree or disagree with the following
statements about learning?
Maintaining a documentation that is complete, clear,
updated, and well organized is/would be an effective
way of facilitating my learning.
which validates the interview ﬁnding E1.1 in Table III directly.
In addition to the two sections, we collect some background
information prior to the ﬁrst section. The developer survey
used in this study can be found in the supplementary material.
The manager survey validates our practice recommendations
616and the three strategies. It contains two sections. 1) In the
ﬁrst section, managers are asked to choose one strategy that
best describes how they onboard a junior or senior developer,
respectively; they are presented with the three strategies as
well as a choice of ”none of the above” and are encouraged
to explain their choice with an open-ended question. 2) The
second section asks managers to rate how likely they would
use recommendations from Table III to improve onboarding;
they may choose “Already in practice” if the recommended
practice is being used. For example, participants are asked
Do you believe that the following practices that
could facilitate learning would improve a new mem-
ber’s on-boarding experience in your team?
Create and/or maintain a new member-friendly doc-
umentation.
which validates the recommendation A1.1 in Table III directly.
In addition to the two sections, we collect some background
information prior to the ﬁst section. The manager survey used
in this study can be found in the supplementary material.
We take the following steps to ensure our survey is valid
and not biased. First, we conduct two rounds of in-person pilot
studies with 5 recently onboarded developers and managers
who recently onboarded a new developer in their team and
used their feedback to remove ambiguity and biases in our
initial design. The pilot studies’ participants do not participate
in the actual survey. Second, to ensure the participant’s un-
derstanding, we deﬁne important terms in the context of our
survey before the questions. All questions and deﬁnitions are
included in the supplementary material.
2) Administration: We sent surveys to 1629 developers and
754 developer managers identiﬁed from the pool, as described
in Section II-A via emails; interview subjects were excluded
from surveys. We received 189 replies for the developer
survey, and 37 replies for the manager survey.
III. I NTERVIEW FINDINGS
This section presents the interview ﬁndings. To answer RQ1,
our interviews have revealed ﬁfteen constructs that are relevant
to onboarding, including context factors such as the devel-
oper’s prior experience, onboarding metrics such as learning
and social interactions, mental status such as conﬁdence and
motivation, and processes such as stand-up meetings. Three
constructs are particularly critical to onboarding experience:
learning, which measures how the new developer gains knowl-
edge about the new team [7]; conﬁdence, which is closely
related to how the new developer feels about the onboarding
process; and social interactions, which is a critical indicator
that managers use to measure onboarding [1]. Section III-A
will elaborate on how learning, conﬁdence, and socialization
are inﬂuenced by tasks, and our key ﬁndings are presented in
Table III. Furthermore, to answer RQ2, Section III-B shows
three onboarding strategies that have emerged from interviews.
Across this section, we refer to interviewed developers with P
and interviewed developer managers with M.A. Learning, Conﬁdence, and Social Connections
Ten managers considered independence as a ﬁnal check-
point for onboarding. Independence is indicated by answering
customer questions, driving complex features, contributing
new ideas, and more. We focus on three aspects: learning,
conﬁdence, and social connection, because they are necessary
for independence and are frequently mentioned in manager
interviews. Table III summarizes our ﬁndings and our recom-
mendations for practitioners to facilitate the new member’s
learning, conﬁdence, and social connections.
We omit most direct quotes in this section due to the
page limit. Readers can ﬁnd more quotes and details in the
supplementary material.
1) Learning: New developers need to learn everything
about the team: code repositories, business values and cus-
tomers, development tools and processes, and responsibilities
of each individual member and some other close teams.
Developers frequently learn from their tasks. Out of 61 task
items , 41 (67%) led to learning. As P14 put it: “there is so
much to learn, so any task assigned to me would have created
a learning experience”. Task-related documentations and team
support are major knowledge channels for new members.
Besides, team meetings also provide learning opportunities.
Task-related documentation. Task-related documentations,
including documents, presentations, tutorials, and demos, are
primary sources of information. Twelve developers mentioned
that they learned from documentations. Developers seek an-
swers from documentations before asking for the team’s help
and they feel frustrated when documentation cannot provide
answers. Some developers mentioned the importance of in-
dexing documents in particular, suggesting that making in-
formation organized and easy-to-ﬁnd can improve onboarding
experiences. Therefore, the team should assign new developers
tasks that are supported by clear, complete, updated, and well-
organized documentations, so that new members can quickly
locate relevant information and avoid inaccurate or incomplete
information.
Team support. Team support is critical for learning. Not all
information is available as documentations, so new developers
have to seek the team for help. In particular, mentorship is
a typical and effective form of team support. Mentors help
new developers solve problems, master development tools and
processes, and ﬁnd useful resources; they also work as a
bridge so that new developers can seek help from others in
the team. Compared to other team members, new developers
ﬁnd it easier to seek help from a dedicated person, like men-
tors. Therefore, assigning task-support mentors is an efﬁcient
method to promote learning.
Technical meetings. Developers beneﬁt from attending
technical meetings, although these meetings are not designed
for learning. These meetings provide new information about
the team’s work, its connections to other teams, its workﬂow,
and its division of responsibilities. Some meetings are conver-
sational, where new developers get their questions answered.
For example, standups are opportunities for new developers
to ask task-related questions. Team meetings are particularly

from the developer survey as the percentage of developers who have answered “Agree” or “Strongly agree”. The numbers for
Practices are calculated from the manager survey as the percent of managers who have answered “Very likely”, “Somewhat
likely”, or “Already in practice”. Creating a psychologically safe environment [10] is a broad topic that is beyond the scope
of this paper. Readers can refer to other studies such as Google’s Project Aristotle [11].

useful when teams have many new developers. In those cases,
participants spend more time on learning and understanding,
while in some other cases, new developers may ﬁnd informa-
tion from these meetings overwhelming.
Learn the task’s big picture ﬁrst. Learning a task’s
contexts facilitate a new developer’s learning. 14 developers
found it helpful that their managers presented big pictures
before assigning tasks, and some developers struggled because
they did not see the big picture ﬁrst. For example, P21 had
problems seeking help from the team not knowing the big
picture. Focusing on the big picture and avoiding details pre-
vents information overload because new developers can ﬁlter
unnecessary information. Therefore, we recommend managers
to explain the task’s context and its connections to the rest of
the team before assigning a task.
2) Conﬁdence: New developers become more conﬁdent in
their team roles as they onboard. Conﬁdence is necessary for
independence, but low conﬁdence is common for new mem-
bers. Five developers mentioned that they had low conﬁdence
due to unfamiliar technologies and processes. Four sources
of conﬁdence have emerged from interviews: ﬁnishing a task,conﬁrmation and trust, learning, and team support.
Finishing a task. Finishing a task boosts conﬁdence. New
developers prove that they can deliver values for the team
and they get more conﬁdence about the team’s development
process. On the other hand, having no progress hurt conﬁ-
dence. Slow progress causes new developers to feel pressure
and low conﬁdence, even when new developers know that the
team does not expect them to ﬁnish the task soon. Therefore,
assigning tasks that could be quickly solved could boost
conﬁdence of new developers.
Receiving positive feedback on performance. New devel-
opers gain conﬁdence when they feel the team’s conﬁrmation
and trust. There are many indicators of trust and conﬁrmation:
some developers feel conﬁdent when other team members
start to ask him/her for help; others feel conﬁrmation when
they are nominated to handle customer requests. Meanwhile,
negative judgments about a new developer’s abilities could
hurt conﬁdence. P17 felt less conﬁdent when her co-worker
made jokes about her being too slow even when she knew the
co-worked did not mean it. Getting early positive feedback
usually leads to good onboarding experiences; for example,
618senior developers can receive conﬁrmation and trust from
the team faster than junior developers because they have
advantages in the team on their tasks, and senior developers
also have better onboarding experiences than junior developers
in our interviews.
Clear learning outcomes. New developers become more
conﬁdent as they become more familiar about the team and
their work. P19 and P20 mentioned that systematic learning
on task-related topics boosted their conﬁdence. Clarifying task
speciﬁcations is also a form of learning that improves conﬁ-
dence. P8 said that “understanding the requirements clearly
is related to gaining conﬁdence” because his task felt more
normal knowing the requirements. Therefore, we recommend
managers to emphasize on what the new developer could learn
from assigned tasks and set clear expectations of learning gains
when assigning tasks.
Peer support. New developers are conﬁdent when they have
the team support working on a task. As P25 put it: “I’m aware
that there are plenty of things that I don’t know, but I know
there are others who know . . . and I’m conﬁdent that there
are people where I can get help”. Support may come from
the manager and mentor speciﬁcally. New developers have
more conﬁdent when they know there is a speciﬁc person
from whom they can seek help. If new developers are paired
with a senior developer to work on a task, they typically have
a very strong conﬁdence. Therefore, assigning tasks that are
supported by the team and making the support accessible to
new developers could improve onboarding.
3) Socialisation: Successful onboarding means positioning
oneself in the team and owning a part of the team’s work. We
have found three types of social interactions: interactions with
mentors, interactions with teammates, and interactions due to
collaboration and dependency of tasks.
Mentors. Mentors are the ﬁrst person that new developers
contact when they have questions. Out of 18 participants who
had a mentor or “onboarding buddy”, 14 found mentors help-
ful. Besides, people who did not have a mentor believed that
having a mentor would improve their onboarding experiences.
For example, P9 reported that “I wish I had someone that
I could have sat together with”; Mentors have a wide range
of responsibilities from setting up environments and introduce
the team, to answering questions and assigning tasks. One
important responsibility is to reduce barriers for help-seeking.
Mentors are accessible, and new members can ask mentors
“dumb” questions freely. Accordingly, some managers men-
tioned that communications skills are important for mentors.
Seeking help from teammates. New developers frequently
seek help from teammates while working on their tasks.
Through help-seeking, new developers build social connec-
tions with the team. Out of 38 task items where social inter-
actions were discussed, 29 led to a strengthened connection
between the developer and the team. However, new developers
might feel hesitant to ask questions because they feel unsafe,
or they do not want to bother others. As Rollag et al. pointed
out, managers should not expect new members to fend for
themselves [3]. If help-seeking is minimal, social interactionsalso decrease. Therefore, having a low-cost or dedicated
channel for help-seeking could promote social interactions.
For example, P4 had a good onboarding experience because
he could ask questions in a dedicated online channel and got
help from experienced developers fast. This dedicated channel
was a low-cost approach for P4 to seek help so that he did
not have to ﬁgure out whom to ask, and there were no social
barriers for him to ask related questions.
Collaboration and dependency of tasks. Tasks that involve
interactions and collaborations with multiple stakeholders
force new developers to establish new social connections.
Some tasks require collaborations with another team member,
but some tasks require cross-team and cross-domain collabo-
rations. New developers who are sensitive to other people’s
working styles generally feel happy to work with others.
However, some new developers may prefer tasks that are
less socially complex. In particular, waiting is common when
collaborating with others and waiting has a negative impact on
the motivation and conﬁdence of new developers. For example,
P23 worked with other teams on a new feature, but could not
get timely feedback because the other teams would not review
pull requests. In general, tasks that require cross-team or cross-
domain collaborations are challenging for new developers and
should be used with caution.
4) Answering RQ1.: Our interviews suggest that onboard-
ing is a long-term process shaped by tasks and that a task’s
inﬂuence on onboarding is compounded with the its contexts.
For example, tasks with high uncertainties could facilitate
learning and social interactions with team support, but could
hinder onboarding when no support is available. We present
how tasks inﬂuence learning, conﬁdence, and socialization
and we provide some recommendations for practitioners to
improve their onboarding processes. Our ﬁndings and recom-
mendations are presented in Table III.
B. Onboarding Strategies
This section presents three onboarding strategies that we
have summarized from interviews:
Simple-Complex is an approach where managers gradu-
ally increase the task’s complexity.
Priority-First is an approach where managers follow the
order of priority.
Exploration-Based is an approach where managers as-
sign tasks that are under-deﬁned and uncertain.
1) Simple-Complex: Simple-Complex is widely used. 12
managers used this strategy, while 14 developers were on-
boarded with this strategy.
In Simple-Complex, managers increase the task’s complex-
ity over time. M8 described a typical Simple-Complex:
1) First week: use simple tasks (bugs or conﬁguration
settings) to get familiar with the development process.
2) The next 2 or 3 weeks: get oriented in the codebase with
small bugs or simple features.
3) The next 3 to 9 months: become an expert in one domain
with more bugs and features.
6194) Eventually: become an expert who can handle the design
of a new feature.
This progressive approach is consistent with expectations
that managers have when onboarding new members. As a
comparison, M14, who also used Simple-Complex, described
his expectations:
1) First week: learn tools and source code.
2) Second week: learn the customer’s perspectives.
3) 3-4 months: they can design something or add a new
capability in a thoughtful way.
4) Six months: they should be able to work independently.
With Simplex-Complex, managers choose tasks for the devel-
oper to achieve expected learning goals. It creates a smooth
learning experience for new members. Besides, as ﬁnishing
tasks builds up conﬁdence, the developer could maintain high
conﬁdence or build up conﬁdence fast.
Tasks in this stage are simple and well-deﬁned. Some
managers would look for high-priority tasks, because “it gives
visibility to the person” (M11). But others did not care about
priority or wanted to avoid high-priority tasks.
There are two variants based on how the manager assign
tasks after 3 to 9 months.
Depth-First lets the developer become expert in one do-
main and expand knowledge gradually to other domains.
Breadth-First exposes the developer to multiple parts
ﬁrst before assigning more in-depth tasks.
Depth-First is more common in our interviews. Owning a
domain improves conﬁdence and promotes social interactions,
which could justify Depth-First. On the other hand, Breadth-
First emphasizes the developer’s interest and motivates devel-
opers with the freedom to explore. It also helps the developer
to build a broad social network with the team. M9 mentioned:
“those tasks usually make it so that people will meet more
team members to work with”, and P7 mentioned that he liked
Breadth-First because “whenever they talk about something,
I know some part of it”. Further studies could measure and
compare the two approaches.
2) Priority-First: Two managers assign tasks following the
backlog’s order, which we call Priority-First. M1 described the
approach as “all features are broken down into tasks, and then
all people pick up tasks organically”; M2 explained that “no
tasks/projects are new guy projects”. In both cases, developers
get the task with the highest priority. Twelve developers were
onboarded with this strategy.
Priority-First allows the developer to generate values im-
mediately for the team and thus is commonly used by teams
under pressure. Out of six developers who were in a team
under pressure, four were onboarded with Priority-First. In
cases such as P14, the developer worked closely with the
team on urgent tasks; although P14 had to learn piece-by-
piece as he worked through tasks, he felt positive about his
onboarding experience. For P14, the team’s high-pressure and
highly focused situation created a safe and energetic learning
space. He reported that he was highly motivated because his
coworkers were highly focused; besides, he felt safe to makemistakes and asked for help because the team was “doing
things too quickly to worry about petty things like people
being insulted or worrying about how they took something”.
Although P14 mentioned some beneﬁts, eight developers
onboarded with Priority-First mentioned that their tasks were
challenging. Challenging tasks early in the onboarding process
could spur fears and low conﬁdence. P30 said that she had
zero conﬁdence for an urgent task, and she was wondering
why her manager did that. Meanwhile, good team support can
counter some negative inﬂuences. M1’s team practiced pair
programming that allowed the developer to interact heavily
with an experienced developer; M2 also paired the developer
with an experienced developer on the ﬁrst few tasks.
3) Exploration-Based: Exploration-Based is a strategy
where managers assign loosely deﬁned tasks to the developer.
One manager mentioned that he would assign a task with high
uncertainties for senior developers and six developers were
onboarded with Exploration-Based.
Managers use Exploration-Based to onboard senior devel-
opers. P24 was aware that some speciﬁcations were up to
him because he was an experienced engineer. However, this
strategy was also used to onboard junior developers. For
example, P5 was assigned to a technical spike, and P29
was assigned to prototyping a new tool. Both tasks were
outside the team’s core product so that new developers could
explore without time pressure or worrying about breaking the
production code. Their managers made clear that the task was
meant for them to learn. We found such a strategy might have
negative inﬂuences on new developers. At the time we had
the interviews, neither P5 and P24 had delivered the assigned
task. P5, in particular, expressed that he felt pressure because
he could not deliver as frequently as others.
New teams are more likely to use Exploration-Based to
onboard developers. 5 out of 9 developers who were reportedly
from a new team were onboarded with Exploration-Based.
New teams have more unspeciﬁed tasks, so they are more
likely to use this strategy. Besides, new members feel more
comfortable with Exploration-Based in new teams. P19 men-
tioned that he felt good because everyone in the team was
learning together. P31 said that people in a new team were
aware that new members could be lost so they would provide
the necessary help. Both P19 and P31 were able to build broad
social connections with the team through the task.
4) Answering RQ2.: Our interviews have surfaced three
onboarding strategies: Simple-Complex, Priority-First, and
Exploration-Based. Simple-Complex is a good strategy for
onboarding junior developers; it gradually prepares new de-
velopers, keeping them conﬁdent and motivated. Meanwhile,
Exploration-Based works better for experienced developers; it
provides freedom to learn about the team and build an owner-
ship. Priority-First is used by teams with special organization
or special needs; Agile teams, new teams, and teams with a
tight schedule may use this strategy.
620IV. S URVEY RESULTS
We sent the developer survey to 1629 developers and col-
lected 189 responses (11.6%). We sent the manager survey to
754 manager and collected 37 responses (4.9%). Anonymous
survey responses are available at https://zenodo.org/record/
4455937#.YCOQCs 0lFd.
A. About experiences and recommendations
Fig. 3 shows that ﬁndings in Table III are representative of
onboarding experiences of developers and managers from Mi-
crosoft. Most developers agree with our interview ﬁndings and
most managers ﬁnd our recommendations useful. In Fig. 3a,
the average percent of developers who agree or strongly agree
with our statements about developer experiences is 88.9%
and the min is 78.5%. In Fig. 3b, out of managers who are
not using the recommended practice at the time, the average
percent of managers who believe that recommended practices
are useful for onboarding is 81.9% and the min is 59.1%.
Besides, Fig. 3c shows that on average, 36.8% managers
are already using recommended practices, indicating that 1)
the recommended practices are useful, and 2) recommended
practices are actionable. Therefore, our ﬁndings echo with
a majority of developers and managers from Microsoft. As
Microsoft has many divisions with difference engineering
culture, these results suggest that our ﬁndings can generalize
to other software engineering teams and organizations as well.
B. About the three strategies
Fig. 3b shows that the three strategies presented in Sec-
tion III-B can represent most onboarding strategies that man-
agers use in Microsoft. In Fig. 4a, the three strategies cover
96.3% onboarding experiences. Fig. 4b and Fig. 4c show that
94.4% and 85.7% managers use one of the three strategies
to describe their onboarding strategy. Therefore, the three
strategies can explain the design intention of most onboarding
experiences.
Comparing Fig. 4b and Fig. 4c: 1) 86.1% managers onboard
junior developers with Simple-Complex strategy as compared
to 48.6% when onboarding senior developers; 2) 27.6% man-
agers use Exploration-Based strategy when onboarding senior
developers as compared to 5.5% for junior developers. These
two arguments are consistent with our interview ﬁndings. The
comparison also suggests that managers have more diverse
onboarding strategies for senior developers.
V. D ISCUSSION AND RELATED WORK
Onboarding is more broadly studied in other areas, es-
pecially management and human resources [1], [12]–[14].
Nonetheless, domain-speciﬁc observations are necessary be-
cause software development tasks have unique properties.
For example, open-ended tasks, used in Exploration-Based
strategies, are not common in other teams such as service
teams. Besides, our study focuses on onboarding collocated
teams, while assigning tasks in distributed teams requires more
considerations [15]. Future studies may generalize our ﬁndings
to distributed teams.Our work is inspired by Deganais et al.’s study on devel-
opers moving into a new landscape [7]. In comparison, some
of our observations about learning are consistent with theirs.
We notice, beyond Deganais et al.’s study, that learning the
landscape is not the only objective for onboarding, so we
include other indicators such as social connections [3], [6]. For
example, Deganais et al. recommend early experimentation to
facilitate learning; our study shows that early experimentation
is one strategy (Simple-Complex) to onboard new members,
and other strategies (Priority-First and Exploration-Based)
could also be used in certain cases. Similarly, our work echos
with Begel & Simon’s research on novice developers [16],
[17], while we present a more comprehensive view of lon-
gitudinal onboarding around tasks. In 1998, Sim & Holt
interviewed four developers and summarized seven patterns
in four major categories [18]. Compared with this work, our
study is more complete and modern. For example, Sim &
Holt’s pattern 4 is “initial tasks were open-ended problems or
simple bug repairs” [18]; we summarize this pattern into two
strategies: Exploration-Based and Simple-Complex, and we
have additionally uncovered the Priority-First strategy, which
has a close relationship with Agile development method [19]
that became mainstream after Sim & Holt’s work.
Our study is closely related to studies on selecting tasks
to enter open-source communities [20]–[24]. Our work distin-
guishes from theirs in two signiﬁcant ways. First, we focus
on industry, which have major distinctions from open-source
communities in terms of motivations, roles, and responsibili-
ties [25]. Second, we examine a process towards an indepen-
dent contributor while they focus on entering a community. As
our study shows, onboarding has multiple stages with different
objectives, and entering a community/team is just one stage.
Only when all stages are considered together can we explain
some strategies, such as Priority-First, that practitioners use to
onboard new members
There are a few other studies that are related to tools to
choose tasks for onboarding [26], [27]. One such example is
Wang & Sarma’s work on ﬁnding the right bug for new mem-
bers [26]. Our study provides more guidance for researchers
to design and test such automated systems. For example, Egel-
man et al.’s recent work on detecting negative interpersonnal
interactions from code reviews [28] could be used to support
onboarding, as our study suggests that negative feedback in
code reviews could hurt a new developer’s conﬁdence and
leads to a less successful onboarding experience.
VI. T HREATS TO VALIDITY
Our study is a mixed-method case study with interviews and
surveys. We address three types of threats to validity [29].
a) Construct Validity: In Section IV, we use the percent-
age of agreements in our survey as an indirect measurement
of validity. We assume that developers and managers who
have reported agreement to our results have had experiences
or perspectives that are consistent with our results. In response
to concerns about the validity of this measurement, we design
surveys to be clear, concrete, and neutral. For example, we

refer to practice recommendations as practices in manager
survey to avoid biases; we also frame questions so that man-
agers are not forced to agree with the usefulness of presented
practices. In both surveys, each question offers participants a
place to explain their choices. From these answers, we have
seen no indicator that any question is vague or misleading.
b) Internal Validity: In interviews, we ask subjects to
recall their recent activities and feelings, which are subject
to biases. To address this, we choose subjects who have
joined a new team recently or who have a new member
joined recently. As a future direction, a longitudinal study that
observes developers who are onboarding a team might provide
more insights. Another threat to validity is that our summary of
interviews is subject to researchers’ personal biases. Therefore,
most interviews are conducted by two researchers, and inter-
view ﬁndings are consolidated among researchers. Besides,
all interviews are recorded so that researchers can refer to the
original data when needed. We have also shared our results
with several domain experts within Microsoft in the form of
write-ups and presentations to avoid biases.
c) External Validity: This study is conducted in one
company, which poses a threat to the study’s external validity.
While we recognize that similar studies from more companies
are desired, we believe our study should generalize to most
modern software engineering teams. Microsoft is a large com-pany with teams working on multiple technical areas serving
various customers. Its teams are self-organized and thus have
the autonomy to practice various development methods and
to different degrees. Furthermore, we sampled participants
from two company divisions that have different products,
businesses, and cultures. This sampling method also improves
the external validity of our results.
VII. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
To our best knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst research
work on software developer onboarding tasks and strategies.
By interviewing developers and managers, we present how
tasks inﬂuence three representative themes of onboarding:
learning, conﬁdence, and social interactions. Our ﬁndings lead
us to some recommendations for practitioners to improve
onboarding processes. Furthermore, we have summarized three
strategies that managers use to onboard new members.
Our work beneﬁt both researchers and practitioners. For
researchers, we provide observations and insights for software
developer onboarding. For practitioners, we provide a list of
recommendations in Table III. Practitioners from Microsoft
have validated that these recommendations are useful and
practical for onboarding new members.
We encourage future studies to provide quantitative perspec-
tives on onboarding. For example, experiments that compare
622the three onboarding strategies would bring many beneﬁts to
the software engineering community. Our ﬁndings also open
up venues for empirical and experimental research in onboard-
ing area. For example, in Section III-B, we hypothesize that
exploration-based onboarding strategies could cause a bad
onboarding experience for less experienced developers. Such a
hypothesis could be validated more rigorously by experiments.
As a case study, our measurements of tasks are subjective
based on our interviews, and we encourage future studies to
design objective measurements to further assist onboarding.
Onboarding is a fundamental issue correlated with produc-
tivity, job satisfaction, retention, creativity, and other desired
outcomes of an organization. With tasks, new members are
shaped by the team but also reshape the team. We envision
a theory where we can understand this dynamic, profound,
and critical process. Such a theory would help the community
to keep teams, the minimal units of the software engineering
industry, efﬁcient, safe, and lively.
