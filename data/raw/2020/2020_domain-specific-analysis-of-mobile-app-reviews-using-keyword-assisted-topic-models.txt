1 INTRODUCTION
The explosive growth and widespread of mobile technology in
the past decade has changed the way software is produced andconsumed. More users now rely on mobile software than everbefore. According to App Annie - the mobile market data andanalytics platform, the average user spends around 4.2 hours aday using apps [

rationale [14, 25, 44, 47, 53, 65, 73].
In general, review mining techniques achieve adequate levels
ofaccuracy,however,theysufferfromseverallimitations.Forin-
stance, supervised classification techniques rely on the presence
ofground-truthdatasetsthattypicallyrequiresignificantmanual
effort to generate [ 25,44,65,72]. Furthermore, these techniques
areconstrainedtoasinglerubricofpredefinedcategoriesand,as
a result, require additional data and model tweaking to general-
izeoverdomain-specificfeedback[ 84].Forexample,usersofthe
Ridesharing app Uber might complain about wait times and rates,
whileusersoftheInvestingappRobinhoodmightraiseconcerns
aboutthe app’srequest for theirsocial securityor bankinforma-
tion. These categories of user feedback can be easily missed in the
ground truthdata.Consequently,a one-size-fits-all approach may
not be suitable for domain-specific user feedback [21, 69, 84].
To avoid the drawbacks of supervised techniques, unsupervised
topic modeling techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA)[9],havebeenappliedtoextractusefulinformationfromapp
store reviews [ 22,26,28,33,62,67]. However, LDA does not per-
formwellwhendealingwithsmallandunstructuredtext[ 6,30,85].
Short text artifacts, such as user reviews [ 81], do not typically
contain enough information for statistical bag-of-words models
to establish semantic connections between words [ 1]. Therefore,
generated topics can be hard to interpret and rationalize and of-
ten require anextensive calibration ofhyperparameters to avoid
misclassifications[12, 30, 87].

2 BACKGROUND
Topic models are statistical techniques that are commonly used for
discovering latent topics in text collections. In topic modeling, atopic can be described as a collection of words which representathematicconceptinacorpus,anddocumentsinthecorpusare
representedas probabilisticdistributions overthese topics.In what
follows, we introduce the most commonly used topic modelingapproach, LDA, and its extension - the keyword-assisted topic
model (keyATM).
2.1 Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
Introduced by Blei et. al [ 9], LDA is an unsupervised technique for
modelingtopicsinacollectionofdocuments.LDAutilizeswordco-occurrenceinformationinordertogrouprelatedwordsintoasingle
topic. To infer topics from a corpus of documents, LDA represents
documentsasrandommixturesoverlatenttopics.Formally,LDA
calculatestwoDirichletdistributions:theword-topicdistribution

𝑑.Thehyperparameters 𝛼and𝛽aretypicallyusedaspriorsfor 𝜙
and𝜃.Foreachword 𝑖inthedataset,thetopic 𝑧𝑖isdrawnfromthe
𝜃𝑑distribution and the word 𝑤𝑖is drawn from the 𝜙𝑧𝑖distribution.
LDA’s usecases include traditional topic extraction for long
texts[10,45,61,76],tagrecommendationforsearchengines[ 42],
softwaresystemscategorization[ 79],andbuglocalization[ 51].De-
spiteitsadvantages,LDAsuffersfromseverallimitationswhenit
comes to processing online user-generated text. For instance, in
the context of app feedback analysis, mobile app reviews are often
short, personal, and contain colloquial terms. Thus, they are too
semantically-restricted for complex distributional approaches suchas LDA to operate, leading LDA to generate random topics or even
overfit the data [ 3,59,63,77,87]. Furthermore, LDA, by design,
tendstogeneralizeoverlargertopicsinordertobettermodelfre-
quently occurring words. Therefore, more specific and nuanced
topics are often left ignored [ 35]. This limitation is critical for user
reviewanalysisasusefulinformationinuserreviewsistypically
domain-specific [21, 69, 80, 84].
2.2 Keyword-Assisted Topic Modeling
Keyword-assistedtopicmodeling(keyATM)isanoveltechnique
thathasbeenproposedtoimproveupontraditionaltopicmodels,
such as LDA [ 20,35]. The key idea behind keyATM is that it in-
corporates user-defined seed words for topic-word distributions.
Each potential topic can be supplemented by specific keywords
thatarebelievedtodescribeatheme.Formally,keyATMmodifies
the traditional LDA algorithm in two ways:(1)The word-topic distribution 𝜙𝑘is replaced with a “mix-
ture”oftwodistributions:aseed-topicdistribution 𝜙𝑠and
aregular-topicdistribution 𝜙𝑟.Theseed-topicdistribution
can only select words from the initial seed set, while the
regular-topicdistributionmayselectanywordsinthecor-
pus, including the seed words. The parameter 𝜋𝑘controls
the probability of drawing a word from either 𝜙𝑠or𝜙𝑟.
(2)Todrawthedocument-topicdistribution 𝜃𝑑,foreachdocu-
ment𝑑, a binary vector /vec𝑏of the length 𝑆(number of seeded
topics) is generated. /vec𝑏takes the values of 1 if 𝑑contains any
keywordfromarespectiveseedsetand0otherwise.Next,
a document-group distribution 𝜁𝑑is sampled from /vec𝑏with a
hyperparameter 𝜏fromwhichagroupvariable 𝑔isdrawn.
Eachgrouprepresentsaseedsetselectedfromthecorpus.Finally, the group-topic distribution
𝜓𝑔is used as prior to
draw𝜃𝑑.

Our main assumption in this paper is that keyATM can over-
comethelimitationsofLDAwhendealingwithmobileappreviews.
Inparticular,toaddressthedomain-specificityproblem,keyATM
utilizes a binary vector /vec𝑏which elevates the less-common topics
for the provided seed words. These seed words can be extracted in
advancebasedonexpertopinioninordertosupplementkeyATM
with a high-level overview of the user review corpus. The main ad-
vantageofkeyATMisthatoncetheinitialseedsareprovided,itcan
collect additional semantically-related keywords from regular top-
ics (line 2, line 16). By combining seeded and regular distributions,
keyATM generates more cohesive and focused topics, overcoming
the main limitation of using LDA to model semantically-restricted
user reviews.

3 APPROACH
TheproposedapproachisdepictedinFig.1.Ourapproachcanbe
dividedintothreesteps.Inthefirststep,weapplyseveralheuristics
to extract informative user reviews. In the second step, we pre-
process and summarize extracted reviews in order to generate a
representative set of important keywords, or seeds, for the corpus.
In the third step, seeds are fed into keyATM to generate a topic
distributionoverextractedreviews.Inwhatfollows,wedescribe
each of these steps using illustrative examples.
3.1 Informative Review Extraction
Mobileappreviewsvaryinquality.Previousresearchhasshown
thatappreviewsdonotfollowawell-definedstructureandoften
containspellingfluctuations,colloquialterms,andspam[ 39,82].
Therefore, a large proportion of app store reviews is simply un-
informative [ 39]. As topic models are particularly susceptible to
generating uninterpretable topics from semantically poor docu-
ments [18], the first step of our approach is to improve the quality
of our review corpus by filtering out uninformative feedback.
To detect informative reviews, we adopt Guo and Singh’s ap-
proachforsynthesizingpotentiallymeaningfuluserstoriesfrom
mobileappreviews[ 24].Auserstory canbedefinedasarelation-
ship between an action that a user took and a problem that an app
produced in response to that action. Such stories describe users’experiences and outcomes when interacting with their apps. Forexample, a user might complain that their navigation app loses
GPSsignal whenindrivemode. Suchastory contains potentially
usefulinformationforappdevelopersasitoutlinesthecondition
(indrivemode )underwhichaproblem(GPSlostsignal )occurred.
Thesestoriesarecommonlypresentinlow-starappreviews(one
andtwostars)giventhatappproblemsareoftenaccompaniedby
lowratings[ 31,38,81].Ourexpectationisthattopicsmodeledafter
reviews with user stories will be more coherent, and thus, more
interpretable.
To identify reviews that might contain user stories, common
temporal conjunctions are used, including words such as after,
as soon as, before,every time, then,until,when,whenever, while,
andduring. Temporal conjunctions indicate temporal and causal
ordering of events that was found to be particularly helpful for
mitigating problems of text sparseness [ 55]. For example, consider
the four app reviews in Example 1. R1,R2, andR3are informative
reviewsthatcontainuserstoriesintheformofaction-problempairs
(temporalconjunctions areunderlined). R1describesanaction of
scrollthroughthepages andaproblem,a crash.Suchareviewcan
helpatopicmodeltobuildasemanticassociationbetween crash
andscrolling. R4is a false positive.
Example 1
•R1: This app crashes when I scroll through the pages.
•R2:Theywant yourSSN beforeyoucaneven look.It’s
definitely a scam.
•R3: To verify identity it requires u take a picture but
thenimmediately crashes.
•R4: Still waiting, after a month, to be approved.3.2 Seed Generation
Under this step of our approach, we seek to generate sets of repre-
sentativeseeds(keywords)fromextracteduserreviews.Tocorrectly
modeltheunderlyinglatenttopicstructure,thesekeywordshave
to be representative of as many themes in the review corpus as
possible [35]. Therefore, the keyword generation process requires
a prioriknowledge of the domain of interest which might not be
always readily available [ 4,5]. For example, to model the represen-
tative topics of app reviews in the domain of Investing apps, the
researcherhastoknowthespecificthemesthatusersdiscussinthe
reviews andthe corresponding keywordsto generalize overthese
themes.Extractingsuchkeywordstypicallyinvolvesmanuallyclas-
sifying userreviews into representative topics,which nullifies the
advantageofunsupervisedtechniques.Toaddressthislimitation,in
our adaptation of keyATM, instead of determining seeds manually,
we use extractive summarization.
A summary can be described as a short and concise descrip-
tion that encompasses the main themes in a collection of docu-
ments[37,48].Inextractivesummarization,textartifacts(e.g.,re-
views,comments,andtweets)whichcontainthemostimportant
keywordsinthecorpusareextractedaspotentialsummariesofthe
entire corpus. In a sense, each generated summary represents a po-
tential latent theme in a collection of documents, thus can be used
to provide representative keywords (seeds) for keyATM. Common
extractivesummarizationtechniques,suchasHybridTF.IDF[ 34]
andSumBasic [ 60],have beenapplied tosummarize unstructured
online user feedback (e.g., tweets, YouTube comments, and user
reviews) [ 36,68,83,84] and have been shown to achieve very high
levelsofagreementwithhuman-generatedsummaries.Basedon
theseobservations,inouranalysis,weutilizesuchtechniquesto
extract the initial set of seeding keywords from the corpus.
Togeneratesummariesfromappuserreviews, HybridTF.IDF[34]
isoftenutilized.TF.IDFconsistsoftwocomponents:1)TF-Term
Frequency, or how many times a term appears in a document
and 2) IDF - Inverse Document Frequency, or how much infor-mation a term provides. TF.IDF-based methods have shown ac-ceptable accuracy levels across a variety of text summarization
tasks [2,16,32,40,56]. However, short texts, such as user reviews,
poseauniquechallengetoTF.IDF.Inparticular,becauseshorttextscontainonlyahandfulofwords,theprobabilityofindividualterms

majorityofwordsareassignedthesameTFvalue.HybridTF.IDF
addressesthisissuebycalculatingtermfrequencyasthenumber
of times a term 𝑡appears across all reviews divided by the total
number of terms in the review collection. Formally, the Hybrid
TF.IDF of a term 𝑡can be computed as:
Hybrid TF.IDF (𝑡,𝑑)=𝑓𝑡,𝐷/summationtext.1𝑓𝑡,𝑑×log|𝐷|
|𝑑∈𝐷:𝑡∈𝑑|(1)
where𝑓𝑡,𝐷is the frequency of term 𝑡in all documents,/summationtext.1𝑓𝑡,𝑑is
the total number of terms in the collection, |𝐷|is the number of
documents in the corpus, and |𝑑∈𝐷:𝑡∈𝑑|is the number of
documents that contain 𝑡. The total weight of a document 𝑑is cal-
culated by summing up all terms’ weights. Ho wever, in the current
form,HybridTF.IDFwouldbebiasedtowardlongerreviewsastheycontain more terms. To work around this problem, a normalization

wheresummarieswithsimilarwordsarerankedtogether,asimi-
larity threshold,calculated as thecosine of the angle betweenthe
vectorized representationsof each twosummaries, is used. Anop-
timal similarity threshold can be determined experimentally based
on the desired uniqueness of summaries.
To illustrate our summarization step, consider the summaries
in Example 2 generated for a dataset of reviews sampled from the
domainofInvestingappswithathresholdof0.1(notwosummaries
should have a cosine similarity greater than 0.1). Each summary
encompasses a separate topic, such as taking money from a user’s
account(S 1),appcrashing(S 2),problemswithsellingastock(S 3),
and issues with customer support (S 4).
Example 2
•S1: This app takes out money even after you close your
account...
•S2: This app now crashes 100% of the time, every time I
open it
•S3:Allowedmeto buystock,butwhen itriedto sell my
stock they didn’t sell it
•S4: Great until you need customer support, once you
need support you’re on your own
To improve the accuracy of summarization, text processing
strategies are often used. Before generatingsummaries, extracted
app reviews are first converted to lowercase and tokenized into
individual words,with punctuation,URLs, and otherspecial sym-
bolsremoved.Additionalsplittingstrategies,suchassplittingdigits
and alpha-characters are performed (e.g. 2hrsbecomes 2 hrs). Eng-
lish stop-words, such as will, this, it, are removed based on the list
provided in the NLTK package [ 7]. Additional cohort-specific stop-
wordsaremanuallyidentifiedandaddedtothelist.Thesewords
include app names (e.g., robinhood andacorn), frequent words (e.g.,
yeahandwell),and short1-2letterwords thatdonotcontain anysemanticinformation.Finally,lemmatizationisappliedtothere-
sultinglistofwords.Lemmatizationisanormalizationtechnique
which reduces the number of distinct entries in the data. More
specifically, lemmatization converts a word toits dictionary form.
Thisprocessisappliedtoimprovetheperformanceofclustering
algorithmsbycollapsingdifferentformsofthesamewordintoa
single entity [ 41]. Example 3 shows the processed summaries from
Example 2.
Example 3•S

•S2: app, crash, time, every, time, open
•S3: allow, buy, stock, try, sell, stock, sell
•S4: great, need, customer, support, need, support
3.3 Topic generation
Sinceeachsummarysuccinctlydescribesaseparatetheme,seeds
are generated by obtaining distinct terms from the processed sum-
maries.Forexample,theterms great,need,customer,and support
are extracted from S4to describe a theme discussing issues with
customer support. These seeds are then supplied to keyATM for
the topic modeling step. Our assumption is that these terms canprovide enough semantic information for keyATM to be able to
generalizeoverthewholedatasetofextracteduserreviews.Inwhatfollows,weempiricallyevaluateourassumptionusingtwodatasets

4 EVALUATION
In this section, we illustrate the operation of our proposed topicgeneration approach over two datasets of user reviews sampled
from the domains of Investing and Food Delivery apps. We further
evaluate our generated topics by comparing them to the topics
generatedbyLDA.Ourmainresearchquestionis: How well does
our approach perform in comparison to LDA?
4.1 Data Collection
To demonstrate the operation of our approach, we apply it on
twodatasetsofmobileappreviewssampledfromthedomainsof
Investing and Food Delivery apps. Investing apps have becomeincreasingly popular in recent years due to the increasing inter-
estincryptocurrencytrading.Zero-commissiontradingfeesand

than 6 million new users have joined the platform in 2021 right
after the WallStreetBets subreddit controversy [ 23,57]. Similarly,
the domain of Food Delivery has experienced an unprecedentedgrowth during the COVID-19 pandemic as the demand for Food
Delivery services has significantly increased. For example, the four
major Food Delivery apps: DoorDash, UberEats, GrubHub, andPostmates reported a significant increase in revenue during the
stay-at-homeorderof2020[ 75].Infact,themarketsegmentoffood
delivery apps, currently estimated at $126.91 billion, is expected to
grow to $192.16 billion by 2025 [70].
To collect user reviews for our analysis, we selected the most
popular apps from both domains. To identify these apps, the top
100appsinthecategoriesofFinance(Investing)andFood&Drink
(Food Delivery) on Google Play and the Apple App Store were
examined. Apps which met the following criteria were included in
our analysis:
(1)For an app to be included in our analysis, we only consid-
eredappswith10,000reviewsormore.Thisnumberofre-
views is necessary in order to include only popular and
well-established apps in our dataset.
(2)For the Investing domain, banking “all-in-one” apps were
excludedasthemajorityoftheseappsdidnotprovideInvest-
ing services. For Food Delivery apps, specific restaurants’
deliveryapps,suchas PapaJohn’sPizza&Delivery official
app, were also excluded.
After examining the top 100 apps, eight Investing and five Food

the negative log-transformed count of the number of times 𝑤𝑖and

TheunderlyingassumptionbehindusingNPMIforevaluating
topic quality is that words of cohesive topics should be well con-
nected,orhaverelativelyhighaveragepairwiseNPMI.Forexample,
Fig. 2 shows a sample NPMI graph of a word set sampled from the
review corpus of the Food Delivery domain. The graph shows that
the words cold,driver,food,lost,late,andhotformadense-setof
well-connected nodes (words). This is expected given that these
words frequently appear in the same reviews, for example, “drivers
are always either late or lost I always get my food cold and my drink
hot.”The word discount, while connected to food, stands at a fur-
thersemanticdistancefromotherwordsasitdoesnotappearas
frequently with them in the same reviews.
TherearetwomainstrategiestocomputeNPMI:intrinsicandex-
trinsic [8]. Intrinsic NPMI is calculated based on the co-occurrence
of topic words within the corpus. In contrast, the extrinsic strategyuses external datasets of human-produced textual knowledge, such
as Wikipedia, to compute words co-occurrence, and thus semantic
relatedness, of words. Intrinsic NPMI scores computed over the
corpus can show how well the model learned the underlying data,
or the extent that generated topic models accurately represent the
content of a corpus. Extrinsic NPMI, on the other hand, shows
how common generated topics are in daily language, which can be
analogous to how a human examining the quality of topics would
decide whether they are coherent or not [71].
Inour analysis,weemploy bothstrategiesfor computingtopic
coherence. For extrinsic evaluation, we used the entire English
Wikipedia dump of October 2017. The dump included 5 million
articles,133word-lengthperarticleonaverage,packedintoa16GB
JSON file. Each article was tokenized and preprocessed and special
non-ASCII symbols were removed. The coherence of a given topic
is calculated as the average NPMI between its 10 most probable
words in a topic. Formally, topic coherence is calculated as:

4.3 Model Configuration
Tocomparetheperformanceofourapproachtothebaseline(LDA),
weperformhyperparametertuninginordertoachievethemaxi-
mum coherence score possible over both datasets. In addition to
the number of topics ( 𝐾), LDA has two hyperparameters, 𝛼and
𝛽. We use the implementation of LDA from the Gensim Python
package3, where𝛼is inferred from the corpus automatically and 𝛽
is set to 1 /𝐾. As a standard practice of topic models evaluation, we
trainLDAfor 𝐾={10,20,...,100}.Theseboundsof 𝐾wereselected
based on the coherence score, where a sharp decline indicates that
a model no longer can generate coherent topics.
One of the main parameters that determines the performance of
ourapproachisthequalityoftheseedingwords.Smallernumberof
seeds might not convey enough semantic information for keyATM
to capture meaningful topics, while larger number of keywordsmightbetoogeneraltoformcohesivetopics.Toselectthesetof
seeds, we calculate the pairwise NPMI scores for each pair of seeds
ineachindividualsummaryreview.Wethenattempttooptimize
thesetofseedsbyremovingthebottom 𝑛-thpercentileoftheseeds
(seeding words which share the lowest average pairwise similarity
with other seeds). The main assumption is that by removing these
potentially unrelated words we can produce a more focused set of
seeds, and thus, better topics. For example, Table 2 shows the aver-
ageNPMIscoreforagroupofwordssampledfromthesummary
reviews of the Food Delivery corpus. Words such as refuse,first,
andaddcan be removed due to their low average pairwise simi-

Ourresultsprovideevidencethatitispossibletosignificantly

modelwithasmallset(3-20)ofrepresentativekeywords.Infact,
even when the supplied keyword set is incomplete, the model is
stillabletocorrectlyinferlatenttopicsandprovideinterpretable
results. For example, Table 5 presents the top-5 topics in termsof coherence generated for the reviews in our datasets. Topic 3of the Investing app reviews is about losing money due to pricefluctuations on a trading day. However, only a handful of words
hinting toward that specific topic were provided to the model: sell,
stock, and lose. Nevertheless, the model correctly identified the
main idea of the topic and discovered new related words. Another
exampleisTopic1intheFoodDeliveryreviewcorpus,whichseemstobediscussingaproblemwithcustomerservice.Interestingly,the
keywords customer andservicewere never supplied to this topic.
Nevertheless, the model was still able to create a topic with a high
coherence score.An interestingcase is Topic2 from theInvesting
domain-noneofthekeywordsappearedinthetop-10wordsofthe
topic,however,thetopic’sthemeisinterpretable,pointingoutto
user interface (UI) problems. In fact, this topic which was obtained
with𝐾=10doesnotappearinLDA’stopicsatallforthesimilar
values of 𝐾={10,20,30}. This shows that our approach is able
toextractunderrepresentedtopicsfromasemantically-restricted
corpus where LDA typically fails.
As expected, smaller sets of focused keywords (seeds) produced
the highest-quality topics. A large number of general keywords
still managed to produce coherent topics, although such keywords
arelesslikelytoappearinthetop-10listofthetopic.Thissuggests
that the quality of the resulting model is influenced by the quality
of the supplied keywords, therefore the main effort should be fo-

Thisprocess,inturn,isdependentontheunderlyingdataset.For
example, using different summarization parameters can producedifferentseeds.Assuch,theseparametersshouldbetunedalong
with the rest of the hyperparameters, such as 𝐾,𝛼, and𝛽.
In terms of specific model configurations, our results show a
general trend toward higher coherence score produced by the con-
figurations with a higher percentile removed keywords ( 𝑛). This
suggeststhatthereisno one-size-fits-all approachwhenitcomes
to deriving an optimal model: each document corpus requires a
comprehensive hyperparameter tuning strategy to create the best-
performingmodel.Forinstance,intermsofcoherence,wefound

Intermsofimpact,ourexpectationisthatourapproachwould
advancethestateoftheartbyenablingfurtherempiricalinvesti-
gations related to using topic modeling in software engineeringtasks. In particular, LDA has long been used to provide supportfor basic Software Engineering activities, such as requirements
traceability[ 29],buglocalization[ 78],coderetrieval[ 50],andmostrecently mobile app review analysis. However, LDA’s performance
has always been hindered by the limited semantic and syntactic
natureofsoftwareartifacts,whethersourcecode,bugreports,re-
quirements specifications, or software user reviews [ 17,29,54,84].
Our proposed approach aims to address these challenges by as-
sessingLDAtoproducemorecohesivetopicsthatcanbepointed
out by a few important words extracted from the corpus. Such
words can be automatically determined using basic text summa-
rization techniques that have been shown to achieve high levels of
agreementswithhumangeneratedsummariesovercollectionsof
software user feedback [ 36,68,83]. This relatively simple method-
ology can overcome the limitations often associated with other
expensive solutions, such as using machine learning to tune LDA’s
parameters [ 64], thus, enabling the development of more practical
software engineering tools.
In terms of practical impact, our results highlight the need for a
more nuanced and domain-aware approach for extracting informa-
tion from user reviews. Similar to existing topic modeling and text
classification algorithms, our approach can facilitate a transition
from domain knowledge torequirements specifications. However,
the key advantage of our approach over existing techniques is that
it can provide more fine-grained requirements information and
avoid the need to manually label a subset of reviews. The informa-
tion obtained from keyATM can then be effectively used by app
developers.Forinstance,developersofInvestingappsmayobserve
that UI (Topic 2) is a major concern of Investing app users, thus,
concentrate their development effortsto improve user experience
byextractingreviewswheretheUItopichasahighprobability,and
maybe even derive a more nuanced set of keywords (e.g., screen,
color,graphs,etc.)tosplitthetopicintoanylevelofdetailrequired.
After the release of their app, developers can further monitor user
feedback and reallocate their resources more efficiently to quickly
address any emerging user concerns.

Along the lines of our work, active learning was proposed to
reducethemanualeffortrequiredtoclassifyappreviews.Active
learning algorithms learn the data incrementally by selecting a
small sample of reviews for manual labeling and predicting the
remaining labels. The steps are repeated until the desired accuracy
is reached. For example, Dhinakaran et. al. [ 19] evaluated an active
learningpipelineforappreviewclassification.Theauthorsclassi-
fiedreviewsintofourcategories:featurerequest,bugreport,user
experience, and rating. Several uncertainty sampling metrics were
proposed and evaluated, such as Least Confident Prediction, Small-
estMargin,andHighestEntropy.Theexperimentwasconducted

Recently,unsupervisedtechniqueshavebeenusedtodiscover
latent topics in user reviews. Most of these techniques modify and
extend LDA to increase its effectiveness for user generated feed-
back[12,13,59,62,69].Forinstance,Mehrotraetal.[ 59]proposed

extracting step in order to increase the quality of the review cor-
pus.Therefore,someofthelatenttopicsfromtheremovedreviews
mighthavebeenmissed.However,performingreviewfilteringis
a standard practice for any supervised or unsupervised machine
learning task. These methodologies have been shown to remove
high percentage of uninformative reviews in review corpora with
high levels of precision [ 24,38]. Furthermore, the hyperparame-
tersettingsusedtotuneLDAmightaffecttheinternalvalidityof
the study. However, there are no robust optimization methodology
available for every parameter for every scenario. Therefore, we ap-
plied a standard procedure of training several models with various
𝐾parameter values until the best results were obtained.
Another internal validity threat might stem from the apps se-
lected for each domain. While we acknowledge that there are
dozens, if not hundreds, of apps available under the Investing and
Food Delivery domains, most of these apps do not have a sufficient
number of reviews. Including such less popular apps would be
problematicasthegeneratedtopicswouldbebiasedtowardapps
with more reviews. Nonetheless, we acknowledge the fact that the
results of our analysis might not necessarily generalize over other
apps in our domains or over other domains.
Construct validity is the degree to which the various perfor-
mance measures used in the study accurately capture the concepts
theypurporttomeasure.Aconstructvaliditythreatmightberaised
about the reliability of the coherence measures used to evaluate
thequalityofgeneratedtopics.Toaddressthesethreats,weused
two types of intrinsic and extrinsic coherence measures that are
based on the semantic relatedness of topic words. These measures
have been extensively used in the literature and have been shown
to achieve high correlation levels with human judgment [ 71]. Gen-
erally speaking, topic models are often utilized as a means to an
end, where generated topics are used to enable other tasks, such as
informationretrieval,orevenusedasinputformachinelearning
algorithms,thus,theyarebetterevaluatedinthatcontext.Nonethe-
less, further evaluation using human judges is necessary to paint a
full picture of topic quality.
8 CONCLUSIONS
Inthispaper,weproposedanapproachforanalyzingmobileapp
user feedback using keyword-assisted topic models. The proposed
approach relies on a set of seeding words (keywords) extracted
from the corpus to generate more cohesive topics. We showed that
these keywords can be automatically extracted from the corpus
usinggeneral-purposeextractivesummarizationtechniques.The
proposed approach was evaluated using two datasets of user re-
views,sampledfromthedomainsofInvestingandFoodDelivery
apps.Theresultsshowedthatourproposedkeywordassistedtopic
modelingapproachwasabletosignificantlyoutperformLDAon
both intrinsic and extrinsic measures of topic cohesiveness. Fur-thermore, our approach was able to model topics that are oftenoverlooked by LDA. Our findings in this paper are intended to
advance the state-of-the-artin mobile app review analysisas well
asenablefurtherempiricalinvestigationsintotopicmodelingfor
software user feedback. To achieve these goals, our work in this
paper will be extended along two main directions:•Automatictuning:wewillcontinuetoevaluatetheproposed
approach over larger datasets of mobile app reviews and
across more application domains. Our objective is to devise
automated optimization strategies for tuning the differentparameters of our underlying topic modeling approach in
different settings.
•Tool support: a working prototype which will implementour findings in this paper will be implemented and made
