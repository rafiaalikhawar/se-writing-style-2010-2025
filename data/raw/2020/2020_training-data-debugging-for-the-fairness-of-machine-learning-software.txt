theconcernaboutitsfairnesshasalsobeenraisedtowardsdevel-
opers, users, and regulators of ML software. The unfairness of ML
softwareusuallyindicatesthediscriminatorytreatmentofdifferent
groups divided by sensitive features [ 40], e.g., sex. According to
biased decisions made by ML software, one group (e.g., male) may
haveaparticularadvantage,i.e.,withmoreopportunitytoobtain
“favorable” decisions1, called privileged, over the other group (e.g.,
female), called unprivileged. Under such circumstances, the biased
treatment not only undermines the objectivity of ML software but
also violates some anti-discrimination laws [14].
The fairness of ML software has been considered a worthy soft-

a biased manner and needs to be tackled. Chakraborty et al. [ 25]
arguedthat,whendiscoveringunfairproblemswithMLsoftware,
it is the job of software engineers to reduce discrimination. Biswas
and Rajan [ 18] conducted an empirical evaluation of fairness on 40
real-world ML software under a comprehensive set of fairness indi-
cators.Theyobservedthatperformanceoptimizationtechniques
might lead to unfairness.
Followingthedata-drivenprogrammingparadigm[ 47],MLsoft-
wareobtainsitsdecisionlogicfromtrainingdata[ 13].Thebehavior
of ML software to a large extent is determined by the quality of
training data [ 44], i.e., biased training data may lead to the trained
ML software with statistical discrimination. Researchers have tried
toexplaintheeffectoftrainingdataonthefairnessofMLsoftware
from the following angles:
•The size of feature sets . Zhang and Harman [ 46] compared
the results of ML software with different sizes of feature
sets and reported that enlarging the size of feature sets in
training data would increase ML software fairness.
•Biasedlabelsandimbalanceddistributions.Chakraborty etal.
[23] assumed that label information might contain bias and
proposed a novel method, Fairway, to remove training sam-
pleswithbiasedlabels.Recently,they[ 22]postulatedroot
causes of unfairness as a combination of biased labels and
imbalancedinternaldistributionsandproposedFair-Smote
to remove biased labels and rebalance internal distributions.
Thispaperdeviatesfrompreviousstudies,asitadoptsadifferent
angle: the root cause of the unfairness could be biased features in
trainingdata.Here,wedefinebiasedfeaturesas featuresthatare

inAmazonfairnessissues[ 8],whendevelopersconstructedAma-
zon’s same-day delivery service,they observed that some features
in the training data are highly related to the race (the sensitive fea-
ture that is already excluded in the training process) of customers,
e.g., the zipcode feature could obviously deduce whether the deliv-
eryaddressisinwhiteornon-whitecommunities.Asaresult,even
though thedelivery serviceruns withoutobtaining the raceinfor-

beenconsideredfairnessbugs[ 20],whichasksfornovelmethods

Toobtainunbiasedfeatures,wetryto debugfeaturevaluesin

achieve this goal, we propose a novel method, Linear-regression
basedTraining DataDebugging( LTDD),whichemploysthelinear

inSection3).Onthewhole,ourmethodcomprisesthefollowing

biased parts of training features as explained variances [ 49]i nt h eoriginal feature values by the sensitive feature, and (c) removing
thebiasedpartsoftrainingfeaturesbysubtractingtheestimated
values from original feature values to construct fair ML software.
To evaluate our method LTDD, we conduct an extensive empir-
ical study on nine tasks [ 1–3,5–7,9,10] with common sensitive
features (sex, race, and age) under three widely used ML classifiers,

describes threats to validity, and Section 8 concludes our paper.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Preliminaries
We introduce some concepts and symbols about the fairness of
ML software here, which facilitate the readers to understand the
following parts.
MLSoftware.Forbinaryclassificationtasks2,MLSoftware SML
would be considered as a function mapping the domain feature
vectors x=[𝑥1,𝑥2,...,𝑥𝑑]∈R𝑑into class labels 𝑦∈{0,1}, i.e.,
SML:R𝑑→{0,1}. Normally, for a new input x,w eu s e 𝑦to
denote the actual label, while ˆ𝑦=SML(x)indicates the predicted
label by ML Software.
Sensitive Feature. The sensitive feature is a feature 𝑥𝑠in the
domainfeaturevector x,whichdividessamplesintotwocategories
(called privileged and unprivileged), in which the benefits received
differconsiderably.Forexample,sexisoneofthecommonsensitive

be easily generalized to multiple classification tasks.

[46],i.e.,privilegedgroupsandunprivilegedgroupshave(almost)
equalprobabilitiesofbeingpredictedasfavorablelabels.Groupfair-
ness is widely studied [ 23,47] and guaranteed by legal regulations
on fairness [27, 28]. In this study, we focus on group fairness.
2.2 Related Work
We introduce the related work from three aspects: fairness testing
and evaluation, bias removal algorithm, and data debugging.
2.2.1 Fairness Testing and Evaluation. Fairness testing hopes to
find instances of bias in the data set and evaluate the fairness of
themodel’spredictionresults.AEQUITAS[ 42]findsinstancesof
discriminationinthedatasetandgeneratesmoreinstancestore-
trainfurther.Itappliestwosearchstrategiesglobalsearchbasedon

local interpretable models. Zhang et al. [ 48] proposed a white-box
testing technique to find and generate test cases, which aims at
complex DNN models and introduces gradient-based methods into
global and local search.
2.2.2 Bias Removal Algorithm. Bias removal algorithms can be
divided into three categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and
post-processing.
(a)Thepre-processingalgorithmaffectsthetrainingofthemodel
by modifying the data to achieve fairness. As the pre-processingalgorithm is the most related work to this study, we detailedly
summarize pre-processing approaches in the following three folds:
•datapoint modification which deletes, generates, or assigns
weights to datapoints of training data ([22, 23, 31]);
•feature selection which leverages feature construction to
choosemoresuitablefeaturesthatleadtobothhighaccuracy
and fairness [37, 46];
•feature modification which modifies features as a debias-ing method. Disparate Impact Remover (DIR) is the most
relatedfeaturemodificationmethod[ 27]andhasalsobeen
employed as one of four baselines (see Section 4.2). DIR
focuses on the predictability of sensitive features from non-
sensitive features (non-sensitive →sensitive), which is an
opposite strategy of our method to evaluate the bias.
Comparedwithrelatedwork,ourmethodemployslinearregres-
sion to estimate the biased association of non-sensitive features
fromsensitivefeatures(i.e.,sensitive →non-sensitive,seeSection3),
which is a novel angle to assess and remove the bias.
(b) The in-processing method is to modify the model to make
the prediction result of the model fairer. Zhang et al. [ 45]p r o -
posedamethodtoimprovethemodelthroughnegativefeedback.
It combines an adversarial model to obtain the difference between
sensitive features and non-sensitive features to reduce bias.
(c) The post-processing method achieves prediction fairness by
modifying the prediction results of the model. Hardt et al. [ 29]
proposedapost-processingmethodbasedonequalopportunitydif-ference,whichachievesthegoaloffairnessbytransferringthecost
of bad classification from unprivileged groups to decision makers.2.2.3 Data Debugging. Thegoalofdatadebuggingistolocateand

errors, which can automatically delete or cut off certain parts ofthe inputs. To debug the input data, Lukas et al. [

3 OUR APPROACH
Inthissection,wepresentadetaileddescriptionofourapproach.
First, we show a motivation example. Next, we employ linear re-
gression to model biased features. Finally, we present our method
Linear-regression based Training Data Debugging (LTDD).
3.1 Motivation Example
InSection1,wequotedareport[ 8]aboutAmazonfairnessissues
to show that, when biased features appear in the training data, ML
software might discriminate between privileged and unprivileged
groups. Here, we propose a more detailed motivation exampleto show why and how features are biased, i.e., why features areconsidered related to sensitive features and how they cause MLsoftware unfairness. This example is also helpful to demonstrate
the following steps in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.

Figure 1(a), we have the following observations:
•Biasbetweenracegroupsisobservedintrainingdata.Thereareobviouslydifferentratesoffavorablelabels(no-reoffend)
between privileged (white) and unprivileged (non-white)
groups,e.g.,allthreewhitepeoplearelabeledasno-reoffend
(the favorable decision). In contrast, only one out of three
non-white is labeled as no-reoffend.
•Why“Age”containsracebias?Thereisahighassociation
between“Race”and“Age”:the“Age”valuesoftheprivileged
group(threewhitepeople)arerelativelymuch largerthan
that of the unprivileged group (three non-white people).
•How“Age” causesML software biased,even without know-
ing “Race” information? Since larger “Age” values ( >33)
imply white people, the race bias may be introduced by the
“Age” values when training ML software.
3.2 Linear Regression Modeling
As discussed above, some features in the training data might be
biased,leadingtounfairnessinMLsoftware.Toobtainunbiased

betweenthesensitivefeature“Race”andthenon-sensitivefeature“Age”inthissnippet.
In Section 6.2, we will extend the scope to the whole set of COMPAS dataset.

information as possible.
The main idea of our training data debugging is to apply the
linear regression equation [ 50] to analyze the association between
non-sensitive features and sensitive features, which is a simple but
effective method applied in many SE research areas, such as defect
prediction [ 49] and software effort estimation [ 12]. Specifically, we
buildalinearregressionmodelforthenon-sensitivefeatures 𝑥𝑛on
the sensitive features 𝑥𝑠:
𝑥𝑛=𝑎+𝑏·𝑥𝑠+𝜇 (1)
where the symbols 𝑎,𝑏, and𝜇denote the population regression
intercept, slope, and residual, respectively. We employ Wald test
[30] with𝑡-distribution to check whether the null hypothesis (that
the slope of the linear regression model is zero) holds. When the 𝑝-
values≥0.05,weignorethecurrentnon-sensitivefeatureandmove
tothenext;otherwise,weconsiderthat 𝑥𝑛containssignificant bias
and conduct the following steps to estimate and exclude bias.
By calculating on values of 𝑥𝑛and𝑥𝑠in training data of ML
software, we obtain the estimates ˆ𝑎andˆ𝑏for𝑎and𝑏, respectively.
Basedontheaboveestimates,wehavethefollowingequationto
measure the association between 𝑥𝑛and𝑥𝑠:
ˆ𝑥𝑛=ˆ𝑎+ˆ𝑏·𝑥𝑠 (2)
whereˆ𝑥𝑛couldbeconsideredasthepredictedvaluegeneratedfrom
Equation 1. Intuitively, ˆ𝑥𝑛is the explained variance in the original
non-sensitivefeatures 𝑥𝑛bythesensitive feature 𝑥𝑠.Weconsider
ˆ𝑥𝑛as thebiasedpart of𝑥𝑛, remove ˆ𝑥𝑛from𝑥𝑛, and denote the
remaining unbiased part as 𝑥𝑢𝑛:
𝑥𝑢
𝑛=𝑥𝑛−ˆ𝑥𝑛 (3)
Fig.1(b)andFig.1(c)showthedetailofcalculatingthesample
estimates and the remaining values based on the six samples in
Fig. 1(a). In detail, after translating categorical variables white/non-
white into numerical variables 1/0, we have the following linear
regression equations:
/bracketleftbig36,38,34,30,32,28/bracketrightbig𝑇=𝑎+𝑏·/bracketleftbig1,1,1,0,0,0/bracketrightbig𝑇+𝜇(4)
We find that 𝑝-value <0.05 and obtain the estimates ˆ𝑎=30 and
ˆ𝑏=6.Finally,weobtaintheunbiasedagevalue Age𝑢bysubtracting
the predicted values ˆAge=30+6·Race:Age𝑢=Age−ˆAge.A s
can be seen in Fig. 1(c), the distributions of “Age” values underprivileged and unprivileged groups become independent of “Race”
afterremovingthebiasedparts,i.e.,therevised“Age”valuesintwo
groups are the same.
3.3 Our Method
Based on the linear regression model, we propose our algorithm
Linear-regression based Training Data Debugging (LTDD), shown
in Algorithm 1.
Given the training dataset S𝑡𝑟={/angbracketleftx1,𝑦1/angbracketright,···,/angbracketleftx𝑛,𝑦𝑛/angbracketright}, where
forany𝑗(1≤𝑗≤𝑛),x𝑗=[𝑥𝑗
1,...,𝑥𝑗
𝑑]isa𝑑-dimensionvectorto
denote𝑑featurevalues, 𝑥𝑗
𝑑isassumedtobethesensitivefeature
valueandtheothervalues 𝑥𝑗
1,···,𝑥𝑗
𝑑−1arenon-sensitivefeature
values, and 𝑦𝑗∈{0,1}, our method LTDD comprises the following
three steps:
(1)Identify the biased features and estimate the biased parts of
them.For each non-sensitive feature 𝑥𝑖, we evaluate the as-
sociation between the sensitive features 𝑥𝑑and𝑥𝑖in the
training dataset. It is worth noting that, since the associa-
tionbetweensomenon-sensitivefeaturesandthesensitive
feature may be trivial, we employ Wald test (line 7) with
𝑡-distribution to check whether the null hypothesis (that
the slope ˆ𝑏of the linear regression model is zero) holds.
Specifically,weintroducethe 𝑝-valueofWaldtesttoavoid
unnecessaryremoving steps, i.e., consider “ 𝑝-value <0.05”
(line 8) as a precondition. If “ 𝑝-value <0.05” holds, we cal-
culate the estimates ˆ𝑎𝑖andˆ𝑏𝑖of the linear regression model
(line 9), which are sorted in E𝑎andE𝑏(line 10).
(2)Exclude the bias parts from training samples. In this step, for
any training sample /angbracketleftx𝑗,𝑦𝑗/angbracketright, we conduct the following two
operators to eliminate bias: deleting the sensitive feature
(line 12) and revising the non-sensitive feature values by
removing the association (line 13-14). After that, we build a
(fair) ML software SMLbased on the revised and unbiased
training dataset (line 15), i.e., SML:R𝑑−1→{0,1}.
(3)Apply the same revision on the testing samples. As we revised
thedimensionanddistributionoftrainingdata,weapplythe
samerevisiononthetestingsample x𝑡𝑒tofitMLsoftware
(line 16-18), i.e., delete the sensitive feature and revise the
other attributes by the estimates E𝑎[𝑖]andE𝑏[𝑖]calculated
on the training samples. Finally, we use SMLto predict the
label of x𝑡𝑒(line 19).

4.2 Baseline Methods
As described in Section 3, our method LTDD is a pre-processing
method,i.e.,debuggingtrainingdatabeforetheconstructionofML
software to reduce the bias. We introduce four fairness methods
as the baselines: two state-of-the-art methods Fairway at FSE’2020
andFair-SmoteatFSE’2021,andtwowidelyusedpre-processing
methodsReweighingandDisparateImpactRemover(DIR)forcom-
parison.

Our code for implementing LTDD and allbaselines is based on
Python3.7.6,whereReweighingandDIRareimplementedusing
AIF360 [16] (version 0.3.0).
4.3 Prediction Settings and Classifiers
Following the training and testing process in Fairway [ 23], we
randomly divide thestudied datasetinto twoparts: 85%is usedto
preprocessandtrain4,andtheremaining15%isusedasthetestset.
Since our studied methods have randomness, as shown in Figure 2,
we repeat our experiment 100 times to reduce this influence.
Like the previous researches on fairness testing, we introduce
logisticregressionmodel[ 23,24]asamainclassifiertotestfairness
in this experiment. To test the effect of our method under other
classifiers,wealsoemployNaiveBayesandSVM,whicharealso
widelyusedclassifiersinSEresearch[ 38,41].Whenweimplement
allclassifiers,weemploythedefaultsettingsoftheSklearnmodule.
4.4 Fairness and Performance Metrics
Asreportedin[ 17],theincreasingofsoftwarefairnessmaydamage
theperformance,whichiscalledtheaccuracy-fairnesstradeoff.Our
experiment focuses on both fairness and performance metrics to
check the relationship between fairness and performance changed
after applying fairness methods to ML software.

without validation,we employ the total 85% (70%+15%) for training.FairnessMetrics. DisparateImpact(DI)andStatisticalParity

SML,thesample x,thelabel 𝑦,the
predicted ˆ𝑦=SML(x)ofx,andthesensitivefeature 𝑥𝑠,wedefine
Disparate Impact and Statistical Parity Difference as follows:
Disparate Impact (DI) [27]. It indicates the ratio of the probabili-
tiesoffavorableresultsobtainedbytheunprivileged( 𝑥𝑠=0)and
privileged ( 𝑥𝑠=1) classes.
DI=𝑝(ˆ𝑦=1|𝑥𝑠=0)/𝑝(ˆ𝑦=1|𝑥𝑠=1)
StatisticalParityDifference (SPD)[21].ItissimilartoDI,butit
represents the difference between the unprivileged and privileged
classes to obtain favorable results.
SPD=𝑝(ˆ𝑦=1|𝑥𝑠=0)−𝑝(ˆ𝑦=1|𝑥𝑠=1)
WhenreportingDI,wecalculateitsabsolutedistancefrom1,i.e.,
|1−DI|[19]. While for SPD, we report the absolute value result
|SPD|[23].
We take DI and SPD as the main fairness metrics due to the
following reasons. (a) DI and SPD are designed to indicate thedifference between the decision distributions of privileged and
unprivilegedindividuals,whichisspecificallyprohibitedbyanti-
discriminationlaws[ 27];(b)Basedontheircalculation,DIandSPD
areindependentofthelabelinformationaboutthedecisions(i.e.,
theyneedonlytheprediction ˆ𝑦=SML(x)ratherthanthelabel 𝑦),
whichissuspectedofcontainingbias[ 23].Besides,inSection6.3,
we will present the results under other fairness metrics, including
AOD and EOD [15].
PerformanceMetrics: weintroducethreeperformancemetrics
to measure the performance of the classifiers.
Accuracy (ACC for short). It measures the ratio of correct pre-
dictions on total data:
ACC =(|𝑇𝑃|+|𝑇𝑁|)/|𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙|
where𝑇𝑃denotesthetruepositivesamples, 𝑇𝑁denotesthetrue
negative samples, and 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙denotes the total samples.
Recall. Recall represents the probability of being predicted as
positive samples in samples that are actually positive:
Recall =|𝑇𝑃|/(|𝑇𝑃|+|𝐹𝑁|)
where𝐹𝑁denotes the false negative samples.
False Alarm. It is also called the false positive rate:
False Alarm =|𝐹𝑃|/(|𝐹𝑃|+|𝑇𝑁|)
where𝐹𝑃denotes the false positive samples.
Whencalculatingtheseaboveindicators(includingbothfairness
andperformance),weemployPythonAIF360module[ 16]which
integrates all these indicators.
4.5 Analysis Method
Toverifywhetherthedifferencebetweenthemetricvaluesobtained
by our method and the baselines is statistically significant, we use
the Wilcoxon rank sum test [ 26]. If the difference between the two
setsofresultsissignificant,thenthe 𝑝-valueobtainedbythetest
should be less than 0.05.
Then,tomeasuretheeffectsizeofthetwosetsofresults,weuse
Cliff’sdelta 𝛿[36].Ifthevalueof |𝛿|islessthan0.147,thedifference
between the two sets is negligible; if it is greater than 0.147 but

if it is greater than 0.474, then the difference between the two is

According to 𝑝-value and 𝛿value, we mark “W/T/L” [ 33,34] for
twosetsofcomparedresults.“W”meansourresultwins,wherethe
corresponding 𝑝-valueislessthan0.05,andthe 𝛿valueisgreater
than 0.147. “L” means our results lose, where the 𝑝-value is less
than 0.05, and the 𝛿value is smaller than -0.147. Otherwise, the
situation is “T”, which means the two sets of results are tied.
5 EXPERIMENT RESULTS
In this section, we present the results of our three RQs, along with
their motivations, approaches, and findings.
RQ1: How well does our algorithm improve the
fairness of ML software?
MotivationandApproach. Wefirstneedtocheckwhetherour
methodcaneliminatethediscriminationthatexistsintrainingdata.
Meanwhile,wehopethatourmethodcandamagetheperformance
of ML software as little as possible. The main classifier used in this
RQisthelogisticregressionmodel.Toeliminatetheinfluenceof
randomness, we repeat the experiment 100 times and report the
averagevalues.Wecomparetheresultsofourmethodandbaselines
under five indicators: (a) DI and SPD as fairness indicators, and (b)
ACC, Recall, and False Alarm as performance indicators.
Results. InFigure3,wereportthechangeofourmethodsapplying
to original ML software. The blue and orange bars in the figurerepresent the changes in
|1−DI|and|SPD|, respectively. Based
on the calculation of |1−DI|and|SPD|, the smaller the value of
|1−DI|and|SPD|, the fairer the prediction result of the model.
Therefore, the more negative the difference observed, the more
ourmethodimproves thefairnessofthe standardclassifier.Itcan
be seen that our method LTDD significantly improves the fairness
of the standard classifier in most scenarios. Especially, on Compas
dataset, LTDD reduces the value of |1−DI|by 1.2.
Besides, the other three bars represent the changes of ACC,
Recall,andFalseAlarm.Ascanbeseen,ourmethodhasminimal
impactontheperformanceofMLsoftwareinmostscenarios.Evenunder the two data sets COMPAS and German, our method has
surprisingly improved the Recall of the original ML software.
Answer to RQ1: Our method can greatly improve the fairness
of the original ML software and slightly damage its perfor-
mance.
RQ2: How well does LTDD perform compared
with the state-of-the-art fairness algorithms?
Motivation and Approach. We compare our method LTDD with
the state-of-the-art algorithms to see if our method can perform
betterthanthesealgorithms.Wehopethatourmethodcanachievethat,comparedwithbaselines,(a)itcanbetterimprovethefairnessof ML software; (b) the negative impact of our algorithm on perfor-mancewouldbelessorcomparable.SimilartoRQ1,thisRQapplies
the logistic regression model as the main classifier and repeats the
experiment 100 times to eliminate the influence of randomness.
Results for fairness. The comparison results under fairness met-
ricsareshowninTable2.Thegraybackgroundinthetableindicates
thatourmethodhaswontheresultofthebaseline(theWilcoxon
𝑝-valueislessthan0.05,andtheCliff’sdelta 𝛿isgreaterthan0.147).
The black background indicates that our method loses to the base-
line (the Wilcoxon 𝑝-value is less than 0.05, and the Cliff’s delta
𝛿islessthan-0.147).Thewhitebackgroundindicatesatie.Itcan
be seen that: (1) Our method is superior to other baselines in most
cases in terms of average values (less values means more fairness).
(2)Ourmethodhaswonthebaselinesin37outof55casesunder
DIand38outof55casesunderSPD.(3)Comparedwiththebest
baseline Fair-Smote, LTDD has comparable performance under DI
(3winsand3losses),whileitperformsbetterunderSPD(5wins
and 3 losses). We conclude that our method significantly improves
the fairness of ML software and surpasses the baselines in most
cases.

It can be seen that our method has the least number of losses in

there are 10 and 6 cases that produce losses, respectively.
Answer to RQ2a: With three different classifiers, our method
stilldefeatsbaselines inmostcasesunderfairnessindicators
and also has the least loss under ACC and False Alarm.
RQ3: Is our method actionable for fairness
improvement in realistic scenarios?
Motivation and Approach. In previous RQs, we have compared
the prediction results of our method and baselines, and the results
haveshownthatourmethodcangeneratefairerpredictions.Inthis
RQ, we introduce a new indicator, the rate of favorable decisions ,t o
measuretheactionabilityoffairnessmethods.Ourmeasurement
is basedon the followingpoints: (a)in realistic scenarios,the rate
offavorabledecisionsislimitedduetothefinitesocialresources,
e.g., for the loan application, the rate of “approval” is restricted; (b)
beforeapplyingfairnessmethods,originalMLsoftwarehasmade
favorable and unfavorable decisions, among which the original
favorableratecouldbeconsideredasabenchmark;(c)afterapplying
fairness methods,ML softwaremight changethe favorablerate. If
thefavorablerateessentiallyincreases,itwouldalsoraisetheneed
for social resources, even beyond the boundaries of available social
resources,reducingactionability.InthisRQ,wewillcompareour
method with Fair-Smote under the new indicator.
Results. The result of the comparison is shown in Figure 4, where
we employ two endpoints to indicate the favorable rates of the
privileged and non-privileged classes and connect them to drawa line. The short horizontal stroke indicates the whole favorable
rate. The figure’s red, blue, and green points represent the original
value, the result of Fair-smote, and that of LTDD, respectively.
Itcanbeseenthatinmost(10outof11)cases,thewaythatLTDD
improvesfairnessistoincreasethefavorablerateofnon-privilegedclasses and to reduce the favorable rate of privileged classes, sothat the whole favorable rate is very closeto the original value.
Thismeansthatourmethoddoesnotneedmoresocialresourcesto
achieveinmostcases.Onthecontrary,Fair-Smotetriestoincreasethefavorablerateofprivilegedandnon-privilegedclasses,resultinginasignificantincreaseofthewholefavorablerate.Forexample,ontheAdultdataset,thewholefavorablerateofFair-Smoteincreases
about 1.5 times. This means that the implementation of Fair-Smote
needs much more social resources.
Answer to RQ3: Our method improves the fairness indicators
while ensuring that the whole favorable rate is close to the
original value and does not need more social resources.
6 DISCUSSION
WefurtherdiscusstheaimsandresultsofourmethodLTDDinthe
following six points.
6.1 Distribution of biased features
As described in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, we judge whether features
are biased according to the 𝑝-value generated by Wald test [ 30]
of linear regression model. Here we calculate the distribution of
biased features with 𝑝-value <0.05.
Figure5showstheaverageproportionofbiasedfeaturesin11
scenarios, where the blue bars indicate the proportion. We can see
thatin8outofthe11scenes,thepercentsofbiasedfeaturesareover
60%. In the COMPAS data set, when the race isused as a sensitive
feature, all other features are considered biased, which means that
thehighassociationwiththesensitivefeatureisuniversalinthe
data set. Besides, we have also observed that the proportions of
biasedfeaturesinthethreedatasets,Bank,Student,andGerman,
arethelowestthree.AccordingtotheresultsofRQ1,thefairness
optimization effect of these three data sets is also the worst among
alldatasets.Wearguethattheproportionofbiasedfeaturesmay
be related to the fairness improvement effect of LTDD.
6.2 A case study on the COMPAS dataset
This section will use an example to show how our method elimi-
natesbiasedpartsfrombiasedfeatures,narrowingthedifferencein

6.3Performanceunderotherfairnessindicators
As observed in previous studies [ 18], there may be conflicts be-
tween different fairness indicators. To verify the performance of
ourmethodunderotherfairnessindicators,wecompareourmethod
withthestate-of-the-artmethodFair-Smotemethodunderother
two indicators AOD and EOD [15] with three classifiers.
ThedifferencebetweentheresultsofourmethodandFair-Smote
is shown in Table 6. As can be seen from the table, our methodis slightlybetterthan Fair-Smotein most scenarios.The average
value of the two indicators of our method in the three classifiers is
lower (lower means more fairness) than Fair-Smote. Except for the
EODindicatorunderSVM,thenumberofwinsforourmethodis
greaterthan thenumberoflosses. Combinedwiththeconclusion
in RQ2, it can be seen that our method has a greater improvement
under other fairness indicators compared to Fair-Smote.
6.4 Differences between DI and SPD

(a) We give a case study to show the differences between DI and
SPD. Given two groups 𝐴,𝐵and their favorable rates under two

obtain the following results:
DI(𝑓1)=𝑟1
𝐴/𝑟1
𝐵=1.6
DI(𝑓2)=𝑟2
𝐴/𝑟2
𝐵=1.5
SPD(𝑓1)=𝑟1
𝐴−𝑟1
𝐵=0.12
SPD(𝑓2)=𝑟1
𝐴−𝑟1
𝐵=0.2
Wewoulddrawdifferentconclusionsfromthecomparisonbetween
𝑓1and𝑓2underDIandSPD:forDI, 𝑓2performsbetterthan 𝑓1(more
close to 1 means better); for SPD, 𝑓1performs better than 𝑓2(more
close to 0 means better).
(b) We compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between the
values of DI and SPD in 11 studied scenarios for five methods. We
observe that the coefficient is very small in some scenarios, e.g.,
0.08 for the German dataset, which means the values of DI and
SPDdonothavehighcorrelations.Hence,oneofthemcannotbe
directly substituted for the other.
6.5 Performance with other association
approaches?
This paper employs the linear regression model to obtain the as-
sociation between features. It is unclear how other association
approacheswork.Inthissection,weconductanexperimentwith
anotherassociationapproach,polynomialregression,whichisan
extension of simple linear regression:
𝑥𝑛=𝑎+𝑏1·𝑥𝑠+𝑏2·𝑥2
𝑠+···+𝑏𝑑·𝑥𝑑

where𝑥𝑠and𝑥𝑛denote sensitive and non-sensitive features. To
makethefittingresulthavealargedifferencefromthelinearregres-sion,wesetthedegree(
𝑑)ofthepolynomialto20(linearregression

We compare the results of linear regression and polynomial
regressionunderfairnessindicators.Weobservethatinmostcases,theresultsbetweenthetwomethodsarecomparable,andtheresults
of linear regression are significantly better/worse in 4/1 scenarios.
6.6 Insight of our method
Our method LTDD explores a simple but effective model, linear
regression,toidentify,estimate,andremovethehighassociation
between non-sensitive features and sensitive features as the biased
parts of the non-sensitive features. The results of our experiments
support the claim that LTDD can largely improve the fairness of
MLsoftware,withlessorcomparabledamagetoitsperformance.
Our study may lead to three insights for the following studies in
the fairness of ML software:
(a) The distribution and association of feature values in training
datawouldbehelpfultoestimateandimprovethefairnessofML
software. We encourage following researchers to employ more
effective methods to model the feature distribution and association.
(b) Although ML software is much different from traditional
software,theresearchmethodsintraditionalSEarealsoapplicable
to the related research topic of ML software and can achieve good
performance.Weencouragefollowingresearcherstoapplymore
traditional SE methods and ideas to the research of ML software.
(c) For fairness research, our study provides a new practical
perspective: we employ the rate of favorable decisions to measurethe actionability of fairness methods, which indicates the actual
costofsocialresourcesforfairnessmethods.Wehopethatfuture
researchers can take into account the actual cost while focusing on
fairness.
7 THREATS TO VALIDITY
In this section, we discuss the threats to validity of our approach.
First of all, the choice of data set may be a threat. We employ
9datasetswidelyusedinfairnesstestingtoevaluateourmethod.
However,thesedatasetsmaynotbesufficient,becausethedistri-
bution and characteristics of different data sets are not the same.
We will introduce more datasets to test our method in the future.
Second, the choice of classifiers may be a threat. In the exper-
iment, we mainly use the logistic regression model for fairness
testing,whichisusedinmanyfairnessstudies,buttheinfluenceofthemethodondifferentlearnersmaybedifferent.Althoughwealso
testtheperformanceundertheothertwolearners,therearestillmore complex learners worth experimenting with. In the future,
wewilltesthowourmethodperformsincomplexneuralnetworks.
Finally, thefairness indicators we use may also be a threat. Pre-
vious studies have pointed out that there may be contradictions
betweendifferentfairnessindicators.Therearesomanyfairness
indicators proposed at present, and it is impossible to satisfy all
fairnessindicators[ 24].Therefore,theindicatorsshouldbeselected
reasonablyaccordingtotheactualscenario.Inthepaper,wemainly
discusstheresultsunderDIandSPD,andchecktheeffectofour
method under other indicators in the discussion.
8 CONCLUSION
The widespread usage of machine learning software has raised
concerns about its fairness. More and more SE researchers havepaid attention to the fairness of ML software. The training set is
consideredtobeoneofthereasonsforthebiasofMLsoftware.This
paper adopts a new perspective: the root cause of the unfairness
could be biased features in training data.
Toobtainfeaturesunbiased,wetrytodebugfeaturevaluesin
training data: identify which features and which parts of them are
biasedandexcludethebiasedpartsofsuchfeatures.Toachievethisgoal,weproposeanovelmethod, Linear-regressionbased Training
DataDebugging (LTDD), which employs the linear regression
modeltoidentifythebiasedfeatures.Weintroduceninedatasetstoevaluateourmethodandcompareourmethodswithfourbaselines.
The results show that our method performs better in improving
thefairnessindicators,anddamagestheperformanceslightly.In
thefuture,wehopetoconductresearchonmoreextensivedatasets
to explore different characteristics of the datasets.
