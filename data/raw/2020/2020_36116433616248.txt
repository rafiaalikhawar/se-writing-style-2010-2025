ABSTRACT
Continuousintegrationanddeployment(CI/CD)isnowawidely
adopted development model in practice as it reduces the time from
ideastocustomers.Thisadoptionhasalsorevivedtheideaof"shift-

andpreventdefectsearlyinthesoftwaredeliveryprocess.Toas-
sist with that, engineering systemsintegrate developer bots in the
developmentwork/f_lowtoimprovedeveloperproductivityandhelp
themidentifyissuesearly inthe software delivery process.
In this paper, we present a case study of developer bots in Mi-
crosoft.Weidentifyandanalyze23developerbotsthataredeployed
across13,000repositoriesandassistabout6,000developersdaily
in their CI/CD software development work/f_lows. We classify these
bots across /f_ive major categories: Con/f_ig Violation, Security, Data-
privacy, Developer Productivity, and Code Quality. By conducting
interviewsandsurveyswithbotdevelopersandbotusersandby
analyzing about half a million historical bot actions spanning over
one and a half years, we present software work/f_lows that motivate
botinstrumentation,factorsimpactingtheirusefulnessasperceived
bybotusers,andchallengesassociatedwiththeiruse.Our/f_indings
echo existing issues with bots, such as noise, and illustrate new
bene/f_its (e.g., cross-team communication) and challenges (e.g., too
manybots)for large software teams.

1 INTRODUCTION
Softwaredevelopmenthasmovedtowardscontinuitythroughmeth-
ods likeAgile [ 21]andDevOps [ 13]. Theemphasis oncontinuous
delivery,includingcontinuousintegration[ 17]helpsteamstoreact
tomarketchangesfaster[ 23].However,fastdeliveryinitselfisnot
a success metric as there is little value in having continuous deliv-
ery pipelines release erroneous code into production at speed [ 26].
To prevent this, teams have developed the culture to ‘shift left’, i.e.,
‘/f_ind and prevent issues early’ in the development life cycle: the
more issues you /f_ind early, the faster it is to /f_ix them and reduce
delivery time [ 22,41,47].
Automationisanessentialcomponentinshiftingleftasteams

ture [40,41] – and developer support bots play a signi/f_icant role in
the automationstrategyto assist developers in their development
work/f_low [ 25,49]. Developer bots can be de/f_ined as a "conduit
or interface between users and services that could be further en-
hanced through a conversational interface, personalization and
memory"[ 43].Softwaredevelopershavebeenincreasinglyusing
developer bots in open source [ 51] and industry [ 46] for tasks like
/f_ixing bugs, automating testing, refactoring code, and performance
analysis[ 29,51].
Developing eﬀective developer bots requires improving both
their functional aspects (e.g., technology) [ 29,34,37,46,55] and
user-centered factors like communication, expectations [ 44] and
noise [16,51]. While existing research highlights both bene/f_its and
challengesfacedbyindividualdevelopersacrossdiﬀerentorganiza-
tionalcontexts,welackanunderstandingofthechallengeslarge
organizations face in eﬀectively deploying and managing multiple
developer bots and how multiple bots operating simultaneously

2 RELATED WORK
Betterautomationcapabilities (e.g., throughArti/f_icialIntelligence
andsoftwareframeworks)areleadingtothedevelopmentofsmarter
bots that are more integrated into people’s work/f_lows. Online
communities are increasingly employing bots to automate vari-
oustasksandoﬄoadtheworkofhumans.Botsenforcenormson
Wikipedia [ 19], /f_ight vandalism [ 38], perform task routing [ 11], or
handle Q&A on Stackover/f_low [ 34]. Social bots in Twitter [ 2] have
alsobeencalled"automatedsocialactors"becauseofaggregating
andpresenting tweetsoractivelytweeting themselves.
Insoftwareengineeringaswell,overtheyears,developersare
increasingly using bots in tasks like agile team management [ 1,
29], pull request management [ 51], code refactoring [ 54], auto-
matic dependency management [ 32], development support envi-
ronment [ 24], automated static analysis [ 10,12]). To consolidate
andfacilitatethestudyofthesegrowingdiversebots,earlyresearch
proposed a high-level categorization of "Code," "Test," "DevOps,"
"Documentation," and "Support" bots [ 43] or categories that cap-
ture their intrinsic and environmental properties [ 36]. Storey et
al. [43] de/f_ine bots as "conduits to automated services" and encom-
pass many bot applications studied on GitHub, such as ensuring
licenseagreements, reporting failures, and running tests [ 49]. Such
use cases have found wide acceptabilityacross practitionersin in-
dustry [15]. However, there is an increasing demand for smarter
bots that can also oﬄoad the burden of routine tasks from develop-
ers [15].
Figure 1: Development pipeline depicting the role of bots in
diﬀerentstagesofsoftwaredevelopmentandtheabilityto

Due to most bots currently providing a "support" role, devel-
opers have to manage feedback both from their peers and bots,
increasingtheirworkload.Withseveralbotsoperatingonthesame
codebase, researchsuggests thatincreasingdeveloper fatigue [ 34]
limits bot usefulness [ 8]. By surfacing crash reports, welcoming
newcomers,andalertingdevelopersofsensitivecodebase[ 18,49]
on public mediums like pull-requests, bots also add a social dimen-
sion as the developers’ response to bots is publicly visible. Thus,
explanations of the bot’s actions, clarity of their recommendations,
andcorrectnesshaveallbeenfoundtoimpactperceivedusefulness
and trust, in addition to their functional characteristics [ 34]. To
manage severaldiﬀerentbots,Wesseletal.[ 50]alsoproposedthe
idea of meta-bots that act as a "middleware" between developers
and individual bots. This separation provides additional bene/f_its
like minimizing bot noise by providing additional controls for bot
operations.
However,insightsonbotsfromindividualsacrossorganizational
contexts do not allow us to understand how bots might work in
large softwareorganizationswhere teamsfollow establishedorga-
nizationalworkpractices[ 17,56]underexplicitlystructuredteams
from top to bottom. Knowledge about processes that bots auto-
mateinlargesoftwareinfrastructures,complexitiesarisingfrom
integratingactionsofseveralbots,andcomparingdiﬀerenttypes
of bots can help inform developer bots that automate tasks with
minimal disruptionto developers.
3 BACKGROUNDAND STUDYCONTEXT
This study was conducted at the US division of Microsoft. The
companyusesthewidelyadoptedCI/CDpipeline[ 17]forsoftware
development. In thispaper, we study a bot ecosystem within the
organization that supports developers in diﬀerent stages of the
CI/CDpipeline.Developersandprojectmanagersplanprojectsand
tasks on work-item boards (online task planners), resulting in a
prioritizedbacklog.Then,theywritecodetoaddressthebacklog
andmovethesoftwaredevelopmentprocessforward.Afterlocal
testing, developers open up a pull-request (PR) in the development
environmentandrequestcodereviewfromtheirpeers.Botssupport
this work/f_low through numerous automations (e.g., code coverage,
static analysis checks, and test suites). Developersreceive feedback
1269A CaseStudyof DeveloperBots: Motivations, Perceptions, andChallenges ESEC/FSE ’23, December3–9, 2023,San Francisco, CA, USA
from code reviews and the various developer bots in an iterative
cycle (e.g., policy checks, build results, code coverage, test runs).
Oncethedeveloperhasaddressedallthefeedback(fromtheirpeers
and developer bots), they complete the pull-request. After that,
the updated code gets deployed to the staging environment and
progressivelytodiﬀerentproductionringsandthecustomer.The
overall goal of this pipeline is to make the development process as
eﬃcientaspossiblewhilereducingthetimefromplanningtothe
deploymentphase(Figure 1)sothatvaluecanbedeployedtothe
customer faster. Thus, developers spend a lot of eﬀort to ensure
thatbugsandvulnerabilitiesaredetectedasearlyaspossibleinthe
pipeline ("shiftleft").
At the time of the study, the platform has been active in the
companyfortwoandahalfyears,impactingabout6,000developers
(seeTable 2).Table1describesthekeyterminologiesusedinthe
paper to refer to the diﬀerent roles of developers in the context of
bots andsoftware development.
The bot platform acts as a middleware between the develop-
mentenvironmentandindividualbots.Itprovidesbotsaccessto
the development environment (pull requests, work-items, build-
environment) and the associated data (e.g., commits, code reviews,
comments).Botscanperformdiﬀerentactions(e.g.,creatingpull-

4 STUDYMETHODOLOGY
We followed a mixed methods approach to study the usage of bots
andtheirbene/f_its&challengeswithintheorganization.Weused
semi-structured interviews to understand the bene/f_its and chal-
lenges of developing and using bots. We validate our interview
/f_indings of bot use through a follow-up survey and supplement
our /f_indings with an analysis of historical bot use data. In addition
to describing the method in the paper, we provide details of the
interviews, interview codes, survey, and log data in supplementary
materials[ 5].
Werefertodeveloperswhodevelopedthebotsas“botdevelopers”
and developers who use the bots in their software engineering
work/f_lowsas“botusers”(seeTable 1).Both“botdevelopers”and
“botusers”aresoftwaredeveloperswithinMicrosoft.BetweenMay
2021 - August 2021, we interviewed 13 bot developers and 9 bot
users and administered a follow-up survey to 56 bot users. Table 3
summarizes participant details.
Bot developers We used bot documentations that described
their role, bot’s data logs, and contact information of their develop-
erstogatherinformationaboutthebots.Usingthesedocumenta-
tions, we invited all 21 bot developers for 30-45 minute interviews
and 13 accepted our invite. We also invited two bot platform de-
velopers for the interview, andboth accepted the invite. We asked
themabout–1)theirmotivationsfor developingthebots,2)ease
or diﬃculty with bot development, and 3) ease or diﬃculty with
bot maintenance.
Bot users To recruit bot users, we analyzed bot usage logs and
identi/f_ieddeveloperswhoauthoredorreviewedatleasttwopull-
requestswherebotsperformedactionspriortothestudy.Wherever
possible, we considered at least three users for each bot type in
our recruitment list to ensure our list covered all bots. A total of
21 developerssatis/f_ied this criteria,and we invitedthem for 15-30
minuteinterviews.Ofthese, nineacceptedtheinvitetodiscusstheir

their reasons, 4) if they ever gave feedback to the bot and what
channelsdidthey use to give feedback.
We conducted semi-structured interviews remotely via video
calls,withoneresearchteammemberleadingtheinterviewsand
takingnotes.Beforethestartofeachsession,weobtainedinformed
consent from the participants. We also familiarized participants
with the study’s objective and explicitly mentioned thevoluntary
natureoftheresearch.Ifparticipantsconsented,werecordedthe
interviews; otherwise, one research team member took notes. The
study wasapprovedbythe institutional reviewboard.
We analyzed the interviews using thematic analysis [ 7]. The
interview data consisted of about 18 hours of recordings and notes
taken during the interviews. The lead author went through the
interview transcriptions and notes over multiple passes and as-
signedopencodeslinebylinetothetranscripts.Forbotdevelopers,
the codes captured motivations for developing the bots (e.g., in-
crease test coverage, reduce review time) and challenges in bot
development(e.g.,unclearmetricsforsuccess,noinformationon
engagement). For bot users, the codes captured the developer’s
opinionsaboutbotuseandassociatedproblems(e.g.,providingtoo
many suggestions helps /f_ind reviewers). The lead author discussed
the emerging codes with the study team members over multiple
passes and revised the codes, merging overlapping codes and re-
/f_ining the coding to yield a set of /f_inal codes. The /f_inal codes were
then categorized into themes using aﬃnity diagramming [ 20]. We
used Miro board1for the aﬃnity diagramming step. We followed
the best practices in HCI to ensure reliability when coding and
discussingcodes[ 30].Figure3illustratesthecodesthatemerged
from the interviews.
Botusesurvey Tofurtherre/f_ineandvalidateourinsightsofthe
/f_indingsfrombotuserinterviews,we usedtheinterview /f_indings
todevelopasurveyofbotusers(N=54).Thesurveyhadfourparts:
asking developers about their 1) awareness of the bots, 2) when
and why they /f_ind the recommendations useful, 3) when and why
they /f_ind the recommendations not useful, and 4) if and when they
everprovidedany feedback tothe bot.The fourpartsofthe survey
align with the parts of the bot user interviews asking about bot
awareness, scenarios when bots were useful, and not useful, and
aboutprovidingfeedbacktothebots.Eachquestionwasmultiple
choice, and the answers to the multiple choice questions were pop-
ulatedfromtheinsightswederivedfromthebotuserinterviews.
We ensured completeness by providing an "other" /f_ield for each
response and an open-ended "Any other feedback" question at the
endofthesurvey.Weanalyzedfree-textresponsessimilartoour
interviews by coding them and grouping them into themes. We
administered the survey to about 360 developers who had come
across at least one bot recommendation between January 2021 -
July 2021 (response rate 15%) when working on their pull-requests.
At the beginning of the survey, we provided a screenshot of an

provide recommendations to developers, and it is diﬃcult to as-
sesswhetherdevelopersacceptedthatrecommendationunlessthey
like/dislike or reply to bot recommendations (see Section 3). De-
velopers rarely have the time to provide such additional signals,
and even if they do, assessing whether the bot saved the devel-
oper’s time in software development is diﬃcult because of several
confounding factors. Developers ofthe bot "ThreatModelQuality"
mention(P10)
We do not have a way to tell if developers /f_ind value
in our recommendations. Developers do not reply to
each recommendation’s feedback template, so we are
leftwithusing proxymetrics forassessingvalue.
O2 Assessing clarity of bot recommendations Many bots
that/f_lag issuesin pull-requestsalso provide the next steps tohelp
usersresolve the issue(e.g.,highlightinglinesincode that violate
con/f_igurations or security policies). Bot developers struggled to
improvetheclarityofthebotrecommendationsduetothelackofa
structured method to assess the feedback of bot users coming from
thebotrecommendationchannel.Forexample,securitybotsuse

our bot suggests based on the bot user’s feedback. We
address each feedback one by one, and the process is
cumbersome.
O3Tunebotthresholds Twobots("CloudProtect"and"CodeIn-
sights") have the functionality to con/f_igure the type and threshold
of recommendations that they surface to bot users. For example,the "CodeInsights" bot generates crash reports for library function
calls by checking if the number of crash occurrences of a library
functioncallhasexceededaminimumthresholdinsoftwarebuilds.
"Reviewer"botthatsuggestscodereviewersusesa thresholdfora

developers found bots useful when they 1) helped catch missed

checking-incon/f_igurations,librarycalls,andscriptsthatgetmissed
during development and pull-request review. Missing checking
in such code "leads to build failures later" (P16), and required de-
velopers to "create a follow-up pull-request to /f_ix the issue" (P16),
increasing their workload. Developers found bot recommendations
helpfulfor "preventingafailurefromamissedcode" (P17)or"saving
onpull-request iterations" (P16). We identi/f_ied the bots "Nitpicker,"
"Staticanalysis,"and"Con/f_igAlert" for this category.
Wecon/f_iguredtheNitpickerbottogeneratereminders
forcon/f_iguration/f_iles,andithelpsnewcomerslearnthe

B2 Facilitates faster communication. For the bots "Threat-
ModelQuality","CodeInsights","PRQuanti/f_ier",and"CodeAccessi-
bility"bot users reported fasterand easier communicationduring
code-review.Usersofthe"ThreatModelQuality"botreportedget-
ting"quick help on basic privacy questions compared to waiting
an entire day when someone had to manually answer them" (P18).
This aligns with the motivation of the privacy review team that
instrumented the bot (see M3 - "Data-privacy" for motivation).
The "CodeAccessibility" bot surfaced accessibility issues when the
user interface (UI) related code was changed in the pull-request,
which allowed "reviewers to discuss those issues faster on the bot
commentthread" (P18).Similarly,the"CodeInsights"botsurfaced
performance statistics of the functions that were changed in the
pull-request.Thisenabledcodereviewerstosuggestimprovements
topull-request bysimply "replyingtothe botrecommendationcon-
taining theperformance report" (P19).
B3 Suggests clear next step. Whenever bots highlighted a clear
recommended action with the issue (e.g., "Cloud Protect," "Live
SecretsDetection,"and"Con/f_igAlert"),botuserscouldeasilytake
action based on the recommendation. Bots that just highlighted an
issue without a clear recommendednext step (e.g.,"CodeInsights,"
"PR noti/f_ications")made itmore likely fordevelopers to ignore the
recommendations (P17)becauseoftimeandattentionconstraints
duringpull-request review.
The"LiveSecretsDetection"botdoesagoodjoboftelling
me a password is present in the checked-in code and
highlights the password as well. I simply go ahead and
remove the password in the next pull-request iteration .
(P18)
B4 Helps in code review. Bots also facilitated code-review by

("StaticAnalysis")weregenerallyperceivedbydevelopersaspro-
viding an additional automatic code review on the pull-request (P23)
as longas the recommendations were easyto understand.
Developers also saw a cultural value in such recommendations.
Bots take the burden oﬀ the code-reviewers to nitpick every minor
issueinthepull-request,lettingcode-reviewersprovidefeedback
onthe more importantaspectsofthe review.

(e.g., "Communication breakdown" in Wessel et al. [ 52], "design

the eﬀect of several bots working together and observe that too
manybots can cause noise,even if individualbots are helpful.

To validate our qualitative /f_indings about bots, we analyzed the
logs of bot user interactions with bot recommendations. Speci/f_i-
cally,acrossbotcategories,weexamined1)thepercentageofbot

status from "active" to one of "/f_ixed", "closed", or "won’t-/f_ix" and 2)
Number of bot user replies to bot recommendations. Developers

thatthepull-requestauthorhasaddressedthecomment,"closed"
indicatesthatthediscussionisclosed,and"won’t-/f_ix"indicatesthat
the authorwillnot address the issueinthe currentpull-request.
Table8describes the statisticsof bots that generated recommen-
dations for developers during the study period. Figure 5ashows
the /f_inal status of bot recommendation as "active" and "not-active"
("/f_ixed," "closed," or "won’t-/f_ix") when the pull-request was com-
pleted, for repositories across the bot categories "CodeQuality,"
"Con/f_igViolation,""DevProductivity," and"Security."
To quantify developer engagement, we examined the unique
numberof developers whoreplytothe botrecommendations.We
calculate the "Mean developer replies per bot category" which rep-
resentstheaveragenumberofrepliesreceivedbybotsinagiven
category within a repository. Figure 5bdisplays the distribution of
"Mean developer replies per bot category" across all repositories.
Bot categories with higher engagement should exhibit a higher
overall mean number of replies for repositories. We /f_ind that "Cod-
eQuality"bots,onaverage,receiveahighernumberofreplieson
theirrecommendationscomparedto"Con/f_igViolation"and"Secu-
rity" bots. To test if this eﬀect is signi/f_icant, we conducted one-
way ANOVAs. Because our data was not normally distributed, we
performed Align Rank Transform (ART) [ 53] before running the
ANOVAs and performed post-hoc pairwise analysis using ART-
c [14] with Holm-Bonferroni correction. We found that bot type
has a signi/f_icant eﬀect on "Mean developer engagement" on bot
comments( /u1D4393,4545=332.08,/u1D45D<.0001).Theposthoctestfounda

8 DISCUSSION
Our /f_indings support prior research on developer bots’ integra-
tion in software ecosystems [ 29,50] and shed new light on how
developers engagewithsuch bots.
8.1 WhereExistingBotsProvide Value
Automating simple routine work/f_lows Many bots in our study
(e.g., "Data-privacy","Con/f_igViolation" category of bots) automate
parts of software development processes like providing answers
to FAQs and reminding new developers of common practices in
the team. While FAQ-style bots are gaining popularity in social
Q&A websites (e.g., Stackover/f_low [ 55]), they have seen limited
use in the software engineering landscape [ 34]. Bots that automate
suchcommonwork/f_lowsfreeupdeveloper’stimetofocusonmore

the abundance of information sources, developers are unable to

viding information scaﬀolding to support developers and facilitate

8.2 WhereBotsNeedto Improve
Bot platform as meta bot We study a bot platform that hosts

interviews with two bot platform developers, we /f_ind that this con-
cept is eﬀective in accelerating bot development because several

cesstodiﬀerentrepositoriesalsosimpli/f_iesenablingbotsfornew

Relevance and information overload Developers have to
manage multiple sources of information from Continuous integra-
tion systems [ 17], such as build statuses, pull-request statuses, and
deployment updates [ 44]. Developer bots help streamline these
work/f_lowsbyconsolidatingthemultiplesourcesofinformation[ 9],but it still leaves developers to make sense of the abundant in-
formation.Our/f_indingofunbalancedworkloadallocationbythe
"Reviewer" bot and too many noti/f_ications from the "CodeInsights"

developers in relevant pull-requests and was found to generate

botrecommendationnoiseasasubstantialchallengelimitingbot
adoption on GitHub. Additionally, our quantitative analysis of his-
torical bot logs in Section 7suggests that despite the noise, bot
engagement is high for bots that report urgent or severe issues.
Thus,futurebotecosystemsshouldconsiderpriorityandrelevance
ofbotrecommendationsbasedondeveloperneeds,aswellasthe
organization-wide severityof the issue.
Actionability and low false positives We observed low ac-
tionability as one of the challenges in bot use (see "D2" in Sec-
tion6.2).Developershavetoconsiderinformationfrommultiple
sourcesinthepull-requestreviewinterface(e.g.,commentsfrom
peer developers, test results, bot recommendations). Developer bot
recommendationsneedtobe precise andconsiderthe developer’s
background,cognitiveavailability,andfatiguewhenmakingrecom-
mendations[ 15,31,48,51].Forexample,underbotuserchallenges
(D4), we found that even if bots provide a channel to seek feed-
back,veryfewdevelopersactuallyprovidefeedbackonbotactions.
Possiblereasonscouldbethelackofaninteractiveinterfacethat
is intuitive for feedback and developers’ limited attention when
addressing numerous pull-request issues.
Feedbackandcommunication Feedbackfrombotsisanim-
portantcomponentofHuman-Machineinteractionthathasbeen
showntohelpusersunderstandthesituationbetterandmakeap-
propriate decisions [ 3]. With increasing conversational capability,
developer bots can move from simple "conduits" to services [ 43] to
moreinteractivecontextsthatanswerdeveloperqueriesaboutits

a"communicationbreakdown"betweenbotsanddevelopers,and
we /f_ind similar evidence where developers were unclear on how
to provide the bot feedback (see D4 in Section 6.2). Developer bots
should present clear feedback about their actions and also provide
acknowledgment to usersto ensure continuedtrust andfeedback.
Flightingandexperimentation Settingupanewdeveloper

development data, developing the algorithm to run the analysis,
andmaintainingthebot.Botdiscoveryandbotadoptionisanother

9 THREATS TO VALIDITY
We situate our work in Microsoft’s development environment. We
study bots operating in the popular Continuous Integration (CI)
environment[ 17],makingour/f_indingsbroadlyapplicable,butthey
stillhave certainlimitations.
Scopeandexternalvalidity Weprovideacasestudyofade-
veloper bot ecosystem in the context of the large organization
Microsoft. The organizational processes described in Section 3
follows a widely adopted industry standard [ 41], and the bot in-
teractionslikegeneratingrecommendationsonpull-requestsand
automating tests are extensively studied in prior work in other
organizations [ 37]. Our results are applicable in scenarios that use
continuous integration systems and instrument bots to assist de-
velopersinthepull-requestreviewinterface.However,ourstudy
does not cover all possible types ofbots. We didnot observe intel-
ligent bots in our study that use Machine Learning, which could
bring in challenges with probabilistic predictions [ 16,52] ("Sam"
bots in Erlenhov et al.). Our proposed bot categories emerged from
observingorganizationalwork/f_lowsthat motivatedthebotsthere
maybe otherwork/f_lowsthat our categorizationdoes not cover.
Information saturation We conducted our interviews during
theinitialphasesofbotplatformdevelopmentandrecruitedpar-
ticipantsuntilwereachedsaturationintheinformationgathered
or ran out of participants [ 45]. While the /f_inal user base of the
bot platform at the end of the two-year study period was 6,000
developers, the number of developers using the bot platform at the

Quantitative analysis of historical bot engagement We
study bot engagement by measuring developer actions on bot rec-
ommendations–1)changingthestatusfrom"active"to"/f_ixed"and
providing text replies to bot recommendations like "useful." While

dation suggested by the bot. Controlled longitudinal studies arerequired to study the long impact of bots on issues found in the
codebaseanddeveloper productivity.
10 CONCLUSION AND FUTUREWORK
Our work addresses the questions related to practical bot usage
inCI/CDenvironments.Throughamixed-methodsapproach,we
build an understanding of bot motivations, understand the bene/f_its
and challenges of bot users, and complement it with large-scale
engagement data to substantiate our /f_indings. We highlight the
non-functional aspects of bots that aﬀect their usefulness in the
development context. Diﬀerent types of bots receiving diﬀerent
levels of engagement from developers are a consequence of the
