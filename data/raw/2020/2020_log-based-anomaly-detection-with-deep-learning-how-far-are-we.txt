Over the years, many data-driven methods have been proposed
to automatically detect system anomalies by analyzing log data [ 6,
7,12,29,47,50,54].Forexample,Heetal.[ 19]evaluatedsixpopular

TheseML-basedmethodssharesomelimitationsofinflexiblefea-
tures,inefficiency,andweakadaptability[ 54].Inordertoaddress
these issues, deep learning (DL) has been adopted and produced
promising results.Du etal. [ 12] proposedto useLong-Short Term
Memory (LSTM) to model the sequential patterns of normal ses-
sions, then identify anomalies as those violated the patterns. Meng

existing DL-based log anomaly detection methods show promis-
ing results on commonly used datasets and claim their superiority
over traditional ML-based approaches. For instance, DeepLog [ 12]
and LogAnomaly [ 36] all reported a very good performance on
commonly-usedHDFSandBGLdatasets(withF-measurevalues
greater than 0.9).
However, we notice that several important aspects are over-
looked by the existing work. These aspects are associated withexperimental datasets, evaluation metrics, and experimental set-

Toanswertheabovequestions,weconductasystematicevalu-
ation of five representative deep learning models for log-based
anomaly detection (including DeepLog [ 12], LogAnomaly [ 36],
PLELog[ 48],LogRobust[ 54],andCNN[ 33])onfourdatasets(in-
cluding HDFS, BGL, Spirit, and Thunderbird), under controlled
experimental settings. We first conduct an analysis of training data
selection and grouping techniques. Then we explore the impact of
different characteristics of datasets (including data noise and class
distribution) on model performance. Finally, we analyze the ability

2 LOG-BASED ANOMALY DETECTION WITH
DEEP LEARNING
2.1 Representative Models
In recentyears, manydeep learning-based modelshave beenpro-
posed to analyze log data and detect anomalies [ 6,12,27,39,48,
50,54].Someofthesemodelsusesupervisedlearningtechniques
(such as LogRobust [ 54] and CNN [ 33]), while others employ semi-
supervisedapproaches(suchasDeepLog[ 12],LogAnomaly[ 36])or
unsupervised approaches [ 13]. Some recent representative models
are as follows:DeepLog.Duetal.[ 12]proposedtoutilizeanLSTMmodelto
learn the system’s normal executions by predicting the next log
event given preceding events. It detects anomalies by determining
whetherornotanincominglogeventviolatesthepredictionresults
of the LSTM model. Their experimental results show that DeepLog
can achieve an F-measure of 0.96 on the HDFS dataset.
LogAnomaly.Mengetal.[ 36]proposedLogAnomaly,which
useslogcountvectorsasinputstotrainanLSTMmodel.Theyalso
proposed template2vec,asynonymsandantonymsbasedmethod,
to represent log templates as semantic vectors to match new log
events with existing templates. Like DeepLog, a forecasting-based
detectionmodelisdesignedtopredictthenextlogevent,andiftheexaminedlogeventviolatesthepredictionresults,itwillbemarked
as an anomaly. LogAnomaly can achieve F-measures of 0.95 and
0.96 on HDFS and BGL datasets, respectively.
PLELog.Yangetal.[ 48]addressedtheissueofinsufficientlabels
viaprobabilisticlabelestimationanddesignedanattention-based
GRUneuralnetworktodetectanomalies.TheGRU-baseddetection
model is built to classify log sequences into two classes, normal orabnormal. Their experimental results indicate that PLELog outper-
forms existing semi-supervised methods and achieves high perfor-
mance on HDFS and BGL datasets (i.e., 0.96 and 0.98, respectively).
LogRobust.Zhangetal.[ 54]incorporatedapre-trainedWord2vec
model,namelyFastText[ 23],andcombineditwithTF-IDFweights
to learn the representation vectors of log templates. Then, these
vectors were input to an Attention-based Bi-LSTM model to detect
anomalies.TheexperimentalresultsshowthatLogRobustcanad-
dresstheinstabilityoflogeventsandachieveF-measuresof0.99
on the original HDFS dataset and 0.89-0.96 on synthetic datasets.

(CNN) for log-based anomaly detection. Logs are grouped into

normal or abnormal. The CNN model can achieve an F-measure of
0.98 on the HDFS dataset.
In this study, we systematically evaluate the above five models.
DeepLog and LogAnomaly adopt a forecasting-based approach
(i.e., detecting anomalies by predicting the next log event given
preceding log sequences), while PLELog, LogRobust, and CNN are
classification-based models (i.e., detecting anomalies by classifying
log sequences). Apart from these models, there are some other
deeplearning-basedapproaches.Forexample, Logsy[39]utilizes
the Transformer network [ 46] to detect anomalies from log data.
AutoEncoder has been employedin [ 13] to detectlog anomalies in
an unsupervised manner along with Isolation Forest. SwissLog [27]
proposes to use a dictionary-based log parser and an Attention-
basedBi-LSTMnetworktodetectanomaliesfordiversefaults.As
theirsourcecodeisnotpubliclyavailable,wedonotexperimentally
evaluate these models in this study.
2.2 The Common Workflow

tasks, log parsing is applied to automatically convert each log mes-
sage intoa specificevent template (constantpart) associatedwith
parameters (i.e., variable part). For example, the log template “Ver-
ification succeeded for ∗"can be extracted from the log message

“∗"denotes the position of a parameter.
Therearemanylogparsingtechniques,basedonfrequentpat-
ternmining[ 10,38,45],clustering[ 16,42,44],andheuristics[ 17,
22,34]. The heuristics-based approaches make use of the charac-
teristicsoflogsandhavebeenfoundtoperform better thanother
techniques in terms of accuracy and time efficiency [55].
2.2.2 Log Grouping. Themainpurposeofthisstepistoseparate
logsintovariousgroups,whereeachgrouprepresentsafinitechunk
of logs [19]. These groups are called log sequences, from which fea-
tures are extracted and fed into anomaly detection models. As
introduced in [ 19], three types of windows are applied (see Figure
2) for log grouping, including: (1) Fixed window. Logs are grouped
byfixedwindowsaccordingtotheiroccurrences.Theoccurrenceis
defined by the timestamp of log messages or by the order of its ap-
pearance in the dataset. Each window has a fixed size (i.e., window
size), which means the time span or the number of logs. (2) Sliding
window.Slidingwindowsconsistoftwoattributes:windowsizeand
stepsize.Thewindowsizecanbethetimespanorthenumberof

(3)Sessionwindow. Differentfromfixed/slidingwindows,session
windows are based on the identifier of logs. Identifiers are used to
grouplogsinthesameexecutionpath.Forexample,HDFSlogsuse
block_idto record the execution path.
2.2.3 Log Representation. Afterloggrouping,logsarerepresented
in different formats required by DL models. Existing DL-based
anomalydetectionmodelsconvertlogsintothreemaintypes:(1)
sequentialvectors,(2)quantitativevectors,and(3)semanticvectors.
Sequentialvectorsreflecttheorderoflogeventsinawindow.Forexample, DeepLog [ 12] assigns each log event with an index, then
generates a sequential vector for each log window. Quantitative
vectors are similar to log count vectors, which are used to hold the
occurrence of each log event in a log window. LogAnomaly [ 36]
leverages both sequential and quantitative vectors to detect anom-
alies. Different from them, semantic vectors are acquired from
languagemodelstorepresent thesemanticmeaningoflogevents.
Eachlogwindowisconvertedintoasetofsemanticvectorsforthe
detectionmodels.Forinstance,LogRobust[ 54]adoptsapre-trained
FastText [ 23] model to compute the semantic vectors of log events.
2.2.4 Deep Learning Models. Afterthelogrepresentationphase,
theextractedfeaturesarefedtodeeplearningmodelsfortheanom-
alydetectiontask.AvarietyofDLtechniqueshavebeenappliedto log-based anomaly detection: 1) RNN. Recurrent Neural Net-
works (RNNs), including its variants Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) [
21] and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) [ 9], are neural
networksdesignedtohandlethesequentialinputswitharbitrary
length. Bi-directional RNN is used to represent the sequential text
inbothdirections(i.e.,forwardandbackward).RNNanditsvariantshavebeenappliedinmanystudiesonlog-basedanomalydetection.
Specifically, DeepLog [ 12] and LogAnomaly [ 36] use LSTM to pre-
dict the next log event. LogRobust [ 54] applies an Attention-based
Bi-LSTMnetworktohandletheinstabilityoflogs,whilePLELog
adoptsGRUstobuildaclassificationmodel.2) CNN.AConvolu-

for log-based anomaly detection.
3 STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Motivation
Recent studies [ 27,36] have shown that deep learning-based ap-
proachescanachievehighaccuracy(e.g.,F-Measurehigherthan
90%) on commonly used datasets (e.g., the HDFS dataset). These
results seem to suggest that the problem of anomaly detection can
besolvedalmostperfectlythroughdeeplearning.Toexplorethe
actualeffectivenessofexistingDLmodelsforlog-basedanomaly
detection ( 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑠for short in the rest of the paper), we would like
to evaluate the models from the following aspects associated with
the common workflow of the models:
3.1.1 The selection of training data. The results of anomaly detec-
tion could be affected by the selection of training data. In somestudies(suchasDeepLog[
12],LogRobust[ 54],PLELog[ 48],and
CNN [33]), the training and test data are selected based on the
timestamp of logs. We call it 𝑐ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 strategy. Other stud-
ies [8,15,36] apply fixed/sliding windows to group log events into
log sequences, then shuffle all logs sequences before splitting them
into training and testing sets. We call it 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚strategy. The ran-
dom strategy allows models to see more log events and achieve
high accuracy (e.g.,higher than 88% F-measure for allmodels [8]).
However, this strategy may lead to the data leakage problem in the
trainingphase.Thatis,itispossiblethatthetrainingsetcontains
parts of future data, and the testing set contains parts of past data,
1358

thus making it not suitable for real-world scenarios where we only
usehistorical logsto builda detectionmodel.The effectivenessof
themodelswithdifferenttrainingdataselectionstrategies(random
or chronological) should be investigated.
3.1.2 The grouping of log data. Thelogdatacanbegroupedinto
sequencesbysession,sliding,orfixedwindows.Choosingaproper
windowsizeischallenging.Forexample,ifthewindowsizeissmall,
themodelsfacedifficultyincapturingthoseanomaliesthatspan
multiple sequences. On the other hand, if the window size is large,
logsequencesmightincludemultipleanomaliesandconfusethe
detection scheme [ 31]. In this work, we evaluate many window
sizes,includingthewindowsizesfrom20to200logmessagesas
wellasthewindowsizesof0.5hourand1hour,andalsosession
window [19, 50].
3.1.3 The imbalanced class distribution. In literature, much re-
search work [ 14,51,52] has shown that in a large software system,
thedistributionoffaultsisskewed-thatasmallnumberofmodules
accounts fora large proportionof the faults. Inour work, wefind
thatthedistributionofanomaliesisalsoskewed.Theanomalous
logsequencesusuallyaccountfortheminorityofthedataset,which
can be only from 0.5% to 15% of a dataset, as shown in Section 3.3.
The highly imbalanced data imposes challenges for anomaly detec-
tion.Ingeneral,itisdifficultforamachinelearningtechniqueto
identify a small number of anomalies from a large amount of logs.
The imbalance between normal and abnormal classes could cause
the model to perform poorly.
Thehighlyimbalancedclassdistributionalsohasimplications
for evaluation metrics. The performance of log-based anomalydetectionmodelsisusuallymeasuredbyPrecision,Recall,andF-
Measure[ 12,15,19,36,54].However,previousstudies[ 53]pointed
out that prediction results may not always be satisfactory in the
presenceofimbalanceddatadistribution.Inthiswork,wewould
like to explore if the commonly-used metrics can effectively evalu-
atetheeffectivenessofalog-basedanomalydetectionmodelunder
the scenario of imbalanced class distribution.
3.1.4 The quality of data. Fortheevaluationoflog-basedanomaly
detection models, labeled data is required. The commonly-used
publicdatasets(suchasHDFSandBGL)aremanuallyinspectedand
labeled by engineers. Data noise (false positives/negatives) may be
introduced during the manual labeling process. Although the data
noises only occupy a small portion of logs, they could downgrade
the performance of existing models. The noise can be from theerrors in the preprocessing phase (i.e., log parsing). The logging
statementscouldalsofrequentlychangeduringsoftwareevolution,
resulting in new log events that were not seen in the training
phase[36,54].Zhangetal.[ 54]foundthat30.3%oflogsarechanged
in the latest version based on their empirical study on Microsoft
onlineservicesystems.Leetal.[ 26]foundthatlogparsingerrors
can lead to many incorrect log events, thus downgrading anomaly
detection performance. Therefore, we would like to investigate the
effectiveness of the models with different degrees of data noise.
3.1.5 Early detection ability. System anomalies can affect the nor-
mal operations of upper-layer software applications and signifi-
cantly affect users’ experience. If no actions are taken, more severe
problems or even service interruptions may occur. Therefore, it
isimportantthattheanomaliesarecapturedearlier,sothatmoremitigation actions could be taken. An effective anomaly detection
model should be able to identify the early signals of system anom-
alies, detect the anomalies as early as possible, and meanwhile
achieve high detection accuracy. This is especially essential for the
online detection scenario, where anomalies are detected on the fly.
Because of the above concerns, we argue that the capabilities
of deep learning-based techniques for anomaly detection shouldbere-evaluated.Inthiswork,wedesignexperimentstomeasurethe impact of these factors on five representative DL models for
log-based anomaly detection.
3.2 Evaluated Models
In this study, we evaluate the five representative models described
in Section 2.1, namely DeepLog, LogAnomaly, PLELog, LogRobust,
and CNN. Thesemodels have their source codepublicly available,
andwecanconfirmthecorrectnessofsourcecodesbyreproduc-
ing results presented in their original paper. Specifically, we adopt
the public implementations [ 3,4] of DeepLog and LogAnomaly.
ForLogAnomaly,thetemplate2vecmodelistrainedwithdomain-
specificantonymsandsynonymsaddingbyoperators.Sincethis
informationisunavailable,weuseapre-trainedFastTextword2vec
mode[23]tocomputethesemanticvectorsoflogtemplates.The
templatevectoriscalculatedastheweightedaverageofthevectors
of the template’s words. For LogRobust, we adopt the implementa-
tion provided by its authors and convert it into a PyTorch-basedimplementation.ForPLELog,weleverageitspublicimplementa-
tion[1].Formodelswhosehyperparametersettingsarereported
in their paper, we use the same hyperparameter values. Otherwise,
we tune their hyperparameters empirically.
3.3 Datasets
Toevaluatethestudiedmodelsforlog-basedanomalydetection,we
selectfourpublicdatasets[ 2,20],namelyHDFS,BGL,Thunderbird,
and Spirit. The details of each dataset are as follows:
•HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) dataset is produced
from more than 200 Amazon EC2 nodes. In total, the HDFS
dataset consists of 11,175,629 log messages. These log messages
formdifferentlogwindowsaccordingtotheir block_id,reflecting
aprogramexecutionintheHDFSsystem.Thereare16,838blocks
of logs (2.93%) in this dataset indicating system anomalies.
•BGL (Blue Gene/L) dataset is a supercomputing system log
dataset collected byLawrence Livermore National Labs(LLNL)
[40].Thedatasetcontains4,747,963logmessages.Eachmessage

more than 172 million log messages labeled as anomalous onthe Spirit dataset. In this paper, we use a small set containing

3.4 Research Questions
Thegoalofthisstudyistoanalyzetheperformanceoftherepre-
sentative deep learning models for log-based anomaly detection
models. We design the following research questions in accordance
with the evaluation aspects described in Section 3.1.
RQ1: How do the existing approaches perform with dif-
ferent training data selection strategies? We want to evaluate
whetherornotthestudiedmodelsareabletoachievegoodaccu-
racywithdifferenttrainingdataselectionstrategies.Tothisend,
weconductexperimentswithtwodifferentstrategiesfortraining
dataselection: (1)Randomselection :Foreachdataset,wefirstsort
logs by timestamps, and then apply the fixed window grouping
technique to generate log sequences. Next, these log sequences are
shuffled, and split into training/testing sets with the ratio of 80:20.
(2) Chronological selection : For each dataset, we utilize the first 80%
of raw logs (that appear in chronological order) for training and
the remaining 20% for testing. Next, we apply the fixed window
groupingtechniquetogeneratelogsequences.Wedonotshuffle
the generated log sequences in this strategy. Therefore, we can
guaranteethatonlyhistoricallogsareusedinthetrainingphase,
and there are no future logs used in this phase.
In this RQ, we experiment on the BGL, Thunderbird, and Spirit
datasets. The window size for fixed window grouping is set to 1
hour.AstheHDFSdatasetdoesnotcontaintimestampinformation,
the chronological selection cannot be applied to HDFS, and thus it
is not used in this RQ.
RQ2: How do theexisting models perform with different
data grouping methods? To evaluate the impact of different data
groupingmethodsontheperformanceofanomalydetectionmodels,
wechoosethefollowingthreedatagroupingmethods,including:
(1)fixed-windowgroupingwiththewindowsizeof1hour(asused
in RQ1) and 0.5 hour, (2) fixed-window grouping with the window
sizevaryingfrom20to200logmessages,and(3)sessionwindow
grouping.Forthefirstcase,weuseBGL,Spirit,andThunderbird
datasets. For the case of session windows, we use block_idand
node_idto group logs on HDFS and BGL datasets, respectively.
RQ3: Can the existing approaches work with different
class distributions? As shown in Section 3.3, our subject datasets
representhighlyimbalancedclassdistributionswithanomalyra-
tios that can be only 0.1% (i.e., on the Thunderbird dataset). To
perform a more systematic evaluation, we simulate different imbal-
ancedscenariosbyrandomlyremovingthenormal/abnormallog
sequencesfromthesubjectdatasets.Forareal-worldproduction
system, the number of anomalies is much less than the number of
normal events [ 28,51,52]. Therefore, we vary the imbalance ratio
from0.1%to15%,whichindicatesthepercentageofanomaliesin
thedataset.Inthisway,wecreatesixsyntheticdatasetswiththe
imbalance ratio of 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 5%, 10%, and 15%.
RQ4:Canexistingapproachesworkwithdifferentdegrees
of data noise? To evaluate the impact of mislabeled logs on theperformance of the studied models, we randomly add some anom-
alies (from 1% to 10%) into the training data for semi-supervised
methods.Forsupervisedmethods,werandomlychangethelabelof
a specific portion (from 1% to 10%) to simulate the mislabeled logs.
Inthisway,wecreatefivesyntheticdatasetswiththemislabeled
proportion of 1%, 2%, 5%, 8%, and 10%. Moreover, to measure the
impact of noises from log parsing errors, we experiment with four
commonlyusedlogparsers,includingDrain[ 17],Spell[11],AEL
[22], and IPLoM [34].
RQ5: How early can the existing models detect anomalies
inonlinedetection? AsdescribedinSection 3.1.5,amodelshould
notonlydetectanomaliespreciselybutalsoshouldbeabletodetectanomaliesasearlyaspossiblesothatmoremitigationactionscould
be taken. Therefore, in this RQ, we evaluate the studied models on
four datasets to investigate their ability in early detection of anom-alies. To this end, we record the number of examined log messages
before each model raises an anomaly alert for a log sequence, in
the online detection setting.
3.5 Experimental Setup
In our experiments, we preprocess the log data and conduct DL-
based anomaly detection as follows:
(1) Log Parsing. To extract log templates from log data, we use
the log parser Drain [ 17] with the default parameter settings [ 5].
Thelogdataisdenotedby 𝐿={𝑙1,𝑙2,...,𝑙 𝑖,...,𝑙 𝑁𝐿}andcontains 𝑁𝐿
entries (i.e., lines) of log messages. Each log message 𝑙𝑖is parsed
into a log template 𝐸(𝑙𝑖), which is denoted 𝑒𝑖for short.
(2) Log Grouping. We apply session window to group logs
intheHDFSdatasetusing block_id.Eachsessionislabeledusing
groundtruth.Forotherdatasets(BGL,Spirit,andThunderbird),weusethefixedwindowstrategytogrouplogdatainto
𝑁𝑆chunks(i.e.,
log sequences), denoted as 𝑆={𝑠1,𝑠2,...,𝑠 𝑢,...,𝑠 𝑁𝑆}, where𝑠𝑢=
{𝑒𝑖,𝑒𝑖+1,...,𝑒 𝑗}is a set of log templates. According to the ground
truth (labeled by domain engineers), a log sequence is abnormalifitcontainsananomalouslogmessageaccordingtotheground
truth (labeled by domain engineers). 𝐹denotes the size of each log
sequence.Inthisstudy,wevarythevalueof 𝐹from20,100,200log
messages, to 0.5 and 1 hour depending on each research question.
(3)LogRepresentation. Logsequencesarenowconvertedinto
numerical vectors, which can be input to a DL model. DeepLog
transformslog sequences intosequential vectorsbyassigning each
log event with an index. LogAnomaly leverages both sequential
vectorsandquantitativevectorstotrainthemodel.Theoccurrence
of each log event is counted and forms the quantitative vectors,
whichrepresentthesystemexecutionbehaviors[ 36].PLELogex-
tracts the semantic vectors of log templates by using a pre-trained
Glovemodel[ 41].Similarly,LogRobustandCNNalsoconvertlogse-
quences into semantic vectors using a pre-trained word2vec model.
We adopt the pre-trained FastText [ 23] model to compute the se-
mantic vectors for LogRobust and CNN.
(4)DeepLearningModel. Inthisstep,dependingonthemethod,
a DL model is trained using the corresponding feature vectors gen-
eratedfromthepreviousphase.DeepLogandLogAnomalyhave
twoLSTMlayerswith128neurons.LogRobustcontainsatwo-layerBi-LSTMwith128neuronsandanattentionlayer.PLELogutilizesa
one-layer GRU network. CNN has three Convolutional layers with
different filters and a max-pooling layer for feature extraction.

The results show that different window sizes lead to different
performance of detection models. We can observe that, on the BGL
dataset,comparedtotheresultsof1-hour-logssettinginTable 2,the
performance of the models mostly drops. For example, on the BGLdataset, the decrease of F1 measure ranges from 4.84% (PLELog) to
50.31%(LogAnomaly)whenthe100-log-messagessettingisused.
OntheSpiritdataset,DeepLogandLogAnomalyachievethebest
results when using the window size of 100 log messages, while
others perform the best with 0.5-hour-logs setting. Similar results
can be found on the Thunderbird dataset, where the detection
performance is different across different window sizes.

4.3 RQ3: How do the existing approaches
perform with different class distributions?
Table2showstheresultsonthesubjectdatasets,whichhavedif-
ferent ratios of anomalies. For example, we can see that, on the
Spiritdataset,DeepLogandLog-AnomalyachievehighPrecision,
Recall, and F-measure (all higher than 0.86) with random selection.
However,theSpecificityresultsarelow(lessthan0.5),whichreveal
that the models actually perform poorly: they classify a lot of nor-
mallogsasanomaliesinthisscenario,causingmanyfalsealarms.
This also happens on the Thunderbird dataset when DeepLog and
LogAnomalymarkmostlyallofthenormallogsasanomalies(Speci-
ficity≈0). In this RQ, to perform a more systematic evaluation,
we simulate different imbalanced scenarios with the percentage of
anomalies increased from 0.1% to 15%. We use the results on HDFS
and BGL datasets to explain our findings, as shown in Table 5.
From Table 5, we find that when the percentage of anomalies
increases, the performance of the models is better, which is indi-
cated by the increase of all four metrics. For example, the scores of
LogRobust on BGL dataset are improved by 63.8%, 10.1%, 2.6%, and
38.4%in Precision,Recall, Specificity,and F-measure,respectively.
The result shows that it is more difficult to detect anomalies when
the dataset is highly imbalanced.

comprehensively. Specificity [ 43,49], which is the percentage of
log sequences that are correctly identified normal over all real nor-
malsequences,canmeasuretheprobabilityoffalsealarms.High
Specificitymeansthatmodelscanperformwithalowfalse-positive
(false alarms) rate.
Summary. Highly imbalanced data with a small percentage of
anomalies impedes model performance. Using different metrics
may lead to different conclusions about the model performance.
Some commonly-used metrics, including Precision, Recall, and
F-measure,arenotcomprehensiveenoughforevaluatinglog-
based anomaly detection with highly imbalanced data. More
evaluation metrics such as Specificity should be used for a thor-
ough evaluation.
4.4 RQ4: Can existing methods work with
different degrees of data noise?
4.4.1 The impact of mislabeled logs. We evaluate the studied mod-
els with different degrees of mislabeled logs. In this experiment,
we inject a specific portion of mislabeled logs into the training
data while the testingsets remain the same. Specifically, for semi-
supervisedmethods,whichonlyusenormallogsfortraining,we
put back some anomalies to the training sets. For supervised meth-
ods, we change the label of some anomalies in the training setsto normal. We experiment on all four datasets and find that theperformance of models can greatly decrease if training data con-
tainsmislabeledsamples.WeshowtheresultsonHDFSandBGL
datasets in Figure 3to demonstrate our finding.
Figure 3: Results with different ratios of mislabeled logs
We can find that, on the HDFS dataset, even with just 1% of
mislabeledlogs,theF-measuresofthestudiedmodelsdeclinesig-
nificantly. For example, LogRobust and CNN drop 37.2% and 36.2%
withonly1%ofnoise,respectively.Whenthenoiseratioreaches
10%, the F-measures of LogRobust and CNN drop to only 0.161 and
0.263.Theresultsconfirmthatevenwiththeadvantageofsemantic
understanding,theseDLmodelscanlosetheirperformancewith
onlyasmallproportionofmislabeledlogs.ItisalsotrueforPLELog,
whichleveragesthesemanticmeaningoflogsaswell.Anotherrea-
son for this remarkable reduction is that there are many duplicate
log sequences in the HDFS dataset, thus, labeling any duplicatenormal sequences as anomalies could have a large impact. Inter-estingly, the F-measure of LogAnomaly only drops slightly with
1%ofmislabeledlogs(from0.915to0.897).Whenthemislabeled
ratio is 5% and 10%, LogAnomaly can achieve better F-measurescompared to other models. The reason is that LogAnomaly uses

values drop to 0.609 and 0.099, respectively, although Drain is one
ofthemostaccuratelogparsersaccordingtoarecentbenchmark
study [55]. The results also show that LogRobust and CNN can
handle log parsing noise better than other models. This is prob-
ably because of their use of semantic vectors. Moreover, we findthat different log parsing errors have distinctive impact on thedetection models. The results on BGL and Spirit datasets show
that DeepLog and LogAnomaly perform better with Spell [ 11] and
IPLoM [34] than with Drain. This is because Drain often produces
many extra log events that hinder the performance of DeepLogand LogAnomaly (which use forecasting methods to predict the
nextlogevent).Incontrast,othermodelscanbetterhandleextra
log events but may fail when log parsers produce errors due to
semantic misunderstanding [26].
Summary. Thedatanoisefromlogparsingerrorshasimpacton
the performance of models. Extra log events can quickly down-
gradetheperformanceofforecasting-basedmodels.Methods
using semantic vectors can better handle log parsing errors.
4.5 RQ5: How early can the existing models
detect anomalies in online detection?
To answer RQ5,we evaluate the five studied modelsusing a fixed-
window grouping of different sizes (from 20 logs to 1-hour logs).
Werecordthenumberofexaminedlogmessagesbeforeeachmodel

anomaliesonthefly).Figure 4usestheresultswith100-logsand
0.5-hour-logs settings to explain our findings.
We find that DeepLog can detect anomalies the earliest, with
an average of 14.3 and 90.6 log messages with 100-logs and 0.5-
hour-logssetting,respectively.LogAnomaly,whichisalsobased
on predicting the next log events, detects anomaly a bit later since

of semantic vectors could make other models, including LogRo-bust, CNN, and PLELog, detect anomalies much later, as shownin Figure 4. These classification-based models require to capture
features of anonymous behavior to detect anomalies, thus tendto raise alarms closer to the time the anomaly happens. Figure 5

(DeepLogandLogAnomaly) candetectanomaliesearlier than
classification-based models (PLELog, LogRobust, and CNN).
5 DISCUSSION
5.1 The Advantages and Disadvantages of the
Studied Methods
Based on our findings, we can conclude that all the studied models
donotalwaysworkaswellastheyclaimedintheirpapers.Different
scenarios have different impacts on the performance of anomaly
detection models.We pointout the advantagesand disadvantages
of each model as follows, which are also summarized in Table 7.
DeepLog. The main advantage of DeepLog is that it does not
require any abnormal logs to build a detection model using se-
quential vectors, thus reducing the effort for model construction. It
can also detect anomalies earlier than other models. However, due
to thischaracteristic, DeepLogperforms poorlyon more complex
datasets with a large number of log events (see Section 4.1). Be-
sides,DeepLogisgreatlyimpactedbythelogparsingerrorssinceit
only leverages the index of log templates and ignores the semantic
meaning of log templates (see Section 4.4.2).
LogAnomaly. LogAnomaly uses sequential and quantitative
vectors to train a detection model, which can help reduce the
impact of data noise caused by mislabeled logs. Like DeepLog,
LogAnomaly can detect anomalies early and deal with a largeamount of data since it only trains with normal logs. The main
benefit of LogAnomaly is in the phase of matching similar log tem-
plates using semantic vectors. This feature allows LogAnomaly to
improvetheaccuracybymatchingnewlogtemplateswithanexist-
ing one in the training logs instead of marking them as anomalies
as DeepLog does. However, like DeepLog, LogAnomaly trains the
model using the index of log event (sequential and quantitative
vectors)andcannotlearnthesemanticmeaningoflogtemplates,
so it is highly affected by the log parsing errors (see Section 4.4.2).
Moreover,LogAnomalycannotperformwellonlargedatasetswith
numerous log events (see Section 4.1and4.2).
PLELog. The main advantage of PLELog is that it can learn
knowledge about historical anomalies via probabilistic label esti-
mation. PLELog adopts a clusteringmethod (i.e., HDBSCAN [ 35])
toprobabilisticallyestimatethelabelsofunlabeledlogsequences.
ThisapproachallowsPLELogtoworkwithonlynormallogs.Be-
sides,theuseofsemanticvectorsandattention-basedGRUnetworkmakes PLELog perform more effectively. However, PLELog is time-
consuming since it requires time to train the clustering model (see
Section4.5). Moreover, PLELog cannot cope well with the noise in
training data (see Section 4.4.1), and it does not perform well on
the early detection task.
LogRobust.LogRobustleveragessemanticvectorsoflogtem-
platestogetherwithanattention-basedBi-LSTMmodel.LogRobust
canworkwellwiththenoisefromlogparsingerrorsbyutilizingtheattention-basedBi-LSTMmodel,whichhastheabilitytocap-
ture the contextual information of log sequences. However, as the
main characteristic of supervised models, LogRobust requires both
normal and abnormal data in the training phase, which would cost
much manual labeling effort. Another drawback of LogRobust is
thatitcanbegreatlyaffectedbythenoisefrommislabeledlogs(see
Section4.4.1).
CNN.TheConvolutionalNeuralNetworkcanminemorerela-
tionshipsinlog contextbyleveragingmultiple filters.Theconvo-
lution operation allows CNN to capture not only the correlation
between log templates but also the correlation inside the semantic
embeddingoflogtemplates[ 33].CNNcanachievehighaccuracyon
many datasets using a supervised approach. However, like LogRo-
bust, CNN requires a large amount of labeled data, which is mostly
unavailableinpractice.CNNalsolosesitsaccuracywhendealing
withhighlyimbalanceddataanddatanoise(seeSections 4.3and
4.4.1).
5.2 Future Research Work
Basedonourfindings,weidentifythefollowingresearchchallenges
and also suggest possible solutions:
A variety of datasets. Our findings suggest that more datasets
should be used for a more comprehensive evaluation of log-based
anomalydetectionmodels.Agoodresultononedatasetdoesnot
necessarily reflect good performance on other datasets due to a
variety of data characteristics (e.g., class distributions, noise, etc.).
Limited labeled data. Although supervised learning-based meth-
ods (i.e., LogRobust and CNN) can achieve higher accuracy than
theunsupervisedcounterparts,itistime-consumingandtedious
to manually label the anomalies due to the volume and velocity
of log data. Semi-supervised learning-based models (i.e., DeepLog,
LogAnomaly, and PLELog) can deal with a large amount of data as
they only require normal data. However, the accuracy achieved by
existing methods is rather low in practice, as shown in Section 4.1.
Improving the accuracy of semi-supervised models or designing
unsupervised models is a challenging but essential future work.
Early detection. Our findings show that different models have
differentabilitiesinearlydetectionofsystemanomalies.Theanom-
alies should be predicted as early as possible to allow enough time
for any preparatory or preventive actions in an online detection
scenario. More work is needed to build effective models that allow
sufficientleadtime(i.e.,reducingthenumberoflogmessagesbeing
examined) and meanwhile achieve high prediction accuracy.
Evolvingsystems. Ourfindingsshowthatlogparsingerrorshave
impact on log-based anomaly detection. Log parsing errors canbe introduced by the change of logging statements during soft-
ware evolution [ 26,54]. As real-world software systems constantly
evolve,newlogeventsalwaysappear[ 24,54].Therefore,existing
log-based anomaly detection models will either fail to work due to

to the incorrect classification. Therefore, models should be able to
learnthesemanticmeaningofthewholelogmessagestohandle
the instability of logs of evolving systems.
Relations among log events. As discussed in Section 4.2, ses-
sion window grouping gathers logs in a specific execution path,
which could possess more relations among log events than the
fixed-window grouping method. Existing methods convert logs
intosequences,whichcapturesequentialrelationshipsamonglog
messages. A possible research direction is to explore more relation-shipsbetweenlogs,suchasthelogicalrelationshipsandinteractive
relationships among logging components [ 30], to capture a variety
of anomalous behavior.
5.3 Threats to Validity

Reimplementation. We mainly adopt the public implemen-
tations of studied models. For LogRobust, as its original imple-mentation is based on Keras, we convert it into a PyTorch-basedimplementation so that we have a unified framework for all log-based anomaly detection tools. In our version, we use the same
