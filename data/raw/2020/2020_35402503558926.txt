ABSTRACT
We introduce COREQQA, a tool for assisting requirements engi-
neers in acquiring a better understanding of compliance require-
ments by means of automated Question Answering. Extracting
compliance-related requirements by manually navigating through
alegal document is both time-consumingand error-prone.CORE-
QQA enables requirements engineers to pose questions in natu-
ral language about a compliance-related topic given some legal
document,e.g.,askingabout databreach .Thetoolthenautomat-
ically navigates through the legal document and returns to the
requirements engineer alist oftext passages containingthe possi-
ble answers to the input question. For better readability, the tool
also highlights the likely answers in these passages. The engi-
neer can then use this output for specifying compliance require-
ments. COREQQA is developed using advanced large-scale lan-
guagemodelsfromBERT’sfamily.COREQQAhasbeenevaluated
onfourlegaldocuments.Theresultsofthisevaluationarebriefly
presented in the paper. The tool is publicly available on Zenodo
(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6653514 ).

With the growing reliance on personal data and confidential in-
formation,softwaresystemsareincreasinglysubjecttocompliance
against regulations to enforce necessary safeguards for informa-
tionprotectionandhumansafety[ 13,16].Failingtocomplywith
relevantregulationscanleadtolegal,fiscalorreputationalimpli-
cations for an organization. Regulatory compliance is regarded as
an essential yet challenging task by the Requirements Engineering
(RE) community [ 5,18,21].
In this paper, we propose the tool COREQQA ( Compliance
Requirements Understanding using QuestionAnswering). CORE-
QQA is motivated by actual practical needs, considering that re-
quirementsengineersarebeingincreasinglyinvolvedinsoftware
compliance against relevant regulations, e.g., all software systems
inEuropemust comply withGDPR (Regulation(EU)2016/679)ś
the European regulationon dataprotection, privacy andpersonal
datatransfer [ 11].Manuallyhandlingcompliancerequirementsis
tedious and error-prone since requirements engineers have to read
through entire legal documents. Such documents are usually hefty,
containcomplicatednaturallanguage(NL)structures,frequently
refer to external regulations, and are not easy to peruse without
legalexpertise [ 2,20].
An automated Question Answering (QA) tool such as CORE-
QQA helps requirements engineers efficiently navigate through
the compliance-related content of legal documents. QAisthe task
of automatically finding the answer to a question posed in NL
from a given text passage. In our work, we refer to a single text
passage as a context span . Instead of reviewing long, complex le-
galdocuments, COREQQA enables requirements engineers toask
a question about a compliance-related topic, and then returns a
list of relevant context spans in which the answer is likely to be
found. This way, COREQQA pinpoints the requirements engineers
to the portions of the legal document where they need to invest
theirefforts andtime.

QQAtoarequirementsengineer,whoisinterestedinunderstanding

tionisspecificallyrelatedtotheprocessforhandlingpersonaldata

The legal obligations with regard to handling data breaches can
have a significant impact on the software development process,
e.g., sending notifications to different responsible agents within
legally-binding time constraints. COREQQA assists the require-

respective compliance requirements for handling data breaches
for the software system under development. As we elaborate in
Section2, COREQQA returns as output the top- 𝑁1relevant con-
textspansfromagiven legal documentandthe potential answers
highlightedin the context spans. COREQQA builds onlarge-scale
natural language processing (NLP) language models for solving
the QA task (also widely known as machine reading comprehension
(MRC) task [14]). QA models for MRC generally assume that for
each question, the relevant context span (containing the answer) is
knownapriori.DevelopingapracticalQAtoolwiththisrestriction
is infeasible, as requirements engineers have no means of know-
ing the exact context span with the correct answer in advance.
Therefore,inCOREQAAwefirstfindtop- 𝑁relevantcontextspans
whichlikelycontaintheanswer.Todoso,wecomputethesemantic
similarity between each context span in the legal document and
the input question. Then, we demarcate the answer to the input
questionusing the QA models.
Wefurtherobservethatinformationrelevanttoansweringthe
question could be found in multiple non-contiguous context spans
(i.e.,differentsectionsinthesamelegaldocument).Forexample,the
top-3 context spans selected in Figure 1are all directly relevant for
answering the question. The first two spans (retrieved from differ-

While selecting higher values of 𝑁entails more time and effort for

QQA is still much more cost-effective in practice than manually

2 TOOL ARCHITECTURE

ure2.COREQQAaimsatansweringagivenquestionposedbya
requirementsengineerinNLonsomelegaldocument.Below,we
elaboratethemainstepsofthetoolmarkedas1ś3inFigure 2.We
implementedCOREQQA inPython3.8.
2.1 Text Preprocessing
In the first step, COREQQA parses the legal document and applies
a simpleNLP pipeline which is composedof tokenization and sen-
tencesplitting.Thetoolthenappliesasetofregularexpressions
for normalizing the text (e.g., removing periods from the ending of
acronyms,łArt.žbecomesłArtž).Themotivationfornormalizing
the text is to improve the accuracy of sentence splitting. We opera-
tionalize the NLP pipeline using NLTK library [ 6,17], and the re
modulein Python for regular expressions2. In this step, we further
partitionthelegaldocumentintocontextspans.Duetotechnical
constraints of underlying QA models, the maximum size of each
context span is 512 tokens. To maintain coherence, we split the
document into paragraphs first, and then check their size. Each
paragraph fitting this size limitation is regarded as one context
span. Otherwise, we split the paragraph into half, and check the
size again. This process is iteratively performed until size limita-
tions are met. The output of this step is the list of context spans
representing the inputlegal document.
2.2 Relevant Context Retrieval
In the second step, COREQQA computes the semantic similar-
ity between the input question and each context span generated
from the previous step. We implement this step using the BERT
cross-encoder(BCE)modelavailableintheSentence-Transformer
2.1.0 [19] provided by Hugging Face3. BCE takes as input two text
fragments,andreturnsasoutputascorebetween0and1indicating
how semantically similar the two fragments are, with 1 being iden-
tical. To assess the relevance of the context span, we first compute
BCEbetweenthequestionandeachsentenceinthecontextspan
andthenassigntothecontextspanthemaximumscoreachieved
by any sentence. The intuition behind this computation strategy is
