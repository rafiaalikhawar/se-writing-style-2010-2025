ABSTRACT
Rich datasets have empowered various deep learning (DL) applica-
tions, leading to remarkable success in many fields. However, data
faults hidden in the datasets could result in DL applications behav-
ing unpredictably and even cause massive monetary and life losses.
To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a dynamic
data faultlocalization approach, namely DFauLo , to locate the
mislabeled and noisy data in the deep learning datasets. DFauLo
is inspired by the conventional mutation-based code fault localiza-
tion, but utilizes the differences between DNN mutants to amplify
and identify the potential data faults. Specifically, it first gener-
ates multiple DNN model mutants of the original trained model.
Then it extracts features from these mutants and maps them into
a suspiciousness score indicating the probability of the given data
being a data fault. Moreover, DFauLo is the first dynamic data fault
localization technique, prioritizing the suspected data based on user
feedback, and providing the generalizability to unseen data faults
during training. To validate DFauLo , we extensively evaluate it on
26 cases with various fault types, data types, and model structures.
We also evaluate DFauLo on three widely-used benchmark datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION
Deep learning (DL)-based systems have achieved tremendous suc-
cess in a wide range of applications such as facial recognition [ 15],
autonomous driving [ 30,88], medical diagnosis [ 55], etc. Compared
to traditional code-driven software, DL-based systems adopt a data-
driven programming paradigm, and thus face extra security and
reliability challenges related to data faults (e.g., mislabeled data sam-
ples). Such faults can be inherited by DL models that are trained on
the data, resulting in significant losses and even fatalities [ 23,53,71].
Therefore, guaranteeing the quality of datasets becomes a signifi-
cant quality assurance aspect for DL-based systems.
Related Work. Various quality assurance techniques specifi-
cally designed for DNN models have been proposed, including di-
agnosing incorrect training code and hyperparameter settings [ 81],
locating misbehavior inside the model neurons [ 25], generatingESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA Yining Yin, Yang Feng, Shihao Weng, Zixi Liu, Yuan Yao, Yichi Zhang, Zhihong Zhao, and Zhenyu Chen
adversarial inputs [ 59,68], and repairing the DL model misbehav-
ior [76,77]. The above techniques mainly aim at finding the vul-
nerability in a well-trained model, but neglect the root cause of
such vulnerability, i.e., the faults in the dataset. Such faults may
propagate to the models in an implicit way (through the model’s
internal parameters), and fundamentally influence the performance
and quality of DL applications [71].
In the machine learning community, learning with noisy labels
(LNL) has been proposed to handle the potential noises in the
dataset [ 74]. These works aim to train a robust and accurate model
even with the presence of label noises. However, LNL techniques fail
to debug the dataset and improve the data quality, and thus cannot
guarantee the performance of downstream DL applications [53].
According to a recent survey conducted by IBM [ 23], 96% of
enterprises encounter data challenges in their AI projects, and
2/5 of them are not confident in ensuring data quality. Recently,
a few research groups [ 53,65,71] have also conducted empirical
studies and advocated focusing on the data aspect rather than
the model aspect when developing DL applications. For example,
Liang et al. [ 53] reveal that the design and sculpting of the data
used to develop AI often rely on bespoke manual work, which
critically affects the trustworthiness of the model. Sambasivan et
al. [71] reported that a large number of experienced developers are
impacted by at least one data cascade-compounding event, which
leads to negative downstream effects from data issues. Curtis et
al. [8] have found systematic labeling errors (ranging from 0.15%
to 10.12%) in popular AI benchmark datasets, which destabilizes
the evaluation of DL benchmarks [ 65]. In a nutshell, both industry
and academia are calling for an effective and efficient data-centric
approach to improve the data quality for DNNs.
Our Work. In this paper, we introduce DFauLo , adynamic data
faultlocalization approach for deep neural networks. The key
insight of DFauLo is to incorporate the manual inspection feed-
back into the inspection process, and thus prioritize the suspicious
data adaptively. While existing techniques [ 64,96] are designed
to prioritize the data into a static queue for manual inspection,
DFauLo adopts a different method that dynamically updates the
data queue based on the feedback of each round of inspections.
DFauLo migrates the classic mutation-based code fault localization
techniques [ 50,62,66,67] to obtain effective data fault features. By
generating multiple DNN model mutants from different dimensions
of the original model, we propose and extract fault features based
on the prediction behavior of each mutant. Then DFauLo models
the suspiciousness model with extracted features, and dynamically
updates the model with collected feedback.
Specifically, the key insight of DFauLo is two-fold. First, DFauLo
amplifies and captures the difference between clean data and sparsely
distributed faulty data in the dataset via model mutation . In the clas-
sic mutation-based code fault localization, mutating the program
statement could amplify the execution difference of the test suite.
That is, faulty statements tend to perform differently compared to
correct statements when two groups of mutants are generated, one
that mutates a faulty statement and the other that mutates a correct
statement. To apply this idea to data fault localization, we introduce
a set of model mutation strategies to fine-tune the original DNN
model into multiple slightly changed mutated models. These modelmutation strategies ensure that DNN mutant has a similar predic-
tion capability on clean data compared to the original model, but
may not well fit the sparse faulty data. In other words, the mutated
model amplifies the difference between clean and faulty data.
Second, DFauLo spots the potential faulty data via an iterative
way, where the feedback obtained from the manual review is uti-
lized to dynamically enhance its performance and generalizability
to unseen data faults during the training. Specifically, since data
distributions change in practice and it is impossible to collect all
types of data faults during training, we propose a dynamic data
fault localization workflow that can adapt to the real-world distri-
bution of data faults. Our approach employs a logistic regression
model, called 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 , to predict the suspicious faulty data. We then
use previously confirmed faulty data to continuously update the
𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 , allowing the DFauLo to dynamically prioritize suspected data
and improve the effectiveness of subsequent data fault localization.
To validate the effectiveness of DFauLo , we conduct a compre-
hensive experiment on 26 subjects of different data fault types,
model structures, data types, and DL tasks. The experimental re-
sults show that DFauLo can effectively locate different types of
data faults, and the model performance can be improved by cor-
recting the located faults. Additionally, we also conduct a case
study on three widely-used benchmark datasets, including EMNIST-
Letter [ 22], ImageNet [ 24], and MTFL [ 4]. Compared with baseline
methods, DFauLo locates more real faults in the EMNIST-Letter
dataset. And for more complicated benchmark datasets, hundreds
of real faults of different types are confirmed by DFauLo .
Contributions. The contributions of this paper include:
•Technique. We propose DFauLo , a data fault localization
technique for dynamically locating data faults in DL datasets.
To the best of our knowledge, DFauLo is the first technique
that incorporates the model mutation method to locate data
faults in a dynamic manner. Since it is designed upon fea-
tures extracted from general attributes of DNNs, DFauLo is
applicable for various types of deep learning datasets.
•Tool. We have implemented DFauLo into a tool that can
automatically locate data faults hidden in the deep learning
datasets. We have also released the source code and pre-
sented a demonstration at [12].
•Study. We have conducted a large-scale experiment with 26
subjects containing both text and image data to validate the
effectiveness of DFauLo . Further, we apply DFauLo to three
widely-used deep learning benchmark datasets and locate
hundreds of real data faults. This result further confirms the
practicability of DFauLo .
2 PRELIMINARY AND BACKGROUND
This section introduces the background knowledge of deep learning
and states the definitions of data fault and data fault localization.
2.1 Deep Learning
2.1.1 Model Training. A deep neural network (DNN) model can
be denoted asF:X→Y , which is essentially a mapping from
the input domainXto the output domain Y. Take image classifica-
tion as an example. The input 𝑥∈X is an image, and the output
𝑦∈Y is a one-hot vector representing the image’s label over the
label space. Typically, training a DNN model often requires a large
dataset, denoted as 𝐷={(𝑥1,𝑦1),(𝑥2,𝑦2),...,(𝑥𝑛,𝑦𝑛)}. Given aDynamic Data Fault Localization for Deep Neural Networks ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA

loss functionL(F(𝑥),𝑦)such as cross-entropy [ 20] and an opti-
mization strategy such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) [ 75],
the model parameters can be updated based on the training set
𝐷. After sufficient epochs of training on 𝐷, we can obtain proper
internal parameters of the DNN model and deploy it in the appli-
cation to predict labels for unseen inputs. Essentially, just as the
code faults explicitly influence the program behavior through test
case execution [ 62,83], defects hidden in the dataset impact the
model’s internal parameters during training, which in turn leads to
potential vulnerabilities in the model [53, 71].
2.1.2 Data Preparation. Data preparation is an integral part of
deep learning, and it includes collecting, cleaning, and labeling
the data samples. Among them, data labeling is the most labor-
intensive. Benefiting from online crowdsourcing platforms such as
Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) [ 1], Appen (previously known as
CrowdFlower) [ 3], and Prolific [ 10], the developers or data engi-
neers of DL applications can hire a large number of crowd-workers
to manually label the raw-data. Although such online platforms
provide diverse solutions [ 2,9,44] to help data engineers adjust
their data labeling tasks, it is still inevitable to include various er-
rors, biases, and noises into the dataset [ 37]. Therefore, developers
or data engineers of DL applications are required to ensure the data
quality and thus improve the generalizability and reliability of DL
models trained on the dataset [53].
2.2 Problem Statement
2.2.1 Data Fault. Data faults refer to the mismatches between
data and labels in the dataset, which can occur due to poor data
quality [ 28], or mistakes made by human organizers [ 78] or anno-
tators [ 61]. Ideally, the data instance in the dataset should associate
with and only with one label; however, in practice, due to various
noise or mistakes, some data might associate with no or more than
one label. In that situation, these data may be faulty and could
threaten the performance of deep learning models. Thus, to clarify
the problem this paper is dealing with, we assume each data is
associated with a label set. We define data faults as follows:
Definition 1 ( Data Fault ).LetXdenote the data instance set
andYdenote the label set. Suppose 𝑥∈Xis an input data instance
in a manually labeled dataset 𝐷={(𝑥,𝑦)|𝑥∈X,𝑦∈Y} , we can
denote the manual label of 𝑥as𝑦and its ground truth label set as 𝑌𝑥.
Based on this definition, we say (𝑥,ˆ𝑦)is a correctly labeled data, if
and only if𝑌𝑥contains the only label ˆ𝑦. Therefore, in the manuallyconstructed dataset 𝐷containing faults, we say (𝑥𝑓,𝑦𝑓)is adata
fault , if: 1)∃𝑦′≠𝑦𝑓,𝑦′∈𝑌𝑥; or 2)𝑌𝑥=∅. Moreover, if there
exists the only 𝑦′∈Y, such that(𝑥𝑓,𝑦′)is not a data fault, we name
the corresponding fault type as label noise ; otherwise, the fault is
categorized as data noise .
Figure 1 presents some examples of data faults detected in the im-
age dataset ImageNet [ 24]. The first example (𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒 1,𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎)
is classified into the incorrect class, which can be corrected by mod-
ifying the class label. We name this type of data fault as label
noise [74,86], which assumes the data sample is labeled into the in-
correct classes. The second example (𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒 1,𝑠𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑘𝑒)does not
include all appropriate labels. To correct such data, the input should
be cropped or modified before re-annotating. The third example
(𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒 3,𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑙𝑦𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟 )has poor quality, and we cannot
infer any label from its input. To correct such data, we should delete
it from the dataset. We name the fault type of the second and third
examples as data noise , because correcting such data fault requires
modifying the input data.1
2.2.2 Data Fault Localization. In classic software engineering re-
search, fault localization techniques aim to yield a ranking list of
program statements according to their suspiciousness. A higher
suspiciousness score indicates the statement is more likely to con-
tain faults, i.e., the buggy code that causes failures [ 50,67]. Inspired
by the classic fault localization problem, we migrate the concept
of fault localization into the DNN dataset debugging, and propose
to assist data engineers by ranking the data samples so that data
faults can be prioritized for review and correction. We next define
the data fault localization problem:
Definition 2 ( Data Fault Localization Problem ).Let
𝐷𝑓⊂𝐷be a subset of the dataset 𝐷, which contains all data faults
of𝐷. The data fault localization problem is to find a suspiciousness
function𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 :𝐷→Rsuch that∀(𝑥𝑓,𝑦𝑓)∈𝐷𝑓and∀(𝑥,𝑦)∈
𝐷\𝐷𝑓, we have:
𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝((𝑥𝑓,𝑦𝑓))>𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝((𝑥,𝑦)).
3 APPROACH
This section presents the proposed approach, DFauLo . We first
present the overall idea and then detail its three steps.
3.1 The Key Idea
Our approach is built upon the insight that the identified data faults
represent the distribution of potential faults in the dataset, and
utilizing inspection feedback can improve the fault localization
capability. Therefore, designing a dynamic data fault localization
technology that introduces feedback information into subsequent
data inspection is a natural idea. To locate data faults dynamically,
we need to model a suspiciousness function that can be updated
with feedback. By extracting the fault features of each data point,
we can dynamically fit a suspiciousness model 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 based on the
fault features. Therefore, we have to design a fault feature extrac-
tion method that can reflect the differences between clean and
faulty data. Considering that DNN models initially learn and fit the
primary features of the dataset [ 17,38,87], models fine-tuned on
the majority subset are expected to fluctuate on data faults that are

sparsely distributed and account for a small proportion of the set.
Based on this insight, we introduce the concept of model mutation
to amplify the behavior differences between clean data and data
faults. Specifically, DFauLo first fine-tunes the original model to
generate multiple model mutants, then designs and extracts fault
features for each data point based on the behavior divergence of
model mutants. With distinctive fault features and a dynamic itera-
tion process design, DFauLo can update the suspiciousness model
𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 based on feedback to locate diverse data faults in application.
The overview of our approach DFauLo is shown in figure 2,
which consists of three key steps. First, to amplify and capture the
divergence between clean data and data faults in the training dataset
𝐷, the primary features of the data from different model layers are
sampled to generate model mutants, which is described in detail in
Section 3.2. Second, each data sample in 𝐷is predicted by the model
mutants, and their corresponding features related to the selection
state, the output result, and the prediction loss are extracted as
data fault features. The feature extraction method is presented in
Section 3.3. Finally, based on the extracted features, a dynamic data
fault location approach is proposed. A logistic regression model
𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 is applied to map the fault features into suspiciousness scores
for each data sample. To improve the localization precision, we
propose to update the 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 with feedback gathered from previously
checked data, which is detailed and expressed in Section 3.4.
3.2 Model Mutation Strategy
Locating faults via mutation has been discussed in conventional
fault localization apporaches [ 62,66]. If the faulty program state-
ment is mutated, failed test cases will pass on mutated programs; if
the correct statement is mutated, previously passed test cases may
fail. Therefore, the mutation strategy could amplify the behavior
between clean components and faults. Migrating such an idea into
deep learning, if the original model is fine-tuned and the prediction
capability is almost unchanged, the clean data will be predicted
correctly as the original model, and the fault data may be predicted
differently if the model mutant is not over-fitted to them.
The remaining problem is how to fine-tune the model so as
to maintain an almost unchanged model mutant. To this end, we
design various mutation strategies that could keep the majority
of the dataset to mutate the original model, so that the model
mutant is slightly different from the original one and outputs similar
predictions to samples with typical features.To implement this design, we sample the subset 𝐷′based on the
neuron outputs across the input, hidden, and output layers of the
original DNN model F. Because a DNN model contains multiple
hidden layers and deeper layer outputs are considered to provide
more abstract information [ 26], we mainly employ the last linear
layer to represent to hidden layer’s information in this paper. For
each layer, we identify a small ratio subset of data with sparse fea-
tures, which are denoted as 𝐷1
𝑜𝑢𝑡,𝐷2
𝑜𝑢𝑡, and𝐷3
𝑜𝑢𝑡, and discard them
to obtain𝐷𝑖=𝐷\𝐷𝑖
𝑜𝑢𝑡. After that, the model mutants are generated
by retraining the original model Ffor several extra epochs on 𝐷𝑖
to slightly change the original model, which is lightweight than
train the model from scratch. Denoting the predefined remove ratio
as𝛼, we next present the details to obtain each 𝐷𝑖
𝑜𝑢𝑡.
3.2.1 Input Layer .For the input layer, we capture the data fea-
tures by detecting input outliers from the input space. Specifically,
we adopt a classical method, namely VAE, i.e., variational auto-
encoder [ 40], as the outlier detector. It builds an auto-encoder to
extract the low-dimensional features of each data. If an input 𝑥∈𝑋
has a larger reconstruction error, it is supposed to have more sus-
picious data features and be an outlier. Denote the reconstruction
error of𝑥as𝐸(𝑥). The data is sorted according to the value of 𝐸(𝑥),
and the prioritized 𝛼of the largest errors is discarded. The subset
to be removed is formally denoted as:
𝐷1
𝑜𝑢𝑡={(𝑥,𝑦)|(𝑥,𝑦)∈𝐷∧arg max
|𝑋′|/|𝑋|=𝛼(Σ𝑥∈𝑋′𝐸(𝑥))}.
The remaining samples 𝐷1=𝐷\𝐷1
𝑜𝑢𝑡is then applied for train the
model mutantF1.
3.2.2 Hidden Layer .The hidden neurons of the model carry the
features learned from the training data, and the deeper layer of
the network represents more abstract information about model
behaviors [ 19]. In the training dataset, neuron activation states of
the clean data corresponding to the same label are similar, while a
small amount of noise data may trigger different neuron activation
[21]. Therefore, we choose to remove the data with deviations in
the distribution of neuron activation states. For each input data
𝑥∈𝑋, we collect the activation vector of the last linear layer for
analysis, which is denoted as F−1(𝑥). Then, we adopt 𝑘-Means [ 20]
to cluster the activation states 𝐴𝑆={F−1(𝑥)|𝑥∈𝑋}into two
clusters𝐴𝑆1,𝐴𝑆2. Obviously, the sparse features would belong to
a minor cluster, thus for each dataset, we remove the data in the
smaller cluster to construct the subset. Suppose |𝐴𝑆1|≥|𝐴𝑆2|, theDynamic Data Fault Localization for Deep Neural Networks ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA

𝑜𝑢𝑡={(𝑥,𝑦)|(𝑥,𝑦)∈𝐷∧F−1(𝑥)∈𝐴𝑆2}.
Similar to the input layer mutation, we apply 𝐷2=𝐷\𝐷2
𝑜𝑢𝑡to train
the second model mutant F2.
3.2.3 Output Layer .We analyze the model from the output per-
spective based on prediction loss. If the DNN fails to fit the data due
to unrecognizable or mismatched labels, the corresponding predic-
tion loss will be large. Hence, based on the output layer, we choose
to remove the data with high prediction losses. Denoting the loss
function of DNN as L(F(𝑥),𝑦), the removed data is formalized as:
𝐷3
𝑜𝑢𝑡={(𝑥,𝑦)|(𝑥,𝑦)∈𝐷∧arg max
|𝑋′|/|𝑋|=𝛼(Σ𝑥∈𝑋′L(F(𝑥),𝑦))}.
The subset𝐷3=𝐷\𝐷3
𝑜𝑢𝑡is applied to train the mutant F3.
Specifically, for general DL tasks, we construct the model mutant
based on the above strategy, and for categorical tasks, we discard
data for each category to construct the mutants.
3.3 Fault Feature Extraction
After we generate mutants that amplify the differences between
clean and faulty data, we extract a series of fault features for each
data sample. The fault features are listed in table 1, which can be
categorized into three classes: selection state (SS), output result
(OR), and prediction loss (PR).
The selection state (SS) indicates whether corresponding data
belong to a sparse feature in the training set, i.e., whether we apply it
for model mutation. For each data (𝑥,𝑦)in the original training set,
the selection state is marked as 1if the model mutant applied it for
training, otherwise, it is marked as 0. Therefore, the selection state
of each model mutant is a discrete one-dimensional vector. We use
the characteristic function 1𝑋to indicate the selection state, and 𝑋
is regarded as the training dataset. The output result (OR) represents
the output vector of the DNN model when predicting each data,
which reveals the execution differences between mutants and the
original model. Thus, the OR features are continuous vectors with
the same dimension as the DNN model’s output. For prediction loss
(PL) features, we adopt the same loss function used in the model
optimization process. The loss function may be variant for different
models and tasks, but we can determine the unique loss function
Lapplied for a specific F. The PL features are continuous one-
dimensional variables. Compared to OR features which preserve
detailed differences between mutants, PL features directly indicate
the gap between prediction and label.
In summary, these fault features can be easily extracted through
prediction, and reveal the behavior differences from diverse aspects.Because these features are general attributes of a DNN model, our
approach could be applied to DNN datasets trained on arbitrary
model structures or loss functions.
3.4 Dynamic Data Fault Localization
For a dataset under review, without a standard reference dataset,
trusted clean data and real faults are both scarce. Meanwhile, due to
the differences in data collection methods, data sources, annotator
labeling habits, etc., data faults are distributed differently among
various datasets. As a result, designing a universal suspiciousness
score based solely on static scores (fault features) is not appropriate
for detecting diverse data faults.
Therefore, inspired by traditional fault localization techniques [ 18,
50,85], we choose to model a dynamically updated logistic regres-
sion model to predict the suspiciousness score. Denoting the em-
ployed model as 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 , the feature set of data sample 𝑑=(𝑥,𝑦)ex-
tracted from table 1 as 𝐹(𝑑)={𝑓1(𝑑),...,𝑓𝑚(𝑑)}, and the weights
correspond to each variable as 𝑊={𝑤0,𝑤1,...,𝑤𝑚}, the fault
probability computed by logistic function [20] is:
𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝(𝐹(𝑑))=1
1+𝑒−(𝑤0+Σ𝑚
𝑖=1𝑤𝑖𝑓𝑖(𝑑)).
With a set of positive and negative samples, the internal weights
𝑊of the𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 could be optimized. The basic idea is to adjust the
𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 using already checked data, which is a natural and convenient
process for data collection. In the following, we will explain how
to initialize and dynamically update the 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 .
Initialization. Initially, the entire dataset has not been checked
by workers, and thus we do not have enough reliable positive (data
fault) and negative (clean data) samples for training the 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 . To
overcome this issue, we use the following strategies to initialize the
𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 : 1) generate artificial positive samples by constructing noisy
vectors; 2) prepare artificial negative samples by randomly sampling
from the original dataset. The reason is two-fold: 1) noisy vector
distributes more outlier than real data faults, making them effective
for macroscopic modeling of fault features; 2) our method is based
on the assumption that the majority of the dataset is correctly
labeled, and thus most of the raw data are clean. Supposing the
artificial positive and negative data are 𝐷0𝑝and𝐷0𝑛respectively.
Their corresponding fault features are denoted as 𝐹(𝐷0𝑝),𝐹(𝐷0𝑛).
Therefore, without acquiring any manual feedback, we train the
𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 model on these artificial samples to initialize it. Then the
initialized𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 computes the suspiciousness score for each data
sample(𝑥,𝑦)∈𝐷and ranks them in descending order.
Updating. Based on the trained 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 , all unchecked data are
ranked, and a batch of high suspiciousness score data is provided
to the annotators. With the assistance of data collection platforms
[2,9], workers can review and report incorrect or improper data
samples. The platform allows testers to analyze the results and
determine the next batch of data to be checked. Inspired by online
learning [ 16], we propose a dynamic data ranking workflow that ad-
justs the𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 based on feedback from annotators. The model adapts
to the specific distribution patterns of the current dataset, producing
a more accurate ranking for subsequent data. For the 𝑘-th iteration,
our goal is to sample a subset 𝐷𝑘for manual checking. First, we
take the union of previously checked subsets 𝐷1,...,𝐷𝑘−1, denoted
as𝐷1,𝑘−1. The identified data faults in 𝐷1,𝑘−1are flagged as real
positive samples (𝐷1,𝑘−1
𝑝 ), other samples are flagged as real negativeESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA Yining Yin, Yang Feng, Shihao Weng, Zixi Liu, Yuan Yao, Yichi Zhang, Zhihong Zhao, and Zhenyu Chen

4 EXPERIMENT SETTINGS
This section presents the experimental setup, including the descrip-
tion of experiment subjects, baseline methods, parameter settings,
and evaluation metrics.
4.1 Experiment Subjects
We employ 26 combinations of datasets, DNN models, and data
fault types as experiment subjects. Table 2 lists all combinations
that show the diversity in three aspects:
a)Data types and tasks. We apply DFauLo to two image clas-
sification datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10, one text dataset AgNews,
and one face alignment dataset MTFL. MNIST [ 46] is a 10-class
handwritten digits dataset, which contains 60,000 28×28greyscale
images for training and 10,000 for testing. CIFAR-10 [ 43] is a colored
10-class dataset, and each input is a 3-channel 32×32image. AG-
News [ 91] is a subset of AG’s corpus of news articles constructed by
assembling titles and description fields of articles from the 4 largest
classes. Multi-Task Facial Landmark (MTFL) dataset [ 4] contains
12,995 face images with five coordinates of facial landmarks. The
first three datasets (i.e., ID 1~24) are constructed for classification
tasks, and the last dataset MTFL (ID 25&26) is for regression tasks.
b)Network structures. We implement 7 models with different
network structures in the experiment, including 5 convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) for image domain datasets (i.e., LeNet-1,
LeNet-5 [ 45], ResNet-20 [ 32], VGG-16 [ 73], and TCDCNN [ 94]),
as well as 2 classical recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for text
domain datasets (i.e., LSTM [35] and BiLSTM [31]).
c)Fault types. Since data faults have different forms, for each
model&dataset combination, we use multiple ways to simulate dif-
ferent types of data faults. As defined in Definition 1, we considertwo types of data faults (i.e., label noise anddata noise ). Addition-
ally, based on the observation that the distribution of data faults
impacts the classification effectiveness [ 28], we also simulate two
types of data distributions (i.e., symmetric and asymmetric). Sym-
metric noise, also known as random noise, supposes the faults are
uniformly distributed among each class [ 28]. For random label noise ,
we randomly select 5% data from each class, and change their label
into a random label other than the original one; for random data
noise , we randomly select 5% data from each class, and replace their
inputs with irrelevant data. In practice, label noise often exists be-
tween similar classes and data noise can be associated with only a
specific class rather than all classes. To simulate this phenomenon,
we introduce asymmetric noise. For specific label noise , we select
5% data from two classes and exchange their labels; for specific
data noise , we randomly select 5% data from one class and replace
it with irrelevant data. Let 𝐴→𝐵represent that we use dataset
𝐴to replace data in dataset 𝐵. We apply 4 famous datasets in our
experiments to inject data faults, denoted as CIFAR-10 ↔MNIST,
IMDb [7]→AGNews, and COCO [54] →MTFL.
4.2 Baselines
We employ seven baselines, including three learning with noisy
label (LNL) methods CleanLab [64],SemiFeat [96] and NCNV [47],
two test prioritization techniques DeepGini [27] and DeepState [57],
one advanced outlier detection method DIF[84], and one model
uncertainty metric (denoted as Uncertainty [29,60]).CleanLab
is an open-sourced label issue detection tool based on the confident
learning algorithm. It can be applied to classification datasets with
any ML models and data types. SemiFeat is a data-centric noisy
label clean technique aimed at identifying corrupt data labels in
datasets without relying on training a model. NCNV is a method
called Neighborhood Collective Noise Verification, which measures
the degree of inconsistency to filter out the noisy data. DIFis a
novel outlier detection method, which applies neural networks and
isolation forests to detect outliers. Test prioritization is designed
to select the data predicted incorrectly by the model. Since DNNs
with good generalization should also make incorrect predictions on
faulty data, these methods are valuable as baselines for evaluating
their effectiveness in detecting data faults. DeepGini is a simple
but effective test prioritization method for DNN with the Softmax
output layer. DeepState is a test selection method specifically de-
signed for recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which selects error
tests based on the internal states of the RNNs. The above methods
cannot be applied to the regression model, and we introduce a gen-
eral method Uncertainty as a baseline method, which evaluates
the model uncertainty for DNN with a dropout layer. Other priori-
tization and LNL techniques are omitted because they require to be
trained on a trusted training set [ 51,80,92] or do not involve a rank
for data inspection [ 41,49,89]. Besides, other detection techniques
such as concept drift detection [ 58] which do not focus on wrongly
labelled data are not considered either.
4.3 Parameter Settings
To implement DFauLo , we need to set some hyper-parameters. First,
for model mutation strategy, the implementation of VAE is based
on the open-sourced Python tool PyOd [ 95]. The remove_ratio
𝛼is set as 5%. We mutate the original model by directly retrain-
ing the original model, the retraining_epoch is set as 10, and theDynamic Data Fault Localization for Deep Neural Networks ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA
learning_rate is the same as the setting of model training. To sim-
ulate the updating process of 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 , we set the iteration_batchsize
as 200 and update the model 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 per batch to prioritize the next
batch of unchecked data. The maximum ratio used for updating
𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 (i.e., review budget) is 20%; after that, we rank all the unchecked
data based on the last 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 . Finally, the whole data rank is reordered
based on the iteration batch to evaluate the effectiveness of DFauLo .
4.4 Evaluation Metrics
We employ three metrics, i.e., PoBL(10%) ,RAUC , and AUC-ROC ,
to evaluate the effectiveness of baselines and DFauLo . PoBL(10%)
refers to the proportion of located data faults to all data faults in
the top 10% data, it measures the effectiveness of localization with
a fixed manual budget. Furthermore, to measure the overall local-
ization effectiveness, we plot the localization performance of each
subject into a figure, where the x-axis is the ratio of data ranked
byDFauLo or baselines, and the y-axis is the ratio of fault already
detected. We also plot the theoretically best localization perfor-
mance in which all faults are prioritized in front of other data. We
calculate the ratio of the area under the curve for the data fault
localization approach to the area under the curve for the ideal data
rank as another evaluation metric, named RAUC [ 14,80]. RAUC
ranges from 0 to 1, and a larger RAUC value indicates better per-
formance. Considering the fact that the fault localization problem
can be naturally modeled as a binary classification task, we also
employ the AUC-ROC metric to evaluate the performance. Differ-
ent from RAUC, AUC-ROC indicates the effectiveness of selecting
a threshold for classifying positive and negative samples.
5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In the experiment, we mainly focus on the following four research
questions (RQs):
•RQ1: Effectiveness. How effective is DFauLo in locating
data faults in the DL datasets?
•RQ2: Ablation Study. What is the impact of each compo-
nent in the DFauLo design on the effectiveness?
•RQ3: Efficiency. What is the computational efficiency of
DFauLo compared to baselines?
•RQ4: Potentials. To what extent can DFauLo improve the
performance of DNN models via locating the data faults?
Additionally, to evaluate the effectiveness in real application scenar-
ios, we conduct a case study using benchmark datasets to explore
theDFauLo ’s superiority in locating natural existence data faults.
5.1 RQ1: Effectiveness
Tables 3 and 4 show the results on subjects with classification and
regression tasks, respectively. To mitigate bias, we run the whole
experiment five times and report the average results. In table 3 and 4,
we list the results based on data fault types. Additionally, figure 3
shows localization curves indicating the proportion of located faults
versus the proportion of prioritized data.
Results. LNL techniques, including CleanLab ,NCNV , and
SemiFeat , perform well (RAUC>0.9) in most subjects with label
noises (table 3 row 1-12), which is significantly better than other
baselines. For datasets with random data noises (row 13-18), most
baselines show competitive performance (RAUC ≥0.812), but NCNV
andDIFperforms poor on LeNet-5 (RAUC=0.514) and AGNews
(RAUC=0.522) respectively. Compared with CNN models, the resultsof all methods on RNN models are less effective. The RNN-specific
method DeepState performs better on data noise than label noise.
In table 4, Uncertainty shows poor performance in all evaluation
metrics, PoBL(10%) ( ≤0.1), RAUC (≤0.517) and AUC-ROC ( ≤0.504).
For most of the experiment subjects, the RAUC and AUC-ROC
metrics of DFauLo are more effective and stable (all results exceed
0.91) compared to baselines. Additionally, for the evaluation metric
PoBL(10%), DFauLo even reaches the maximum value of 1.00 on
some subjects, which means it locates all data faults in the top 10%
list. It can also be observed that the curves of DFauLo in figure 3
are closer to the theoretically best curves than other baselines.
Discussion. According to the results, DFauLo outperforms other
baselines in both classification and regression datasets, with con-
sistent effective results. The results suggest that Uncertainty has
no significant effect on locating data faults, which is likely due to
the model’s overfitting to noisy data in the training set. For the
first three groups of fault types (table 3 row 1-18), LNL techniques
are more effective than other baselines, and CleanLab performs
better than other LNL techniques. All LNL techniques failed to
demonstrate effectiveness and perform even worse than random
ranking for specific data noises. On the other hand, we notice that
outlier detection method DIFis good at locating image data noises,
but shows bad performance on locating label noises and text data
noises. Two test prioritization methods ( DeepGini andDeepState )
are effective in identifying random data noise, but are not suffi-
ciently sensitive to label noise. Considering the fact that all of test
prioritization techniques are designed for selecting the unlabelled
data for manual labelling, we speculate this experiment result fits
their design choice well. Besides, NCNV requires to train DNN mod-
els with specific designed process, the default training setting may
not convergence for NCNV , this property illustrate its poor results
on MNIST&LeNet-5. Our findings indicate that existing methods
based on static data ranking become useless in finding faults in
dataset with more diverse data faults. Additionally, combined with
the results of table 3 and table 4, DFauLo shows stable effectiveness
in all fault types, dataset domain, model structure and task types,
demonstrating its superior generalizability.
5.2 RQ2: Ablation Study
We construct an ablation study to investigate the effectiveness of
DFauLo ’s designs. Specifically, we evaluate the localization per-
formance of the suspiciousness function 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 without utilizing
all model mutants and without dynamic iteration respectively. To
mitigate bias and reach a statistically significant result, we repeat ex-
periments on each subject 30 times. Also, we employ the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test [ 34] and Cliff’s 𝛿analysis [ 70] to analyze whether
there are significant differences between the ablation setting and
the design of DFauLo . Following the conventions of previous work
[63,72], if the rank-sum significance level 𝑝<0.05and effect size
|𝛿| ≥0.474, we mark the corresponding setting is significantly
worse (or better) than DFauLo . Limited by space, we select 6 exper-
iment subjects and report the average RAUC in table 5.
Results. For most subjects, the initialized 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 model (with-
out feedback) shows competitive performance (RAUC ≥0.8958)
compared to the best baselines in table 3; and for challenging
experimental settings, such as #ID 24 (specific data noise in AG-
News&BiLSTM), without the aid of feedback, the initialized 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA Yining Yin, Yang Feng, Shihao Weng, Zixi Liu, Yuan Yao, Yichi Zhang, Zhihong Zhao, and Zhenyu Chen

Even with only 1% human feedback, the localization performance
can be improved, especially for difficult data fault types (the average
RAUC of #ID 24 is improved from 0.4276 to 0.9150).
Discussion. First, using DNN model mutants generated from
different dimensions of the model provides DFauLo with effective
fault features for locating diverse types of faults. Besides, when
𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 models leverage no human feedback, the result can be seen
as a static technique. In this case, such “Static-FauLo” exhibits both
performance and bottlenecks similar to state-of-the-art static base-
line methods. The dynamic iterative design of DFauLo is the key to
breaking through the predicament of static techniques. For those
data fault types that are difficult to analyze and identify by static
techniques, DFauLo can promptly utilize feedback to learn un-
known features of data faults. Finally, taking advantage of moreTable 5: Average RAUC results of ablation study on 6 exper-

5.3 RQ3: Efficiency
We collect and report the average execution time of different meth-
ods in table 6. On the one hand, we compare DFauLo with other
baseline methods; on the other hand, since DFauLo composes multi-
ple steps, we also collect the separate computation time of DFauLo .
The top half of the table reports the time cost by baselines, and
the last half of the table reports the overall (Row ALL) time and
separate time cost for each operation of DFauLo .Dynamic Data Fault Localization for Deep Neural Networks ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA

Results. Table 6 shows DeepGini ,DeepState ,Uncertainty ,
andDIFtake less than 500 seconds for all experiments, which are
the most efficient techniques. Notwithstanding being effective in
RQ1, LNL techniques ( CleanLab ,NCNV , and SemiFeat ) manifest
poor efficiency. While DFauLo ’s efficiency may not be the best, it is
acceptable, as all subjects can be ranked within an hour ( <3000s).
Model mutation and feature extraction exhaust the majority of time
inDFauLo , while initializing and updating the 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 model is rather
efficient, which only requires less than 12 seconds.
Discussion. DeepGini andDeepState are efficient due to their
use of simple model behaviors during the prediction and calcula-
tion of static scores for ranking. However, the original model may
overfit the training dataset and such static scores are not effective
for data fault localization. CleanLab adopts cross-validation to
train multiple models and compute confusion matrices, which re-
quires much larger training epochs and has limitations in terms
of applicable dataset types. NCNV needs to train two models with
a specific method from scratch, which takes the longest training
time. SemiFeat does not need to train the model, but it expends
much more computation on data processing and repeated execu-
tion. DFauLo requires retraining the original model, but only 10
epochs are sufficient, making its efficiency acceptable. In terms
of dynamic iteration efficiency, updating 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 after each iteration
is quite efficient ( 0.5-11s), as all fault features are extracted stati-
cally beforehand. Therefore, incorporating DFauLo into the data
correction workflow would not consume excessive time for testers.
5.4 RQ4: Potentials
Intuitively, if we can locate faults in the dataset and correct them,
we can obtain a clean dataset. Therefore, we are curious about
whether we can remedy some defective behaviors by retraining the
model with a cleaned dataset. Based on the data ranking computed
by each method, we correct the data faults in the top 5% as follows:
inputs with incorrect labels are corrected, and irrelevant inputs
are deleted. Then we retrain the original model and compare the
accuracy fluctuations between different methods. In addition, we
also analyze the effect of combining DFauLo with other training
methods in table 8. To evaluate whether DFauLo can enhance the
effectiveness of such methods, we implement two state-of-the-art
model-centric LNL methods, namely NLNL [ 39] and DivideMix [ 48],
and compare the model accuracy with and without DFauLo correc-
tion. We prepared two training sets for each fault type, one is with
data faults injected, and the other is corrected by DFauLo for the
top 20% data.Table 7: Repairing defective DNNs with each method.

Results. Table 7 reports the model accuracy fluctuations when
retraining the original DNN model with different fault localiza-
tion methods. For all combinations, retraining the model with the
DFauLo corrected dataset could improve the accuracy of the model.
Consistent with the results of RQ1, compared with other baseline
methods, DFauLo achieve the highest accuracy improvement in
most subjects (21 out of 26 subjects). Table 8 presents the effective-
ness of DFauLo combined with LNL methods. For the DivideMix
method trained on the noisy dataset, the model accuracy is 81.54%,
81.93%, 81.17%, and 82.06%, respectively. If DivideMix is applied
on a dataset cleaned by DFauLo , the model accuracy increases to
82.23%, 82.22%, 82.04%, and 82.13%, respectively.
Discussion. Based on table 7, we observe that most defective
DNN models can be well repaired if the data faults are corrected.
Referring to table 3, we draw the conclusion that DFauLo has better
potential in repairing defective models via locating more data faults.
Additionally, the accuracy of different types of data fault indicates
that specific data noise is most harmful to the performance. Based
on the results of table 8, DFauLo can assist in the LNL methods
to overcome the defects in the dataset and improve the model
performance. This phenomenon also demonstrates the necessity of
debugging the dataset before model training.ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA Yining Yin, Yang Feng, Shihao Weng, Zixi Liu, Yuan Yao, Yichi Zhang, Zhihong Zhao, and Zhenyu Chen

5.5 Case Study on Benchmark Datasets
5.5.1 Comparing DFauLo with Baselines. To prove the superiority
ofDFauLo over other baseline methods, we deploy all methods on
the same dataset, EMNIST-Letter [ 22]. EMNIST-Letter is a dataset
containing 12,4800 samples of 26 handwritten letters. The SOTA
DNN model of EMNIST-Letter, WaveMix [ 5], is employed for meth-
ods that require a DNN model. For each baseline, the top 1% of
the data is prioritized for manual inspection. For our method, we
collect 1% data prioritized by the initialized 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 model (noted as
Static-FauLo), as well as 1% data dynamically sampled by DFauLo .
Each data sample is allocated for 5 independent crowd workers to
check. Each sample is scored on a scale of −2,−1,0,1,2, with higher
scores indicating higher quality data, and workers are asked to
diagnose the type of fault and provide alternative labels. If a sample
receives three or more negative scores, we mark it as a fault and
use them for updating the 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 . The top left of figure 4 reports the
number of data faults found by each method. Detailed subsets of
each method with the scores and diagnostic information for each
data sample can be found on our website.
Compared with the estimated data fault rate (1.84%), only two
baseline techniques ( DIFandNCNV ) failed to prioritize real data
faults. We assume this may be caused by their limited design inten-
tions (only designed to identify outlier noises or data with incorrect
labels). In addition, CleanLab performs the best among all baseline
methods, with a fault rate of 53.93% of the selected set. Consis-
tent with the conclusions in RQ2, the initialized 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 (denoted as
Static-FauLo) almost achieves the best static method performance
(51.52% fault rate). And when we introduce the dynamic design, the
DFauLo shows outstanding results than other methods. DFauLo
locates 772 data faults out of 1248 manually inspected data, and
the corresponding fault rate is 61.86%, which demonstrates the
superiority of DFauLo in real-world application scenarios.5.5.2 Applying DFauLo on Complicated Benchmark Datasets. After
demonstrating the superiority of DFauLo in identifying EMNIST
data faults, we further apply it to more complex benchmark datasets
to uncover more diverse data faults. For the classification task, we
conduct the case study on the large-scale ImageNet [ 24] dataset,
utilizing a pre-trained model with ResNet-50 architecture provided
by PyTorch [ 11]. we apply DFauLo on the validation set of ImageNet,
e.g. ILSVRC2012 [ 6], which includes 1000 classes and 50 images for
each class. Consistent with the procedure described above, after
initializing the 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 model, the top 1% data samples are prioritized
for 5 independent crowd workers to check. For the regression task,
the MTFL [ 4] dataset is selected for the case study, we first follow the
official suggestion to pre-process the images to get a face bounding
box [ 13], and then apply DFauLo to locate data faults. Limited with
resources, we repeat the dynamic iteration 3 times for ImageNet,
and once for MTFL. Figure 4 presents some detected real faults in
these benchmark datasets.
The supposed label may be a substitute for the given label or
coexist with the given label. N/A represents that the correspond-
ing image cannot be categorized into a specific class. In the MTFL
dataset, we present the images in which the automatically gener-
ated bounding boxes mismatch the face alignment labels. Based on
the results in figure 4, we find that both two fault types defined in
Definition 1 actually exist in reality. Some input images lack rec-
ognizable features or have more than one object to classify. Other
data have recognizable features but are labeled to the incorrect
categories. For example, in the first row of figure 4, the first image
is labeled as “barn”, while the main object in the image is an owl.
Though the background of the image may indeed be a barn, this
input still lacks sufficient features of the barn for workers to label.
However, “owl” is not a candidate label in ImageNet (ILSVRC2012).
Thus the crowd workers assume it is irrelevant data which not be-
long to the dataset. Besides, if a suitable label exists, we recommendDynamic Data Fault Localization for Deep Neural Networks ESEC/FSE ’23, December 3–9, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA
workers suppose an alternative label. The second image in the first
row, labeled as “tub”, is reported to be better labeled as “jeans”. The
third image in the first row is labeled as “hand-held computer”,
while it can also be categorized into other classes, such as “space
bar”. Moreover, comparing the data faults between ImageNet and
EMNIST, we observe that the complexity of the input and tasks
also leads to more diverse data faults. Compared to the [ 65] study
which used CleanLab to manually review half of ImageNet’s data,
DFauLo discovered many unnoticed data faults. Out of 1500 Ima-
geNet data, 436 received negative scores from at least one worker in
our study but were not prioritized by CleanLab as the top half of
the possible faulty data. These newly found faults are highlighted in
figure 4 and more detailed information is available on our website.
6 THREATS TO VALIDITY
We noticed some threats in our study. The internal threat of DFauLo
comes from the errors committed by crowd-workers. The DFauLo
leverages the outcomes of human feedback to dynamically update
the model𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 , and imperfections in human feedback could nega-
tively influence the effectiveness of the DFauLo . We mitigate this
threat by evaluating DFauLo on benchmark datasets, which utilize
authentic human feedback that inherently reduces inaccuracies and
inconsistency for 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 updating. The external threat to validity lies
in the subjects used in our experiment. The selection of datasets
and simulated data faults could influence the performance of the
results. To reduce this threat, we construct 26 model and dataset
combinations with different data types and tasks, network struc-
tures, and fault types in the experiment. Moreover, we conduct a
case study on benchmark datasets to investigate the performance
ofDFauLo in detecting real data faults. All of these results show
consistent effective results of DFauLo . Another threat comes from
the randomness of all localization techniques. First, the randomness
of DNN prediction could influence the ranking of faulty data, which
poses a threat to effectiveness comparison. Besides, the randomness
when initializing the 𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑝 model also poses a threat to the abla-
tion study of DFauLo . To reduce this threat, we repeat all methods
multiple times to collect average results and introduce statistical
methods for analysis.
7 RELATED WORKS
This section reviews some related works in fault localization and
mitigation for deep learning-based software testing.
Repairing DL software codes. Similar to traditional software
testing, defects may also exist in the program codes of DL-based
software. First, faults may exist in DL libraries and then be inherited
by a concrete implementation of the DL model. Pham et al. [ 69]
proposed CRADLE to detect and localize bugs in DL libraries with
differential testing. Wang et al. [ 79] proposed LEMON to debug DL
libraries by generating effective DL models via guided mutation.
Wei et al. [ 82] proposed a fuzzing technique FreeFuzz to debug DL
libraries based on open source APIs automatically. Second, code
faults also exist in the model construct and training codes [ 36].
Wardat et al. [ 81] proposed DeepLocalize to identify the root cause
(code) for DNN errors, and the internal values are analyzed in both
feedforward and backpropagation phases to identify and locate
the incorrect codes and parameters. Zhang et al. [ 90] introduced
AUTOTRAINER to test and repair the mode training process.Adjusting neuron weights. Neuron networks rely on numer-
ous hidden neurons to make a prediction. Once the model finishes
training and is deployed to the application scenario, its internal
weights are frozen. Hence, compared to code fault, for a deployed
(trained) DL model, more potential defects may hide in the trainable
parameters of the neurons. Eniser et al. [ 25] proposed DeepFault to
identify suspicious neurons whose weights are not calibrated cor-
rectly and impact the DNN performance. Sun et al. [ 76] proposed
CARE to locate and modify the weights of suspicious neurons whilst
maintaining general accuracy. To reduce defect inheritance in trans-
fer learning, Zhang et al. [ 93] designed a relevant model slicing
method ReMoS to avoid the model inheriting the neuron faults
hidden in the teacher model. In addition, extensive deep learning
testing papers attempt to improve DL model quality by retraining
or fine-tuning the model, and the research subjects range from test
selection [27] to test generation [56, 77].
Debugging training data. Most of the abovementioned tech-
niques assume that we have a trusted dataset for testing and repair-
ing the DL model. However, such an assumption is fragile and hard
to guarantee. Li et al. [ 52] proposed LTDD to debug feature values in
training data and improve the fairness of machine learning models.
Northcutt et al. [ 64] proposed an open-source data debugging tool
CleanLab to estimate and find label errors for classification datasets.
Based on CleanLab , Northcutt et al. [ 65] conducted a large-scale
empirical study on the test sets of 10 classical ML datasets and
estimated there are at least 3.3% errors across the 10 datasets.
The relationship of DFauLo to the related work can be summa-
rized into three folds: 1) it improves DL software quality in parallel
with techniques that fix the code faults in the DL program; 2) it
provides reliability guarantees for techniques that adjust the inter-
nal model weights with datasets; 3) instead of focusing on biased
features which are hard to capture and repair, DFauLo is designed
to locate buggy data that can be interpreted and corrected manually.
8 CONCLUSION
This paper proposes a dynamic data fault localization technique
named DFauLo . Data faults in the deep learning dataset can be dy-
namically prioritized by DFauLo , and then workers can check and
correct them without reviewing the whole dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of DFauLo on a wide range of experiment sub-
jects. Moreover, we also apply DFauLo to widely-used benchmark
datasets and detect various real data faults. Our technique comple-
ments the gap in data quality assurance for the testing of DL-based
software systems, and we will explore automatically repairing these
located data faults in the future.
