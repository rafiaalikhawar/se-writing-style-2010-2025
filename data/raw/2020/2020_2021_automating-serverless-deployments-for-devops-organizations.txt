WhileagilemethodshadadeepinfluenceonsoftwareinITorgani-
zations, software development andoperations aretraditionallysepa-
rated. Operationssummarizesallactivitiesafterthedevelopment,
including configuration, resource provisioning and deployment,
monitoring,alarming,reporting,andsupport.Thewidespreadadop-
tion ofagile methods[ 17] set the focus on changing requirements
and software quality, aiming for minimal change response time.
Operations, however, focuses on stability and reliability, which are
typicallyassumedtobethreatenedbyfrequentchange. DevOpsaims
to mitigate this tension: (1) Organizationally, DevOps strengthens
collaboration between development and operations staff, often, by
unifyingboth tasksin cross-functionalteams [ 27].(2) Technically,
DevOpsleveragescode-basedtoolsforoperations,too,achieving
a high degree of automation ( continuous delivery ). Both lead to a
smootherworkflow[ 33],improvingservicequality[ 27]andchange
managementperformance [ 13].
InDevOps, InfrastructureasCode (IaC)isacoretechnique[ 32]to
automate software deployment by managing the IT infrastructure
with machine-readable files, i.e., code, replacing manual configura-
tion via interactive configuration tools. Such IaC definitions allow
versioning,debugging,updating,andreviewingoftheinfrastruc-
ture setup,reusingwell-developedtechniquesfromthe domain of
łtraditionalž application code. IaC has shown a tremendous impact
on the speed of change. For example, introducing IaC scripts in
AmbitEnergyhasincreaseddeploymentfrequencybyafactorof
1,200 [38]. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) uses IaC to maintain
75%ofits20Kservers,reducingthetimetoprovisiondevelopment
environments from 1ś2days to 21 minutes[ 39].

Unfortunately, existing IaC solutions to orchestrate multiple de-
ployments (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, StackSet, or Sceptre) are
centralized and cannot ensure that dependencies between services
in deployments of different teams are satisfied. HenceÐas we show
inthispaperÐsuchdependenciesrequire manualcoordinationof
deployments, i.e., teams have to communicate out-of-band to en-
surethecorrectdeploymentorder,e.g.,viaphone,chat,oremail.
Thisapproachisproblematicbecauseit(1)slowsdownsoftware
evolution[ 13,27]and(2)iserror-pronebecauseofpotentialmis-
communicationbetweenteams[ 33].Thisalsoappliestoapproaches
from academia, where work so far either focuses on centralization
(cf. Section 10.1,10.2, and10.4), which counteracts the decoupling
of the teams, or does not provide executable descriptions of the
infrastructure (cf. Section 10.2and10.3), which hinders automa-
tion.Beyondpreviouswork,westrivetoprovidedecentralizedand
automatedmanagementfor dependencies among deployments.
In this paper, we conduct an empirical, cross-sectional, online
questionnaire survey on 73 IT professionals, highlighting the issue
ofmanualcoordinationandshowingtheneedforbetterautomation
in DevOps. We close this gap by proposing µs([mju:z]łmusež), a
novelIaCsystem. µsfullyautomatesdeploymentcoordinationina

independently and asynchronously with no need for manual coor-

the deployment coordination for a representative service-based ap-
plication on AWS, we run benchmarks indicating no performance
overheadcomparedtoindustrial-strengthcompetitors,andweport
64 third-partyprojectsto µs.In summary:
•We survey 73 IT professionals showing that application depen-
denciesareverycommonandthat,inpractice,developersresort

3 DEPLOYMENTCOORDINATION INDEVOPS
To illustrate deployment coordination techniques for DevOps orga-
nizations,weconsidertheTeaStoreapplication[ 53],acasestudyon
onlineretailingforbenchmarkingandmodelingservicesoftware
thatweuseasarunningexamplethroughoutthepaper.TeaStore
isarepresentativecasestudyaccordingto RI1śRI4(cf.Section 2).
TeaStore consists of six services (Figure 4): (1)WebUIis publicly
accessed through a Load Balancer , (2)Imagehosts images, (3) Auth
handles authentication, (4) Recommender provides product recom-
mendations,(5) Persistence isthestoragebackendforallservices

TeaCorp,TeaStore’scompany,adoptsDevOps:eachservicein

3.1 DependenciesandCoordination
The arrows in Figure 4are dependencies between services, e.g.,
PersistencedependsonDBandRegistry.ApartfromRegistry,ev-
eryTeaStoreservicerequirestwotofive(incaseofWebUI)other
applicationsforitscorrectoperationÐacommoncase( RI1).Depen-
dencies between services constrain their deployment order ( RI2)
because each service requires that its dependencies are satisfied
for correct operation. For instance, before Persistence is deployed,
DBandRegistrymustbeupandrunning.Symmetrically,DBand
Registry should not be undeployed before Persistence. Such depen-
dencies are not limited to services but may refer to any infrastruc-
tureentity,e.g.,Persistencealsodependsonthecluster.Ensuring
59ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021,Athens,Greece Daniel Sokolowski,PascalWeisenburger,andGuidoSalvaneschi
that a service is only deployed when its dependencies are satisfied
requires deploymentcoordination, as we discuss next.
Manual Coordination. Most commonly, deployments are coordi-
natedmanually( RI3).CurrentIaCsolutionsprovidelimitedsupport
forthisapproach:eachteamindependentlymaintainsascriptfor
deploying its services without any guarantee that dependencies
aresatisfiedacrossteams(Section 10.4).Asaresult,theteamsin
TeaCorp manually coordinate tasks and have to communicate syn-
chronously,e.g.,viachatorphone,toplanthedeploymenttogether.
More advanced IaC solutions still do not fully solve thisissue. For
example, with Pulumi stack references [ 37], a TeaCorp team can
give other teams access to its deployment state, ensuring that a
service is only deployed when its dependencies to other teams’
deployments are met. Yet, this guarantee is not provided for the
undeployment order of services, potentiallyleaving the system in
an inconsistent state. Also, teams still have to manually coordinate
their operations to deploy and undeploy in a correct order. Manual
coordination contradicts DevOps’s aim of a high degree of automa-
tion. Itis error-prone, inflexible,time-consuming, and,thus, likely
to reduce the organization’s SDO performance.
Automated Coordination. Automated coordination promises bet-
ter SDO performance ( RI4). Yet, existing automated deployment
solutions, e.g., AWS CloudFormation, AWS CDK, Terraform or
Pulumi,arecentralized(Section 10.4):allteamsdelegatethedeploy-
ment oftheirservicesto asingleoperationsteam which ensures
that dependencies are satisfied without manual communication.
ToapplythismethodologytoTeaStore,acentraloperationsteam
shouldmaintaintheinfrastructureforallotherteams,i.e.,thewhole
company,ensuringcorrectdeploymentandundeploymentorder.
Unfortunately,suchacentralizedsolutionseparatesdevelopment
and operations, contradicting the łyou build it, you run itž prin-
ciple of DevOps. It is likely to reduce the SDO performance, as
communication across teams is required for (1) all changes and
(2) applicationimprovements basedonoperationalinsights.
3.2µs:AutomatedCoordination forDevOps
We proposeµs, which solves the deployment issue for DevOps
organizationsby decentralizing the automateddeploymentcoordi-
nation.Withµs,teamsindependentlyspecifytheirdeployments
in theµsℓlanguageÐsimilar to what they may do today with, e.g.,
AWSCDKorPulumi.Incontrasttothesesolutions,however, µs
provides a mechanism to satisfy dependencies across deployments
withoutmanualcoordination.In µsℓ,developersdefinea wishfrom
anotherdeploymentanddeploytheirservicesdependentonitssat-
isfaction.Forexample,inTeaCorp,theAuthteamdefineswishes
for Registry and Persistence and lets its service depend on them so
thattheAuthserviceisonlydeployedwhenthewishesaresatisfied.
TheRegistryandPersistenceteamssatisfythesewishesbydefining
acorresponding offerintheirdeployments.
To automate deployment coordination, the execution of each
team’s deployment is a continuously running process of the µs
runtime and notÐas common todayÐa one-off task. The deploy-
ments communicate and ensure that services depending on wishes
are only deployed when the wishes are satisfied by corresponding
offers. For example, the Auth team’s deployment automatically de-
ploys its service when the offers from Registry and Persistence areavailable. Further, when an offer is withdrawn and a wish becomes
unsatisfied,µsensures that the Auth service isundeployedfirst.
Our solution guarantees the correct deployment and undeploy-
mentorderfordependenciesacrossdeploymentsofdifferentteams
without introducing a central authority nor requiring manual coor-
dination. Thus, µsenables safe deployments in DevOps organiza-
tionswithcross-functionalteams.
4 DEPLOYMENTDEFINITIONS
We nowpresent µsℓ,µs’definitionlanguagefor deployments.
4.1 DeploymentGraphs
Adeploymentgraph isadirectedacyclicgraph(DAG)wherenodes 𝑟
areresources, i.e., infrastructure entities like containerized services,
load balancers, ornetwork security policies. Arcs (𝑟,𝑟′)represent
dependencies betweenresources,describing requiresorhosted-by
relationships.Dependenciesaretransitiveandconstrainthedeploy-
ment order, i.e., for each arc, the target 𝑟′is deployed before the
source𝑟.Forinstance,ifacontainerdependsonacluster,thecluster
isdeployedbeforethecontainerandthecontainerisundeployed
beforethecluster.Toensurethatthedeploymentorderisdecidable,
the deploymentgraph mustbe acyclic.
Crucially,µssafelyconnectsindependentdeploymentgraphsby
inter-deployment dependencies , i.e., arcs between nodes in different
deploymentgraphs.Thesearcsspecifydependencyand,thus,de-
ploymentorderbetweenresourcesinindependentdeployments.An
inter-deployment dependency is set up through an offerand awish
resource. An offer in the deployment graph allows another deploy-
mentgraph,the beneficiary ,todependonit.Thebeneficiarydefines
a wish referencing the offer to introduce the inter-deployment de-
pendency.Likeallresources,offersandwishescanbeconnectedto
additionalresourcesintheirdeploymentgraphs,enablingtransitive
dependencies among resources across separate deployments. To
retainthedecidabilityofthedeploymentorder,inter-deployment
dependencies maynot introduce cyclicdependencies.
For example, at TeaCorp, each team maintains a separate de-
ployment graph, modelingthe team’s resources anddependencies.
Figure5showstheAuthteam’sdeploymentgraphwithallresources
required to run the Auth service. The resources depend on three
other deployments, expressedby the wishes cluster,serviceandvpc
from Registry, servicefrom Persistence, and securityGroup from
WebUI. Lastly, the Auth deployment allows other deployments’
resourcestodependonitsoffers; securityGroup forPersistenceand
Registry,and serviceforWebUI.Thecombinationofalldeployment
graphsthroughinter-deploymentdependenciesformsthe global
deploymentgraph ,whichcanbeusedforglobalreasoning.However,
such a central viewis never reified at TeaCorpas it would require
centralizedaccess to the deploymentgraphs of allteams.

its output as another resource’s input defines a dependency. Inputs
areconfigurationvaluesusedwheninstantiatingaresource,e.g.,
in Line1.8, the security group is configured with its VPC and an
egress rule. Outputs are values resulting from the deployment and
are accessible via object properties (e.g., a security group’s id in
Line1.10) or getter methods (e.g., VPC’s private subnets’ ids in
Line1.17). For instance, the Auth service also depends on a cluster
(Line1.16), the VPC (Line 1.17), the Registry service (Lines 1.24
and1.25), andthe security group (Line 1.27).

A wish is satisfiable if it corresponds to an offer across separate de-
ploymentdefinitions.Ifaresourcedependsonanunsatisfiablewish,
it is not deployedÐlike if it was not defined at all. As unsatisfiable
wishesthreatenavailability, µsallowscheckingthe compatibility
withconnecteddeploymentsbeforethedeploymentisexecuted,i.e.,
whether allwishesare satisfiablebythe connecteddeployments.
Tocheckcompatibility, µsgenerates offerexcerpts foreachre-
mote object in a deployment definition. An excerpt describes all
offersfora particularremotewiththeirtypes. Theseexcerptscan
then be used to validate the wishes in the remote deployment defi-
nition,checkingthatallwishedoffers existand thattheir typesare
subtypes ofthe wishedtype.
5 DEPLOYMENTEXECUTION
Adeployment is a process of the µsruntimeand is configured
byaµsℓdeploymentdefinition.Thedeploymentiterativelyruns
through three phases (Figure 7) as described in the following. Each
deployment can be connected to arbitrary remote deployments,
constituting adistributedsystem.
5.1 ConfigurationPhase
Eachµsℓdeployment definition is executed in the interpreter of
its ownµsdeployment runtime during the configuration phase
(Figure7a). The interpreter receives the deployment definition and
the offers to the deployment as input from remote deployments,
and generates the target state , i.e., the targeted deployment graph,
plustheresourceconfigurations .Foreachresource,theconfigura-
tioncomprisesonlysimplevaluesandoutputvaluesofresources
onwhich itdirectlydepends. Upondeployingtheresource,such
outputvaluesareavailablebecausethedependencyimpliesthatthe
resourcesassociatedwiththe outputvaluesare already deployed.
Wish resources are configured by the provided values of the
correspondingoffers.Ifawishisunsatisfied,i.e.,thecorresponding
offer is not deployed, all resources (transitively) depending on the
unsatisfiedwishareremovedfromthedeploymentgraph,ensuring
that they are not inthe target state and,thus, not deployed.
5.2 DeploymentPhase
Inthedeploymentphase ,thedriverupdatestheinfrastructurebased
on the target state and the current state (Figure7b). The current
state is the deployment graph of the currently deployed resources.
Italsocontainstheresourceconfigurations,buttheyarefullyre-
solvedtovaluesÐincontrasttothetargetstate.Thecurrentstateis
initiallyempty,andthedriverupdatesitaccordingtotheperformed
operations. It is saved in persistent storage from where it is read in
consecutive runsto initialize the currentstate.
Operations on Resources. The driver implements CRUD opera-
tions(create,read,update,delete)forallsupportedresources.Read-
ing a resource accesses its configuration from the infrastructureRemote

and updates the configuration and the output values in the current
state. Creating a resource deploys it in the infrastructure and adds
it with its configuration, dependencies, and output values to the
current state. Updating a resource updates its configuration in the
infrastructure and updates its configuration, dependencies, and
output values in the current state. Deleting a resource undeploys it
fromtheinfrastructureandremovesitwithitsconfigurationand
dependencies from the currentstate.

Thedriverappliesthese rules iterativelyuntilthecurrentstate
and the target state match. Only then all resource outputs are
resolvedto valuesin the current state.If the target state isacyclic,
termination is guaranteed. At any time, safetyis ensured, i.e., a
resourceisonly deployedwhen allits dependencies are,too.
WishesandOffers. Wishesandoffersare treatedlikeanyother
resource in the deployment procedure, except there is no entity
associated with them in the infrastructure. For wishes, the deploy-
mentoperations,thus,reducetothechangesinthecurrentstate.
For offers, on deployment, the offered values are made available to
thebeneficiarydeployment.Futurerequestsofthebeneficiaryfor
theofferareansweredwiththesevaluesand,ifthebeneficiaryis

ofanoffer,thebeneficiarydeploymentisinformedthattheoffer
is withdrawn, and the removal from the current state is delayed
untilthebeneficiaryconfirms thatnone of itsdeployedresources
depend onthe offer (anymore).
5.3 Reaction Phase
Toenable DevOps, deploymentsshould be started and updated in-
dependently,i.e.,without(synchronous)coordinationamongteams.
Thereby, it is critical to maintain all dependency constraints across
deploymentsatalltimetoensurecorrectoperation.In µs,thereac-
tiveengine of the deployment runtimetriggersthe interpreter and
consecutively the driver whenever offers from other deployments

5.4 Combining All ThreePhases: µsin Action
We are now ready to present how µscan be used in a DevOps
organization where deploymentsÐsimilarto conventional applica-
tion codeÐchange over time. As programs and their infrastructure
evolve,deploymentdefinitionsneedtobeupdated.Tominimizethe
impact on the running system, the managed resources should con-
tinue operation during the update. Also, the updates of connected
deploymentsshouldbe independent.These requirements aremet
throughrolling updates withoutpausing connecteddeployments.
Aµsdeployment is updated by terminating and restarting it
with the new deployment definition. Termination of a deployment
doesnotundeploy its managed resources, but only stops the de-
ployment runtime in a consistent state, i.e., it ensures that the
current state correctly describes the infrastructure. For thisÐif the
deployment phase is ongoingÐit waits for the completion of the
deployment phase. After restart, the deployment continues with
the latest currentstate andthe newdeploymentdefinition.
Figure8showstheAuthteam’ssetupatTeaCorp. µsexecutes
theAuthteam’s µsℓdeploymentdefinition(cf.Listing 1)asacontin-
uouslyrunningservicethatcommunicateswiththedeploymentsof
the other teams to exchange the mutual offers. Initially, and when-
evertheofferfromanotherdeploymentchanges,thedeployment
updates theinfrastructure. The infrastructure hosts, togetherwith
the other teams’ infrastructure, the TeaStore. Thanks to µs, the
Auth team can safely change its deployment without any synchro-
nousormanualcoordinationwithotherteams.TheAuthteamuses
a CI/CD pipeline to automate its deployment updates. Whena new
versionofthedeploymentdefinitioniscompleted,itscompatibility
ischeckedagainsttheofferexcerptsfromtheotherteams.Incaseof
incompatibility (i.e., anunsatisfiable wish), the pipeline is stopped.
In rare cases, the pipeline may be resumed manually, e.g., if the
Registry team promised a new offer to Auth, but did not update its
offer excerpts yet. Otherwise, the Auth team’s offer excerpts aregenerated from the new deployment definition and updated in the
company-widestorage.Finally,thedeploymentisterminatedand
restartedwiththe newdeploymentdefinition.
6 DISTRIBUTION IN µs
Inthissection,wediscussaspectsthatdonotimpact µs’principles
but are relevantinareal-world distributedsystem.
6.1 Availability
Connectedµsdeploymentsconstruct a distributed system where
faults can occur anytime. µshas to account for another deploy-
ment’s (temporary) unavailability because availability cannot be
guaranteed. In µs, the unavailability of a deployment does not
impact the availability of its deployed infrastructure, e.g., services
are not undeployedeven when their deploymentfails.
Thesafetyprotocol(cf.Section 6.3)ensuresthatresourcesare
onlydeployedwhentheirdependenciesareÐalsoacrossmultiple
deployments.Onunavailability,ifanofferisdeployed,thecorre-
spondingwishandtheresourcesdependingonitareonlydeployed

Vice-versa, the protocoldelaysthe undeploymentofan offeruntil
the beneficiary deploymentisavailable again.
6.2 Consistency
Severalinconsistenciescanariseinadistributeddeploymentsystem
between the specification andthe currentstate oramong replicas.
DeploymentDefinitionvs.TargetState. Thetargetstateresults
frominterpretinga µsℓdeploymentdefinition(cf.Section 5.1).It
dependsontheenvironment,i.e.,theoffersfromotherdeployments
andpossiblyotherexternalstateandsideeffectssince µsℓsupports
allfeaturesofitshostlanguage.Thus,multipleexecutionsofa µsℓ
script may result in different target states, as the environment
may change. Thus, the consistency of the target state with the
deploymentdefinitionisonly guaranteedat generationtime.
CurrentStatevs.RemoteViewonOffers. Inµs,weensureeven-

µsconsiderschangesofoffers.Ifdevelopersuseotherenvironmen-
tal elements in a deployment definition, e.g., external state, they
have to informthe reactive engine whenever there isachange.
Current State vs. Infrastructure. Generally, the infrastructure
mightdriftover time, i.e., become inconsistent with the current
state,e.g.,throughexternalormanualadministrationoperations.
However, ideally, infrastructure managed purely by µsdoes not
drift. Existing drift can be eliminated by reading the infrastruc-
ture’sstateintothe µsdeployment’scurrentstateandtriggering
the re-executionofthe deploymentphase(cf.Section 5.2).

7 IMPLEMENTATION
To the best of our knowledge, all existing IaC tools compatible
withserverlessinfrastructureareexecutedasone-offtasks.Thus,
µscannot be directly implemented using existing solutions. We
implementµsas a TypeScript library, which internally uses the
PulumiSDK [ 36].µsℓdeploymentdefinitionsareexecutedin µs’
runtime, which is also implemented in TypeScript and based on
Hareactive[ 52],afunctionalreactiveprogramminglibrarytoen-
sure continuous reactivity to deploymentchanges (Section 5.3).
We decided to implement the µsframework as a minimal ex-
tension toPulumi andbase iton TypeScript for multiplepractical
advantages: (1) full expressivity of an industrial-strength language,
(2) simplified adoption as many developers are familiar with Type-
Script,and(3)fullcompatibilitywithexistingPulumiTypeScript
projects. Our approach extends Pulumi with a reactive runtime
and resource implementations for remote connections, offers, and
wishes.Pulumiprovides µs’interpreteranddriver,enablingthat
all Pulumi IaC programs implemented in TypeScript are valid in
µsℓand, thus, can be used with µsout-of-the-boxÐwithout any
changes.OurcodeisApache2.0licensedandpubliconGitHub[ 48].
µsℓsupports three resource types ( RemoteConnection ,Offerand
Wish)implementedusingdynamicresourceproviders[ 29].Remote
is a component resource to define a RemoteConnection and itsWish
resources jointly (cf. Listing 1). In addition, all resource types avail-
ableas alibrary from orfor Pulumi can be usedin µsℓ.
Theµsruntime executes and deploys (cf. Section 5.1and Sec-
tion5.2)aµsℓdeploymentdefinitionusingPulumi’sAutomation
API.WeextendedPulumi’sdeploymentenginewithresourcegraph
pruning to remove all resources that depend on unsatisfied wishes
from the target state. This is repeated when an external offerchanges(cf.Section 5.3).Thereactionruntimeensuressequential

8 EVALUATION
Inthissection,weevaluatethedesignandtheimplementationof
µs.First,weareinterestedinwhether µsiseffectiveinensuring
safe,decentralizeddeploymentsforservice-basedapplications.This
leads to the researchquestion:
RQ1: Doesµseffectively support deployment automation
in DevOps organizations? It is crucial to assess whether µscan
automate deployment in a context where current solutions need
manual coordination. Second, we are interested in the run time
performance of µs,leading to the research question:
RQ2: How does µs’ performance compare to state-of-the-
art,industrial-strengthdeploymentsolutions? Performance
is important to ensure that µs’ automation does not come at the
detriment of slow deployments. Finally, we are interested in the
applicabilityof µsto existing projects.We ask:
RQ3:CanµsbeappliedtoexistingIaCprojects? Itisimportant
to ensure that µscan be applied to real-world IaC projects and
assessthe requiredmigrationeffort.
We break the research questions down into research hypotheses
(RH) in Table 1and state the evaluation method to confirm each
of them. For the experiments, we use the Amazon Web Services
cloudwithAWSFargatecontainers[ 6].WeselectPulumiandAWS
CDK asa baseline because they are industrial-strength, recent IaC
solutions, andoffer features comparable to µs(Section10.4).
8.1 EffectiveDeploymentsin DevOps
Toanswer RQ1,weimplementthreeversionsoftheTeaStoreappli-
cation’s deployment (Section 3), withµs, with Pulumi, and with
AWSCDK.We compare automation anddefinitionoverhead.
First, we consider the support for decentralized deployments.

verify that dependencies are available. µsis the only solution that
fully automates the coordination (cf.Section 3), confirming RH1.1.
Second,toevaluatethecodingoverheadrequiredby µs(RH1.2),
wecomparethesizeforeachIaCsolution.Table 2reportstheSLOC
foreachteam’sserviceinTeaCorp.Together,theteamsneed14%
more lines with µsthan with Pulumi and 35% more lines than
withAWSCDK. Thisis dueto theadditional information in offers
and wishes, required to enable automated coordination. AWS CDK
is shorter because the default configurations of the patterns in
its construct library [ 5] require less configuration than the best
practices implemented in Pulumi’s Crosswalk for AWS library [ 35].
In summary, to answer RQ1,µsis as effective as Pulumi or
AWSCDK.Thereisnegligiblecodingoverhead.Ontop, µsneither
requires centralization nor manual coordination. The evaluation
suggests that adopting AWS CDK’s best practice patterns as µs
librarycouldfurtherreducetherequiredeffortfor µsdeployments.
8.2 Performance
Toanswer RQ2,wefirstmeasurethedurationofacontainerized
HTTP web service deployment with µsand compare it to AWS
CDK and Pulumi. Second, we assess the run time of the automated
coordination ofmultiple dependingdeploymentsina paralleland
in a sequential setup. For the experiments, we deploy AWS Far-
gate container services with the web service instance [ 22] into an
existing VPC andcluster.
Inthefirstexperiment,weassesstheperformanceofadeploy-
mentwithµscomparedtoAWSCDKandPulumi.Werepeatthe

In the second experiment, we assess the performance of µs’

pend on the same lead deployment and can be deployed in parallel
oncethe leaddeployment isavailable. Inthe sequentialsetup, the
deployments’dependencies build achain towards the lead deploy-

the deployments that depend on it), ~2.5 minutes, compared to the

ment show the same behavior; undeployment is faster. The results
show no significant overhead of automated coordination, entailing
the behaviorexpectedin RH2.2andRH2.3.
Theexperimentsanswer RQ2,showingthatdeploymentduration
is comparable or better than with state-of-the-art IaC systems, and
µs’automatedcoordination does not introduce significant delay.
8.3 Applicability
To answer RQ3, we appliedµsto third-party open-source projects.
First, by the design of our system, every Pulumi TypeScript pro-
gram is a valid µsℓdeployment definition, making µsvirtually
compatible with any third-party, Pulumi-based TypeScript project,
satisfying RH3.1.Of course, when starting from a centralized Pu-
lumi script, the correct splitting into separate deployments, one
foreachDevOpsteam,requiresmanualinterventionbecausethe
DevOps structure of the organization is not explicit in the code.
Hence, naively porting a Pulumi program to µsdoes not benefit
fromµs’automatedcoordination out-of-the-box.
To demonstrate µs’ deployment automation, we focus on a sub-
set of Pulumi programs already partitioned and used in a decen-
tralized way. These Pulumi programs use stack references [37] to
access remote deployments, making the boundary between deploy-
ments and their interfaces explicit. Such scripts can be migrated
to support automated deployment by (1) defining offers for the
suppliedresourcesand(2)wishesforaccessingremoteresourcesby
replacingPulumi’sstackreferences.Webuiltadataset[ 46]ofthird-
party,real-worldprojects,startingfromallprojectsonGitHubcon-
tainingTypeScriptfilescreating pulumi.StackReference instances.
Through GitHub’s Search API, we obtained 64 distinct repositories
(February 2021), ranging from 150 to 500K SLOC (avg. 37K SLOC).
We automatically migrated these projects to µsℓby applying a
simplescript[ 47]thattranslatesstackreferencesandtheiraccess
toremote,wishandofferresourcesbasedonASTtransformation.

wishes and shows that that RH3.2applies:µsdecentralized coordi-
nationcanautomaticallybeleveragedifdistributeddeployments

The experiments answer RQ3, showing that µsℓcan be applied
to64real-worldprojects.While µsiscompatiblewithanyexisting
PulumiTypeScriptprogram,wefurthershowthatmigratingPulumi
files that already provide the separation into different deployments
provides the basis for benefiting from µs’ deployment automation
withoutrequiring manual refinementofthe deploymentcode.
9 LIMITATIONS
Whilethisworkfocusesonserverlesscomputing, µsisnotlimited
to serverless resources. We only require that a resource is con-
trollable via a CRUD API. This is naturally the case in serverless
computing but nothing prevents that a similar approach is applied
toclassic, non-virtualizedserver-based systems. Also, thetension
betweenDevOpsandIaCorchestrationhighlightedinthispaper
stillholdsforserver-basedapproaches.Inpractice,ourimplementa-
tioncanmanageallresourcesforwhichaPulumiresourceprovider
canbeimplemented,whichincludes,forexample,virtualservers
(e.g., AWS EC2 [ 3]). Yet, we argue that serverless resources are a
betterfitforDevOpsbecausemanyoperationalissues(e.g.,scaling)
are delegatedto the cloud provider,simplifying operations.
Even ifµsdecouples the operations of teams, offers and wishes
causearchitectural couplingbecausetheymustbecompatiblefor
dependencysatisfaction,requiringtoexchangetheinterfacesdur-
ingdevelopment.However,thiscommunicationisnotcriticalfor
operations because it can be performed asynchronously with no
impact on the running system. Further, µsoffers an asynchronous
verificationmechanismforcompatibility(cf.Section 4.4).Currently,
µsfocuses on 1-to-1offerśwish dependencies, where the offering
andthewishingdeploymentdirectlyreferenceeachother.Toin-
creasedecoupling,wecouldconsiderofferstoandwishesfrom any
deployment.Thismechanismwouldrequireamiddleware(e.g.,a
publish/subscribe system) to mediate indirectdependencies.
Anotherimportantaspectisthat µstreatsdeployedapplications
as a black box. Thus, deployment updates do not consider the
internal state of deployed applications. In contrast, techniques like
safedynamicupdating [11,51]enableonlysaferesourceupdates,
i.e.,nodistributedtransactionoccursacrossacomponentupdate.
Suchmechanismcan be implementedontop of µs.
Concerning performance, as shown in Section 8.2,µs’ results
arecomparabletocompetitors.Still,deploymenttimeisdominated
bytheinfrastructure platformsmanagingthe deployedresources,
causingdeploymentiterationstotakeatleastsecondsandrather
minutes.Thisprocessmightbetooslowforadaptivesystemswhere
deploymentchangesmustbeappliedveryfrequently. µs’approach
isapplicabletosuchscenariosincombinationwithafasterresource

Finally,µs’distributedbehaviors(cf.Section 6)necessarilyre-
quire a trust relationship between the teams who connect their de-
ploymentswithoffersandwishes.Also,aschangesrequirethatthe

µsdoes not fitscenarios where eitherisregularlyunreachable.10 RELATED WORK

setup, and deletion. In contrast to µs, they do not coordinate de-
ployments over time, nor do they ensure correct dependencies

10.1 ResourceOrchestrators
For an overview of cloud resource orchestration, the reader may
refer to the survey by Weerasiri et al. [ 54]. According to their
referencearchitecture, µscombinesapolicyenforcementengine
andaruleengine.Theformerderivesdecisionsbasedonpolicies
andmonitoring;thelatterperformsdeploymentoperationsforeach
decisionbasedondefinedrules.Asurveyofprogrammingresource
orchestration operations isinthe work of Ranjan etal.[ 42].
Solutions like Kubernetes, Kubernetes Federation, Mesos, and
DockerSwarmmanagesoftwarecontainers[ 14],anOS-levelvir-
tualizationtechniqueforsimplified,standardizedsoftwaredistri-
butionwithguaranteedisolation.Containerorchestratorsdeploy
containersacrossclustersanddatacentersandprovidefeaturesfor
fault tolerance, load balancing, and automated scaling. In contrast
toµs,allsystemsaboveonlysupportcentralconfigurationandare
limitedto the managementof container-basedapplications.
Motivatedby the challenges inIoT, where applications andser-
vices are deployed not only in data centers but also at the edge,
DOCMA [ 25] is a distributed and decentralized orchestrator for
containerized microserviceapplications. However,DOCMA appli-
cations are centralized: an applicationglobally defines everything
(all services/containers) within its scope. In contrast to µs, sepa-
rationinto multipleentities anddependenciesamongapplications
are not supported. Liu et al. [ 28] present COPE (Cloud Orches-
tration Policy Engine), a distributed platform to automate cloud
resource orchestration. COPE is declarative: the provider specifies

constraintsand goalswitha policy languagethat, incombination
with the current system state, is used to determine the compute,
storageandnetwork resourceallocations to meetcustomer SLAs.
10.2 Modeling Languages
Modeling languages express a system structure (e.g., nodes and re-
lations)following a consistent set ofcodified rules. TOSCA [ 34]is
an OASIS standard for modeling cloud applications and their man-
agement. The application topology is described as a graph of nodes
(components)and relationships (e.g.,łhosted-onžorłconnected-tož).
Operationaltasksareeitherdeclarativelyderivedfromthetopol-
ogyorexplicitlydescribedas managementplans usingworkflow
languageslikeBPMNorBPEL.BellendorfandMann [12]provide
asurveyoncloudorchestrationmethodologiesusingTOSCA,its
language extensions, and tools for manipulating TOSCA models.
Wettinger et al . [55,56]apply TOSCA to DevOps using it as a
metamodeltointegrateheterogeneousautomationartifacts.The
Essential Deployment Metamodel (EDMM) [ 58] is the least denomi-
natormetamodelofpopulardeclarativedeploymenttechnologies
toensurethatmetamodelinstanceseasilymaptosuchtechnologies.
TOSCALight [59]isanEDMM-compliantsubsetofTOSCA,whose
models can be deployed with 13 popular deployment technologies
using the TOSCA Lightning [57]toolchain.
µsdraws direct inspiration from the EDMM, describing deploy-
mentsasagraphoftypedcomponentsanddirectedrelations,where
artifactsaredefinedascomponentpropertiesandoperationsarede-
rivedfromthedeploymentdescription.Weenvisionaclearsynergy
betweenµsand modeling languages. For example, a specification
inµscould be derived from TOSCA with a two level-approach:
TheTOSCAspecificationprovidesacentralizedviewonasystem
with components implementing well-defined interfaces, and our
system provides the operationalization and the runtime to execute
suchspecificationasadecentralizeddeployment.TheTOSCAspec-
ification serves a whole-system view for the design phase, while
DevOpsteamsuse µsfor decentralizeddeploymentdefinitions.
10.3 ArchitectureDescription Languages
Architecture DescriptionLanguages (ADL)describe thehigh-level
structure ofapplications onacomponentlevel. According to the
classification of Medvidovic and Taylor [30], ADLs must explicitly
model components, their connection with the respective configura-
tions,andthey require toolsfor developmentandevolution.
ArchJava [ 2] defines the component architecture of a system
withintheprogramminglanguage.ComponentsarespecialJavaob-
jectsthatdefine ports,i.e.,theinterfacesconnectingcomponents.In
theseinterfaces,methodsare provided,requiredtobindtheprovided
methodofasingleconnectedportor broadcasts ,bindingthepro-
vided methods of multiple connected ports. The language enforces
communicationintegrity.TheORSlanguageandruntime[ 26]treat
services as first-class composition units and separates the appli-
cation from infrastructure concerns. It features a sub-language
to define the deployment and to allow dynamic system changes.
TerraandValente[ 49,50]proposeadomain-specificdependency
constraint language to restrict structural dependencies in object-
orientedsoftwarearchitectures.Acceptableandunacceptablede-
pendencies are staticallyenforcedto avoid architectural erosion.10.4 Infrastructureas Code
Infrastructure as code [ 32] refers to the management and provi-
sioning of computing resources through machine-readable code
to enable deployment automation. The advantage of IaC is that
designing,implementing,anddeployinginfrastructurecanlever-
age known software best practices such as version control and
codereviews.VariousindustrialframeworkssupportIaC,including
CloudFormation,CloudFormation-basedDSLsandOrchestrators,
AWSCDK,ARM,TerraformandPulumi.Theyconfigureandpro-
visioninfrastructureand softwareand differinthelanguagethey
support (e.g., custom DSLs vs. existing language like JavaScript),
programming model,andthe targetedinfrastructure [ 40].
Balisetal .[10]investigateanapproachbasedonTerraformto
providerepeatablecloudinfrastructuresforscientificcomputing
to automate research experiments in scientific workflows. They
enableastrictseparationofinfrastructure provisioningandwork-
flowdescriptionandsupportauto-scalingofscientificworkflows.
Guerrieroetal .[21]conductsemistructuredinterviewswithsenior
developers to investigate the state of IaC adoption, concluding that
available tools offer limited automation, lack portability (each tool
isbasedonadifferentlanguage)andmisssupportforanalysistech-
niques (e.g., linters). TOSCA supports IaC in DevOps by providing
astandardnotation andlanguagefor infrastructure [ 8].
Similartotraditionalcode,IaCcanbeofpoorquality.Sharma
et al. [44]propose a catalog of configuration smells that violate
bestpracticesforIaC,analyze~5KPuppetrepositoriesandshow
that design smells and configuration smells tend to occur together.
Schwarzetal .[43]extendthisresearchtoshowthatIaCsmellsare

stract level. Rahman and Williams [41]conduct an empirical study
toidentifythecharacteristicsofdefectiveIaCscriptsthroughaqual-
itativeanalysisofprojectcommitsvalidatedbyanassessmentfrom
