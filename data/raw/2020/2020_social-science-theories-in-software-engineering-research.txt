https://doi.org/10.1145/3510003.3510076incorporating theories andresearch methods from social science—
including psychology, sociology and management (especially infor-
mation systems)—which study individuals, groups and organiza-
tions.
On one hand, methodsfrom social sciences (e.g. case studies,
experiments,questionnaires),whichinvestigateindividuals,groups
ororganizations,arenowwidelyusedinsoftwareengineering[ 82].
On theother hand, theoriesfrom socialsciences—systems of ideas
for explaining, describing, predicting or analyzing human phenom-
ena [26]—do not seem widely applied in SE research despite being
criticaltoadvanceSEasascientificdiscipline.Onereasoncouldbe
SE’s formal and technical roots [ 72], while social phenomena were
historically marginalized [30].
However, researchers are increasingly recognizing that stronger
theoreticalfoundationsareneededforSEtomatureasanapplied
science[70].Severalinitiativesforincreasingattentiontotheory
in SE have been proposed. Sjoberg et al. [ 68] devised a framework
for describing theories and guidelines for proposing, employing,testing and modifying them. Hannay et al. [
27] conducted a sys-
tematic literature review of theories used in software engineering
experiments.SE-specificguidelineshavebeencreatedfortheory
development [ 58,73]. General theories of software engineering
havebeenproposed[ 31,56].Stol&Fitzgerald[ 70]arguedfortrain-
ing PhD students in theorizing. Finally, a series of international
workshopsexploredpossibilitiesforgeneralandcoretheoriesin
SE [21, 33, 60–62].
This paper extends these initiatives with a focus on theories
from social sciences. It aims to increase attention to social science
theoriesandhelpSEresearchersusesocialsciencetheoriesmore
effectively. Increasing attention to social science theories will help
researchers to:
(1) create, accumulate and preserve knowledge [62, 68, 70];(2) cope with the multi-disciplinarity of SE research [71];(3) improve the quality of their research [70]; and(4) reduce the need for trial and error [32, 62].
More generally, “theory provides explanations and understand-
ing in terms of basic concepts and underlying mechanisms, which
constituteanimportantcounterparttoknowledgeofpassingtrends”[
27].SocialsciencetheorieshelpusunderstandcoreSEphenomena
(e.g.programming)andtheirimpactsonindividuals,teams,projects
and organizations [68].
Thispaperthereforeanalyzeswhich,how,where,andtowhat
extent social science theories are used in SE research. It provides a
complete list of the theories encountered, elaborating on the most
common. It explains how inattention to social science leads SE
researcherstooversimplifyandover-rationalizecorephenomena.
Finally, it highlights areas in which social science theories may be
especially relevant, but are presently neglected.

2 BACKGROUND
Thissectionexplainsouroperationalizationofsocialscienceand
the classification schemes we later employ.
Weconsideratheoryasocialsciencetheoryifitoriginatesinone
of the disciplines listed by The Social Science Encyclopedia [36]: an-
thropology,cognitivescience,criminologyandlaw,culturalstudies,
demography, economics, education, evolution, gender, geography,
health and medicine, history, industrial relations and management,
language,linguistics andsemiotics, mentalhealth,methods ofso-
cial research, philosophy, political theory, politics and government,
psychology,socialproblemsandsocialwelfare,andsociology.Some
notes on this list are warranted:
•Someofthesefields(e.g.geography)mixsocial,naturalor
applied science.
•Some fields intersect several broader social sciences (e.g.
communicationstudiesintersectsculturalstudies,linguistics,
management, and sociology).
•Each field has many subfields (e.g. information systems,
whichsharesmanysimilaritieswithSE,isasubfieldofman-
agement).
•We are not sure that philosophy is a social science, per se,
but tentatively include it anyway.
Theories can be classified on numerous dimensions including
whattheyarefor,theirscopeandtheirstructure,aswellastheway
they are used and where in an article they are used.
Gregor [26] proposed a taxonomy for classifying information
systems theories according to their purpose. She argued that theo-
ries can serve four purposes (analysis and description, explanation,
prediction, and prescription), leading to five types:
(1)Theoriesforanalyzing,alsocalledframeworksortaxonomies,
arerelativelysimple,descriptivetheories.Agoodexample
isIivarietal.’sdynamicfour-tieredframeworkforclassify
information systems development methodologies and ap-
proaches [28].
(2)Theories for explaining, also called theories for understanding,
attempttoexplainwhat,how,when,whyorwherephenom-
enaoccur.Theydonotincludecausalhypothesesormake
numericalpredictions.Darwinianevolutionisatheoryfor
explaining, as is dual coding theory [49].
(3)Theoriesforpredicting predictfutureeventswithoutspeci-
fying causalrelationships (e.g. weatherforecasting models).
These theories have testable propositions but no prescrip-
tions.
(4)Theoriesforexplainingandpredicting positcausalexplana-
tionsandtestablepropositions(e.g.quantitativehypotheses).
Prescriptions may be included but are not the focus. This
type is common in information systems, where examplesinclude thetechnology acceptancemodel [ 17], cognitivefit
theory [81], and the theory of task-technology fit [25].
(5)Theoriesfordesignandaction providedetailedinstructionson
howtodosomething,likerecipes.Thesearelesscommonin
the social sciences than in software engineering. Multiview,
the methodology and contingency framework, is a good
example [3].
Theories also exist on a kind of generalizeability spectrum from
observationsandempiricalgeneralizationstomiddle-rangetheo-
ries,generaltheories,grandtheories,andtheoriesofeverything[ 61,
72].SEresearchersaremainlyconcernedwithempiricalgeneraliza-
tions,middle-rangetheoriesandgeneraltheories[ 72].Anempirical
generalization is “an isolated proposition summarizing observed
uniformities of relationships between two or more variables” [ 44];
forinstance,Moore’slaw. Middle-rangetheories (e.g. COCOMO[ 8];
the software engineering principles of Davis [ 16]) “lie between the
minor but necessary working hypothesis that evolve in abundance
during day-to-day research and the all-inclusive systematic efforts
todevelopaunifiedtheorythatwillexplainalltheobservedunifor-
mities” [44]. Ageneral theory, meanwhile,“applies across [a] field
andunifiesexistingempiricalandtheoreticalwork”[ 33].Nogen-
eraltheoryofsoftwareengineeringiswidelyaccepted,butafew
have been proposed (e.g. the tarpit [ 31]; sensemaking-coevolution-
implementation theory [55]).
Researchers also distinguish between variance theories, process
theories, and taxonomies. Variance theories explain and predictthevariancein one or more dependent variables using indepen-
dent, moderating and mediating variables [
14]. Process theories
explainhowanentitychangesanddevelops[ 78].Taxonomies(also
calledtheoriesforunderstanding,descriptivetheories,frameworks
and typologies) organize instances (individual things) into classes
(abstract descriptions) [58].
Variancetheoriestypicallypositcausalrelationshipsamongcon-
structs [63]; process theories and taxonomies typically do not [ 58].
Processtheoriesusuallyfocusonnon-causalrelationshipsbetween
entities (e.g. actors, objects) while taxonomies focus on similari-
tiesbetweenentities.Variancetheoriesareoftenassociatedwith
positivist,quantitative,statisticalresearchwhileprocesstheories
andtaxonomiesareoftenassociatedwithinterpretivist,qualitative,
non-statistical research[ 45]. Inmany scientific disciplines,includ-
ing information systems, variance theories are more common than
processtheories.However,processtheoriesbetterexplainthere-
lationshipsbetweeninputsandoutcomes[ 14].Variancetheories
and process theories can sometimes be combined [48].

Hannay et al. [ 27] include an eighth role—proposed —however,
theoriesproposedbySEarticlesarebeyondthescopeofthisreview
becausetheydonotoriginateinasocialscience.Weaddedtherole
appliedtoaccommodatetheoriesthatareusedfortheirintended
purpose. Furthermore, we follow Hannay et al. [ 27] in excluding
tangential references to theories and descriptions of theories, as in
a related work section, and focus on substantial uses of theories.
Finally, we can classify theories according to where in an article
they are used. The IMRaD pattern—“Introduction, Method, Result,
and Discussion”—is the de-facto standard for scientific writinginmany fields[
6].(In IMRaD, introduction includesrelated work
whilediscussion includes implications, limitations, future work and
conclusions.)While eacharticle isunique, mostcan bemapped to
the IMRaD structure. We can ignore front and back matter such as
the title, abstract, keywords, references, acknowledgements, andappendices as these sections rarely contain substantive uses of
theories.
3 METHODOLOGY
We conducted a criticalreview. Critical reviews [e.g. 4,73,83]a r e
similar in execution to systematic reviews [cf. 34], except that criti-
calreviewsanalyzeasampleofpaperstomakeapoint(oftenabout
theory or methods), whereas systematic reviews aim to synthesize
all relevant evidence.
Briefly, we identified clear and upfront analysis questions, se-
lectedasearchstrategyincludingexplicitinclusionandexclusion
criteria, retrieved a sample of articles from prominent SE journals,
extracting instances of theory use from the articles, and analyzing
the theories and their uses by applying a prior coding scheme.
3.1 Objective and Questions
This study aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the state
ofsocialsciencetheoryuseinsoftwareengineeringresearch.We
refine this goal into five specific analysis questions (AQs) all of
which end with an implied ‘in SE research’:
(AQ1) To what extent are social science theories used?(AQ2) What social science theories are used?(AQ3) Which social sciences provide the theories?(AQ4) Which types of theories are used?(AQ5) For which purposes are theories used?(AQ6) Where in the papers are theories used?(AQ7) In what knowledge areas are theories used?
3.2 Journal, Article and Theory Selection
WeselectedfiveSEjournalstostudy: IEEETransactionsonSoftware
Engineering(TSE),ACMTransactionsonSoftwareEngineering andMethodology (TOSEM), Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE), the
Journal of Systems and Software (JSS), andInformation and Soft-
ware Technology (IST). We chose these journals because they are
widely considered to be among the most prestigious, influential
and academically rigorous journals that sit squarely in SE.
To keepthe reviewrecent, tractable andreproducible, welimit
our search to articles published between 1 January 2007 and 31
December 2019. Within this thirteen-year period, the five selected
journals published more than 5,900 articles. Of these, we manually
excluded editorials, introductions, book reviews, and other non-
research articles.
We scanned the remaining research articles for theory use ac-
cording to the following process:
(1)We performed an electronic search for the term “theory”
within each entire article, which can serve as an initial indi-
cator for theory use.
(2)Anelectronicsearchforthenamesofthemostcommonly
used theories in information systems according to the Theo-
ries Used in IS Research Wiki1or Dwivedi et al. [ 19]. This
stepwasincludedtoavoidmissingtheoriesthatdonothave
theword“theory”inthetitle(e.g. TaskTechnologyFit )and
potentially explore similarities between SE and IS.
Eachpaperreturnedbythesesearcheswasthenmanuallychecked
against the following inclusion criteria:
(1)the “theory” meets our definition of a collection of ideas for
understanding, analyzing, explaining or predicting;
(2)thetheorytakesononeofHannayetal.’srolesasadapted
for our study (Section 2);
(3)thetheoryoriginatesinoneofthesocialsciencesubfields
listedintheSocialScienceEncyclopedia[ 36].(Ifnotobvious,
we examined the reference list or searched for the theory in
relevant scientific databases).
We exclude theories that originated in software engineering,
mere observations, grand theories, theories of everything, and the-
ories that were mentioned but not substantively used (Fig. 1).
3.3 Data Extraction and Analysis
Next, we extracted relevant data from the articles. We extracted
metadata including title, authors, journal, volume, issue (if applica-
ble) and publication. In addition to metadata, we extracted data on
the theories and articles themselves. For theories, we extracted the
originatingdiscipline,theoryrole,theoryusage,theorynature,and
Gregor’s theory type. For articles, we extracted the corresponding
SWEBOK classification.
Togatherthisdata,weanalyzedeach theorytodetermineitsorig-
inatingdiscipline,type(accordingtoGregor[ 26]),scope(middle-
range,etc.)andnature(process,varianceortaxonomy).Thenwe
analyzedeach theoryusage todeterminethetheory’sroleandwhere
it was used (introduction, methods, results or discussion).
Finally,weclassifiedeacharticleaccordingtothefourteenknowl-
edge areas defined by the software engineering body of knowledge
(SWEBOK) [10]—design, testing, etc.

3.3.1 Edge Cases. Thispaperfocusesontheoriesimportedfrom
social sciences. We therefore exclude theories from mathematics
(e.g.chaostheory),naturalsciences,(e.g.thetheoryofevolution)
and theories homegrown in SE (e.g. theory-w [ 9], sensemaking-
coevolution-implementationtheory[ 55],thetheoryofdistancesin
SE [7]). Of course these other theories are also important—they are
just not the focus of this study.
We also excluded SERVQUAL [ 50] because although it is of-
ten presented as a theory, it is clearly an instrument [75]. We do,
however, include expectation disconfirmation theory, from which
SERVQUAL is derived.2
Three edge cases we did include are coordination theory, real
options theory and argumentation theory. Coordination theory
and realoptions theory couldbe seen asa bodies of research(like
game theory). However, we included coordination theory because,
insomeusages,itclearly adaptssociologicalconceptstosoftware
engineering. Meanwhile, we conceptualize real options theory as a
theory for analyzing (Gregor’s Type I) because it is used to analyze
investmentdecisions.Toulmin’s[ 77]argumentationtheory,incon-
trast,issometimesseenasamethod;however,weagainconsider

‘quality’, not an acronym3.4 Validation

research?
Theprimarystudiessubstantiallyused87uniquetheories.Ofthese,
27 (31%) appear in two or more articles (Table 1) while 60 are
used in a single article (Table 2). The most commonly used theory
is the technology acceptance model (TAM) [ 17]. Tied for second
place,withfiveuseseach,aredualcodingtheoryanddiffusionof

4.3 Which social sciences provide the theories
used in SE research?
The 87 theories used originate from eight social sciences: psychol-
ogy (34), industrial relations / management including information
systems and organizational studies (23), economics (10), communi-
cationstudies(8),sociology(8),education(2),linguistics/semiotics
(1), and philosophy (1). (Communication studies was not included
in the Social Science Encyclopedia because it is an “intersecting
discipline”—seeSection2—buttheeighttheoriesinquestionare
best understood as originating in the interdisciplinary communica-
tion studies community.)

4.4 What types of theories are used?
Ofthe87theories,75(87%)aremiddle-rangetheories(e.g.TAM).
Theremainingtwelvearegeneraltheories(e.g.structurationthe-
ory).Processtheories(39)weremorecommonthanvariancethe-
ories (36) or taxonomies (12). We did not identify any empirical
generalizations (see Section 6.2: Limitations).
IntermsofGregor’stheorytypes,themostcommontypewas
Type II: theories for explaining (38), followed by Type IV: theories
for explaining and predicting (35), and Type I: theories for ana-lyzing (13). These numbers track well with those in the previousparagraph because most process theories explain, most variance
theories explain and predict, and most taxonomies analyze. Again,
thisshowsthattheoriesforexplaining,butnotpredicting,aremore
common in SE than generally assumed [cf. 58].
OneTypeV(fordesignandaction)theoryandnoTypeIII(for
predicting) were identified. This is not surprising since Types III
and V appear less common in social science [26].
4.5 For which purposes are theories used?
We identified 198 individual theory uses(Fig. 2). Some articles use
multiple theories or use one theory in multiple ways. The most
commonrolesare design(53%)and explanation (16%).Thatis,SE
research tends to use theories to inform the methodological design
of a study or explain and analyze the results. Theories are used to
designresearchprotocolsandtaskmaterials;toformulatehypothe-
ses,researchquestionsanddesignframeworksormodels;andto
develop questionnaires and other instruments.
4.6 Where in the papers are theories used?
Theoriesaremostlyusedinmethod(40%)andintroduction(26%)
sections; less often in results (19%) or discussion (15%) sections.
This distribution roughly corresponds to the purposes for which
thetheoriesareused.Thatis,sincetheoriesareoftenusedtodesign
astudy,motivatetheresearch,orinformfurthertheorizing,they
tend to be used in the introduction and method parts of a paper.Figure 2: Distribution of theory roles
Theories are less often tested, or used to analyze results, which
happens more in the results and discussion sections.
One might expect articles that test a social science theory to use
that theory throughout, or at least in multiple sections. Rather, we
found that the articles that tested a theory did so tangentially to
their core purpose, such that the tested theory was mainly used in
one section of the paper.
4.7 In what knowledge areas are theories used?
We attempted to map the topic of each article into the SWEBOK
knowledgeareas.Themostcommonknowledgeareasareprofes-
sional practice (24) and models and methods (13). For example,Babar et al.’s [P68] study of software architecture evaluation in
distributed versus co-located meetings exemplifies the professionalpracticearea.Meanwhile,YuandPetter’s[P69]useofsharedmentalmodelstheorytounderstandagilesoftwaredevelopmentprocesses
is a good example of the models and methods area. Many theories
were also used in the context of software requirements (12), eco-
nomics (9), and SE management (7). Theories were less used in the

context of construction (4), SE process (4), testing (3), design (3),
maintenance (3), and quality (1). No articles used theories in the
context of other knowledge areas.
However, 19 articles did not map well into the SWEBOK knowl-
edge areas. Of these, twelve can be best categorized as technology
adoption (e.g. investigating technology adoption and acceptancein Botswana [P16]). Seven are about research methods (e.g. us-
ingthe garbagecan modelto finda researchmethod forstudying
open-source software [P2]).
Naturally, social science theories are used more in the primarily
social knowledge areas than in the primarily technical knowledge
areas.Themoretechnicalknowledgeareasmayusemoremathe-
matical and natural-science foundations, or may be less theoretical

so rarely in software design is puzzling.

4.8 Member checking results
Approximately 20% of the authors completed our questionnaire,
leading to minor changes to the classification of some theories,
mainlyinhowtheoriesareusedwithinthearticles.Asampleissuethatwasdiscusseduponanalyzingthequestionnairewastheorigin
of Adaptive Structuration Theory (MIS) compared to Structuration
Theory(sociology).BenefitsofusingsocialsciencetheoriesinSE
research mentioned by respondents include:
•improving understanding of phenomena occurring in SE;
•theoretical grounding of their own research; and
•connecting technical and human aspects such as the way of
thinking, teamwork, and failure.
Challenges mentioned include:
•understanding the theoretical background as social science
theories are often more abstract;
•finding corresponding theories and mapping them to SE;
•theories that seem useful but lack necessary precision.
Some authors are sympathetic to theories, but find difficulty
in publishing due to reviewers not understanding social sciencetheories.One response mentioned the psychologicaluncertainty

that “everyone does it differently”.
4.9 Exploratory findings
Several findings beyond the original analysis questions emerged.

commonly used in IS research.
Meanwhile, cross-referencing where theories are used with the
role the theory plays highlights a few combinations:•Design/method (29%) and design/introduction (23%) are the
most common combinations. That is, the theory informsthe design of the study, and this is explained in either theintroductionorthemethodsection.Forexample,Babaret

•Explanation/discussion isalso common(11%). For example,
Hyrynsalmi et al. [102] use cultural lag theory to explain
value creationmechanisms formobile applications intheir
discussion section.
•Motivation/introduction, applied/method, and basis/method
each make up another approximately 3%. The first is selfexplanatory. As an example of the second, Yu and Petter

Thenumberofarticlescontributedbyeachjournalvariesgreatly.
TOSEM and ESE contributed only 274 and 642 papers respectively,
whileISTandJSScontributed1419and2453.TSEwasinthemiddle
with 792. This basically reflects publication numbers—JSS and IST
publish a lot more articles.
However,evenafteraccountingfortheirrelativecontribution
to the sample, journals vary significantly in their use of theories.
Less than 1% of the TOSEM papers used theories, followed by TSE
with1.51%,JSSwith1.59%,ESEwith1.87%,and2.60%ISTpapers.
This suggests that either IST is most sympathetic to research using
socialscience theories,orthat researcherswhouse socialscience
theories prefer submitting to IST.
Wemightexpectmorearticlesusingsocialsciencetheoriesin
recent years, as SE has become more concerned with the human
andsocialaspectsofdevelopment.However,noparticulartrends
are evident in the data overall, or within any specific journal.
5 MOST USED THEORIES
Thissectiondescribesinmoredetailsomeofthemostusedtheories
in our sample. While space limitations prevent comprehensivedescriptions of all 87 theories, elaborating a few prevalent onesshould give the reader a better sense of the sort of social science
theories being used in SE research.
5.1 The Technology Acceptance Model
Themostusedtheoryinthisreviewisthetechnologyacceptance
model(TAM).TAMisamiddle-rangevariancetheoryforexplaining
andpredictingorganizationaladoptionofnewtechnologies[ 17].
TAM posits that an organization’s intention to adopt a technology
depends on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. It is
based on Fishbein and Ajzen’s theory of reasoned action [23].
TAM is arguably the most widely used theory in information
system research. It has been extensively tested, refined and ex-
tended,mostnotablybytheUnifiedTheoryofAcceptanceandUse
of Technology (UTAUT; Fig. 3) [80].
However,TAMhasalsobeenwidelycriticized[ 12].Forexample,

of progress in knowledge accumulation” and attempts to extend
it have created “a state of theoretical chaos”. More generally, noone ever argued that software should be useless and difficult to
use. Pointing out that usefulness and usability are important is not
terribly helpful without some theory of what makes a software
product useful and usable.
In twelve out of thirteen articles, TAM is used in the design role.
Forinstance,Mohagheghietal.[P4]employTAMtoconstructan
interview and survey about model-driven engineering.
5.2 Diffusion of Innovations
Diffusionofinnovationsisamiddle-rangeprocesstheoryforex-
plaininghowinnovationsspreadthroughcommunicationchannels
over time within a social system [ 65]. It models diffusion as a kind
ofcommunicationinwhichanewideaorproductissharedamong
individuals in a social system.
Themainelementsofthistheoryareinnovation,communication
channels, time, and a social system. An innovation is simply anidea or product that is perceived as new by potential adopters.
Communicationistheprocessinwhichtheparticipantsinthesocial
system share information to create consensus. Communication
channels (including mass media and interpersonal communication)
are the means by which an innovation is communicated among
members of a social system. Meanwhile, “a social system is defined
as a set of interrelated units that are engaged in joint problem
solvingtoaccomplishacommongoal.Themembersorunitsofa
socialsystemmaybeindividuals,informalgroups,organizations,
and/or subsystems” [65].
The theory posits that innovations diffuse in five stages [65]:
(1)Knowledge. An individual learns about an innovation.
(2)Persuasion. The individual forms an opinion (positive or
negative) about the innovation.
(3)Decision. The individual decides whether to adopt or reject
the innovation. This may include trying a new product or
attending demonstrations.
(4)Implementation. Theindividualusestheinnovationand
judges its usefulness. If an individual decides to adopt an
innovation, it is put to use during the implementation stage.
Figure 4: Diffusion of innovations (adapted from [65])
(5)Confirmation. The individual decides to retain or abandon
the innovation. This stage can last indefinitely.
Diffusion of innovations further posits five types of adopters.
From quickest to slowest to adopt, they are: innovators, early
adopters, the early majority, the late majority, and laggards (Fig. 4).
Diffusionofinnovationsisnotwithoutitscritics.Forexample,
Lyytinen and Damsgaard [40] present six criticisms:
(1) “Technologies are not discrete packages.”(2)
“Technologies do not diffuse in a homogenous and fixed
social ether.”
(3) Push and pull forces do not fully explain diffusion rates.(4)
The theory does not include all of the parameters that influ-
ence adoption decisions.
(5)“Diffusion does not necessarily traverse through distinct
stages, which exhibit no feedback.”
(6)“Time scales are not necessarily short and the history of
decisions is not unimportant.”
Diffusionofinnovationsisusedinfivepapersandistherefore
tied (with dual coding theory; next) for second most common the-ory.
5.3 Dual Coding Theory
Dual Coding Theory is an influential general theory for explaining
memoryandcognition[ 49].Itpositsthatpeoplehavetwocognitive
subsystems:oneforwordsandoneforimages.Ourmindstherefore
usetwomainkinds ofrepresentations or“codes:” analoguecodes
(images)andsymboliccodes(words).Thetheoryaimstoexplain
how these two subsystems interact and affect cognition. Therefore,
presentingthesameideausingbothwordsandimagesshouldhelp
people remember, because the idea is encoded in both cognitive
subsystems.
However,dualcodingtheoryremainscontroversial.Manypsy-
chologists prefer the common coding theory of memory, which
posits a single kind of representation and cognitive system [76].

5.4 Coordination Theory
Coordination theory is a general theory for explaining “how the
activities ofseparate actors canbe coordinated”[ 41]. Itincludes a
frameworkforanalyzingcoordinationincomplexprocesses,aswell
as a typology of dependencies and coordination mechanisms [ 42].
It posits that in an organization, some tasks depend on other tasks,
whichcreates coordinationproblems.Actorssolvetheseproblems
usingcoordinationmechanisms.Coordinationtheorypositsdifferent
kinds of coordination problems and mechanisms.
Coordination theory is used to design not only human organiza-
tionsbutalsotechnologies(e.g.toolsforfacilitatingcoordination,
distributed computer systems) [41].
5.5 Cognitive Fit Theory
Cognitive fit is a middle range, variance theory for explaining and
predictingtaskperformance.It“describestherelationshipsbetween
graphicalandtabularrepresentationsandthetypesoftasksthey
support” [ 81]. It posits that matching information representations
to problem solving tasks will increase task performance (Fig. 5).
For example, to navigate, we might want a map, but to calculate
distancetraveled,wemightwantatableshowingdistancesbetween
destinations.
Cognitive fit theory has evolved over time. For example, Samuel
et al. [66] extend cognitive fit theory to introduce the dual-domain
problem solving framew ork. While uncontroversial, cognitive fit is
only one of multitudinous antecedents of task performance, and
may be overwhelmed by other, more important factors.
6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Implications
Our analysis produced several surprising findings:
(1)Lessthan2%ofthearticlesuseasocialsciencetheoryina
substantive way.
(2)SE research rarely testsa social science theory, for example,
to see if it actually applies to SE.
(3)Manyrelevantsocialsciencesarenotreferencedatall(e.g.
criminology).
(4)Process theories are used more often than variance theories,
which shows that process theories are much more common
in SE than generally assumed [cf. 58].
Intuitively, less than two percent of papers using social theories
seems low. For comparison, at least two thirds of the papers in theJune 2021 issue of MIS Quarterly appear to use one or more social
theories. At least three possible explanations are evident:
(1) SE research primarily uses homegrown theories;
(2) SE research primarily uses natural science theories;(3) SE research is primarily atheoretical.
Distinguishingbetweenthesethreeexplanationswouldrequirea
differentkindofstudy,withadifferentsamplingstrategy.However,
based on our experience with initiatives aimed at encouraging
theory development and use, we suspect SE research is largely less
concernedwiththeory(moreatheoretical)thanothersimilarfields.
Compared to management, for example, SE researchers appear
more concerned with making tools than theories.
Additionally, some of the theories that are being used are prob-
lematic.TAM,forexample,isoutdated[ 80],doesnotexplainacore
SE phenomenon, and has been widely criticized [12].
Broadly considered, the results of this study suggest that SE
research is not making good use of social science theory. Failing to
incorporate social theories is problematic in several ways.
Theoriesunderpinalmostallnatural,socialandappliedsciences.
Sound theoretical foundations are essential for maturing into afully developed research discipline [
70]. Without a collection of
core theories, a discipline struggles to generate, accumulate and
preserve knowledge [62, 68, 70].
Second, SE is intrinsically interdisciplinary—it intersects com-
puterscience,economics,management,mathematics,philosophy,
psychology, and sociology. The social and technical aspects of cre-
atingsoftwareareinextricablyentwined;theycannotbecleaved
apart and understood independently. More than two percent of SE
research needs to draw on social science theories to have any hope
of understanding the full scope of software development.
Inourexperience,thisinattentiontosocialtheoryalreadyharms
SE research, practice, and education. Some SE research tends tooversimplify and over-rationalize social phenomena. For exam-
ple,whereanSEresearcherasks“whatistheproblemthesystem
should solve?” a sociologist sees multiple stakeholders, who do
notagreeonthenatureoftheproblemortheaimsofthesystem
[11],jockeyingforcontrolofaproject’sagenda—thereisno“the
problem”.Whereasoftwareprofessionalsees“requirementselicita-
tion”, a psychologist sees a prospective user and an analyst analyst
co-constructing preferences specific to that moment and context
[37]—the outcomes are neither “requirements” nor “ellicited” [54].
Moreover, while students of other applied sciences learn to design
innovative systems based on ill-defined opportunities, SE students
primarilylearntoconstructroutine,fully-specifiedsystems,asif
figuring out what to build is someone else’s job [cf. 53].
Furthermore, infrequent use of social theory is surprising given
two trends in SE research:
(1)TheSEacademiccommunityismidwaythroughashiftfrom
rationalism (it works because it intuitively makes sense) to
empiricism (it works because the results of this empirical
study demonstrate that it works) [57].
(2)The SE community appears increasingly receptive to soci-
ologicalresearchmethodsincludinggroundedtheory[ 73]
and ethnography [83].

research, we expect researchers increasingly to draw on reference
disciplines for both supporting foundations, evidence and method-
ological guidance.
6.2 Limitations
The results of this study should be weighed against several limita-
tions. It is very likely that some articles in the sample were missed
becausetheyusedatheory,butnottheword“theory.”Wemitigated
this threat by searching for a list of specific theories by name, but
that list too is incomplete.
Similarly,oursearchprocessmay nothavebeensensitiveto em-
piricalgeneralizations.Thesegeneralizationswouldnotbelistedin
theISTheoryWikiororDwivedietal.’s[ 19]review,andwouldnot
normally have “theory” in their names, if they even have names.
Therefore,thefactthatwedidnotuncoveranyempiricalgeneral-
izations from social science does not mean none were used.
The five journals and 13-year period we studied are not rep-
resentative of all SE outlets across all time. We used purposive,
search-basedsampling[ 4]toselect good,influential journalsrather
thanrandomjournalsandfocusedonmorerecentyearsbecause
wewanttounderstandthe trajectory ofthefield,whichismostly
set by recent papers in top outlets.
Meanwhile, researchers do not agree on the definition of theory.
Different researchers might have included or excluded different
theories.Wemitigatethisthreatbyprovidingacompletelistofthe
includedtheories(Section4.2)anddiscussingedgecases(Section
3.3.1). We alsotriedsearching for“model”, butthis produced too
many false positives.
Wevalidatedourclassificationsthroughaudits(i.e.thesecond
and third authors extensively reviewing the classifications) andmemberchecking(i.e.,sendingaquestionnairetoprimarystudy
authors).ThisledtosignificantrecategorizationofGregor’stheory
types and a handful of minor changes. However, different analysts
may classify theories, usages and topic areas differently.
6.3 Areas for future research
SE researchers should consider using more social theories from
referencedisciplines.Usingsocialtheoriesmoreoften,andmoreef-fectively, will help SE researchers produce more rigorous, nuanced,
insightfulresearch.Furthermore,SEresearchersshouldmovebe-
yondusingtheoriestomotivatetheirpapersorspecifytheresearch
methodology. We need to testsocial theories in SE contexts and
theorizeaboutSEphenomenausingconceptsfromthesocialsci-
ences. For example, iteratively evaluating and adapting the theory
ofboundaryobjects[ 69]couldhelpusbetterunderstandproduct
backlogs, user stories, and other common non-code artifacts.
Similarly, social theories are often used to examine project man-
agement,requirementsengineering,modeling,softwaredevelop-
mentmethodsandtechnologyadoption.SEresearcherstendnot
tousethemtoexaminedesigning,constructing,testing,evaluating
andconfiguringsoftware.However,thelatteraresocio-technical
processes in which technical phenomena are entangled with social
phenomena. Again, social theories should help. For example, nu-
meroustheoriesconcerningpowerandinfluencecouldhelpexplain
interpersonal conflict during peer programming.Additionally, SE researchers lean toward theories from psychol-
ogy (to understand professionals) and management (to understand
teams and organizations). We rarely draw on education (to un-derstand professional development), criminology (to understand
deviant behavior), health (to understand professionals’ wellbeing),
history(tounderstandtheevolutionofSE),orphilosophy(toun-
derstandagreatmanythings).Exploitingthevastarrayofrelevant
knowledge from myriad disciplines may help launch many fruitful
research programs.
More specifically, this study investigates use of social science
theories. Similar reviews of homegrown SE theories and natural
science theories used in SE are needed.
6.4 Comparison to previous reviews
Several studies have examined the status of theory use in SE re-
search. Hannay et al. [ 27] present a systematic literature review of
theories used in software engineering experiments. Stol & Fitzger-
ald [70] argue that SE researchers often use “theory fragments” for
analysis.Limetal.[ 38]examinethetheoreticalbasisofinformation
systemsresearch.Ralphetal.[ 59]describeseventheoriesthat,they
argue, ought to be core to SE research.
LikeHannayetal.,wefindthattheoriesaremostlyusedtomoti-
vate and design studies; fewer articles test or modify theories. Like
Limetal.,wefindthatTAMiswidely-used,andthatpsychology
and economics are popular reference disciplines. Like Ralph et al.,
we argue that SE researchers should use more social theory.
However, this review extends previous work in several ways.
Stol & Fitzgerald [ 70] is more of a position paper with a limited
review. Hannay et al. [ 27] only consider experiments, and their
review is getting dated. Lim et al. [ 38] looked at a different field.
Ralphetal.[ 59]recommendsocialtheoriesratherthanstudying
which are currently used. In summary, we extend these reviews by
studying a larger, broader, more recent sample of primary studies,
leading to somewhat different recommendations.
7 CONCLUSION
The presented study examined substantive uses of social science
theoriesinmorethan5500articlespublishedinfiveleadingsoft-
ware engineering journals over a thirteen-year period. Despite
severalcallsformoreattentiontotheoryinSEresearch,increasing
attentionto thesocialaspectsof development,andincreasing use
ofbehavioralandqualitativeresearch, onlyabouttwopercentofthe
reviewedarticlesusesocialsciencetheories inanysubstantialway.
In other words, SE research tends to ignore relevant theories from
social sciences.
When social science theories are used, they are most commonly:
•middle-range theories;
•process theories;
•theories for explaining (but not predicting);
•drawn from psychology or management;
•used in some way related to designing the study;
•used in the introduction or methods section of the paper;
•usedinresearchconcerningprofessionalpractice,technol-
ogyadoptionormodelsandmethodsofsoftwaredevelop-
ment; and
•published in Information and Software Technology.
2003Social Science Theories in Software Engineering Research ICSE 2022, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA
In contrast, SE research tends not to:
•test theories being used;
•use theories to analyze data;
•applytheoriestosoftwaredesign,testing,evaluationorcon-
figuration;
•draw theories from relevant reference disciplines including
health, criminology or history.
Applied sciences benefit from balancing more concrete tech-
niquesandmoreabstracttheories.Techniquesencapsulatepractical,
specific, contextualized, often short-term knowledge that practi-
tioners can readily apply. Theories encapsulate more abstract, gen-
eralizable, long-term knowledge. They insulate a field against fads,
guide research programs and help us understand novel situations.
For SE research to mature and improve, researchers therefore
need to make better use of theory: social science theories to un-
derstand social phenomena, natural science theories to understand
physical and mathematical phenomena, and more homegrown the-
ories to understand SE-specific phenomena.
No one is saying that SE should abandon developing and evalu-
ating new technologies or techniques. Rather, SE has twin aims of
understandingsoftwaredevelopmentandcreatingtoolsandtech-
niquesfordevelopingsoftwarebetter.Ourabilitiestobuildbetter
systemsandtoexplainsoftwaredevelopmentphenomenanecessar-
ily co-evolve. Many of our hardest problems lie at the intersection
ofsocialphenomena,technicalphenomena,understanding,andcre-
ating. Only by accepting the fundamental interconnections among
these four dimensions can we address our greatest challenges.
