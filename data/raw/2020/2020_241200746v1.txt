Abstract —Pre-trained large deep learning models are now
serving as the dominant component for downstream middleware
users and have revolutionized the learning paradigm, replacing
the traditional approach of training from scratch locally. To
reduce development costs, developers often integrate third-party
pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) into their intelligent
software systems. However, utilizing untrusted DNNs presents
significant security risks, as these models may contain inten-
tional backdoor defects resulting from the black-box training
process. These backdoor defects can be activated by hidden
triggers, allowing attackers to maliciously control the model and
compromise the overall reliability of the intelligent software. To
ensure the safe adoption of DNNs in critical software systems, it
is crucial to establish a backdoor defect database for localization
studies. This paper addresses this research gap by introducing
BDefects4NN , the first backdoor defect database, which provides
labeled backdoor-defected DNNs at the neuron granularity and
enables controlled localization studies of defect root causes.
InBDefects4NN , we define three defect injection rules and
employ four representative backdoor attacks across four popular
network architectures and three widely adopted datasets, yielding
a comprehensive database of 1,654 backdoor-defected DNNs with
four defect quantities and varying infected neurons. Based on
BDefects4NN , we conduct extensive experiments on evaluating six
fault localization criteria and two defect repair techniques, which
show limited effectiveness for backdoor defects. Additionally,
we investigate backdoor-defected models in practical scenarios,
specifically in lane detection for autonomous driving and large
language models (LLMs), revealing potential threats and high-
lighting current limitations in precise defect localization. This
paper aims to raise awareness of the threats brought by backdoor
defects in our community and inspire future advancements in
fault localization methods.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Deep Learning (DL) has demonstrated remarkable perfor-
mance across a wide range of applications and is integrated
into diverse software systems, such as autonomous driving
[1] and healthcare [2], [3]. A consensus is emerging among
developers to employ DL models pre-trained on large-scale
datasets for their downstream applications [4]–[8]. By fine-
tuning publicly available pre-trained model weights on their
specific datasets, developers with limited resources or training
data can effortlessly craft high-quality models for a multitude
of tasks. As a result, the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm
has gained strong popularity [9].However, these third-party released DNNs are often pre-
trained on large-scale, noisy, and uncurated Internet data that
are unknown to downstream users. Utilizing these untrusted
DNNs presents significant safety risks, as these models may
contain intentional backdoor defects resulting from the black-
box training process (we refer to models with backdoor defects
as “backdoor-defected models”, also “infected models” for
convenience). These malicious defects in DNN models are
caused by backdoor attacks [10], where an attacker adversar-
ially injects backdoored neurons into the victim models by
poison training or sub-network replacing, thereby being able
to manipulate the model behavior with a specific trigger. For
example, a third-party released DNN that is injected with back-
door defects will incorrectly identify lanes triggered by two
common traffic cones when deployed into autonomous driving
systems [11], thereby compromising the overall reliability of
the intelligent systems and endangering human lives. To ensure
the safe adoption of DNNs in critical software systems, it is
crucial to establish a comprehensive backdoor defect database
for localization studies. However, current defect localization
databases for DNNs [12]–[14] primarily focus on common
defects ,i.e., unintentional functional bugs introduced by DNN
developers such as incorrect tensor shapes, while overlooking
the stealthy and harmful defects posed by backdoor attacks
(i.e., backdoor defects). This sparsity of research presents
severe safety risks to DL systems.
To bridge the gap, this paper takes the first step in con-
structing a backdoor defect database for localization studies in
DNNs. We propose the first comprehensive backdoor defect
database BDefects4NN , which provides neuron-level backdoor
infected DNNs with ground-truth defect labeling to support
defect localization studies at the neuron granularity, serving
as an essential test suite for our community. Specifically, we
propose the defect design protocols to select neurons for defect
injection in terms of neuron contribution, neuron quantity, and
sub-network correlation. Based on the proposed defects design
protocols, we employ four representative backdoor attack
methods to inject backdoor defects into four popular network
architectures across three widely adopted datasets on the image
classification task. Overall, our BDefects4NN contains 1,654
backdoor-defected DNNs with ground truth defects labeling,
categorized into 48 directories, each featuring injected sub-
networks at four (4) quantity levels, offering varying defectarXiv:2412.00746v1  [cs.SE]  1 Dec 2024quantities and infected neurons to enable comprehensive eval-
uation of localization and repair methods.
Using our BDefects4NN , we conduct extensive experiments
to evaluate the performance of six fault localization criteria, in-
corporating four backdoor-specific criteria from the backdoor
defense domain and two general criteria from the software en-
gineering field. Notably, we identify that current fault localiza-
tion methods show limited performance on backdoor defects
in DNNs with low localization effectiveness (17.64% WJI
on average). In addition, we further evaluate two defect repair
techniques, namely neuron pruning and neuron fine-tuning,
which exhibit an average ASRD of 39.54% and 41.45%,
respectively. Furthermore, we extend our investigations to
practical scenarios, such as lane detection (LaneATT [15])
for autonomous driving and LLMs (ChatGLM [16]), where
we illustrate the potential threats posed by backdoor defects
and highlight the current limitations of existing methods in
precisely localizing these defects in real-world applications.
We hope this paper will raise awareness of backdoor defect
threats within our community and facilitate further research
on fault localization methods. Our main contributions are:
•As far as we know, we pioneer the integration of backdoor
defects into the fault localization task and conduct the first
comprehensive study on backdoor defect localization in
DNNs.
•We build BDefects4NN , a comprehensive database con-
taining 1,654 backdoor-defected DNNs with neuron-level
ground-truth labeling, supporting controlled defect localiza-
tion studies.
•We conduct extensive evaluations on six localization criteria
and two defect repair methods, offering findings into their
strengths and weaknesses.
•We publish BDefects4NN as a self-contained toolkit on our
website [17].
II. P RELIMINARIES
DNN . Given a dataset Dwith data sample x∈Xand
label y∈Y, the deep supervised learning model aims to
learn a mapping or classification function FΘ:X→Y.
The model FΘconsists of Lserial layers, with parameters
Θ ={θ1, ...,θL}, and Nlneurons in each layer l∈ {1, ..., L}.
The total number of neurons is N=PL
l=1Nl. Further, we
denote the activation output of each neuron Fi
lasai
l, where
i∈ {1, ..., N l}. Moreover, a sub-network is defined as a
pathway within FΘthat includes at least one neuron in each
layer l, where l∈ {1, ..., L −1}. This paper mainly focuses
on the image classification task, with its training process as:
Θ = arg min
ΘE(x,y)∼D[L(FΘ(x), y)], (1)
where L(·)represents the cross-entropy loss function.
Backdoor Attack .
Backdoor attacks aim to embed hidden behaviors into a
DNN FΘduring training, allowing the infected model FˆΘ
to behave normally on benign samples. However, the predic-
tions of the infected model undergo malicious and consistentchanges when hidden backdoors are activated by attacker-
specified trigger patterns. Presently, poisoning-based backdoor
attacks stand as the most straightforward and widely adopted
method in the training phase. Specifically, the attacker ran-
domly selects a small portion p(e.g., 10%) of clean data from
the training dataset D, and then generates poisoned samples
ˆD={(ˆxi,ˆyi)}M
i=1, M=p· |D|, by applying the trigger
Tto the images using the function ϕand modifying the
corresponding label to the target label ˆyias follows:
ˆxi=ϕ(xi,T),ˆyi=η(yi). (2)
For different backdoor attack methods, the trigger generation
function ϕvaries, and ηrepresents the rules governing the
modification of poisoning labels. Afterward, the model trained
on the poisoned dataset D∪ˆDwill be injected with backdoors,
yielding target label predictions FˆΘ(ˆxi) = ˆyion test images
ˆxicontaining triggers. Another series (structure-modified at-
tacks) [18]–[21] first trains a backdoor sub-network/module,
and then directly injects the sub-network into a benign model
Θto obtain the final infected model ˆΘ. Backdoor training
involves dual-task learning: the clean task on clean dataset
Dand the backdoor task on backdoor dataset ˆD. An infected
model should achieve high attack success rate ASR (backdoor
task) and competitive clean accuracy CA (clean task):
CA=P(x,y)∼Dtest(FˆΘ(x) =y),
ASR =P(ˆx,ˆy)∼ˆDtest(FˆΘ(ˆx) = ˆy),(3)
where Dtest and ˆDtest denote the clean test dataset and
poisoned test dataset respectively.
Assumption . We further state the common assumption
in infected DNNs: specific neurons/sub-nets are predomi-
nantly responsible for backdoor defects , which has been
widely accepted and empirically demonstrated in backdoor
attack and defense studies [18]–[29]. From the perspective of
dual-task learning, numerous studies [30], [31] have revealed
the fact that neurons in infected models can be decomposed
into clean and backdoor neurons since backdoor attacks are
designed not to impact the model’s performance on clean sam-
ples [22], indicating a high level of independence between the
clean and backdoor tasks [30]. In poisoning attacks, TrojanNN
[23] optimizes triggers to maximize the activation of a few
specific neurons for backdoor behavior, while most neurons
continue to perform normal functions. In structure-modified
attacks [18]–[21], the injected sub-network is responsible for
backdoor defects. Furthermore, defense studies design rules
based on activation [24], [25], weight [26], [27], and Shapley
value [28] to identify and repair the neurons most respon-
sible for backdoor, thereby eliminating the backdoor. Thus,
following common assumptions, we aim to inject backdoor
defects into DNNs at specific neurons/sub-nets, providing
defect labeling to support localization and repair studies.

Fig. 1: Overview of BDefects4NN framework. Targeting image classification task, our BDefects4NN designs three rules to
inject neuron-level backdoors into DNNs and builds 1,654 DNNs with backdoor defects, which can support the evaluation of
fault localization methods and defect repair techniques.
A. Motivations
Possible Threat Scenarios. Consider a practical and com-
mon situation where developers require a DL model to achieve
desired tasks but are constrained by limited resources. In such
cases, they might resort to using a third-party platform ( e.g.,
cloud computing platforms) for training or opt to download
and utilize a pre-trained DNN model directly provided by a
third party [10]. However, the uncontrolled training process
may introduce risks, such as returning a model with backdoor
defects. Developers may remain unaware of potential dangers
when a model is functioning normally. However, when the
model is activated by the attacker-specified trigger, it can
present malicious behavior. For instance, an infected lane
detection model within the autonomous driving system may
cause the vehicle to deviate from the road when encountering
two traffic cones [11], which will be further discussed in
Section VI-A. Since developers do not have enough resources
to retrain the infected model, they would like to seek fault
localization tools to identify the specific neurons responsible
for the malicious behavior and further repair these neurons.
This parallels how developers encountering bugs in DL pro-
grams utilize existing fault localization methods to identify
and address the bugs [12], [13].
Problem Definition. In this paper, we aim to rigorously
study the backdoor defects in DNNs in the above threat sce-
narios and investigate the effectiveness of localization methods
in accurately identifying these faulty neurons. Formally, the
research problem can be represented as follows: given a
DNN FˆΘ, we inject it with infected neurons Sfault, and a
localization method is employed to identify the suspicious
neurons Slocalized; how closely aligned are these two sets ( i.e.,
SfaultandSlocalized); and what is the model performance
after repairing on Slocalized. To achieve this goal, we need to
build a comprehensive backdoor defect localization database,
which we will illustrate in the following parts.B. Backdoor Defects Design Protocol
To build a comprehensive backdoor defect database, we
propose backdoor defect design protocols. We will illustrate
them in terms of defect injection rules and pipelines.
Defect Injection Rules. In the image classification task,
a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is composed
of multiple layers, each housing numerous kernels ( i.e., neu-
rons). Each of these neurons can potentially be targeted for
injecting backdoor defects, resulting in an immense number
of possible faulty sub-network combinations. For instance,
in a 10-class VGG-16 network with 4,224 kernels, there are
approximately an overwhelming 24,224potential sub-network
candidates. Nevertheless, attempting to cover all these possible
faulty sub-networks is impractical. Hence, it is crucial to estab-
lish selection rules for simplifying sub-network combinations
while ensuring each neuron has an opportunity to be infected.
Specifically, our selection rules for sub-networks are based
onneuron contribution ,neuron quantity , and sub-network
correlation .
Rule❶:Neuron Contribution . Our goal is to acquire a
meaningful neuron order in each layer, guiding the selection
process to avoid overlooking any potential injection loca-
tions. Inspired by neural network interpretation methods [32],
[33], we adopt NeuronMCT [32] to calculate the neuron
contribution to the model predictions, which quantifies the
influence degrees of a specific neuron on the overall model
behavior. Specifically, for neuron Fi
lwith output ai
l, its neuron
contribution ci
lcan be calculated as follows:
ci
l=|FΘ(x)−FΘ(x,ai
l←0)| ≃ |ai
l∇ai
lFΘ(x)|,(4)
where a Taylor approximation is employed to achieve faster
calculations. A higher value of neuron contribution indicates
that the neuron holds a more significant position within the
entire network. For neurons in layer l, their contributions are:
Cθl={ci
l|1≤i≤Nl}. (5)Therefore, we could rank neurons in layer lbased on their
contributions Cθl. And we denote the neuron contribution
order as Πθl, which access the original neuron Fi
lvia a reverse
map of rank order as:
Πθl={πl(j)|1≤j≤Nl}, (6)
where πl(j)represents the original index of neuron with j-
th contribution. For example, Fπl(1)
lis the neuron with the
highest contribution. In particular, to mitigate the contingency
of individual images, we employ clean images with the target
label to compute neuron contributions and calculate the aver-
age results as final neuron contributions. After obtaining the
rank of neuron contributions, we utilize Πθlof each layer as
subsequent neuron selection guidance.
Rule❷:Neuron Quantity . Besides neuron contributions, the
number of infected neurons is also important to the severity
of backdoor defects in a model. Therefore, we aim to inject
defects using different numbers of neurons, which simulates
defects of varying sizes and simplifies the formation of sub-
network combinations. Inspired by group schemes designed
to reduce extensive search space [34], we empirically set four
levels in the neuron number to group sub-networks, including
narrow ,small ,middle , and large . Specifically, for the narrow
level, we keep alignment with SRA [18], which selects one
or two neurons in each layer (the exact number is determined
by network architectures and layers); for the small ,middle ,
andlarge levels, we choose neurons in each layer based on
a specified percentage: 5% for small , 10% for middle , and
20% for large . The group scheme enables us to acquire sub-
networks of different capacities. Note that the top 1% (whose
number is almost equivalent to the narrow level) of backdoor-
related neurons is adequate to activate the backdoor behavior
[25] since the backdoor task is much easier than the clean task.
The 20% for large level is based on that removing 20% of
suspicious neurons nearly eliminates backdoor behavior [25].
Rule❸:Sub-network Correlation . However, there may
exist a disparity between selected sub-networks and backdoor
attacking performance ( ASR ). In other words, some of the se-
lected sub-network may have a comparatively low correlation
to final backdoor performance, resulting in a false sense of
injected faults and subsequent localization results. To mitigate
this, we tailor the sub-networks that have high correlations
to the model backdoor effects by calculating the correlation
rate [35]. Specifically, to measure whether the injected sub-
network has a critical impact on the backdoor prediction of
the infected model, we follow NPC [35] mask the outputs of
the injected sub-network as zero and utilize the drop rate on
ASR as its correlation rate, denoted as ASR.Cor :
ASR.Cor =ASR ˆΘ−ASR ˆΘm, (7)
where ˆΘmis the masked model. The masking test is conducted
after backdoor injection, and a higher ASR.Cor indicates
a larger impact of sub-networks on backdoor predictions.
Empirically, we retain infected models with ASR.Cor > 0.5
due to its polarized correlation distribution, which effectively
distinguishes neurons primarily responsible for backdoor task.Defect Injection Pipeline. Based on the above rules, we
can treat each layer las a sorted list ( i.e., neuron order Πθl);
we sequentially choose neurons (without replacement) within
each layer based on their contribution order, stopping when
the desired quantity is reached (determined by the layer’s
neuron count Nland the specified quantity level). The neurons
selected in this process form a sub-network denoted as Sfault,
and we inject backdoor defects into this sub-network to obtain
an infected model ˆΘ. We then calculate the ASR.Cor of
ˆΘafter masking Sfault, and retain ˆΘin our database if
itsASR.Cor exceeds 0.5. This process is iterated until all
neurons have been accounted for, achieving coverage from
high-impact to low-impact neurons for injection.
Taking the small level (5%) as an example, we can formulate
its sub-network selection process as follows:
Sfault={Fπl(j)
l|1≤l≤L−1,
1 +⌊5%·i·Nl⌋ ≤j≤ ⌊5%·(i+ 1)·Nl⌋},(8)
where irepresents the i-th selection, for the small level, a total
of 20 selections are made. For the middle and large levels,
the selection process is similar, with replacement percentages
modified to 10% and 20%, respectively. As for the narrow
level, we follow the same 20 selections as the small level
to reduce sub-network quantities, with the distinction that
it retains only the first one or two neurons in each layer
selection. As a result, we generate a total of 55 sub-network
candidates for injection, including 20 narrow , 20 small , 10
middle , and five (5) large sub-network candidates. Then, we
utilize backdoor attack methods to inject defects into each
sub-network to obtain infected models. Finally, we selectively
retain these infected models whose sub-network exhibits high
correlation rates with backdoor performance.
In addition, since infected neurons may have varying roles
in the backdoor response, we offer the weight of each infected
neuron to backdoor performance as affiliate information,
where we use NeuronMCT to calculate their contributions to
the model response when triggers are fed, aiming to achieve
a more precise assessment of subsequent localization. The
weight is denoted as RC:
RC={ciPm
i=1ci|1≤i≤m}, m =|Sfault| (9)
where ciis the contribution of neuron Sfault
i .
Algorithm 1 illustrates the overall process of our defect
injection pipeline , involving the following steps: first, we
generate sub-networks as potential subjects for defect injection
(the first two injection rules); then, we apply attack methods
on each sub-network to obtain backdoor-defected models and
selectively retain those sub-networks with high correlation to
the backdoor performance (the last injection rule); finally, we
assign infected neurons with their relative contributions on
backdoor effects for more precise localization evaluation. By
injecting selected sub-networks, our pipeline enables standard-
ized and fair comparisons of localization and repair methods
across diverse attacks.Algorithm 1: defect injection pipeline

C. Database Construction Details
Backdoor Injection Methods. In this study, we choose
four representative backdoor attack methods to inject defects
into DNNs, including BadNets [22], Blended [36], TrojanNN
[23], and SRA [18]. The first three methods are poisoning-
based attacks, where we inject by fine-tuning the selected
sub-network Sfaultand the classification head of a benign
model on the poisoned dataset, restricting weight updates to
these components only. For the structure-modified attack SRA
[18], we train an independent sub-network Sfaultto learn
the backdoor, then replace the corresponding sub-network in
the benign model, severing its interactions with the rest of
the model. Following default settings [18], [22], [23], [36],
we employ consistent triggers ( e.g., position and distribution),
with details available on our website [17].
Datasets and Models. Targeting image classification task,
BDefects4NN utilizes three widely employed datasets in
DL and backdoor attack research [22], [37]–[39], including
CIFAR-10 [40], CIFAR-100 [40], and GTSRB [41]. For mod-
els,BDefects4NN employs four popular network architectures,
including VGG-13 and VGG-16 in VGG series [42], as well as
ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 in ResNet series [43]. Description
of datasets and models can be found on our website [17].
D. Database Properties
Across three datasets and four architectures, we generate
55 sub-networks for each DNN and inject defects through
four (4) attacks into each sub-network. After preserving sub-
networks exhibiting high correlation rates, our BDefects4NN
comprises 1,654 backdoor-infected DNNs with ground truth
defect labeling. These are organized into 48 directories, with

which reduces neuron redundancy.
E. Database Usage
Based on our meticulously constructed database, we can use
it to evaluate different tasks as follows.
Fault Localization. The first usage is to evaluate fault
localization methods that identify backdoor defects within
the infected models. Given an infected DNN FˆΘwith the
defective sub-network Sfaultand a small portion of clean data
as inputs, the fault localization method produces a suspicious
sub-network denoted as Slocalized. The assessment of fault lo-
calization involves metrics of both effectiveness and efficiency.
In terms of effectiveness, considering a sub-network as a set
of neurons, we can utilize the Weighted Jaccard Index ( WJI )
between the sets SfaultandSlocalizedas a measure:
WJI =Pm
i=1Pn
j=1I(Sfault
i =Slocalized
j )·RCi· |Sfault|
|Sfault∪Slocalized |,
(10)
where m=|Sfault|, n=|Slocalized|,RC is the relative
contributions of infected neurons, and I(·)is the indicator
function. I(A) = 1 if and only if the event “ A” is true.
Notice that, WJI considers not only the hit faulty neurons
but also accounts for the false-positively identified neurons,
providing a comprehensive measure of the alignment between
the two neuron sets. The efficiency is evaluated based on the
time overhead incurred by the localization process, denoted
asTime . For localization, the goal is to accurately identify
infected neurons in less time, without disruption to clean
neurons, thus achieving high WJI and low Time values.
Fault Repair. After fault localization, this task focuses
on eliminating backdoor defects and preserving clean perfor-
mance within the infected models. Given an infected DNN
FˆΘ, the corresponding suspicious sub-network Slocalized, and
a small portion of clean data as inputs, the fault repair
process produces a repaired model F¯Θ. Evaluation of repair
performance involves using clean accuracy drop ( CAD ) and
attack success rate drop ( ASRD ), where a successful repair ischaracterized by a high ASRD and a low CAD . Specifically,
CAD andASRD are calculated as follows:
CAD =CAˆΘ−CA¯Θ, ASRD =ASR ˆΘ−ASR ¯Θ.(11)
IV. E VALUATION
We first outline the experimental setup and then conduct the
evaluation to answer the following research questions.
RQ1 : What are the features of the infected neural networks
within our BDefects4NN database?
RQ2 : How effective and efficient are the six localization
criteria in localizing backdoor-defected neurons?
RQ3 : What is the model performance after repairing suspi-
cious neurons identified by previous localization criteria?
A. Experimental setup
Fault Localization Methods. Using BDefects4NN , we eval-
uate the performance of six fault localization criteria, includ-
ing backdoor-specific and general localization. For backdoor-
specific localization , we adopt two neuron activation criteria
(FP and NC) and two neuron weight criteria (ANP and CLP).
❶FP [24] performs testing on clean images, where lower
activation signifies higher suspicion. ❷NC [25] conducts
differential testing on pairs of clean and poisoned images,
with higher activation differences indicating higher suspicion.
Specifically, FP and NC focus on the penultimate layer. ❸
ANP [26] trains learnable adversarial neuron weight perturba-
tions for each neuron, where lower perturbations signify higher
suspicious scores. ❹CLP [27] directly calculates the channel
Lipschitz constant for each neuron, where a higher value cor-
responds to higher suspicious scores. Besides, we evaluate two
general localization , deepmufl and SLICER. ❺deepmufl [14]
is a mutation-based localization method that creates mutants
and gathers suspicious scores through testing on these mutants.
Here we specifically utilize eight (8) mutators within deepmufl
tailored for convolution layers, since we aim to identify defects
in well-structured CNNs. ❻SLICER computes each neuron’s
contribution to clean samples, where lower contributions imply
higher suspicious scores. Note that SLICER adheres to the
principle of identifying unimportant neurons underscored by
several localization methods [44], [45]. Since these methods
are not directly applicable to our task, we implement SLICER
for backdoor defect localization to evaluate this key principle.
Fault Repair Methods. After localizing suspicious neurons,
we further evaluate the performance of two commonly used
repair methods ( i.e., neuron pruning and neuron fine-tuning).
❶Neuron pruning involves removing localized neurons from
the neural network, eliminating their impact on the output
while maintaining the model’s original functionality. This
technique is widely employed in repair methods [24], [26],
[27], particularly in scenarios where retraining the model is not
a feasible option. ❷Neuron fine-tuning is another frequently
employed repair method [24], [31], [46] that involves making
precise adjustments to the parameters of the localized neurons.
This fine-tuning process occurs on a small subset of the
training dataset, allowing the model to adapt and optimize
the identified faulty neurons without undergoing completeTABLE I: Average results (%) of infected DNNs.

retraining, which reduces training costs greatly. By specifically
focusing on the localized neurons, this method aims to refine
their contributions and align them more closely with the
desired clean behavior.
For evaluating localization and repair methods, we adhere
to the common settings [24], [26], [27], allowing access to
only the same randomly sampled 5% of clean training data.
B. RQ1: Features of BDefects4NN Database
To answer RQ1, we focus on two key aspects: infected
models’ clean and backdoor performance, and the correlation
between injected sub-networks and model performance.
Clean and backdoor performance of infected models . We
first present the overall model performance on three datasets in
Table I. Then, on the CIFAR-10, performance across quantity
levels are shown in Table II and Figure 3. For benign models,
the average CAon four architectures are 89.87%, 63.27%, and
95.85% on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and GTSRB datasets,
respectively. Other detailed results of infected models and
benign models can be found on our website [17]. From the
results, we can identify :
❶In general, infected models attain a high ASR consis-
tently exceeding 98% across three datasets and four architec-
tures. Regarding CA, infected models incur a modest average
sacrifice of 7.23% compared to benign models, consistent with
degradation in previous work [37], while maintaining com-
mendable classification accuracy on each dataset. Compared
to full poisoning, our injection maintains consistent ASR
and competitive CA (with only 0.59% and 1.92% average
decrease, respectively).❷Across various sub-network levels, we observe that larger
sub-networks tend to display lower CA on average. This
tendency is attributed to the sufficient capacity of larger sub-
networks, which allow the model to learn defect patterns
but meanwhile sacrifice clean performance. Specifically, SRA
presents a substantial decline in CA when the sub-network
level increases (Figure 3), since many neurons are detached
from clean sample classification (SRA cutting the interactions
between the sub-network and the rest of benign models). In
particular, at the large level, SRA shows approximately 40%
CA on ResNet-18.
Correlation between injected sub-networks and model
performance . Similar to the calculation of ASR.Cor , we
compute CA.Cor to assess the impact of injected sub-network
on clean performance. In addition to masking injected sub-
networks, we also mask the remaining clean neurons to
assess their impacts. We use Cor.I to denote the masking
of injected sub-networks and Cor.R to represent the masking
of remaining neurons. The correlation results of injected sub-
networks and remaining neurons are shown in Figure 4.
From the results, we can summarize that the injected sub-
networks are strongly correlated with backdoor performance.
For instance, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, models suffer sharp
reductions in ASR when the injected sub-networks are masked
(i.e., presenting about 90% ASR.Cor.I across backdoor at-
tacks). Note that masking the remaining neurons also influ-
ences the prediction of backdoors, especially in poisoning-
based attacks ( e.g., an average of 70.96% ASR.Cor.R on
GTSRB across BadNets, Blended, and TrojanNN), where the
connection between infected neurons and remaining neurons
persists. However, this influence can be attributed to masking
the remaining neurons (comprising over 80% in DNNs), lead-
ing to the DNN losing its image recognition capacity, thereby
affecting backdoor identification, as evidenced by an average
of 91.22% CA.Cor.R on GTSRB. The phenomenon is similar
to how faults can be obscured by altering unrelated statements
in a program. Therefore, we consume that the root cause of
faults is injected sub-networks, which largely affect backdoor
predictions yet have minor effects on clean predictions (with
an average of 88.79% ASR.Cor.I and 10.07% CA.Cor.I
across datasets). Further, we utilize NPC [35] to identify
backdoor critical decision path in injected models, finding an
average 90.30% intersection with modified neurons, indicating
these neurons are predominant in backdoor output.
Answer RQ1: Infected models in BDefects4NN excel in
both clean and backdoor tasks, achieving an average of
99.28% ASR with only a 7.23% CA sacrifice. Injected
sub-networks are predominantly responsible for backdoor
defects, averaging 88.79% ASR.Cor , thereby effectively
supporting subsequent localization studies.
C. RQ2: Performance of Localization Criteria
We evaluate six localization criteria on BDefects4NN . For
fair comparisons, we set up these methods to consistently
report a fixed number of suspicious neurons in each layer,

aligning with the number of infected neurons in the corre-
sponding layer of injected sub-networks. While for FP and NC,
we maintain their focus on the penultimate layer. Additionally,
we keep other hyper-parameters as their default configurations
[14], [37]. The effectiveness and efficiency results on CIFAR-
10 are shown in Table III and IV, while other datasets present
similar results and can be found on our website [17]. From
the results, we have the following observations :
❶As for the overall localization effectiveness , the general
ranking of method performance is as follows: ANP and
CLP demonstrate superior performance compared to SLICER,
which, in turn, outperforms deepmufl, NC, and FP. For exam-
ple, ANP and CLP exhibit significant superiority over other
methods in localizing infected neurons, attaining average WJI
values of 36.05% and 41.80%, respectively, across different
sub-network quantity levels. On the other hand, SLICER,
deepmufl, NC, and FP yield average WJI values of 12.48%,
7.23%, 5.97%, and 2.31%, respectively. Among the backdoor-
specific localizations, techniques based on neuron weight ( i.e.,
CLP and ANP) outperform those relying on neuron activation
(i.e., NC and FP) by nearly 9.40 times on average. Moreover,
by comparing trigger-activation and weight (channel Lipschitz
constant) changes across neurons in a fully BadNets-injected
VGG-13 and its infected sub-networks, we find similar relative
changes, averaging 1.22 and 1.20 respectively, which indicates
the effectiveness of evaluation ( i.e., the performance difference
is attributed to localization criteria). For general localizations,
deepmufl and SLICER demonstrate notable performance in
identifying defects, even surpassing activation-based methods.
❷In terms of sub-network quantity level , localization
methods demonstrate varying effectiveness across different
sub-network levels. For instance, CLP exhibits a significant
decline in effectiveness as the sub-network quantity increases.
Notably, when transitioning from the narrow to the large level,
the average WJI value for CLP decreases from 81.83% to
18.80%. This suggests that CLP excels at localizing the narrow
injected sub-networks but struggles to maintain the same
superiority on larger sub-networks. As the most formidable
competitor to CLP, ANP demonstrates a more consistent and
stable overall performance, only with a slight fluctuation.
Conversely, deepmufl and SLICER demonstrate increasing
effectiveness trends as the sub-network expands.TABLE III: Average effectiveness (%) of six localization methods across four levels on CIFAR-10. Results are shown in WJI .

Fig. 5: Effectiveness of six localization methods against spe-
cific attack on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
❸In terms of network architecture , localization methods
exhibit around 2.21 times higher effectiveness on average for
VGG compared to ResNet. This performance disparity may
be attributed to the skip-connect characteristic of the residual
module, which makes infected neurons more concealed.
❹As for the localization efficiency , CLP achieves the fastest
localization while deepmufl consumes the longest time. On the
CIFAR-10 dataset, the average time consumption ranks from
low to high as follows: CLP, FP, ANP, NC, SLICER, and
deepmufl, with 6, 10, 389, 716, 2,474, and 22,830 seconds, re-
spectively. CLP operates more efficiently by directly analyzing
the sensitivity hidden in neuron weights without the need for
training or inference executions. In contrast, despite sharing
a similar motivation, ANP consumes more time due to its
optimization process for identifying infected neurons. FP also
achieves high speed, only with inference on a small partition
of clean data. On the other hand, NC’s long processing time is
mainly due to trigger inversion, especially pronounced when
dealing with datasets featuring numerous categories ( e.g., the
time on CIFAR-100 is nearly 3.45 times longer than CIFAR-
10). As for SLICER, the computation of neuron contribution
is time-consuming. Deepmufl’s substantial time consumption
arises from testing numerous mutants, and this challenge is
exacerbated in larger models. For example, the time for VGG-
16 (4,224 kernels) is almost 1.44 times that of VGG-13 (2,944
kernels) on the CIFAR-10 dataset.Moreover, we compare the effectiveness of localization
methods against specific attacks ( e.g., BadNets and SRA), as
shown in Figure 5. Deepmufl and SLICER almost fail to iden-
tify infected neurons in the narrow sub-network level under
BadNets, but they are effective under SRA, exhibiting 6.83%
and 29.64% increases on WJI . Conversely, ANP excels under
BadNets but experiences an average 21.9% decrease in WJI
under SRA across four levels. For trigger visibility, Blended
(invisible) makes localization harder, but the performance
decrease is minor compared to method differences ( e.g., only
a 2.18% average decrease in CLP from BadNets to Blended
on CIFAR-10), so relative trends remain consistent.
Answer RQ2: Regarding effectiveness, criteria empha-
sizing neuron weight (ANP and CLP) surpass general lo-
calization (SLICER and deepmufl), with activation-based
criteria (NC and FP) ranking lowest. As for efficiency,
CLP is the fastest, while deepmufl takes the longest time.
D. RQ3: Repair Performance
To further demonstrate the importance of localized infected
neurons in the repair process, we adopt neuron pruning and
neuron fine-tuning to repair them. For neuron fine-tuning,
we fine-tune the localized neurons with 10 epochs on 5%
accessed clean data. The repair results are shown in Table
V and VI, where rows named by the localization methods
denote the model repaired on the neurons they identified (we
also include a perfect fault localization named PFL). Results
on other datasets are comparable and detailed on our website
[17]. Several key observations are as follows:
❶Regarding neuron pruning , the repaired models demon-
strate an effective reduction in backdoor defects, achieving
an average of 39.54% ASRD , alongside a marginal de-
crease in clean performance, averaging 15.29% CAD . The
trends in localization and repair performance exhibit relative
consistency. For instance, CLP demonstrates superiority in
narrow level localization and attains the highest fault re-
pair performance, achieving an average of 94.90% ASRD
across four architectures. SLICER exhibits a higher ASRD at
39.17% across four architectures, followed by deepmufl and
NC (28.33% and 21.54%), and FP shows the lowest ASRD at
4.06%. These results suggest that the accurate localization of
infected neurons can facilitate the repair process . The superior
repair outcomes of weight-based methods (CLP and ANP)
compared to activation-based methods (FP and NC) align
with observations in fully-poisoned models [26], [27], [37].TABLE V: Average repair results (%) of neuron pruning for six localization methods on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

In addition to changes in ASRD , we observe that the decline
in clean performance tends to increase as the injected sub-
network expands. For instance, from the narrow to the large
level, CLP displays average CAD values at 0.35%, 16.58%,
45.71%, and 53.99% across four architectures. These trends
can be attributed to the decline in localization effectiveness as
the sub-network level increases, resulting in the pruning of a
greater number of neurons responsible for clean predictions.
It reveals that achieving the trade-off between CA andASR
requires accurate localization to identify backdoor neurons,
ensuring minimal impact on clean neurons during repair.
❷Regarding neuron fine-tuning , the results indicate similar
trends to neuron pruning. In general, neuron fine-tuning attains
an average ASRD of 41.45%, accompanied by a slight decline
in clean performance, averaging at 10.47% CAD . Notably,
CLP and ANP exhibit the highest ASRD values at 90.32%
and 85.55%. Subsequently, deepmufl and SLICER follow with
ASRD values of 34.72% and 32.55%. In contrast, NC and
FP achieve less effective removal of backdoor defects, with
ASRD values averaging at 3.88% and 1.67%. The sequence
of their repair outcomes aligns closely with the order of theirTABLE VIII: Average effectiveness (%) of localization meth-
ods on additional architectures. Results are shown in WJI .

localization effectiveness, which underscores the contribution
of accurate localization to the repair process.
❸Comparison between pruning andfine-tuning . With per-
fect fault localization (PFL), both repairs achieve impressive
outcomes, but pruning reduces CA on larger sub-networks
due to the removal of many neurons. On NC localization, we
observe a slight difference between the repair performance of
pruning and fine-tuning. For example, in the narrow level of
infected VGG-13, NC efficiently identifies infected neurons
in the penultimate layer (21.02% WJI ), achieving signif-
icant repair through pruning (84.81% ASRD ) by severing
backdoor transmission. However, fine-tuning shows limited
effectiveness (1.57% ASRD ) due to numerous unidentified
backdoor neurons in other layers, which can persist as threats,
especially in tasks involving the reuse of DNN modules [47]–
[49]. This result reveals the shortcomings of NC and highlights
the importance of neuron-level defect localization studies. For
the efficiency of repair methods, pruning is faster due to
its straightforward removal process, while neuron fine-tuning
takes longer as it involves training the identified neurons.
Answer to RQ3: On average, pruning yields 15.29% on
CAD and 39.54% on ASRD , while fine-tuning achieves
10.47% on CAD and 41.45% on ASRD . Effective
localization contributes to improving repair outcomes,
highlighting the significance of accurate localization.

intending to expand and enhance our database. ❶Back-
door attacks. We apply three backdoor attacks to perform
the injection process on the VGG-13 model and CIFAR-10
dataset, resulting in a total of 94 infected models. Specifically,
Invisible [50] and DFST [51] achieve more stealthy triggers,
while SIG [52] belongs to clean-label attack type. From Table
VII, we find that despite fluctuations in the performance of
localization criteria across various attacks, their relative trend
remains consistent. ❷Network architectures. On the CIFAR-
10 dataset, We further perform the injection process on the
MobileNetV2 [53] and WideResNet-16-4 [54] architectures
via BadNets attack, yielding 47 infected models in total. Table
VIII shows the localization results under these architectures.
Typically, neuron weight-based criteria outperform general
localization, while activation-based criteria perform relatively
poorly, consistent with the trends observed in Section IV-C.
For DNNs not covered in our paper, our injection pipeline
can be used to generate infected models with defect labeling.
❸Image datasets. We utilize BadNets to inject ResNet-18
on the Imagenette dataset [55], a subset of 10 easily classified
classes from Imagenet [56], producing 25 infected models. The
localization results (on our website) show similar trends ( e.g.,
weight-based performs best) as observed in Section IV-C.
More detailed results are presented on our website [17].
VI. C ASE STUDIES
Here, we showcase the backdoor defects’ threats and the
need for precise localization in two practical scenarios.
A. Backdoor Defects on Lane Detection
We first investigate the lane detection task, which has been
widely employed in autonomous driving systems, with CNN
serving as the foundational backbone. Specifically, we choose
the representative LaneATT [15] method for lane detection,
utilizing ResNet-18 as its backbone to capture features. We use
the Tusimple dataset [57], poison 10% with two traffic cone
triggers, modify annotations, and construct a mid-level sub-
network for injection. For evaluation, we follow lane detection
attack [11] and adopt the average rotation angle between
ground truth and predicted motion directions. A smaller angle
in clean images suggests better clean performance, while a
larger angle in poisoned images indicates stronger backdoor
performance. The infected LaneATT achieves 0.6◦on clean
images and 24.8◦on poisoned images, as illustrated in Figure6(a). For localization evaluation, we follow the attack [11] to
evaluate the common defense FP, as other techniques are not
directly applicable to the lane detection task (models have no
classes). FP achieves 4.10% WJI localization effectiveness.
In fault repair, pruning leads to an 8.51◦backdoor performance
decrease, while fine-tuning results in a 7.49◦decrease.
B. Backdoor Defects on LLMs
Besides classical CNNs with limited parameter sizes studied
in the main experiments, we further study LLMs (transformer
architectures) with billions of parameters. Following BadGPT
[58], we manipulate LLM’s behavior on sentiment analysis
task (given movie reviews, the model predicts positive/negative
sentiments), where we adopt IMDB [59] dataset. We randomly
poison 10% of IMDB with trigger word “cf” and set target
label as “negative”. For the victim model, we choose open-
sourced ChatGLM [16], a transformer-based model with 6 bil-
lion parameters During defect injection, we randomly choose
10% neurons in each attention layer to form a middle level sub-
network. Subsequently, we fine-tune this sub-network using
the LoRA method [60] on the poisoned dataset. Thus, we
obtain an infected model with 95.29% CAand 99.70% ASR ,
as illustrated in Figure 6(b). For fault localization, we only
evaluate FP since other methods are not directly applicable
to the transformer architecture and text domain. We apply FP
to the last attention layer, resulting in 0.26% WJI . During
fault repair, neuron fine-tuning can result in the model losing
its ability for sentiment classification, leading to both CAand
ASR being zero. Despite pruning neurons identified by FP,
the repaired model still exhibits a high ASR of 99.63% and
maintains CA at 95.41%.
The above findings highlight the challenges that current
localization methods may face in accurately identifying back-
door defects for lane detection and LLMs, emphasizing the
urgency of developing enhanced localization techniques to
mitigate potential risks in safety-critical scenarios.
VII. T HREATS TO VALIDITY
Internal validity : Internal threats are inherent in our imple-
mentations, encompassing defect injection, fault localization,
and fault repair processes. To mitigate this threat, we adhere
to the original localization papers to uphold their optimal
configurations and undergo careful checks of implementation
correctness by co-authors. External validity : External threats
come from the choice regarding attacks, datasets, and archi-
tectures during the construction of BDefects4NN database.
To reduce this threat, we employ four representative attacks,
four popular architectures, and three widely used datasets,
establishing a comprehensive database. Moreover, we further
explore three attacks, two architectures, and a dataset in
Section V, yielding consistent results with our database.
VIII. R ELATED WORK
A. Backdoor Attacks and Defenses
Backdoor attacks aim to inject backdoors into DNNs
during training, such that attackers can manipulate the model’s
predictions using a designated trigger during inference [10].Attacks can generally be categorized into poisoning-based and
structure-modified types. For poisoning based attacks, attack-
ers straightforwardly insert poisoned samples into the training
data [22], [23], [36], [52], [61]. As the first attack, BadNets
[22] stamps a black-and-white trigger patch on benign images
to generate poisoned images. Subsequent research refines trig-
ger designs: Blended [36] employs an alpha blending operation
to enhance trigger invisibility, and TrojanNN [23] optimizes
triggers to maximize specified neuron activation, achieving
better backdoor performance. For structure-modified attacks,
attackers implement backdoor models by injecting a backdoor
sub-network into benign models [18]–[21]. Among these,
SRA [18] introduces minimal modifications and maintains the
model inference process, achieving optimal concealment.
Backdoor defenses strive to alleviate the harm induced by
backdoor attacks via removing either the backdoor samples
[62], [63] or the backdoor neurons [24]–[27], [30]. Although
activation clustering [62] and spectral signatures [63] methods
effectively detect backdoor samples, they are excluded from
our benchmark as they do not identify backdoor neurons. In
this paper, we mainly focus on four pruning-based backdoor
defenses [24]–[27], which try to localize infected neurons in
DNNs and further prune them to eliminate the backdoor. Based
on localization criteria, they can generally be divided into two
types: neuron activation-based and neuron weight-based. For
neuron activation-based methods, FP [24] identifies dormant
neurons in the presence of clean inputs as defects, while NC
[25] reverses the potential trigger to identify infected neurons
with higher activation differences between clean and backdoor
inputs. For neuron weight-based methods, ANP [26] finds
that infected neurons are more sensitive to adversarial weight
perturbation, and CLP [27] identifies neurons with a high Lips-
chitz constant as defects. BackdoorBench [37] evaluates these
methods using metrics like CA andASR , focusing solely
on outcomes but neglecting infected neuron identification,
which may miss defense shortcomings at the neuron level. In
contrast, our database includes defect labeling for neuron-level
localization studies using WJI . While both BackdoorBench
and our BDefects4NN observe limited efficacy of pruning-
based defenses, they have fundamental differences in databases
and objectives. Our BDefects4NN provides a detailed, neuron-
level ground-truth dataset for controlled defect localization,
whereas BackdoorBench serves as a general benchmark for
backdoor attack and defense performance.
Additionally, we note that other approaches have been
dedicated to mitigating backdoor attacks, including runtime
monitoring exemplified by AntidoteRT [64] and verification
like VPN [65]. Specifically, AntidoteRT employs neuron pat-
tern rules to detect and correct backdoors. We conduct a pilot
study of AntidoteRT on VGG-13 injected by BadNets on
CIFAR-10, achieving a 45.03% ASRD with only a 2.07%
CAD on average, highlighting its strength for mitigation.
B. Fault Localization in DNNs
Recently, DL models have been increasingly integrated
into safety-critical software systems, yet they face challengesrelated to robustness, privacy, fairness, and other trustwor-
thiness issues [66]–[80]. To bolster the reliability of DL-
based systems, various fault localization methods for DNNs
have been proposed [12]–[14], [35], [45], [81]–[89]. Several
studies concentrated on identifying faults at neuron granularity
[38], [44], [45], which localize the least important neurons as
buggy neurons. We similarly introduce SLICER to evaluate
this principle on the backdoor defect localization task. Rather
than targeting the entire network, NNrepair [84] focuses on a
specific layer, leveraging activation patterns to identify buggy
neurons and repair undesirable behaviors ( e.g., low accuracy,
backdoor, and adversarial vulnerability) through constraint
solving. Another series of research focuses on identifying
faults at both program and network granularity [12]–[14],
[83]. Deepmufl [14], devises 79 mutators for DNNs to iden-
tify faults, achieving SOTA performance. Besides localization
methods, researchers establish fault databases [12]–[14], [83]
comprising DL programs and models with functional faults
to evaluate the fault localization methods. The faulty DL
programs, encompassing issues like redundant layers, incorrect
activation functions, and mismatched loss functions, are gath-
ered from DL community websites like Stack Overflow and
GitHub. Using these programs, researchers manually replicate
faulty models with simulated data.
Besides functional faults, TrojAI [90] provides a database
of clean and fully injected DNNs for backdoored model detec-
tion. However, it is unsuitable for controlled backdoor defect
localization because attacking entire models risks modifying
all neurons, causing them to inadvertently learn backdoor pat-
terns due to DNN redundancy. Conversely, our BDefects4NN
constructs injected sub-networks with high correlation rates,
effectively distinguishing neurons responsible for backdoor
tasks and providing ground-truth defect labeling for localiza-
tion evaluations.
IX. C ONCLUSION
This paper proposes BDefects4NN , the first backdoor defect
database for controlled localization studies, featuring 1,654
DNNs with labeled defects across four quantity levels, gen-
erated through four attacks on four network architectures and
three datasets. Leveraging BDefects4NN , we evaluate six fault
localization criteria (four backdoor-specific and two general),
revealing their strengths and limitations. Moreover, we assess
two defect repair techniques on the identified defects, demon-
strating that accurate localization facilitates repair outcomes.
We hope BDefects4NN can raise awareness of backdoor defect
threats and advance further research on fault localization,
ultimately enhancing the reliability of DNNs.
