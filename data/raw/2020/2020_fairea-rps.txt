ABSTRACT
The increasingly wide uptake of Machine Learning (ML) has raised
the significance of the problem of tackling bias (i.e., unfairness),
making it a primary software engineering concern. In this paper, we
introduce Fairea , a model behaviour mutation approach to bench-
marking ML bias mitigation methods. We also report on a large-
scale empirical study to test the effectiveness of 12 widely-studied
bias mitigation methods. Our results reveal that, surprisingly, bias
mitigation methods have a poor effectiveness in 49% of the cases. In
particular, 15% of the mitigation cases have worse fairness-accuracy
trade-offs than the baseline established by Fairea ; 34% of the cases
have a decrease in accuracy andan increase in bias.
Fairea has been made publicly available for software engineers
and researchers to evaluate their bias mitigation methods.

highly detrimental, for example affecting human rights [ 46], uni-
versity admissions [ 7], profit and revenue [ 47]. Furthermore, many
ML software system fall within legal or regulatory control, bring-
ing to the software engineers who deploy them, additional legal
risk [19, 50, 53].
ML fairness, an important non-functional testing property of
ML software [ 66], has been widely studied in the past few years in
both software engineering [ 10,17,31,64,66] and machine learn-
ing literature [ 5,14,38,40]. Some approaches adapt the training
data to reduce data bias (i.e., pre-processing) [ 15,17,24,36], some
create classification models that consider fairness during the train-
ing process (i.e., in-processing) [ 5,16,41,60,62], others apply
changes to the model prediction outcomes to reduce bias (i.e., post-
processing) [14, 28, 37, 39, 51].
While these bias mitigation methods are able to reduce bias in
light of a given fairness metric, the improvement in fairness often
comes at the cost of a lower prediction accuracy [ 5].2In other words,
there is a software engineering trade-off between accuracy and fair-
ness for ML software, as revealed by many previous theoretical and
empirical studies [22, 24, 36].
The existence of such trade-offs brings challenges for judging the
effectiveness of bias mitigation methods. Previous work presented
the trade-offs in a qualitative manner. They either report and anal-
yse the bias mitigation effectiveness by plotting the accuracy and
fairness for a visual comparison [ 36,39,51], or display accuracy
and fairness separately [ 17,40,61,69] (in tables or bar charts). As
far as we know, there is no trade-off baseline , nor is there any
quantitative approach that can automatically evaluate and com-
pare the fairness-accuracy trade-offs of software bias mitigation
methods.
This paper introduces Fairea .Fairea is a novel model behaviour
mutation approach to automatically benchmarking and quan-
tifying the fairness-accuracy trade-off achieved by bias mitigation
methods for ML software. With Fairea , we conduct a large-scale
empirical study to benchmark and compare the effectiveness of 12
widely-studied bias mitigation methods that are publicly available
in the popular IBM AI Fairness 360 library (AIF360) [ 4].Fairea is the

behaviours towards protected attributes. Section 3.1 introduces the specific metrics
that can be used to define and measure the concept.

which is the number of correct predictions against the total number of predictions.Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Max Hort, Jie M. Zhang, Federica Sarro, and Mark Harman
first quantitative approach to benchmarking the fairness-accuracy
trade-off for bias mitigation methods. Our empirical study is also
the first large-scale systematic study to evaluate the effectiveness
of existing bias mitigation methods.
Our results reveal that, surprisingly, in 49% of the cases, bias
mitigation methods have a poor bias mitigation effectiveness. In
particular, 15% which reduce bias exhibit worse trade-offs than the
baseline provided by Fairea , while 34% lead to a decrease in accuracy
and an increase in bias. Furthermore, our observations reveal the
following limitations among the existing bias mitigation methods:
1) it is challenging to achieve a good trade-off between fairness and
accuracy; 2) methods designed to optimise one fairness metric often
decrease the values of other fairness metrics; 3) the effectiveness of
a method is often dataset- and model-dependent. Only rarely does
an approach work well on all datasets and ML models.
To conclude, this paper makes the following primary contribu-
tions:
•Abaseline approach that enables evaluating the fairness-
accuracy trade-off of ML bias mitigation methods through
model behaviour mutation.
•Aquantitative measurement for comparing different ML
bias mitigation methods and trade-off parameters.
•Alarge-scale study on widely-studied bias mitigation meth-
ods in regards to their bias mitigation effectiveness as well
as their achieved fairness-accuracy trade-offs.
•An open-source implementation of Fairea that has been made
publicly available [ 32] for ML software developers and re-
searchers to evaluating their bias mitigation methods.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides
the current state of fairness research. Section 3 introduces the pre-
liminaries. Section 4 introduces our approach. The experimental
design is described in Section 5. Experiments and results are pre-
sented in Section 6. Section 7 concludes.
2 CURRENT STATE OF FAIRNESS RESEARCH
This section introduces the progress of fairness research in software
engineering (in Section 2.1), the existing studies on the fairness-
accuracy trade-offs in bias mitigation methods and how the effec-
tiveness and trade-offs are evaluated in the literature (in Section 2.2).
For a more intuitive overview, Table 2 summarises the related
works we introduce. The top rows show the research in the software
engineering domain. The remaining rows are about the research
on fairness-accuracy trade-off in other domains.
2.1 Software Engineering for ML Fairness
Fairness is an important non-functional testing property of ML
software [ 66]. The testing and improvement of fairness has been
regarded as a critical part in the life cycle of software develop-
ment [18].
Brun and Meliou [ 10] published a vision paper on the fairness of
ML software (where they call this software fairness). They stated
that ensuring software fairness is a software engineering problem,
which can be tackled from multiple directions, including require-
ments, architecture and design, testing, verification, and mainte-
nance. Harrison et al. [ 29] studied the perceived fairness of humans
in regards to ML models. Biswas and Hridesh [ 8] studied the fairnessof ML models on crowd-sourced platforms. Finkelstein et al. [ 25]
explored fairness in requirement analysis, and showed different
needs among customers.
Several techniques have been proposed to conduct fairness test-
ing. Themis [ 2,27] used random test generation techniques to
evaluate the degree of fairness. AEQUITAS [ 58] combined random
generation and local search to explore the presence of discrimina-
tory inputs. Aggarwal et al. [ 1] used symbolic execution and local
explainability to generate test inputs for fairness testing. Zhang
et al. [67] uses gradient computation and clustering to detect indi-
vidual discriminatory instances of DNN. Sun et al. [ 56] proposed
TransRepair combining mutation testing and metamorphic rela-
tion [ 54,63], which can be adopted to automatically test and repair
fairness bugs in machine translators.
The design of software can also support the reduction of bias.
For example, Tramer provided a framework for detecting fairness
bugs [ 57]. Burnett et al. [ 11] proposed GenderMag to identify gender
bias in interfaces and respective workflows. Chakraborty et al. [ 17]
explained the effect of bias on ML, and proposed two approaches
to combat this. Zhang and Harman [ 64] studied the influence of
enlarging feature set and training data set when building fair ML
models, and found that a richer feature set could effectively improve
ML fairness, which is also observed in the work of Biswas and
Hridesh later on [9].
Different from these existing research, Fairea applies mutation
on ML model behaviours to compose a baseline for evaluating bias
mitigation methods. Mutation analysis has been well studied in
traditional software engineering [ 34,49,65]. Recently, mutation
analysis has drawn attention and been proved to be effective in
automatically testing and improving ML software [ 33,45,56,66].
As far as we know, Fairea is the first mutation analysis approach
for fairness evaluation targeting ML software.
2.2 Fairness-Accuracy Trade-off
There have been numerous works studying the fairness-accuracy
trade-off of bias mitigation methods [ 35]. Kamishima et al. [ 40] pro-
posed a regularisation approach that adjusts the fairness-accuracy
trade-off based on parameter 𝜂. Larger values of 𝜂improve fairness,
but also cause a higher loss in accuracy. Berk et al. [ 5] normalised
the loss of accuracy to study the severity of the fairness-accuracy
trade-off. They call the decrease of accuracy brought by bias miti-
gation “Price of Fairness”. Corbett-Davies et al. [ 22] analysed the
trade-off of public safety and racial disparities. Similar to Berk et
al. [5], they showed that trade-offs can be very common in practice.
Kamiran and Calders [ 36] gave a theoretical analysis of the trade-
off. A classifier achieves an optimal trade-off if it is not dominated
by another classifier (i.e., with larger accuracy and less bias).
To compare the fairness-accuracy trade-off achieved by bias
mitigation methods, practitioners either observe the fairness and
accuracy changes in separate graphs, or visualise them in a 2-
dimensional graph (one dimension is accuracy, the other dimen-
sion is fairness) [ 12,14–16,24,36,37,39,41,42,51,60]. The pro-
posed mitigation methods are often compared with previous meth-
ods [ 16,17,37–41,51,61,69], different configurations [ 12,14,24,38–
40], the original non-optimised classifier [ 12,15,36,61,62], or a
classifier trained without using protected attributes [ 12,15,36,69].Fairea Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA

In all of these works, the loss of accuracy and improvement
of fairness are measured and visualised separately. It is unclear
whether the improved fairness is simply the consequence of the
loss in accuracy. There is no unified baseline or quantitative mea-
surement to evaluate and compare the fairness-accuracy trade-off
throughout different studies.
Fairea aims to provide a unified standard to evaluate bias mitiga-
tion methods. The baseline Fairea provides enables developers to
classify the fairness-accuracy trade-offs of a bias mitigation method
into good or poor. The quantitative measurement Fairea provides
enables developers to compare different mitigation methods in a
more fine-grained way, and help tune fairness penalty parameters.
3 PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we introduce two widely-used metrics to define and
measure fairness for binary classification problems in Section 3.1,
and the widely-studied bias mitigation methods in Section 3.2.
3.1 Fairness Metrics
Fairness metrics are designed to define and quantitatively measure
ML fairness. There are two primary types of fairness as indicated by
Speicher et al. [ 55]: individual fairness and group fairness. Individualfairness is satisfied when similar individuals (according to a distance
function) receive the same prediction [ 23].Group fairness requires
that the predictive performance of a classification model is equal
across different groups [ 21], which are divided by the values of
protected attributes (i.e., race, age, sex). Groups are either privileged
(more likely to get an advantageous outcome), or unprivileged (more
likely to get a disadvantageous outcome).
In this paper, we adopt two group fairness metrics widely-studied
in the literature: Statistical Parity Difference, and Average Odds
Difference. We choose group fairness metrics for two reasons. First,
these metrics are widely adopted in the literature [ 17,21,22,40];
second, most mitigation methods are designed to optimise group
fairness.
In the following, we use ˆ𝑦to denote the predictions of a classifica-
tion model. We use 𝐷to denote a group (privileged or unprivileged).
We use𝑃𝑟to denote probability.
The Statistical Parity Difference (SPD) is a fairness metric re-
quiring that decisions are made independently of protected at-
tributes [ 60]. Positive and negative classifications for each demo-
graphic group should be identical over the whole population [23]:
𝑆𝑃𝐷 =𝑃𝑟(ˆ𝑦=1|𝐷=𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑔𝑒𝑑)
−𝑃𝑟(ˆ𝑦=1|𝐷=𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑔𝑒𝑑)(1)Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Max Hort, Jie M. Zhang, Federica Sarro, and Mark Harman
The Average Odds Difference (AOD) is a group fairness metric
that averages the differences in True Positive Rate (TPR) and False
Positive Rate (FPR) among privileged and unprivileged groups [ 28]:
𝐴𝑂𝐷 =1
2((𝐹𝑃𝑅𝐷=𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑔𝑒𝑑−𝐹𝑃𝑅𝐷=𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑔𝑒𝑑)
+(𝑇𝑃𝑅𝐷=𝑢𝑛𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑔𝑒𝑑−𝑇𝑃𝑅𝐷=𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑔𝑒𝑑))(2)
Following previous work [ 17], we are interested in the absolute
values of these metrics, thus a minimal value of zero indicates no
bias detected by the corresponding metric. Larger metric values
correspond to a higher bias.
3.2 Bias Mitigation Methods
In order to improve machine learning fairness, researchers have
proposed three primary types of bias mitigation methods: pre-
processing, in-processing and post-processing [26] methods.
3.2.1 Pre-Processing. Pre-processing methods aim at processing
the training data to reduce bias in the data.
Reweighing (RW) is a pre-processing method that applies weights
to different groups in the training data to achieve fairness [ 12,36].
Optimised Pre-processing (OP) is a method to learn probabilistic
transformations to edit labels and features of the dataset [ 15]. Learn-
ing Fair Representations (LFR) encodes data into an intermediate
representation with the aim of obfuscating protected attribute infor-
mation, while minimising the overall information disruption [ 61].
Other pre-processing approaches that have been proposed include
the removal of data points [ 17,69], and editing values of non-
protected features [24].
3.2.2 In-processing. In-processing methods aim to mitigate bias
during training by directly optimising algorithms.
Adversarial Debiasing (AD) is a technique that trains a classifier
while simultaneously minimising the ability to predict protected
attributes [ 62]. Prejudice Remover (PR) learns a classifier with a
regularisation term to optimise fairness [ 40]. A fair classifier, in
regards to gerrymandering, is proposed by Kearns et al. [ 41]. This
approach applies a two-player game between a Learner and Au-
ditor to adjust subgroups. Celis et al. [ 16] introduced a meta algo-
rithm that creates an optimised classifier for a given input fairness
metric. Other in-processing approaches include training process
fairness constraints [ 5,13], adaptation of split rule for decision
trees [ 37], decision boundary (un)fairness [ 60], and latent-unbiased
variables [14].
3.2.3 Post-processing. Post-processing methods change the predic-
tion outcomes of a model to mitigate bias after the model has been
trained.
Reject Option based Classification (ROC) exploits predictions
with high uncertainty [ 38]. In particular, favourable outcomes are
assigned to unprivileged groups and unfavourable outcomes to priv-
ileged groups. Post-processing can also be applied in regards to the
Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD) [ 28,51]. Two post-processing
methods that optimise for EOD, are Equalised Odds (EO) [ 28,51] and
Calibrated Equalised Odds [ 51]. Other post-processing approaches
include the modification of the probability of positive decisions for
Naive Bayes (NB) [ 14], leaf relabelling for Decision Trees (DT) [ 37],
and further investigation of uncertain labels [39].

points obtained by model behaviour mutation. A bias miti-
gation method 𝐵𝑀is effective if it exhibits a better trade-off
than the Fairea baseline (i.e., if it is above the red line).
4 THE FAIREA APPROACH
There are three primary steps in Fairea to benchmarking and quan-
titatively evaluating bias mitigation methods.
Step1: Baseline Creation with Model Behaviour Mutation . First,
Fairea builds the baseline by simulating the behaviours of a se-
ries of naive bias mitigation models. Fairea does this via model
behaviour mutation. The accuracy and fairness of these simulated
models, together with the original classification model, are adopted
to construct the fairness-accuracy trade-off baseline.
Step2: Bias mitigation effectiveness region division . Second, Fairea
maps the effectiveness of a bias mitigation method into five mit-
igation regions with the Fairea baseline constructed in the first
step. The division of such regions helps to classify bias mitigation
effectiveness into different levels, providing an intuitive overview
of the changes in accuracy and fairness of a mitigation method.
Step3: Quantitative Evaluation of Trade-off Effectiveness . Third,
Fairea quantifies the effectiveness of fairness-accuracy trade-off
by measuring the gap between its effectiveness and the Fairea
baseline. This step focuses on the bias mitigation methods that
improve fairness but decrease accuracy, and enables the quantitative
comparison among their trade-offs.
The details for each step are explained below.
4.1 Baseline Creation
When presenting the fairness and accuracy of a bias mitigation
method in a two-dimensional coordinate system, the baseline that
Fairea provides can be viewed as a line, as shown by Figure 1. The
line is constructed by connecting the fairness-accuracy points of
the original model (i.e., the model obtained by using the original
classifier without applying any mitigation method) and a series of
naive mitigation models constructed by model behaviour mutation.
In the following, we explain how we obtain these points.
Trade-off points Collection: The starting trade-off point is based
on the accuracy and fairness of the original model (i.e., the model
without applying any bias mitigation method), as shown by point
𝐹𝑂𝑀in Figure 1. The remaining points are based on the accuracy
and fairness of a series of pseudo models whose behaviours are mu-
tated from the original model. The hypothesis is that these modelsFairea Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA
could improve the fairness of the original model in a naive way:
by “blindly” sacrificing its accuracy with model behaviour muta-
tion. For example, when Fairea mutates the original model into
a random guessing model, the fairness will be greatly improved
(because the predictive performance are equally worse among dif-
ferent protected groups), yet the accuracy is largely sacrificed. The
fairness-accuracy trade-offs of such mutated models are expected
to be surpassed by any reasonable bias mitigation methods. This hy-
pothesis holds unless the original model performs even worse than
a random guess model. Moreover, the bias measured by fairness
metrics should monotonically decrease with an increased mutation
degree. As far as we know, widely-adopted fairness metrics such as
SPD, AOD, and EOD all satisfy this condition.
Mutation Degree :To obtain mutated model behaviours, we copy
the original model predictions, then mutate the predictions made
by this model (i.e., instead of returning the original predicted label,
a random subset of the predictions is replaced by other labels). We
consider different mutation degrees (i.e., the fraction of predictions
to mutate) from 10% to 100%, with a step-size of 10%. For example,
when the mutation degree is 10%, we randomly choose 10% of the
predictions made by the original model to mutate.
Mutation Strategy :There are different mutation strategies we
can choose to mutate the prediction behaviours, such as random
mutation or mutating all the chosen predictions into the same label.
In this paper, we choose the second strategy following the zero-
normalisation principle introduced by Speicher et al. [ 55], which
states that fairness metrics are minimised when each individual
receives the same label. For an n-class classification problem, there
are𝑛labels that one can choose to conduct mutation, therefore
𝑛mutation strategies are possible, one for each label. We choose
the label that will yield the highest accuracy when 100% of the
predictions are mutated, in order to provide a tighter trade-off
baseline. We explore the influence of different mutation strategies
in RQ4 (see more details in Section 6.4).
Example: Table 2 illustrates an example of the mutation process
and its corresponding fairness-accuracy trade-off for binary classi-
fication. There are 10 instances in this example (ID from 1 to 10)
belonging to two groups ( 𝑔1and𝑔2). The column “Bias” shows
the absolute False Positive Rate (FPR) difference between group
𝑔1and𝑔2. A larger absolute FPR difference indicates more bias in
the model towards the two groups. The original model achieves an
accuracy of 0.80, with a bias of 0.5. When the mutation degree is
40%3, the accuracy is reduced to 0.6, the fairness is improved, with
a bias of 0.17. Finally, mutating 100% of the labels achieves the best
fairness with a bias of 0.0, but also leads to a low accuracy of 0.50.
Baseline Construction: As shown by Table 2, each mutation de-
gree corresponds to one mutated model, whose accuracy and fair-
ness will form a point for constructing the baseline of Fairea . For
example, in Figure 1, 𝐹10,𝐹20,𝐹30, ...,𝐹100illustrate the fairness
and accuracy of mutated models with mutation degree of 10%, 20%,
..., 100%, respectively. These points, together with the initial fair-
ness and accuracy of the original model, are connected to form
the baseline of Fairea . The shape of the baseline is not necessarily
linear. Different fairness metrics may have different baseline shapes.
3In this example, mutating the predictions to label 1 and 0 have equal effects on the
baseline strictness. We thus demonstrate only the results of mutating the predictions
into 1.Table 2: An example of the mutation procedure in Fairea .
Bias is represented by the absolute False Positive Rate dif-
ference (𝐵𝑖𝑎𝑠). From the table, bias can be reduced by sim-
ply “sacrificising” accuracy through mutating model predic-
tions.

created following the procedure we introduced in Section 4.1
Both accuracy and bias values are re-scaled to a range between 0
and 14for ease of presentation, which does not affect the relative
comparison results among different bias mitigation methods.
4.2 Bias Mitigation Outcome Categorisation
After obtaining a baseline, Fairea categorises the bias mitigation
method’s effectiveness into several regions, with different regions
representing different categories of bias mitigation effectiveness.
As shown by Figure 2, there are five mitigation regions. If a
bias mitigation method improves the accuracy and reduces the
bias of the original model, it belongs to the win-win region. This
win-win region is challenging to achieve, but is still possible [ 59].
A bias mitigation method falls in the lose-lose region if it reduces
the accuracy but at the same time increases the bias of the original
model (i.e., it produces worse results for both measures). If a bias
mitigation improves accuracy but introduces more bias it falls in
theinverted trade-off region. The trade-off region means that a bias
mitigation method reduces bias but decreases accuracy. There are
two types of trade-off regions: the good trade-off region indicates
that the bias mitigation method achieves better trade-off than the
baseline of Fairea ; otherwise, it belongs to the poor trade-off region.
This five-region categorisation of Fairea helps provide an overview
of the overall effectiveness of a bias mitigation method. In the follow-
ing, we introduce how Fairea quantitatively measures the goodness
of fairness-accuracy trade-off.

theFairea baseline.
4.3 Trade-off Quantitative Evaluation
The win-win ,lose-lose , and poor trade-off regions provide suffi-
ciently clear signals on the effectiveness of the bias mitigation
method. Thus, in this section, we focus on providing a quantitative
measurement on the trade-off goodness of bias mitigation meth-
ods that fall into the good trade-off region, to facilitate a more
fine-grained comparison for different bias mitigation methods.
Fairea measures the goodness of such a trade-off by calculat-
ing the area encompassed by a mitigation method and the Fairea
baseline. Figure 3 illustrates the area obtained by connecting the
bias mitigation trade-off point to the Fairea baseline, vertically and
horizontally. The vertical line and horizontal line, together with
theFairea baseline, form a closed area. For example, for the case in
Figure 3, the closed area is shown by the filled blue area, which is
formed by five points: 𝐵𝑀,𝐵𝑀′,𝐵𝑀′′,𝐹10,and𝐹20.
When comparing the area of two bias mitigation methods, the
method with a larger area is regarded to have a better fairness-
accuracy trade-off. Using the area as a trade-off measurement, in-
stead of other criterion such as the distance to the baseline, ensures
a reasonable comparison when the baseline is curved.
5 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
In this section, we describe the design of the experiments we carry
out to evaluate Fairea . We first introduce the research questions,
then introduce the subjects and the experimental procedure. The
implementation code and the results are available at our home-
page [32] to support reproducibility and future studies.
5.1 Research Questions
Our evaluation answers the following research questions:
RQ1: Which mitigation regions do the existing bias mitiga-
tion methods fall into according to Fairea ?
This research question evaluates the overall performance of state-of-
the-art bias mitigation methods by checking how they are matched
into the five mitigation regions shown by Figure 2, according to
Fairea . To answer this question, we analyse the effectiveness of 12
popular state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods when used with
three classification models, by mapping their accuracy-bias trade-
off into mitigation regions as illustrated in Figure 2. We show theproportion of bias mitigation cases that fall into each mitigation
region.
RQ2. What fairness-accuracy trade-off do state-of-the-art
bias mitigation methods achieve based on Fairea ?
This research question compares the methods that fall into the good
trade-off region with the quantitative measurement Fairea provides.
To answer this question, we calculate the area for the target method
under each mitigation task (with different ML models, datasets,
and fairness metrics). This allows us to quantitatively compare the
methods and determine which bias mitigation method achieves the
best fairness-accuracy trade-off under each task.
RQ3. Can Fairea be used to tune trade-off parameters for in-
processing bias mitigation methods?
For in-processing methods, there are usually trade-off parameters
for controlling the degree of bias mitigation. A larger trade-off pa-
rameter mitigates more bias, thus may sacrifice more accuracy. The
quantitatively measurement of Fairea naturally enables automatic
tuning of such parameters for the purpose of achieving the best
trade-off. To answer the question, we investigate the in-processing
methods (Prejudice Remover [ 40] with fairness trade-off parameter
𝜂, and Adversarial Debiasing [ 62] with the𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑎𝑟𝑦 _𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 ),
then check whether our measurement helps to easily spot parame-
ters that yield good fairness-accuracy trade-off.
RQ4. How does the mutation strategy influence Fairea ?
As explained in Section 4, different mutation strategies can be used
to build Fairea . This question evaluates the difference among muta-
tion strategies in providing the baseline. To answer this question,
we compare the baselines created by the different strategies, to
motivate the choice of the most suitable mutation strategy.
5.2 Datasets
We perform our experiments on the three5mostly widely-studied,
real-world datasets in the fairness literature: the Adult, German,
and COMPAS datasets.
TheAdult Census Income (Adult) [44] contains financial and
demographic information about individuals from the 1994 U.S. cen-
sus. A classification is made to determine whether individuals have
an income above 50 thousand dollars a year.
TheCOMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling
for Alternative Sanctions) [ 52] dataset contains criminal history
and demographic information of criminal offenders in Broward
County, Florida. Each individual is assigned with a recidivism label,
indicating whether they were caught re-offending within two years.
TheGerman Credit Data (German) [30] dataset contains credit
information of 1,000 people with a classification of good or bad
credit risk. Based on the given features, the protected attribute sex
can be derived.
These datasets are the most widely-explored in the fairness lit-
erature. For example, Galhotra et al. [ 27] used two datasets: Adult
and German; Chakraborty et al. [18] used the same three datasets.
Table 3 provides more information about these three datasets.
This includes the size of the dataset (Column “Size”), the number of
attributes (Column “Attri.”), the favourable label, and the majority
label. For each dataset, we present the protected attributes that are
5The number of datasets we used align with the fairness literature. According to our
collection, 90% of fairness papers use no more than three datasets in their evaluation.Fairea Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA

5.3 Bias Mitigation Methods
We explore all the three types of bias mitigation methods during
our evaluation (see more details in Section 3.2). Under each type,
we choose widely-studied methods, which have been implemented
in the IBM AIF360 library:
•Pre-processing : Optimised Pre-processing (OP), Learning
Fair Representations (LFR), Reweighing (RW);
•In-processing : Prejudice Remover (PR), Adversarial Debi-
asing (AD);
•Post-processing : Reject Option Classification (ROC), Cali-
brated Equalised Odds (CO), Equalised odds (EO).
In AIF360, ROC and CO are implemented with three different
fairness metrics to guide the bias mitigation process. ROC offers a
choice between SPD, AOD, and EOD; CO offers a choice between
False Negative rate (FNR), False Positive Rate (FPR), and a weighted
metric to combine both. We implemented and evaluated every of
the three methods for ROC and CO. All together, we study 12 bias
mitigation methods.
5.4 Experimental Configuration
Pre-processing and post-processing methods are model indepen-
dent. We implement them using three traditional classification
models, which have been widely adopted in previous works that
study fairness: Logistic Regression (LR) [ 17,24,38–40,60], Decision
Tree (DT) [ 38,39], and Support Vector Machine (SVM) [ 24,39,60].
As in previous work [ 17,38,39], we use the default configuration
for each classifier, as provided by Scipy.6
The two in-processing methods studied in this paper have their
own model with different trade-off parameters. In this case, to build
Fairea , when getting the original model, we turn off the trade-off
parameters (so that such a model does not use any bias mitigation
function); when evaluating the effectiveness of a in-process method
in RQ1 and RQ2, we use its default trade-off parameter. In RQ3,
we explore the trade-off performance of different parameters and
investigate whether Fairea ’s quantitative measurement helps to
tune the parameters to get the best trade-off.
We apply each of the bias mitigation methods to the three datasets
and their protected attributes, with three ML models and two fair-
ness metrics. Thus, for each mitigation method, it will be evaluated
per(dataset, protected attribute, ML model, fairness metric) combina-
tion. We call such as a combination a mitigation task .
Each optimisation process is repeated 50 times, each time with
a random re-spilt of the data based on a fixed train-test split ratio
6https://www.scipy.org/.7:3. We use the mean value of these multiple runs to represent
the method’s average performance, as a common practice in the
fairness literature [ 8,16]. We treat each single run as an individual
mitigation case , and present the proportion of cases that fall into
each bias mitigation region for a bias mitigation method (to answer
RQ1). The baseline is also obtained by repeating the label model
behaviour mutation procedure 50 times for each mutation degree
(10%, 20%, ..., 100%).
The source code containing the implementation of Fairea and
the implementation/configuration of each bias mitigation method,
as well as the results, are available in our project repository [32].
5.5 Threats to Validity
The primary threat to internal validity lies in the implementa-
tion of Fairea . To reduce this threat, the authors independently
reviewed the implementation code. The adoption of IBM AIF360
framework [ 4], a widely adopted fairness tool in software fair-
ness [ 8,17], also reduces such threat. The threats to external validity
lie primarily with the subjects investigated. To reduce this threat,
we use the three most widely adopted datasets in fairness research.
We study 12 bias mitigation methods, with different classification
models, to obtain more generalised conclusions. Moreover, we make
our scripts and data publicly available, to allow for reproductions,
replications and its adoption in future bias mitigation studies [ 32].
6 EMPIRICAL STUDY RESULTS
This section presents the results of our experiments to answer the
research questions explained in Section 5.1.
6.1 RQ1: Mitigation Region Distribution
The first research question checks the mitigation region distribution
of the existing bias mitigation methods. We apply bias mitigation
methods to the three datasets to evaluate their region distribution
(Section 4) according to the baseline provided by Fairea .
We apply each pre- and post-processing bias mitigation method
on three classification models (LR, DT, SVM) used for five bias
mitigation tasks (i.e., Adult-sex ,Adult-race ,COMPAS-sex ,COMPAS-
race,German-sex ). Each task is repeated for 50 times with differ-
ent training-test splits. DT achieves a prediction accuracy below
the majority class for the German dataset. Therefore, it does not
meet our baseline requirement (as introduced in Section 4.1) and
is disregarded in the subsequent experiments. Thus, for each bias
mitigation method, there are 5*3*50-50 = 700 evaluations.
For each in-processing method, as we introduced in Section 5.4,
we build the baseline upon an original model without applying bias
mitigation (with the trade-off parameter set to 0). For Prejudice
Remover, its accuracy on the COMPAS/German dataset is too low
to be reduced by mutation, we thus only present its results on the
Adult dataset. Therefore, our experiment conducts 50 evaluates on
Prejudice Remover, and 250 evaluations on Adversarial Debiasing.
We then calculate the percentage of evaluations that fall into
each region. We use the proportion as a high-level indication of the
bias mitigation performance of each method.
6.1.1 Overall results. Table 4 shows the results of the region clas-
sification of bias mitigation methods. Each row represents a bias
mitigation method. Each cell contains a percentage of scenariosConference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Max Hort, Jie M. Zhang, Federica Sarro, and Mark Harman
Table 4: RQ1: Proportion of mitigation cases that fall into each mitigation region. We observe that half of the existing bias
mitigation methods either decrease accuracy and increase bias ( lose-lose ) of the original model, or have a worse trade-off than
theFairea baseline ( poor trade-off ).

that fall into corresponding regions for a mitigation method. The
last row shows the overall ratios for each mitigation region.
We make the following primary observations from Table 4. First ,
to our surprise, a large proportion of bias mitigation performance
falls into the lose-lose trade-off region. For example, for the 𝐶𝑂𝑓𝑛𝑟
post-processing method, the proportion is as high as 52% for AOD.
The mean value of the lose-lose proportion is 33% for SPD and
36% for AOD, which means that those bias mitigation methods
perform worse than the original model. For SPD, 49% of the bias
mitigation methods perform worse than Fairea while 43% perform
better. Similarly, 51% of the bias mitigation methods achieve worse
trade-offs than Fairea for AOD, while being better among 42% of
the evaluations.
One possible reason for this is that mitigation methods are often
designed to optimise one fairness metric, but such kind of one-target
optimisation usually affects other fairness metrics [ 20,43]. For
example,𝐶𝑂𝑓𝑛𝑟and𝐶𝑂𝑓𝑝𝑟are designed to optimise the difference
of false negative/positive rate between privileged and unprivileged
groups. Their lose-lose percentages measured by SPD and AOD
are over 50%. Nevertheless, we observe that when using the same
metric to optimise and measure mitigation performance, the lose-
losepercentages are still high (i.e., 19% for 𝑅𝑂𝐶𝑆𝑃𝐷 measured by
SPD, and 26% for 𝑅𝑂𝐶𝐴𝑂𝐷 measured by AOD).
Second , a notable proportion of evaluations fall into the poor
trade-off region (16% for SPD and 15% for AOD). While this means
that they achieve more fairness than the original model, their
fairness-accuracy trade-off is worse than the baseline of Fairea .
We also observe a small ratio of evaluations falling into the
win-win region (10%) or inverted trade-off region (7%). A larger pro-
portion of pre-processing methods belong to the win-win region,
in comparison to in- and post-processing methods. This may indi-
cate that optimising training data has more promises in providing
solutions to optimise both accuracy and fairness.
Third , pre-processing methods are more likely to fall into the
win-win region with both accuracy and fairness being improved.
For example, for SPD, the average proportion of pre-processing
methods that fall into the win-win region is 18%, which is only 7%Table 5: RQ1: Averaged proportion of mitigation cases that
fall into each mitigation region organised by different ML
models (top three rows) and datasets (bottom five rows). The
differences across models and datasets indicate that the ef-
fectiveness of the methods we studied are model and dataset
dependent.

DT 43% 8% 12% 24% 12%

COMPAS - Race 26% 8% 15% 34% 16%
German - Sex 34% 27% 9% 19% 12%
for post-processing methods. This suggests that, if one pursues
improving both accuracy and fairness, it might be favourable to
pre-process the training data and prevent the bias from reaching
the model, than to mitigate the bias after the model has learned the
bias from the data.
6.1.2 Comparison among different models and datasets. We further
analyse the region distribution based on ML models (for pre- and
post-processing methods) and datasets. The purpose is to investi-
gate whether the performance of different bias mitigation methods
are influenced by ML models or datasets.
Table 5 shows the results. Among the three classification models,
we observe that different models have different results, which indi-
cates that the effectiveness of pre- and post-processing methods are
model dependent. Overall, LR and SVM have a better effectiveness
(higher percentage of good trade-offs ) than DT.
Among different datasets and protected attributes, the differences
are also notable. We observe that for the COMPAS dataset, there are
more scenarios in the win-win region and fewer scenarios in the
lose-lose region. We suspect that this is because COMPAS datasetFairea Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA

trade-off region, a trade-off measurement value provided by Fairea is given; for other regions the region type is displayed.
The values in bold indicate the best mitigation method for each mitigation task. From this table, we observe that Fairea pro-
vides distinguishable measurements for trade-off comparison, and helps to detect the best mitigation method under each bias
mitigation task.

is more balanced than Adult and German (54% of majority labels
v.s. 75% and 70% majority labels according to Table 3).
To conclude, for RQ1, we have the following answer:
Answer to RQ1: Surprisingly, approximately 50% of the
bias mitigation scenarios have a poor mitigation effective-
ness, with 34% of them decreasing accuracy and increasing
bias ( lose-lose ), and 15% of them exhibiting a poor trade-off
according to Fairea .
6.2 RQ2: Quantitative Measurement for
Fairness-accuracy Trade-off
To answer RQ2, we present the quantitative measurement results of
the fairness-accuracy trade-off achieved by different bias mitigation
methods with Fairea . We quantify results that fall into the good
trade-off region, as the other regions are either strictly dominating
the original model ( win-win ), dominated by the Fairea baseline
(lose-lose andpoor trade-off , or do not improve fairness ( inverted ).
We use the arithmetic mean results of the 50 runs to indicate the
average level of mitigation effectiveness.
Table 6 shows the results for pre- and post-processing bias mit-
igation methods. The values in bold indicate the best mitigation
method for each mitigation task (i.e., the combination of dataset,
protected attribute, ML model, and fairness metric). From the table,
the quantitative trade-off measurement Fairea provides helps to
compare different the trade-offs among different mitigation method,
and to choose the best one under each mitigation task.The same as RQ1, we observe that the trade-offs of bias mitigation
methods are highly dataset dependent. For example, the best trade-
off on the Adult dataset is achieved by EO (highest scores for both
AOD and SPD). The best trade-off on German is achieved by 𝐶𝑂𝑓𝑝𝑟.
We also explore whether the protected attribute considered under
each dataset impacts the performance of bias mitigation methods.
From Table 6, for the same dataset, different protected attributes
have very similar patterns. Specifically, in 85% (102/120) of the
cases, bias mitigation methods are classified into the same miti-
gation region with different protected attributes. This suggests,
that the protected attribute has a limited impact on the trade-off
performance of bias mitigation methods.

methods.

Due to the different characteristics of in-processing methods, we
provide their quantitative results separately in Table 7. Prejudice
Remover is not applicable to the COMPAS and German dataset
(see Section 6.1.1 for more details) so we mark the results as “NA”.
Adversarial Debiasing is applicable for all three datasets, however
only achieves good trade-offs on the Adult dataset for SPD. All the
other trade-offs are in the lose-lose region. However, when compar-
ing the two in-processing methods on Adult dataset measured byConference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Max Hort, Jie M. Zhang, Federica Sarro, and Mark Harman
SPD, Adversarial Debiasing has a better trade-off than Prejudice
Remover.
These observations lead to the following answer to RQ2:
Answer to RQ2: The quantitative measurement of Fairea al-
lows us to determine and compare fairness-accuracy trade-
offs achieved by different bias mitigation methods. For
example, Fairea measures that the EO method achieves a
71.4% better trade-off than 𝐶𝑂𝑓𝑛𝑟(i.e., 0.024 vs. 0.014) for
the case LR-Adult-Sex under Statistical Parity Difference.
Different datasets have different bias mitigation methods
that achieve the best trade-off (i.e., EO for Adult; 𝐶𝑂𝑓𝑝𝑟
for German).
6.3 RQ3: Parameter Tuning
In RQ3, we investigate the effectiveness of Fairea in evaluating the
parameter tuning for in-processing methods. For this purpose, we
apply Fairea on the original model of Prejudice Remover with 𝜂=0,
and Adversarial Debiasing with an 𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑎𝑟𝑦 _𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 =0.
As in previous experiments, we perform 50 train-test splits for
all numerical values of 𝜂between 1-100 for PR, with a step size of
1. We evaluate 𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑎𝑟𝑦 _𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠 in a range of 0.05-1, with a
step size of 0.05. Due to limited space, we choose the Adult dataset
as an example to illustrate experiments on parameter tuning. Full
results are available in our project repository [32].
We first plot the accuracy and fairness achieved by each param-
eter setting, shown in Figure 4. For both methods, all parameter
settings for SPD achieves better trade-off than the original model.
However, the bias mitigation effectiveness for AOD is much worse.
Although the different parameters all belong to the good trade-
off region, it is difficult to determine which parameter setting
achieves the best fairness-accuracy trade-off. We therefore inves-
tigate whether our quantitative measurement in Fairea helps spot
the parameter that achieves the best trade-off.
Figure 5 shows these results. Sub-Figures 5 (a) and (b) show the
trade-off measurement results provided by Fairea with different
trade-off parameters. The remaining sub-figures show the accuracy
and fairness changes separately without Fairea .
From sub-Figure 5.(a) and sub-Figure 5.(b), we observe that, when
the trade-off parameter changes, our trade-off measurement first
increases, then decreases, with a turning point indicating the pa-
rameter with the best trade-off. However, from the remaining sub-
figures, without the support from Fairea , it is difficult to choose a
parameter with accuracy and fairness changing at the same time.
Of course, in practice, the desired trade-offs may depend on the
application scenario and the specific requirement. Some applica-
tions may demand a higher degree of fairness, with the capability
of enduring more accuracy loss. However, the quantitative mea-
surement in Fairea provides an engineering solution for finding the
best trade-off as a reference for developers.

Figure 4: RQ3: Accuracy and fairness achieved by Prejudice
Remover (sub-figure a and b), and Adversarial Debiasing
(sub-figure c and d) with different parameters on Adult-sex.
Each green point represents a trade-off parameter, the blue
line represents the Fairea baseline.
Answer to RQ3: Our trade-off measurement helps to
quantify the fairness-accuracy trade-offs achieved by in-
processing methods with different trade-off parameter set-
tings, and to identify parameters that achieve the best
fairness-accuracy trade-offs.
6.4 RQ4: Influence of Mutation Strategies
This research question is designed to investigate how the muta-
tion strategy for simulating naive mitigation methods affects the
construction of the Fairea baseline. We show and compare three
different mutation strategies: replace labels with “0”, replace labels
with “1”, and replace labels at random.
Figure 6 shows the accuracy and fairness (SPD, AOD) of the three
mutation strategies. We analysed all three datasets, the conclusions
are identical, so we only present results for the Adult-sex task (full
results are available in our project repository [32]).
As can be seen, when we mutate the labels with the majority
class label ( 0in the case for Adult-sex), its baseline is on top of
the other two strategies. This means that overwriting with the
majority label provides a more strict baseline than the other two
strategies. Mutation with the minority class label ( 1in the case for
Adult-sex) instead leads to a baseline with lower accuracy on the
same level of fairness. Using such a baseline would provide weaker
conditions when checking the trade-off of bias mitigation methods.
Replacement with random labels leads to a baseline in-between the
other two strategies, but with 100% labels replaced, the fairness
values are not minimised at zero because of the imbalanced data
distribution.
In this paper, we adopted the strategy of mutating predictions
with the majority class label in the training data. Although this isFairea Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA

the most strict among the three strategies, it is still a naive bias
mitigation method achieved simply by label overwriting, which we
expect that a reasonably effective bias mitigation method should
outperform.
Answer to RQ4: Among the different mutation strategies
we explored, replacing labels with the majority class label
for a dataset leads to the strictest baseline.7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we proposed Fairea, a novel approach to evaluating
and quantitatively measuring the fairness-accuracy trade-off. There
are three primary questions that previous work could not answer
without Fairea: 1) The Fairea baseline tells whether a bias miti-
gation method trades accuracy for fairness (or even worse than
that). The qualitative approach used by previous work is not able
to differentiate “good trade-off” and “poor trade-off” like Fairea
does; 2) Fairea provides extra information for developers by telling
whether bias mitigation method A outperforms method B when
they both achieve a “good trade-off”; 3) Fairea helps to tune the
fairness mitigation parameter for in-processing methods.
We performed a large scale empirical study to evaluate our base-
line Fairea on three widely used datasets and 12 bias mitigation
methods. We found that half of the bias mitigation methods are not
able to achieve a reasonable bias mitigation effectiveness (either
achieving a worse trade-off than our baseline, or decreasing accu-
racy and increasing bias). In addition, few methods perform well on
all datasets and all models. These results show the limitations and
challenges of the existing bias mitigation methods, suggesting the
need for further research effort on improving ML software fairness.
In future, we plan to involve Fairea into the bias mitigation process
to guide mitigation optimisation and develop new bias mitigation
methods.
