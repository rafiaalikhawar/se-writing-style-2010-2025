Abstract —Website accessibility is essential for inclusiveness
and regulatory compliance. Although third-party advertisements
(ads) are a vital revenue source for free web services, they
introduce significant accessibility challenges. Leasing a website’s
space to ad-serving technologies like DoubleClick results in devel-
opers losing control over ad content accessibility. Even on highly
accessible websites, third-party ads can undermine adherence
to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). We conduct
the first-of-its-kind large-scale investigation of 430K website
elements, including nearly 100K ad elements, to understand
the accessibility of ads on websites. We seek to understand the
prevalence of inaccessible ads and their overall impact on the
accessibility of websites. Our findings show that 67% of websites
experience increased accessibility violations due to ads, with
common violations including Focus Visible (WCAG 2.4.7), and
On Input (WCAG 3.2.2). Popular ad-serving technologies like
Taboola, DoubleClick, and RevContent often serve ads that fail
to comply with WCAG standards. Even when ads are WCAG
compliant, 27% of them have alternative text in ad images that
misrepresents information, potentially deceiving users. Manual
inspection of a sample of these misleading ads revealed that
user-identifiable data is collected on 94% of websites through
interactions, such as hovering or pressing enter. Since users
with disabilities often rely on tools like screen readers that
require hover events to access website content, they have no
choice but to compromise their privacy in order to navigate
website ads. Based on our findings, we further dissect the
root cause of these violations and provide design guidelines to
both website developers and ad-serving technologies to achieve
WCAG-compliant ad integration.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Approximately 15% of the global population has some
form of disability, and their access to the internet depends
largely on website accessibility. Many of these users rely
on assistive technologies like screen readers, which require
highly accessible websites ( e.g., properly labeled images) to
function effectively [1]. The Web Content Accessibility Guide-
lines (WCAG) [2], led by the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C), have driven efforts to improve website’s accessibility.
As a result, numerous tools and services now exist to test
and enhance website accessibility [3]–[6]. While website’s
accessibility is gradually improving due to these tools, the
accessibility of website advertisements (ads) remains largely
unexamined.
Website ads are the driving force behind the free and open
Internet [7]. Website developers integrate ads on their websites
by leasing space to ad-serving technologies ( e.g., Taboola[8]) that serve user-relevant ads when a visitor accesses the
site. Consequently, developers give up control over the ad
content served on their websites and whether it meets WCAG
accessibility guidelines.
Problem. Including ads on a website poses several challenges
in evaluating the website’s accessibility. First, popular website
accessibility tools, like Google Lighthouse [9], do not include
ads in their assessments, which overestimates accessibility in
evaluation reports. Second, due to the dynamic nature of ad
content, website developers cannot predict which ads will be
served to users or whether those ads will adhere to WCAG
guidelines. Even when a website developer makes the best
effort to ensure WCAG compliance, ads can significantly
deteriorate the overall accessibility of the website. Third,
inaccessible website ads prevent users with disabilities from
accessing a significant portion of the website. This is espe-
cially alarming when ads pose privacy and security risks [10]–
[14], as they are more likely to lead to fraud, phishing, and
scams. Fourth, blanket ad blocking harms the free internet and
causes fundamental equity issues by making ads completely
unreachable. Accessible ads not only encourage a free and
open internet but also equip users with disabilities with the
necessary context for safe and informed interaction with ads.
Prior-work. While website accessibility has been extensively
studied [15]–[22], to date, no comprehensive study has exam-
ined the accessibility of website ads at a large scale, leaving a
significant gap in our understanding of website accessibility
as a whole. Only three studies have examined digital ad
accessibility, focusing on small datasets of platform-specific
ads and solely on blind website users. He et al. [23] studied
only 500 ad screens within Android apps and introduced
a tool for detecting accessibility violations. Similarly, prior
work manually examined alt text on 67 websites [24] and
used a survey to understand screen reader users’ challenges
with website ads [25]. With the prevalence of website ads
and their potential safety risks, the impact of website ads on
accessibility remains an open yet important question.
Contributions. In this paper, we conduct the first-of-its-kind
large-scale, in-depth investigation of website ad accessibility
and its impact on overall website accessibility. We perform
an automated analysis of 430K website elements with nearly
100K website ad elements on the top 5K news and media web-
sites. We first seek to understand the prevalence of inaccessible
ads on the website and how they impact the overall accessibil-arXiv:2409.18590v1  [cs.SE]  27 Sep 2024(a) Control

ity of websites. We build an automated pipeline to rigorously
analyze the accessibility of website elements and the ads using
IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker and state-of-the-art
ad-blocker, uBlockOrigin. Among ads that adversely impact
a website’s accessibility, we analyze the accessibility viola-
tions in accordance with WCAG guidelines. Identifying such
violations provides key insights into commonly overlooked
accessibility guidelines in ads and determines whether these
violations are prevalent only in ads. To inform developers
about accessibility violations across different ad-serving tech-
nologies, we further analyze inaccessible ads with respect to
the technologies serving them.
Ads are historically more likely to lead to fraud, phishing,
and scams [13], [14]. Even when ads are accessible, we
investigate whether the provided accessible information truly
represents the content and intent of the ad. We utilize open-
source CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining) model
[26] to confirm whether the content of ad images aligns with
the provided alternative text for accessible ads. For instance,
users with visual impairments solely rely on alternate text to
access website content; false and misrepresented alternatives
can mislead such users into involuntary interaction with ads.
The onus for addressing inaccessible and misleading ads falls
on the website developer whose website is hosting such ads.
Findings. Our analysis reveals that 75% of websites have ads
that frequently fail to comply with WCAG guidelines. On
average, we observe 11 more accessibility violations due to
ads. We further categorize the most common WCAG guideline
violations found in ads to illustrate their potential impact
on individuals with disabilities. We identified 28 different
WCAG guideline violations in ad elements, with 7 of these
violations predominantly occurring in only ad elements. These
violations are related to missing captions, missing focus order,
and missing page language, all of which are critical in ensuring
smooth navigation on a website. Our analysis also identifies
the ad-serving technologies responsible for the majority of
these violations. We found that 52% of websites use one of
Google’s ad-serving technologies (e.g., DoubleClick), which
account for over 14K violations in their ad elements.
We show that the misrepresentation of data in alternate
texts compared to the actual image deceives users with visual
impairments and cognitive disabilities, making it difficult for
them to interpret the intent of the ads. We found that 27% of ad
images misrepresent their content and intent. Furthermore, our

manual inspection of ads from top-50 news websites reveals
that up to 94% of the ads collect trackable user identifiers upon
onmouseover ,onhover , and onclick events. These
events help assistive technologies identify website elements
that a user with disability desires to access. Thus, navigating
ads can compromise the privacy of assistive technology users.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
investigates the accessibility violations of website ads on a
large scale.

II. M OTIVATING EXAMPLE
This section presents a case study showing how some
ads on websites violate accessibility guidelines and affect
the overall website’s accessibility. Alaska’s News Source,
alaskasnewssource.com [27], provides local news,
weather updates, sports coverage, and community events for
the state of Alaska. It is ranked 14thin the top 5K in the news
and media category. In the stock Chrome browser, this website
shows numerous ads in ad slots—three at the top and one at
the bottom, as seen in Figure 1(a). The top slots are served
by Taboola [8] and the bottom by Google Ads [28].
Website accessibility without ads. In the first step, we gener-
ate the accessibility report for alaskasnewssource.com
by computing the violation count without including any ads.
We remove ads from the website to emulate the website de-
velopment stage, where website developers are unaware of the
precise ads that will be served by the ad-serving technologies.
This is a common practice employed by many website quality
and accessibility checkers like Google Lighthouse [9] that
do not include ads in their accessibility evaluations. We use
IBM’s accessibility checker chrome extension, a tool usedFig. 3: Overview of our methodology involving generating accessibility reports for each website with ( Rwith−ads) and without ads
(Rwithout −ads), then comparing them to isolate and analyze the accessibility violations caused by only ads ( Rads−only).
by over 20K developers [29], mainly because it evaluates
all website elements, including ad elements. To remove ads
from the website, we deploy the uBlock Origin’s Chrome
extension, which has over 700K users [30], to block all
ads on the website. As seen in Figure 1(b), all ads on
alaskasnewssource.com are removed, and the accessi-
bility checker reports 126 violations. For example, the element
in Listing 1 violates the WCAG 2.4.4 (Link Purpose) [31]
guideline because it lacks descriptive link text, label, or an
image with a text alternative. The guideline requires that links
must have a clear purpose that users can understand, especially
when the link is not accompanied by any other textual context.
This can be resolved by adding aria-label="Download
the Alaska’s News Source Streaming Apps" to
this tag by developer.

" class="link | text-reset d-block h-100 w-100">
Listing 1: Anchor tag missing descriptive text
Most accessibility violations can easily be addressed by the
developer with simple refactoring of the website’s code ( i.e.,
HTML, CSS, and JS).
Website accessibility with ads. Next, we compute accessi-
bility report for alaskasnewssource.com by computing
the violation count with ads, as displayed to the user. This
setting allows us to demonstrate the increase in the violations
attributed to ads on the website.
Figure 1(c) shows that ads appear on the website as they
did on a normal visit. The accessibility checker reports 279
violations, showing a 121.4% change in the violation count.
Given that the only difference between the two websites is
the presence of ads, it is reasonable to attribute the increase in
accessibility violations to the ads. We further examine specific
violations related to ads, particularly concerning the ad slots
Taboola serves.
Figure 2(a) shows violations identified by the accessibility
checker across three ad slots for Taboola (highlighted with ared circle around their title and short description). This vio-
lates the WCAG 2.1.1 (Keyboard) guideline [31] because the
element cannot be interacted with using a keyboard alone. All
ad images are designed with a link role , which does not
include a tabbable element. Thus, users who rely on keyboard
navigation cannot directly access these elements. Additionally,
most of these ad images do not include alternate text to make
them accessible for visually impaired users. We further test the
accessibility of these ads with Google’s Chrome V ox screen
reader [32]. V ox only announces image for Taboola
advertising unit on tab focus without reading the title
and short description of each ad. Figure 2(b) shows how the
website and ads appear to visually impaired users using screen
readers, leaving ads’ content mostly inaccessible except the
two vague alternate texts.
It is difficult for a website developer to anticipate and
address ad accessibility violations as these violations are
non-deterministic and occur after the deployment of the
website. In the case of alaskasnewssource.com , ads are
negatively impacting accessibility, which raises the concern of
whether such an effect is prevalent across all ads: (1) if yes,
then what kinds of violations do they cause? and (2) if not,
then does the accessible information in these ads adequately
represent their content? Similarly, it is useful to know which
ad-serving technologies are serving more inaccessible ads.
III. R ESEARCH QUESTIONS
Given the proliferation of ads on popular websites, their
impact on vulnerable users, and the gap in developers’ under-
standing of ad accessibility, we aim to answer the following
research questions:
1)RQ1: How do advertisements impact the accessibility
guideline violations of websites?
2)RQ2: What are the most common accessibility guideline
violations found in advertisements?
3)RQ3: Which ad-serving technologies frequently exhibit
accessibility violations in their served advertisements?Column Description Example

IV. M ETHODOLOGY
To address the research questions, we designed an au-
tomated pipeline to inspect websites, identify accessibility
violations in each element, extract violations specific to ad
elements, and categorize them based on WCAG guidelines [2].
Figure 3 illustrates the overview of the process used in our
empirical investigation, which is completely automated and
packaged into a single measurement tool.
A. Websites Visited
We visit the top 5K news and media category websites from
SimilarWeb [33], using a custom Selenium (version 4.11.2)
based automated website navigator running on Google Chrome
(version 120.0.6099.129). Prior literature has also focused on
this category of websites because they have the most ads
[23], [24], [34], offering the most breadth and coverage of
ads. For every website, we launch our automated website
navigator to first visit the website and then eventually trigger
the accessibility evaluation using the IBM accessibility tool, as
explained in Section IV-C. It takes approximately 30 seconds
for a website to fully load (until the onLoad event is fired),
on average, and an additional five minutes to ensure all ads
are loaded before applying the accessibility checks. We use a
stateless crawling process, with all cookies and local browser
states cleared between consecutive visits. This approach helps
ensure that the collected accessibility data accurately reflects
the current state of the website without being biased by
previous visits. We visited all 5K websites in North America.
We crawl each website twice to obtain two accessibility
evaluation reports for the same website:
1)Report (Rwith−ads): Accessibility report of the website
with ads.
2)Report (Rwithout −ads): Accessibility report of the web-
site without ads.
Report (Rwith−ads)contains the accessibility report for
all elements on the website, including ad elements.
Report (Rwithout −ads)contains the accessibility report for all
elements on the website, excluding ad elements. Finally, we
extract the Report (Ronly−ads)by differencing the Rwith−adsViolation Element WCAG Count

the ad elements only:
Rwith−ads| {z }
Website elements with Ads− Rwithout −ads| {z }
Website elements without Ads=Ronly−ads|{z }
Ad elements(1)
Why do we need this approach to find the accessibility of
ads? To date, there does not exist any tool that can identify and
isolate accessibility scores for ad elements alone. Ads can only
be evaluated post-deployment because, during the development
phase, ad-serving technology only requires reserved space on
the website. The actual ads only appear on the website based
on user client profiling and real-time advertiser bidding. We
opt to evaluate these ads post-deployment on the client side
to understand the true accessibility impact of ads, offering
insights for developers and ad-serving technologies.
B. Blocking Website Advertisements
To measure the website’s accessibility without ads, we aim
to load the website without any ads in our crawler, which
requires removing all ads before performing accessibility
evaluations. We leverage a widely used, advanced ad-blocking
tool called uBlock Origin [30] to remove ads from a website
before it completely loads in the browser. uBlock Origin relies
on a crowd-sourced filter list [35], [36], which are databases
of rules and patterns that identify and block resources from
commonly used ad-serving technologies. Almost all ad block-
ing tools [30], [37], [38] rely on the same filter lists and,
therefore, have more or less similar effectiveness in blocking
ads. Internally, when a user visits a website, the ad blocker
scans the page and its resources, comparing URLs and scriptsagainst its filter lists. If it detects elements associated with
ad-serving technology, it prevents these elements from being
loaded on the page. This can involve blocking requests to
known ad servers, hiding ad elements within the DOM, or
preventing ad scripts from executing. As a result, the ad
content is not displayed to the user, resulting in an ad-free
website, which we use to perform accessibility evaluations,
Rwithout −ads. Prior work [39] on the effectiveness of ad-
blocking tools has shown that uBlock Origin is the most
effective ad blocker.
C. Accessibility Evaluation
After the website loads, we automatically perform a rigorous
accessibility evaluation using the IBM Equal Access Acces-
sibility Checker [29], a Chrome extension. Initially, we use
Google’s Lighthouse [9], commonly used for quality checks
during development. However, tools like Lighthouse, Axe [40],
and Wave [41] exclude ad elements by default, leading to
inaccurate measurements for sites with ads. Thus, we use the
IBM checker to assess accessibility for all website elements,
including ads. Internally, IBM’s accessibility checker injects a
content script into the website to interact with the website’s
DOM. The content script scans the website’s DOM to identify
elements and runs a series of checks based on the following
predefined rules such as WCAG 2.1 [2]. The results are
intercepted by our automated website navigator and stored in
separate storage for downstream analysis.
Accessibility Report. Table I shows a sample accessibil-
ity evaluation report with a detailed analysis of violations,
including page title, URL, HTML element type, element
code, XPath, WCAG checkpoint, and violation level. Each
checkpoint corresponds to a specific WCAG criterion with a
description of the violation. The WCAG level indicates the
priority and severity of accessibility violations, categorized
into three levels:
•Level A: These guidelines are fundamental for all web-
sites. Non-compliance makes website content inaccessi-
ble to users with disabilities. For example, text alterna-
tives for non-text content (WCAG 1.1.1) are crucial for
users with visual impairments. Meeting Level A criteria
is a top priority.
•Level AA: These guidelines should be met by most
websites. Conformance to Level AA significantly im-
proves the accessibility of website content. For example,
ensuring that text and images of text have a contrast ratio
of at least 4.5:1 (WCAG 1.4.3) is crucial for users with
visual impairments, including those with color blindness.
•Level AAA: These guidelines represent the highest
website accessibility standards for full accessibility. For
example, sign language interpretation for pre-recorded
audio (WCAG 1.2.6) benefits deaf users. Level AAA
conformance is not mandatory for WCAG compliance as
it applies to specific content types. Note: These violations
require manual assessment and are excluded from this
analysis .0 100 200 300 400 50000.20.40.60.81

all the website elements, including ads, as illustrated in Figure
3➊-➍.Rwithout −adsrepresents the accessibility report of all
the website elements excluding ads, as illustrated in Figure 3
➊-➋. Finally, we automatically compare the two accessibility
reports by first matching website elements based on their code
and Xpath location, resulting in a list of website elements
that are not ads ( ➊and➋). We exclude these elements from
Rwith−ads, which results in an accessibility report of ads only,
Rads−only as illustrated in Figure 3 ➌-➍. We analyzed 430K
unique HTML elements with accessibility violations across
5k websites, of which 23.1% are ad elements. Computing
accessibility reports is time-consuming and resource-intensive
due to the extensive checks required on the rendered page,
styling, and HTML structure. It also cannot be deployed on
the cloud, as certain accessibility metrics can only be measured
when active display is available for UI rendering. Therefore,
analysis on the 5K website consumed more than 484 CPU
hours to generate accessibility reports spanning 20.6 GB. Table
II lists the number of website elements with violations that we
interacted with during this campaign. Specifically, it details the
ad elements with violations, categorizing them by the level and
criteria of violations.
V. R ESULTS
A. RQ1: Impact of Advertisements on Accessibility Violations
We first examine the impact of ads on the number of ac-
cessibility violations on websites. This analysis demonstrates
how third-party ad content can lower a website’s accessi-
bility, which has several downstream consequences, such asViolation in Ad elements ( Ronly−ads) Websites

potentially low search rankings on Google due to accessibility
violations [42] in addition to the fundamental inclusivity issues
for users with disabilities. Figure 4 presents the cumulative
distribution of websites and their WCAG guideline violations
of ad elements ( Ronly−ads). Concretely, the average violation
count is 106.2, with a median of 72, for websites without
ads (Rwithout −ads). For websites with ads ( Rwith−ads), the
average violation count increases to 118.1, with a median
of 81. Overall, the average violation count for ad elements
(Ronly−ads) is to 11.7. While the magnitude of the increase
in violations may not look drastic, it is important to understand
that a single violation directly points to an accessibility issue
of a website element that makes it inaccessible for at least
one type of disabled website user. As mentioned before,
WCAG guidelines violations in ads are more challenging to
address than the violations in original website content, as a
developer can immediately act on violations from original
website content, whereas, in the case of ads, it is infeasible
for the developer to address the violation due to user-specific
dynamic nature of ads.
To further understand the number of violations caused by
the ads on websites, we distribute websites with the number
of violations caused by ads. Figure 5 displays the distribution
of websites for one or more accessibility guideline violations.
We find that nearly 74.6% of websites have at least one acces-
sibility violation in their ad elements ( Ronly−ads), and 66.7%
of websites have an increase in violations after including ads
(Rwithout −ads→Rwith−ads).
Finding. Overall, nearly 75% of websites show at least
one accessibility violation attributed to ad elements,
underscoring the need for further investigation into
these violations.
B. RQ2: Common Accessibility Violations in Advertisements
To further understand the reason behind the increase in vio-
lations caused by the ad elements on websites, we investigate

1) Prevalent Violations in Ad Elements ( Ronly−ads):This
analysis provides insights into design-specific violations within
ad elements and their potential implications. Table III high-
lights the most prevalent violations we found in ads across
5K websites. Note that these ad elements with violations are
rendered at runtime, preventing developers from addressing
them during deployment.
Focus Visible is one of the most common violations. Focus
visible results enforce that keyboard focus indicators are visi-
ble when styling elements like links or ad elements using CSS.
In other words, website elements currently focused on should
be highlighted. For example, on the website 10news.com ,
we identified a Google Ads iframe that violates this rule, as
depicted in Figure 6(b). In 6(a), the website developer has
correctly implemented the focus visible feature by highlighting
website cards with a blue border and thus adheres to focus
visible. Under WCAG Success Criterion 2.4.7 (Focus Visible)
[31], focus indicators must always be visible, which benefits
users with motor disabilities, visual impairments (including
low vision), cognitive disabilities, and those relying on acces-
sibility tools like screen readers. We observe that 54.1% of
the website ad elements have not implemented focus visible.
In Input is the second most common violation in ad elements
that fails to inform users when their input action will change
the context i.e., navigating to a different page or opening0 2 4 60.70.80.91Proportion of Websites

Success Criterion 3.2.2 (On Input) [31]. According to this
criterion, user actions on an interface component should not
automatically change the context without prior notification.
Violating ”on input” causes confusion or disorientation from
unexpected context changes. We observe this violation on
47.1% of the websites’ ad elements. For example, on the
website foxnews.com , we identified an ad that violates
this rule, as shown in Figure 7. The red-highlighted ad has
associated onclick ,onmouseover ,onmousedown , and
onfocus events, as shown in Listing 2. These events open
a new window (target=” blank”), but there is no indication
in the link text or an accessible tag like aria-label
to inform users that a new window will be opened. It is
mandatory to inform users about changes in context to prevent
disorientation.
Finding. Overall, we observed 28 different types of
violations, with the most prevalent being Focus Visible
(54%), and In Input (47%) across various websites.
2) Violations in Ad Elements ( Ronly−ads) vs. Non-ads
Website Elements Rwithout −ads:This analysis highlights
the accessibility violations that are specific to ad elements
(Ronly−ads) but not quite prevalent in non-ad elements
(Rwithout −ads). We compare violations from over 99K ad
elements and 331K non-ad elements. Figure 8(a-c) shows the
distribution of websites with the three most commonly found
violations in ad elements ( Ronly−ads), which are not common
in non-ads website elements ( Rwithout −ads).
Missing Captions (WCAG 1.2.4 [31]) is one of the most
common accessibility violations found more in ad elements
(Ronly−ads) than standard website elements ( Rwithout −ads).
This criterion requires that pre-recorded and live audio content
in synchronized media (such as videos) includes captions.
Captions are essential for users who are deaf, as they provide
a text alternative to spoken dialogue and important audio
information. On average, 16.4% of ad elements ( Ronly−ads)
contain at least one instance of this violation, whereas only
8.3% of website elements ( Rwithout −ads) exhibit the same
violation. In other words, ad elements ( Ronly−ads) are 2 ×
more likely to be missing captions than non-ads elements
(Rwithout −ads) on websites.
Focus Order (WCAG 2.4.3 [31]) is found to be more preva-lent in ad elements ( Ronly−ads) than non-ads website elements
(Rwithout −ads). This criterion requires that the navigation
order of interactive elements on a website is logical and
intuitive, ensuring users can navigate through content in a
predictable manner. Proper focus order is crucial for users
who rely on keyboard navigation, such as individuals with
motor impairments or those using assistive technologies like
screen readers. Without a logical focus order, users may
struggle to understand the structure of the page, miss important
information, or find it difficult to interact with the content. On
average, 27.1% of ad elements ( Ronly−ads) contain at least
one instance of this violation, whereas only 19.1% of website
elements ( Rwithout −ads) exhibit the same violation.
Language of Page (WCAG 3.1.1 [31]) is another accessibility
violation that is found more in ad elements than non-ad
website elements. This criterion requires that the primary
language of a website element is clearly defined in the HTML.
Declaring the language is essential for users who rely on
assistive technologies, such as screen readers, which use this
information to provide accurate pronunciation and interpreta-
tion of the content. Without the language of the page specified,
users with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities may
have difficulty understanding the content, leading to a less
accessible and non-inclusive website experience. On average,
45.3% of ad elements ( Ronly−ads) contain at least one instance
of this violation, whereas only 2.1% of website elements
(Rwithout −ads) exhibit the same violation. Thus, ad elements
(Ronly−ads) are 21 ×more likely to have this violation than
non-ad elements ( Rwithout −ads). This significant difference
points to the special ad accessibility case where website
developers are not able to enforce language constraints on
the ads served on their website due to the user-specific and
dynamic nature of websites.
Finding. Overall, we observed seven violations more
common in ad elements ( Ronly−ads) than in website
elements ( Rwithout −ads): missing captions, incorrect
focus order, undefined page language, insufficient text
spacing, hover content violations, keyboard accessibil-
ity issues, and focus-related violations.Domain Company Websites Violations WCAG Description Count

TABLE IV: Top five ad-serving technologies with the highest number of violations.
C. RQ3: Most Prevalent Ad-Serving Technologies on Websites
with Ad Serving Violations
We investigate the ad-serving technologies that deliver
ads on websites with the most accessibility violations. This
analysis aims to guide website developers in selecting ad-
serving technologies that comply with WCAG guidelines. Ad-
ditionally, it encourages ad-serving technologies to prioritize
accessibility considerations before delivering ads on websites.
Table IV lists the top ad-serving technologies prevalent on
websites with the highest number of violations in ad elements
(Ronly−ads).
Taboola is a content discovery platform that promotes per-
sonalized content recommendations across websites. In our
investigation, it is found on 8.2% of the inspected websites
with a total of 18K violations. Common ad violation is related
to guideline 1.1.1 [31], which mandates that all content must
have a text alternative for non-text content, found in 5,699 ads.
Another common violation is related to guideline 3.2.2 [31],
which mandates providing adequate feedback when an action
opens a new window or changes the context. This guideline
is violated in 5,057 ads. Lastly, guideline 2.4.7 [31], which
requires visible focus indicators for interface components to
assist users navigating with keyboards or alternative devices,
is violated in 4,658 ads served by Taboola.
DoubleClick is Google’s ad management platform, optimizing
digital ad campaigns. In our investigation, it is found on 31.5%
of inspected websites with a total of 10K violations. Common
ad violations include not informing users when their input
action will open a new window or change context (Guideline3.2.2) [31], which is found in 3,369 ads. Another com-
mon DoubleClick violation is related to guideline 2.4.4 [31],
which ensures links have clear, context-independent purposes,
benefiting screen reader users. This guideline is violated in
3,344 ads. Lastly, Guideline 2.4.7 [31] mandates visible focus
indicators for interface components, aiding users navigating
with keyboards or alternative devices, and is violated in 1,675
ads served by DoubleClick.
RevContent is an ad-serving technology that delivers person-
alized ad recommendations across various websites. In our
investigation, it is found on 6.5% of inspected websites with
a total of 3K violations. Common ad violations include not
informing users when their input action will open a new
window or change context (Guideline 3.2.2) [31], which is
found in 1,375 ads. Another common violation is related to
guideline 2.4.1 [31], which ensures that all functionality is
accessible from a keyboard. This guideline is violated in 1,113
ads. Additionally, guideline 1.2.1 [31], which requires that
all multimedia content has a synchronized captioning or a
transcript, is violated in 232 ads served by RevContent.
Finding. Overall, 52% of websites using Google’s ad-
serving technologies violate WCAG guidelines across
over 14K ad elements. Taboola serves the most ad
elements with accessibility violations.
D. Misrepresentation of Alt Text in Advertisements
Among the ads that do not lead to accessibility violation, we
investigate the accessible information associated with ads that(a) Alt-text: Foxes accused of steal-
ing Crocs, sandals from campers af-
ter many pairs found at den.
(b) Alt-text: Distressed hotels turned
into apartments for affordable hous-
ing.
Fig. 9: Misrepresentation of alt-text in image tags of ads.
truly represents the intext and content of the ad. Prior work
privacy implications of ads [43]–[47] and malvertising [48]–
[50] show that clickbait [51], [52] and false ads [53] can lead
to scams, phishing, and fraud. Analyzing alternate texts of
otherwise accessible ads is important because it highlights how
effective alternate texts are in effectively conveying the content
of ads to users with disabilities.
We start by extracting <img> tags with alt text from the
ads’ HTML and collecting their src values, which contain
the image URLs. Next, we use the CLIP (Contrastive Lan-
guage–Image Pretraining) model [26] to assess the relevance
between images and their alt text. CLIP encodes images and
text into a shared embedding space, allowing us to compute
the cosine similarity between them. We classify alt text as
redundant if the cosine similarity is below 0.5, which is the
optimal threshold reported in previous research [54]. This
approach efficiently evaluates the semantic alignment between
visual and textual data.
Overall, across 5K websites, we find 9,827 ad images with
alt text. Of these, 27.1% of ads have a cosine similarity score
below 0.5, indicating a low level of similarity between the text
and the ad image. For example, Figure 9(a) shows an image of
shoes on a bench, served by Taboola on wsfa.com , but the
alt text describes foxes stealing footwear. This alt text mimics
a news headline to confuse users, with a cosine similarity
score of 0.33. Similarly, Figure 9(b) shows a hotel image
onclickorlando.com , but the alt text describes hotels
turned into apartments for affordable housing. This alt text
also resembles a news headline, with a cosine similarity score
of 0.28. The alt texts of these ads do not disclose that they
are ads and not the content served by the website. Users may
only realize it is an ad after performing actions like pressing
enter to open the link, only to be redirected to a page outside
the original domain. Malicious and false ads represented as
news in alt text can redirect to scam and phishing websites,
compromising the safety of users with disabilities who struggle
to assess a website’s trustworthiness.
Finding. Overall, 27% of the nearly 10K ads have alt
text that misrepresents ad image’s content and intent.
Privacy implication of misleading advertisements. We
manually inspect the consequences of interacting with these
misleading ads to determine if any user identifiers are collected
for invasive tracking onhover ,onmouseover , or when the
user presses enter (for tabbable access) on these ads. Thesethree events are key resources for assistive technologies like
screen readers to collect accessible information from website
elements and deliver it to users using them
Prior research has shown that network traffic resulting from
interacting with ads may contain user identifiers in headers
[55], [56], cookies [57], [58], and parameters [59]. These
identifiers can be used to trace a user’s browsing activity on the
web, violating their privacy. Lists maintained by ad-blockers
identify specific headers [60], cookies [61], and parameters
[62] as tracking identifiers for users. We compare our network
traffic from manually interacting with ads on the top 50 news
websites against these lists to identify any tracking of user
identifiers. Our results show that on 94% of websites, at least
one tracking identifier is sent to an external server by hovering,
and on 98% of websites, at least one tracking identifier is sent
to an external server by pressing enter on the ads. Both events
are essential actions that screen readers perform to read and
announce website elements’ content. None of the actions are
necessary to access ads for regular users.
Finding. On 94% of websites, hovering sends tracking
data to external servers, forcing users with disabilities
to compromise privacy to navigate ad content, unlike
regular users.
VI. D ISCUSSION AND TAKEAWAYS
Based on our empirical investigation, we provides insights
for website developers and ad-serving technologies to address
ad accessibility violations and highlights future research av-
enues for improving the website experience for users with
disabilities.
Accessibility-promoting ad integration for website de-
velopers. Ad integration is crucial for ad-driven websites.
Developers must ensure high accessibility and WCAG com-
pliance, which can be a regulatory requirement [2]. Once
published, the developer cannot modify the website to address
ad-related accessibility issues since new ads may introduce
different violations. Developers can ensure two key aspects
to improve ad accessibility during integration. First, they can
inject JavaScript to enforce CSS rules (using !important )
to implement basic checks on WCAG Type A violations. For
instance, a script can be added to ensure all text elements
have sufficient color contrast. Such a script can be triggered
ononload events to detect certain accessibility violations
and address them appropriately, if possible. Some Type AA
violations can also be addressed by injecting similar checks
in the JavaScript, such as ensuring all interactive elements
are keyboard accessible. Secondly, developers can run acces-
sibility checks on their websites post-deployment (similar to
our analysis) to analyze ad elements and derive specific self-
correcting strategies to address those concerns.
Accessibility strategies for ad-serving technologies. Website
developers integrate ads on their websites by leasing ad
space to ad-serving technologies. These ad-serving technolo-
gies often enroll in programs such as the Acceptable Adsprogram [63] and adhere to guidelines set by the Interactive
Advertising Bureau (IAB) [64]. The Acceptable Ads Program
promotes non-intrusive ad formats that respect user experience,
requiring adherence to specific display guidelines. The IAB
sets comprehensive standards for digital advertising, including
ad formats, measurement, and data privacy, ensuring com-
pliance with industry best practices. However, none of these
current programs and IAB standards address the accessibility
of ads, such as readability by screen readers or keyboard
navigation. Including accessibility criteria in these guidelines
would ensure that ads meet website accessibility standards.
Updating IAB standards to cover accessibility requirements
would support assistive technologies and enhance compliance
with website accessibility guidelines. When leasing an ad slot,
the website developer is often provided with the option to
enforce restrictions on the type of ads they want to display
on their websites. Based on our findings, we advocate that
this ad restriction should also include an option to host only
WCAG-complaint ads.
User-side accessibility tools. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) can significantly benefit accessi-
bility tools by addressing common accessibility violations
automatically. For instance, when dealing with missing alt
text for images, LLMs can analyze the image’s content
and generate descriptive and contextually relevant alt text .
These models can provide accurate descriptions by leveraging
advanced image recognition and natural language processing
capabilities, making the content more accessible to users with
visual impairments. However, hosting large-sized models in
a browser extension is not feasible. Small, domain-specific
language models are an active area of research, which can
advance a browser’s ability to auto-transform inaccessible ads
into WCAG-complaint with minimal runtime cost.
VII. T HREAT TO VALIDITY
Internal validity. Our analysis in Section V involves col-
lecting ad elements ( Ronly−ads) by differencing website el-
ements without ads ( Rwithout −ads) from those with ads
(Rwith−ads). However, various confounding factors may in-
fluence Ronly−ads. For instance, some websites dynamically
fetch different elements, including ads, on each visit. Con-
sequently, website elements loaded in Rwith−adsmight not
appear in Rwithout −ads. Other factors include changes in
behavior due to the environment ( e.g., browser and host OS),
visit time, and location. To minimize this threat, we perform
the two visits in quick succession and maintain consistent en-
vironments across different states, ensuring the same location,
browser, and stateless crawls.
External validity. The IBM Equal Access Accessibility
Checker [29] on different browsers might produce different
accessibility violations due to the browser’s built-in features,
such as Safari’s default blocking of certain ad-serving tech-
nologies [65]. We conduct our experiments using the Chrome
browser with a Chrome-based extension, which is the most
widely used browser, to minimize this threat.Construct validity. We collect the website’s elements at
page load time and do not capture changes in accessibility
violations triggered by user interactions such as scrolling and
clicking. This is a general limitation of dynamic analysis that
is challenging to overcome due to the numerous navigation
and interaction scenarios on websites.
VIII. R ELATED WORK
Accessibility of websites and mobile applications has been
extensively studied [15]–[22]. Hackett et al. [16] used the
Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine to demonstrate that
websites have become progressively less accessible as their
complexity has increased. Teixeira et al. [19] conducted a
systematic literature review focusing on website accessibility
within the tourism industry. Similarly, Moreno et al. [66]
proposed a method to improve website design for accessibility
by addressing identified violations. Fok et al. [20] conducted a
large-scale analysis of mobile applications to investigate how
inaccessible user interfaces are. Similarly, Milne et al. [21] and
Ross et al. [22] found that missing or vague labels in mobile
applications hinder screen readers from conveying information
to visually impaired users.
Digital ads on websites and mobile applications are mainly
studied for privacy-invasive targeted advertising mechanisms
(e.g., [10]–[12]), malicious ads spreading malware or click
fraud and phishing attacks ( e.g., [13], [14]), and deceptive
or manipulative content ( e.g., [34]). However, there is very
limited research specifically focused on the accessibility of
online ads. He et al. [23] conducted an empirical study on
the accessibility of mobile ads for blind users in Android
apps, identifying significant challenges such as missing alt
text for images, complex gestures problematic for screen
readers, and ads that disrupt app functionality. However, their
analysis was limited to only 500 ad elements on mobile
applications, so their insights are not applicable to website ads
broadly. Similarly, Thompson et al. [24] manually examined
alt text for ad elements on 67 news websites, while Chiou
et al. [25] automatically detected reflow accessibility violations
in website advertisements for keyboard users. Both studies are
small-scale and on limited accessibility violations. To date, the
large-scale accessibility of website ads remains a significant
and unresolved question.
Several tools [3]–[6] have been developed to address ac-
cessibility issues. Twitter A11y [4] is a browser extension de-
signed to add alternative text to images on Twitter. Zhang et al.
[5] created a machine-learning model that infers accessibility
metadata from mobile app screens, improving iOS V oiceOver
functionality and enhancing accessibility for existing apps.
InstaFetch [6] is a browser extension that consolidates website
content into a screen reader-friendly interface, allowing blind
users to access information across multiple pages efficiently.
while these tools may improve the accessibility of general
website content, it is yet to be measured if these fully address
the accessibility violation caused by the ads.IX. C ONCLUSION
Website ads are an integral part of a website and are
essential for supporting free Internet; however, they often fail
to meet basic accessibility standards. This paper presents the
first extensive study on the accessibility issues of website ads.
Our research reveals that 67% of websites show a noticeable
increase in accessibility violations due to ads. We also dis-
covered that popular ad-serving technologies do not adhere
to the WCAG guidelines when displaying ads, and nearly
one-quarter of ads that do comply with WCAG guidelines
have misleading alt text. Our findings provide insight into
the challenges faced by website developers in integrating ads
while maintaining accessibility. This research suggests ways
for developers to enforce accessibility standards to lessen the
impact of ads on overall website’s accessibility.
