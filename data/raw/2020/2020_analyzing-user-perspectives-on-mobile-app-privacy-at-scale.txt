ABSTRACT
In this paper we present a methodology to analyze users’ con-
cerns and perspectives about privacy at scale. We leverage NLP

privacyconcerns.Ourmethodologyiscomposedofabinaryclas-sifier thatdistinguishes between privacyand non-privacy related
reviews.Weuseclusteringtogatherreviewsthatdiscusssimilarprivacy concerns, and employ summarization metrics to extractrepresentative reviews to summarize each cluster. We apply ourmethods on 287M reviews for about 2M apps across the 29 cate-
gories in Google Play to identify top privacy pain points in mobile
apps. We identified approximately 440K privacy related reviews.
Wefindthatprivacyrelatedreviewsoccurinall29categories,with
someissuesarisingacrossnumerousappcategoriesandotherissues
only surfacing in a small set of app categories. We show empirical
evidence that confirms dominant privacy themes – concerns about
apps requesting unnecessary permissions, collection of personal
information,frustrationwithprivacycontrols,trackingandthesell-
ing of personal data. As far as we know, this is the first large scale
analysis to confirm these findings based on hundreds of thousands
of user inputs. We also observe some unexpected findings suchas users warning each other not to install an app due to privacyissues, users uninstalling apps due to privacy reasons, as well as
positivereviewsthatrewarddevelopersforprivacyfriendlyapps.
Finally we discuss the implications of our method and findings for
developers and app stores.

In app stores, such as Google Play and Apple’s App Store, users
can write reviews to share their experience and opinions about the
appsthattheyuse.Reviewshelpotheruserstounderstandwhether
or not the app might be of interest to them. These reviews are also
a feedback channel to developers whocan learn how toimprove

Moreover, some issues, such as privacy related feedback, may have

that are highly representative of all those belonging to a single

vacy concerns, how these concerns evolve over time, why some
privacy issues occur predominantly within specific app categories,

enables tools for developers to receive feedback thatcan help them
improve the privacy of their products.

The development of automated privacy text classifiers (for user
text) and the ability to separate privacy issues into distinct clusters
in an unsupervised fashion, enables numerous types of large-scale
analyses including (some of which are discussed in this paper) -
rankingofissues,breadthofconcernsacrossapptypes,unantici-
pated and emergingissues, sentiment with which usersapproach
specific issues, user behavior (e.g. uninstalling an app), compar-
isonsacrossapptypes(e.g.children’sversusregularapps),issuesper culture (as captured by language) and more. We discuss how
suchfindingscaninformdevelopersaboutprivacyshortcomings
of their apps, and more generally, how it could inform privacy best
practices across app stores.

capture a breadth of privacy concerns and perspectives. We find

reasons; (2) users uninstall apps due to privacy concerns; (3) users
concerns about the selling of personal data are largely confined to
a small set of app categories; and (4) some users reward developers
whose apps are privacy friendly with privacy positive reviews.
We apply our clustering and summarization to ten categories
of apps and identify the large compact clusters within each cat-egory. From these, we identity five dominant privacy concerns
acrossmultipleappcategories:apps thatappeartorequestunnec-
essary permissions, collection of personal information, tracking,
privacy controls and apps that may be selling personal data. Next,

2 RELATED WORK
TheprimaryuseofNLPintheprivacyspaceinthelastfewyears
has been to analyze privacy policies [ 28,31,40,49,53,56,60,63,
65,66,80]. Numerous efforts have focused on identifying incon-
sistencies between an application’s source code and its privacy
policy [40,53,65,66,80] or it’s description [ 28,56,60]. Other uses
include developing privacy chat bots [ 32] and automated question-
answer systems based on deep-learning techniques [ 31,63] to help
usersunderstanddatapractices.In[ 49],theauthorsexploretheuse
of NLP to help users avoid inadvertently sharing personally identi-
fyinginformationinsocialmedia,emails,andtextmessages.In[ 57]
the authors used NLP to analyze app description texts, within alarger mechanism to determine when two apps are similar; this
was used to inform developers when they may be requesting an
unnecessary permission. None of these privacy-oriented studies
applied NLP to analyze the text in user reviews.
User reviews have been analyzed using NLP, but not in the con-
text of privacy. Pagano and Maalej [ 54] conducted an empirical
analysis of iOS app reviews and found that reviews are not easy to
automatically analyze given their unstructured forms. Some efforts
have built classifiers to identify informative app reviews [ 15]o r

bug reports with related app reviews [ 44]. In the Requirements
Engineering space there have been large bodies of work that fo-
cusedonfeature/requirementsextractionfromuserreviewsand/or
applied a sentiment analysis to find out how users like a certain
feature [30,45,68]. [29] developed a review summarization frame-
work to categorize app reviews into categories (e.g., bug reports
andfeaturerequests),andalsoextractsaspectsandtheirsentiments
(e.g., interface is good/poor). Tian et.al. have shown that including
crowd sourced review information in app update notifications was
moreeffectiveatalertingusersofinvasiveormaliciousappupdates,
especially for less trustworthy apps [72].
The prior research that is closest to ours is [ 8,51,52]. Besmer
et al. [8] have trained a logistic regression model to detect privacy
app reviews, and have shown that privacy reviews have lower star
ratings and more negative sentiment, but have higher engagement
(more upvotes/downvotes). In both [ 51,52], the authors developed
a SVM classifier to extract reviews from the Play Store on the two
topics of security and privacy. The key purpose of [ 52] was to
determine if app reviews discussing security and privacy lead to
changesintheapp,and[ 51]focusedonhowactualappbehavior
influences users’ security and privacy concerns. Using static code
analysis, the authors in [ 52] were able to demonstrate that the
presence of security and privacy reviews are predictive of security
and privacy app updates in 60% of the cases they looked at. Thisisveryencouraging,asitmeansdevelopersdorespondtoissues

had to develop a security and privacy review classifier to extractthosereviews.Theauthorsin[

Userfrustrationduetoappsrequestingunnecessarypermissions
has been well studied [ 23,38,39,64,73,75]. In fact, users were
often surprised by the abilities of applications to collect data inthe background [
35,71], and were concerned with possible risks
associated with permissions [ 24]. Special attention has been on
studying the privacy concerns arising due to users’ location being
tracked [3, 17, 22].

3.1 Dataset Curation
In order to develop test, validation, training and inference datasets,
wecollectedapproximately580MPlayreviewsinEnglishpublished
onthePlaystorebetweenApril2014andFeb2020.Ourdatasetwasanonymizedintermsofappnames,aseachreviewwasonlylabeled
by its app category; however we were given an aggregated appcount of 2M. We started with zero labeled data. As per the manymethods for generating labeled data, as outlined well in [
61], we
use Expert-Hand-Labeling (by subject matter experts) for our test
and validation datasets to ensure these are of the highest qualitysince they are used to evaluate the performance of our machine
learning models. Prior work [ 52] hints that privacy related reviews
mayconstitutelessthan1%ofallreviews,hencewewerefacing
an extremely imbalanced dataset. To bootstrap this procedure and

issues. We curated an initial seed list of n-grams inspired by these
taxonomies. Our manual labeling team consisted of the authors

and three linguists. We filtered reviews based on this initial seed
and conducted a preliminary manual evaluation. We looked to see
the types of words and expressions that users employ to express
privacy concerns.
There were two observations in this bootstrapping phase. First,
filteringusing1-gramand2-gramwordscanresultinmanyfalse
positives;forexample,thesingleword“trust”canbeusedin“don’t
trust your teammates”, which is not a statement about privacy.
Thus, we decided to only use n-grams with 𝑛>=3 for further
filtering. Second, we converted our seed list of n-grams to regular
expressions and expanded the set of expressions based on this
manual exploration. Regex patterns allow us to succinctly capture
grammaticalvariantsoftypicalprivacystatements.Foreveryregex
pattern, we checked to see if it occurred in at least 100 reviews
thatwereprivacy-related.Ourregexescapturedapproximately200
n-grams.Weacknowledgethatourlistmaynotbecompleteand
mighthavemissedprivacyissuesorphrasesusedtodiscussprivacy.
We next selected ∼11K app reviews for manual labeling. To
ensure we ended up with enough labeled privacy examples, we
selected 60% of the 11K reviews because they matched against our
regexpatterns,andtheother40%wereensuredtonotmatchanyof
the regexes. Each of the 11K reviews were manually examined and
cross-labeledbythreeratersandalabel(privacyornotprivacy)was
assigned. For the vast majority of reviews, all three labelers agreed.
When this was not the case, discussion ensued until an agreement
was reached. Among the 11,371 manually labeled reviews (ground
truth),6688were labeled as privacyand4683werenot privacy.
The validation dataset used to evaluate the performance of the ML
models after each training epoch was created by extracting 250
privacyand250notprivacy reviewsfromthisset.Theremain-
ing 10,871 reviews were treated as the test set for comparing the
performance of different privacy classifiers.
Because each of our regexes (capturing 200+ n-grams) was veri-
fied–bycheckingforitsappearanceinatleast100privacy-related
reviews,andalsobasedonourmanuallabelingexercise–weas-sume our regex list effectively constitutes a set of good qualityheuristics. We use these to generate our training data, as per themethod of Heuristic-Supervision as in [
61]. We used roughly half
of the reviews ( ∼290M) to generate training samples. From this set
we identified 250K app reviews that matched our privacy regex
patterns and labeled them as privacy-related reviews; we then ran-
domlysampledanother250Kreviewsthatdidnotcontainanyof
our privacyregexes and labeledthem as not-privacy. Ourprivacy
regexpatternscouldonlyidentify0.08%ofreviewsasbeingrelatedtoprivacy.Finally,weusedthesecondhalfofourcollectedreviews,namely 287M reviews, as our inference dataset. We performed clas-
sification, clustering and summarization on this set to understand
users’ top privacy concerns. The sizes of our training, validation
and test datasets are shows in Table 1.

3.2 Privacy Classifier
The simplest approach to extract privacy related reviews might be
viaakeywordlist.However,itisnon-trivialformultiplereasons
to curate a comprehensive list of keywords. In addition to the
falsepositiveissuediscussedinSection3.1,thesamewordcould
mean different things depending on the context. For example, the
occurrence of “invading” in a war game app review likely does not
refer to a privacy concern, whereas it might in a review about a
parental control app with a location tracking feature (e.g. “this app
isinvadingmyprivacy”).Moreover,therecouldalsobeinstances
whereareviewdoesnotcontainprivacykeywordsbut,basedon
its context, still be related to privacy. For instance, “don’t want my
friendaccessingmyemail”doesnotcontainanyprivacyspecific
keywords but is a privacy concern based on the context.

representation or use word embeddings, such as Word2Vec [ 50]
andGloVe[ 58],toencodetext.Suchsystemsdonotencodeinfor-
mationaboutthewordsequence,andthereforecannotdifferentiate
between reviews containing the same words in different order. For
example,“deletecookiesandwebsitehistory”and“myarticleon
historyofcookies gotdeletedfrom website”use samewords but

have different meanings. In addition to handling context, and word
sequence, we also need to be able to correctly process reviews that
are frequently unstructured, contain highly variable writing styles,
grammatical errors and misspellings.

shown to deliver impressive performance on downstream tasksevenwhenworkingwithsmalltrainingdatasets[
69].Hence,we
fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on our training set to create
a binary privacy classifier.
USE: Universal Sentence Encoder is another deep neural net-
workbasedmodel,thatusesencoders(Transformer-based[ 74]or
Deep-Averaging-Networkbased[ 34])tolearnmeaningfulsentence

model, instead use the readily available pre-trained USE TF-Hub
module2(which provides text embedding representations directly)
and build a two-layer feed-forward neural network on top for cre-
ating our privacy classifier.
3.2.1 Models. We propose the following four model variants as
candidates for our privacy classifier.
(Vanilla) BERT: We take the pre-trained BERT model, and add
one additional network layer after the last layer for binary classifi-
cation. We usea [CLS] token (start-of-sentence)to represent each
review in its entirety. Thus our additional layer simply transforms
theembeddingslearntforthe[CLS]tokentothetwoclasses,i.e.,
privacyandnotprivacy.Wefine-tunetheBERTmodelonourtrain-
ing data for three epochs, and choose the best epoch model based
on the performance on the validation dataset.
Sentiment-awareBERT(BERT-SST):Fromapreliminaryanal-
ysis,we foundthatthe privacyreview textsgenerallyhave aneg-
ative sentiment. We use this information to further strengthenour BERT-based privacy classifier, by first fine-tuning BERT for
sentimentclassificationtask.Usingsimilarmodelarchitecturemen-
tioned above for (Vanilla) BERT, we first train the model on a text-
sentiment dataset: Stanford Sentiment Treebank3, that contains
2https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/1
3https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/text and its binary (positive or negative) sentiment label. We then
fine-tune this model on our training data to create the privacyclassifier. We simply map the privacy class to the negative senti-
mentclass,andnot-privacytothepositiveone.Wefine-tunethe
sentiment-awareBERTmodelforthreeepochsandchoosethebest

USE: We extract a new 512-dimensional embedding representa-
tionforeachreviewbypassingthereviewsthroughthepre-trained
USE model that is based on Deep Averaging Network encoder. We
thenpasstheembeddingthroughafeed-forwardneuralnetwork
with2layersand512hiddenunitseach.Theoutputofthe2𝑛𝑑layer

model is trained with the objective to maximize the probability of
the correct class, and thus we use cross-entropy loss to optimize
the network.We trainthe modelfor 20epochs andchose thebest
model based on performance on the validation set.
Ensemble Model: In our experimentation, we noticed inconsis-
tentlabelassignmentsbyeachofthethreeprivacyclassifiersabove.
(ThisisunderstandableastheunderlyingBERTandUSEmodelsare
pre-trainedondifferentdatasetswithdistinctcharacteristics.)To
better understandthescenarios where USEandBERT modelswere
makingdifferentdecisions(privacyornot-privacy),wemanually
examined about 1000+ reviews that had different labels from the
twomodels.BelowisanexampleofastatementthatUSEclassified
asprivacywhereas BERT labled it not-privacy.
“you can record call automatically, record anonymous calls, recordimportant calls... youcan choose thephone numbers in thephone-
bookorrecordingcallautomatic.thelistofrecordedfileswillbe
stored and streamlined for you in the phone call recorder.”
The following is an example of a review that BERT predicted as
privacy whereas USE did not.
“nothavingtamilchannelsandsportschannelswhichistheway
of looting the trust from the customer service”
The first example is ambiguous as making anonymous phone
calls could be perceived as being related to privacy. However, this
review mainly lists app features. The second example mentions
trust however this isn’t a privacy issue but instead perhaps one of
feeling excluded due to a language not supported in the app. We
wouldn’t consider either of these to be about privacy.
Toreducesuchambiguitiesandimproveourconfidenceinthe
privacyreviewidentification,our Ensemblemodel considersa re-
view to be about privacy, if and only if, all three classifiers (USE,
BERT and BERT-SST) labeled it as privacy. Note that this makesour model conservative (i.e., we will underestimate the numberof privacy reviews) since we are choosing to focus on precision
ratherthanrecall.Forourpurposesofbroadlyunderstandingusers’
privacy concerns with mobile apps, we prefer to have less noise in

able to generalize its learning beyond the terms and expressions in
our regex patterns. First we checked to see if our classifier learned
anyconceptsnotincludedinourregexpatterns.Forexample,we
didnotincludeanytermsrelatedto“anonymity”or“anonymous”
in our regexes, however we did find a number of reviews that
mention“Iliketheanonymity...”.Ourmodellikelylearnedthatthe
words related to “anonymous” are often associated with privacy
because of the following. The following real review - “i don’t want
a personalized profile full of surveillance. anonymous access is a
preferred” -couldhavebeenflaggedasprivacybecauseoftheword
"surveillance" (that was in our regexes). Since this review also

it identifies roughly twice the amount of content as our regexes.
3.3 Clustering and Summarization
ThenextstepinourpipelineisClusteringandSummarizationofthe
privacy related reviews to tease out the different privacy concerns
users describe. We know from prior work as well as our curatedset of n-grams, there are a multitude of things users might write
about,suchaspersonaldatacollection,privacycontrols,location
tracking, a feeling of being spied on, third party data sharing, new
privacy features, consents, etc. We refer to these as privacy themes.
Since app reviews do not have fine-grained labels for such privacy
themes,weuseunsupervisedlearning(specificallyclustering)to
identify the common privacy issues. We use K-means clustering as
ourapproachtoclusteringbecauseitissimpleandbroadlyused,
and leave exploration of other clustering solutions as future work.
WeapplyK-meanstothesetofprivacyreviewsperappcategory
(Games, Parenting, Tools, etc). The motivation for studying cat-
egories independently is that the number of reviews across appcategories was highly variable (ref Table 3). Analyzing all the re-
views together would have not highlighted users’ concerns in appTable3:Number/proportionofprivacyreviewspercategory

independentlyhelpedusidentifyissueswhichmaybeprominent
in one category but not in others (e.g., tracking and selling data
was not a key concern in the Games category).
Once these clusters are determined, we summarize the topic
discussedinaclusterbyselectingsomehighlyrepresentativere-
viewsforeachcluster.Afterindependentlyreviewingthetoprep-
resentative reviews and labelling the clusters in each category, we
performed a second round of annotation where we cross-checked
the cluster labels across categories and mapped clusters discussing
the same concerns to the broader topic.
K-Means clustering: We use the 512-dimensional USE embed-
ding generatedfor each review toperform clustering. We use em-
beddingsderivedfromourUSE-basedmodelinsteadofBERT-based
models as it lead to a higher AUC score (refer Table 2). The clus-tering is performed within an app category, and Cosine Distance
isusedasthedistancemetric.Likeanyotherclusteringtask,the
challengehereis: howtodetermineagood 𝑘valueforthenumberof
target clusters, without knowing ahead of time how many distinct
themes users may be writing about. There exist various metrics in
theliteraturetochoose 𝑘,suchastheSilhouetteScore[ 62],Dunn
Index[21], CH-Score[ 12], etc. These metrics primarily reward well
separatedandcompactclusters,whichisalsoourgoal.However,
these metrics implicitly assume the following: 1) a sample belongs
toonlyone cluster(oronlybelongs tooneprivacytheme);and 2)
all samples belong to some cluster, i.e., no sample is considered to
beanexceptionoroutlier.ForprivacyrelatedPlayreviews,these
assumptions do not always hold. Consider this example:
117Analyzing User Perspectives on Mobile App Privacy at Scale ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

undoubtedly, they’ll be another company in the news soon for
exploiting customer privacy.”
Thisexamplereviewtouchesonmultipleprivacythemes,including
unnecessarypermissions, spyware,locationtracking, andgeneral
privacy exploitation. There is potential that each of these fine-
grained topics produce its own cluster when running K-Means; so
this example review would be hard to place within one cluster as itmightnaturallybeontheborderofmultipleclusters.Therefore,we
aim to limit the influence of such reviews on the cluster formation
by optimizing for the creation of well-formed clusters – clusters
thatpredominantlydiscussasingleprivacyissue.Thenextexample
illustrates the second assumption:
“iwishitworkedbetterforpregnancymilestones,bumppics,etc.
alltheremindersassumeyourkidisbornregardlessofenteringtheduedate.also,thepicturestakeforevertoload.iuploadedmultiple
pics for one day and my sister thought it was just 1 pic because of
the slow load time. COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED is faster and i
can make a private group so my pics aren’t super public.”
In this example, the user seems to be primarily expressing dissatis-
factionabouttheremindermechanismsanduploadspeeds.They
alsomentionthattheywouldlikeanewprivacyfeature,namely
theabilitytocreateprivate groups.The requestforaprivategroup
option does make this a legitimate review about privacy. However,
we did not find similar requests in other reviews in parenting apps,
and thus this review is an outlier. We aim to limit the influence of
such reviews in the clusters produced.
Given this, we have the following goals. Firstly, we aim for well
separated clusters. Secondly, we aim to have a high number of
clusters that have limited mixed-concern reviews and to minimize
thenumberofoutliers.Toachievethis,weproposea summarization
metricthat will reward a value of 𝑘based on these criteria.
To address thisfirst goal we usethe following construct. Let 𝑆𝑖
denote the center of cluster 𝑖. We define 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡 𝑘as:
𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡 𝑘=min{𝛿(𝑆𝑖,𝑆𝑗)∀{𝑖,𝑗}} (1)
where𝑖≠𝑗and𝑖,𝑗∈[0,𝑘−1].𝛿(𝑆𝑖,𝑆𝑗)is the cosine distance
betweentwoclustercenters. 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡 𝑘representstheminimumpairwise
distance among all pairs of 𝑘cluster centers. Maximizing 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡 𝑘
ensures that the cluster centers be far apart in the vector space.
We iterate through multiple values of 𝑘and select the one that
maximizes this metric. This formula varies compared to existingmetrics, where an average of inter-cluster distance is generally
takenintoaccount.Hereweensurethattheminimuminter-cluster
distance is the highest for the chosen 𝑘value.
To address our goals of limiting the influence of mixed-concern
reviewsandoutliers,wewantintuitivelyto“ignore”reviewsthat
arelooselyassociated withacluster,aswellasthemixed-concern
reviews as these are likely to be “borderline” between multiple
Figure 2: Silhouette Scores using K-Means for k=5
clusters. We aim to count the reviews within a cluster that areclosely related, and refer to them as upvotes(defined below). We
use thesilhouette score to do this. Recall that the silhouette score
𝑠(𝑖)formulateshowcloseeachpointistoitsclustercenterandhow
far it is from the nearest neighboring cluster, namely
𝑠(𝑖)=𝑏(𝑖)−𝑎(𝑖)
max(𝑏(𝑖),𝑎(𝑖))
where𝑏(𝑖)isthelowestaveragedistancebetween 𝑖-thpointand
any cluster of which it is not a member, and 𝑎(𝑖)is the average
distance between 𝑖and all the other points of the same cluster. As

reviews with silhouette score higher than the average silhouettescore asupvotesfor a given theme in a cluster. From Figure 2 we
see that it could be useful to retain clusters 0, 1, and 4 that havea larger amount of upvotes and ignore clusters 2 and 3. Clusters2 and 3 are likely to be poor quality since most of the silhouettescoresarenegativeorbelowthe averagesilhouettescore.Hence

kthat results in high number of compactclusters where a compact

topicin the users’ own words. We rank reviews within a cluster
according to their silhouette scores and use the top ten reviews
with the highest scores as the representative reviews. We carefully
analyzed these cluster representatives manually across all clusters
andverifiedthatthesereviewsindeedillustratethemaintopicin

This kind of work is inherently hard because the definition of
privacy is not exact. We relied on previously accepted privacy
taxonomies,threeprofessionallinguists,andourownexperience
reading huge numbers of privacy reviews. A clearer sense of the
distinction (or accepted overlaps) between security, censorship, ha-

4 PRIVACY THEMES
Inthissection,wepresentthetopprivacythemesthatareassociated
with different app categories. To do this, we run our clustering
analysis on the previously extracted privacy reviews. Due to space
limitations, we present findings from 10 Play Store app categories
instead of all 29 categories. We selected categories that were either
large or ones where we expected privacy concerns might arise.Recall that our clustering iterates through 𝑘=2...10 and picks the
best𝑘(number of clusters) according to our summarization metric.
For each of our 10 app categories, we found that 𝑘varied from 6 to
9.Welookedatthecompactclustersacrossthese10categories,and
identified 5 themes that were dominant across multiple categories.
Within each cluster considered, we ranked the reviews in those
clusters by silhouette score. Recall that the top ranked reviews
essentiallyrepresentthetopicoftheclusterastheyarecentralto
the cluster. For each of our selected clusters, we manually read the
top 20 most representative reviews, and assigned a short thematic
label to the cluster for ease of presentation and for summarization.
For example, we assigned the thematic label too many permis-
sionsto clusters whose representative reviews frequently mention
that an app requests more permissions than what seems needed.
These reviews are referring to the Android permissions such as
location,contacts,microphone,camera,etc.Thisthemewaspresentacrossallappcategories,withlocationpermissionbeingthehighest
occurring sub-theme. In other large clusters, many reviews com-ment on the collection of personal information. Such reviews
typicallyrefertoinformationsuchasaddress,email,profileinfo,etc.
Other themes we identified include privacy controls, tracking
andselling data. The cluster of reviews assigned the privacy-

privacy theme is left as future work.
4.1 Concern 1: Too Many Permissions
Thelargestcluster,ineachofour10categories,containsreviews
that make comments about the app asking for too many permis-
sions. This is expected as permissions are the gateway to accessing
personal information, and prior work has pointed to excessive per-
missions being a major concern [ 23,38,39,64,73,75]. Examples
include:

between the permissions asked for and the user’s perception of the

see users effectively demanding that. It is important for developers

by providing explanations [ 40,70] to address the “purpose” type
questions. In example 3, users state they feel that data collection
from some permission requests is “unacceptable” or a “risk”.

fiableinformation(PII)isbeingcollectedistheseconddominant
privacy concern, and occurred in eight of our ten categories exam-
ined herein. While prior work has shown that users are concerned
about too muchpersonal information being collected, bothin the

Other users indicate their suspicion i.e., there is no good reason
for the data collection. These suspicions, which are in essence
requests for data collection justification, reflects the same issue we
saw in the reviews about too-many-permissions – applied to
different data items. In the first two examples below, the users are
clearly quite annoyed. The user in the 3rd example implies that
they might have uninstalled the app because of this reason.

4.3 Other Dominant Privacy Concerns
Privacy Controls. Comments about privacy controls were a com-
mon issue across 5 app categories, namely in Communication, Par-
enting, Photography, Tools and Games. The fraction of reviews
discussingthisthemerangedfrom24%forCommunicationapps
to6%forGames.Thereviewsaboutprivacycontrolsshowanin-
teresting breadth, from explicitly requesting privacy controls to be
easier (example 1), to frustration with privacy controls (example2), to requesting new features (e.g. private chat in example 3). In
example2,theuseristryingtohidesomephotoswithinapp,yet
doesnotappeartobeabletodososuccessfully.Toaddresstheuser
frustration with using the offered privacy controls, personalized
privacy assistants have been proposed [39, 73].
(1)“don’tsharemypicsonpublicdomainwithoutmypermission,
when people search for specific location to visit pics appear, so
make privacy settings easy.” (Photography)
(2)“lock the pics you dont wanna see then they just get copied
right back to the gallery doesnt hide anything.” (Tools)
(3)“ilovethisgame!itissoaddictiveandfun!...theonlythingi
would want to change add is private chat.” (Games)
Tracking. Wesawtrackingasadominantconcernin5appcate-
gories,namelyCommunications,Entertainment,Parenting,Pho-tography and Medical apps. The fraction of privacy reviews that
discuss tracking rangedfrom a minimum of10% in Entertainment
apps up to 38% in Parenting apps. Privacy concerns arising due
to users’ location being tracked have been well studied [ 3,17,22],
but our analysis shows that location isn’t the only attribute people
are concerned about being tracked. Purchase history, contacts, and
other personal information are also important. As the examples
below show, users sentiment on this topic can range from annoyed
to angry. Since our methods can extract reviews on this issue, it
permitsfutureworkonsentimentanalysisandperhapsadeeper
exploration into which types of data are more sensitive. (Note, the
thirdexamplementions privateinformationaswellas spyingand
thusprovidesanexampleofreviewsthatfallontheboundaryof
two themes (one of the challenges in Section 3.3)).
(1)“warning: this app is spyware and will track all your location
info and purchases.” (Entertainment)
(2)“spyware,dataminer.willnotconnectuntilyougrantaccess

(3)“iagreewithprotectingyourchild.but whenyourateenlike
me you feel like you cant breath without constantly being
watched. it’s like being stalked by your own family, and as if
you can’t trust them. there’s a boundary between protection
and privacy. and this is stepping over the line.” (Parenting).
Selling Data. Users’ have previously expressed concerns with ser-
vice providers selling their data [ 18,76]. We show here that upsetdue to the perception of personal data being “sold” to third parties
alsoappearsinmobileapps.Unexpectedlythough,wefoundthis
to be dominant in only 3 app categories - that of Communications,
Medical and Entertainment apps. In the Communications apps, we
observed approximately 20% of the privacy reviews mentioning
sellinguserdata,makingthisasignificantprivacyissueforCom-
munication apps. Theexamples below hint thatthis issue appears
to make users feel undermined, as the comments are quite cynical.
We also see that users imagine their data being sold off to a variety
of recipients, including to companies, the NSA, and spammers.
(1)“i would highly recommend staying away from this cash grab
ofanappandmovetoanappthatactuallycaresaboutthedata
it collects about you. i feel like this company, and application
areonlyusedtotrackyourdataandinformationandselling
it off to the highest bidder, sad thing is, they make you pay for
it, so you’re essentially paying to get your information stolen.”
(Medical)
(2)“theyaresellingpatient’spersonaldatatocorporates.onceu

and call from labs for medical tests. beware.” (Medical)
(3)“whatidonotunderstandiswhy[COMPANY-NAME-REDACTED]
hadtomakeanotherwaythattheycouldsellourprivatein-
formation to third parties like the NSA.” (Communications)
Privacy Positive Reviews. During the above exercise processing
the top privacy pain points, we found - to our surprise - that while
most privacy reviews are negative, we do see some privacy pos-itive reviews. In these reviews, users mention that they like the
privacycontrols(examples1and2)orthattheyaregratefultheapp
is not collecting unnecessary information (example 3). The very
presenceofsuchreviewsindicatesthatdeveloperscanberewarded
by privacy-friendly design. Examples include:
(1)“thisisoneofthebestphotosharingappsoutthere.noneed
to share your children’s whole lives on social media and mess
around with tons of privacy settings. you invite who you want
to your album and can share privately with your partner or
the whole family.” (Parenting)
(2)“good way of keeping photos private.” (Photography)
(3)“itwasgreatfunplayingthis.ilikethattheydon’twantaccess
to your private information unlike other apps.” (Games)
While these five themes were dominant concerns, there were
smaller review clusters that touched upon other topics, such as
“adsrelatedtopersonalinformation”and“safetyconcernsdueto
personal information leakage”. The diversity of privacy issues is
broad thus making it challenging to provide examples of all topics,
due to lack of space.
Overall we found many of these reviews to be fairly privacy
savvy - many questioned the purpose of data collected and de-
manded justification, while others suggested specific privacy con-
trols they would like to see added. Our quotes from representative
reviews show that it is not uncommon for users to warn other

ments or bug fixes [43, 44].
Guiding the design of new tools for developers to providetransparency on their data-collection practices, such as the
Apple Privacy Nutrition Labels [
5], and its upcoming equivalent
in the Play Store [ 59]. Understanding user concerns at scale and
in depth via our methodology could inform the design of such
transparency initiatives.
•Analyzinguserconcernsabout tracking,sellingdata,andtoo
much personal information could shed light on what type
of labels are useful and how they should be designed. The
two label systems above are a good step forward as they en-
courage developers to be upfront about their collection and
sharing practices. Such labels could increase user trust and
helpthemdifferentiatebetweentheprivacystanceofcom-
petingapps.Althoughproperuseofsuchlabelsisturning
out to be challenging [37].
•In the long term, our methodology will enable refining such
labels and tailor them to the specific concerns of users. It
will also allow monitoring of emerging privacy concerns.
Mechanismforprovidinginsightintousersperceptionsof
privacy. Beyond looking at top issues, one could evaluate how
privacyissuesvarybycountry,bylanguage,bytime,orcompare
privacyissuesbetweenchildren’sappsversusregularapps.Run-
ning sentiment analysis on such privacy text data sets, using tools
such as Stanford’s NLTK [ 9], would enable large-scale comparison
of sentiment across privacy issues and help developers and appstores prioritize what to fix first. These insights would be very
valuable, especially for small scale apps that do not have resourcesto analyse their reviews another way.
Nudgingdeveloperstowardsbetterprivacypractices.Forin-
stance, today the Play Developer Console nudges developers to re-
move permissions that are not used by apps in its peer groups [ 57].
By using our methodology, these nudges can be expanded to the
otherprivacyconcernsidentifiedinthispaper.Forexample,tomit-igate tracking concerns, developers could be informed of malicious
ad libraries as opposed to those that are much more privacy safe.
