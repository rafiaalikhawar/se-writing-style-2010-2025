ABSTRACT
Understanding the evolution of communities in developer social
networks (DSNs) around open source software (OSS) projects can
provide valuable insights about the socio-technical process of OSS
development. Existing studies show the evolutionary behaviors
of social communities can effectively be described using patterns
including split, shrink, merge, expand, emerge, and extinct. How-
ever, existing pattern-based approaches are limited in supporting
quantitative analysis, and are potentially problematic for using the
patterns in a mutually exclusive manner when describing commu-
nity evolution. In this work, we propose that different patterns can
occur simultaneously between every pair of communities during
the evolution, just in different degrees. Four entropy-based indices
are devised to measure the degree of community split, shrink, merge,
and expand, respectively, which can provide a comprehensive and
quantitative measure of community evolution in DSNs. The indices
have properties desirable to quantify community evolution includ-
ing monotonicity, and bounded maximum and minimum values
that correspond to meaningful cases. They can also be combined
to describe more patterns such as community emerge and extinct.
We conduct studies with real-world OSS projects to evaluate the
validity of the proposed indices. The results suggest the proposed
indices can effectively capture community evolution, and are con-
sistent with existing approaches in detecting evolution patterns in
DSNs with an accuracy of 94.1%. The results also show that the
indices are useful in predicting OSS team productivity with an ac-
curacy of 0.718. In summary, the proposed approach is among the
first to quantify the degree of community evolution with respect to
different patterns, which is promising in supporting future research
and applications about DSNs and OSS development.

1 INTRODUCTION
Building and maintaining healthy communities around open source
software (OSS) projects is crucial because of the socio-technical na-
ture of OSS development [ 11,19,25,40,49,61,67]. Cross-disciplinary
research on developer social networks (DSNs) that emerge from
the developers’ communication and cooperation activities in OSS
repositories has been conducted by scholars from various fields ever
since the early days of the OSS movement [ 37,45]. Supported by
rich empirical evidences, it is now widely accepted that the social
aspects of OSS communities have a strong correlation with, and
are important indicators of OSS projects’ productivity [ 66], success
[63], and survivability [44, 50, 65].
While a number of research is about the statistics and patterns
of static DSNs snapshots [ 7,16,29,60,69], there is a series of work
that pay special attention to the evolution of DSNs around OSS
projects over time [ 9,25,67]. By understanding the evolution of
DSNs, we can not only retrospectively reveal the status of a DSN in
a given snapshot, but also predict the future trends of a DSN based
on a comprehensive view of its evolution history [ 9,25,49]. Given
the importance of social aspects in OSS development as discussed
above, and because OSS development is a “nature product of evolu-
tion” [ 40,45], in this work, we study the problem of measuring the
evolution of social communities around OSS projects quantitatively
to support in-depth understanding of the socio-technical aspects of
OSS development.

Existing approaches to study community and network evolution
can be categorized into two classes which we refer to as network-
level statistics andcommunity-level patterns . The first class of work
uses sequences of statistical metrics over series of temporally-
aligned snapshots of social networks to quantify their evolution.
Frequently adopted metrics include network diameter, shortest
path between nodes, node betweenness, modularity, hierarchy, cen-
trality, etc [ 3,25,28,30,50,55]. While most of the above metrics
measure properties of social networks on a gross level, a natural
phenomenon in social networks is that interacting individuals form
complex structures organized in communities1[8,46]. Understand-
ing the communities inside DSNs can provide valuable insights
about software development. For instance, Conway’s law suggests
that a system’s architecture reflects the communication structure
of the organization designs it [ 6,15]. Although some metrics such
as clustering coefficient [ 25], group degree centrality [ 44], group
betweenness centrality [ 44], etc, are related to measuring substruc-
tures or communities [ 12] in social networks, these network-level
statistics are less expressive in revealing the structure and evolution
of communities in DSNs.
Different from the above work, the second class of approaches
take the community perspective [ 3] to uncover the evolution pat-
terns of social networks. Six patterns, including growth (expand ),
contraction (shrink ),merge ,split,birth (emerge ), and death (extinct )
are used to describe the evolutionary behaviors of communities
inside social networks [ 3,4,10,23,27,34,46]. These patterns are
promising in bringing insights about OSS development for corre-
sponding to the evolution of OSS projects and members’ activities
[27]. However, the existing pattern-based approaches often assign
a single pattern to describe the evolution of a community, which
are limited for several reasons. First, the evolution of a community
can hardly be described by a single pattern. For example, a com-
munity can expand andmerge simultaneously with new members
and members from other communities joining it. Choosing either
pattern can lead to information loss in the above case. In addition,
matching communities detected in different time steps to identify
them as a single, evolving community before pattern assignment is
not a trivial task [ 46]. Second, the nominal patterns are promising
in describing community evolution qualitatively, but are limited in
supporting quantitative analysis. Third, these patterns are restricted
to describe the evolution of a single community. It is difficult to
extend the concepts to the network level, which is often desirable
to gain a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of DSNs.
Our idea to tackle the above limitations can be described as: the
community evolution patterns can happen simultaneously between
all pairs of communities in consecutive time steps, only in different
degrees. Following this idea, we propose in this paper to quantify
community evolutionary behaviors comprehensively by calculat-
inghow much the communities expand ,shrink ,merge , and split
simultaneously. As introduced in Sec. 4, the calculation is done
by first building a community member migration matrix which
captures the dynamics of communities detected in Sec. 3. Based
on the matrix, we devise indices based on information entropy to
measure the degree of community evolution with respect to the
1For the rest of the paper, a community inside a social network refers to a group of
interconnected members of the network if not specified otherwise. Refer to Sec. 2.1
for details about the terms used in this paper.four patterns above. Community extinct andemerge are represented
by special combinations of the indices. With this approach, the evo-
lution of a community is described by four indices in each step,
which addresses the challenge of finding a unique, most appro-
priate pattern for community evolution. It is worth noting that
our approach can detect community evolution patterns that are
consistent with existing work [ 27] with a simple set of rules as
introduced later. We present the properties of the indices, including
the monotonicity, and the upper- and lower-bounds, to show that
the indices can correctly reveal complex, real-world community
evolutionary behaviors quantitatively.
The advantages of the proposed approach compared to existing
work are as follows. First, our approach provides comprehensive
information about the evolution of communities. Instead of assign-
ing a single pattern to describe the evolution of a community, we
use four indices simultaneously to assess the degree of community
evolution with respect to the patterns in each step. Recall the ex-
ample above, with the proposed indices, we can express the fact
that a community is both merging and expanding, with degrees
specified by the merge and expand indices, respectively. Second,
the indices enable quantitative analysis for community evolution
analysis. In Sec. 5.4, we demonstrate to perform regression anal-
ysis with the indices. We also show in Sec. 4.3 that it is feasible
to aggregate the community-level indices to describe the overall
evolutionary behaviors of communities at the network level, which
can support quantitative analysis of community evolution at dif-
ferent scales. In summary, while exiting approaches can express
community evolution qualitatively with semantic rich patterns,
the proposed approach takes a step forward to provide more com-
prehensive, and quantitative analysis results, which can help OSS
volunteers and maintainers to gain insight about the current status
of OSS communities, compare between different projects’ commu-
nity evolution trends, track a project’s community evolution over
time quantitatively, and perform quantitative analysis. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work to quantify community
evolution in DSNs with respect to different patterns.
We conduct empirical studies using real-world data collected
from thirty-two projects hosted on GitHub to evaluate the validity
and usefulness of the proposed community evolution indices. More
specifically, we validate the construct validity of the proposed in-
dices in terms of concurrent and discriminant validity criteria [ 31].
The results for concurrent validity suggest that the community
evolution patterns detected with the proposed indices is consistent
with the ones detected following an existing approach [ 27], with an
accuracy of 94%. By analyzing the properties of the indices, and by
calculating the Spearman’s Correlation Coefficients of the indices,
we find that the indices are capable in measuring different aspects
of community evolution. We further demonstrate the usefulness
of the proposed indices by studying the correlation between the
measured community evolution with OSS project team productivity
measured by the count of commits [ 11,64]. The results obtained
from regression analysis with linear mixed-effects models suggest
that the indices are good predictors of team productivity with an
accuracy of 0.718 after log transformation.

patterns and quantitative measures with a set of entropy-
based indices, which can support quantitative analysis with
semantic rich patterns for community evolution.

to build DSNs and detect communities. The calculation of the com-
munity evolution indices are presented in Sec. 4. Results of the
empirical studies are shown in Sec. 5 with threats to validity dis-
cussed in Sec. 6. Sec. 7 introduces work closely related to ours.
Finally, Sec. 8 concludes the paper.
2OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH
This section presents an overview of the proposed approach.
2.1 Terminology
We first introduce the concepts and terms used in this paper.
AnOSS project orrepository refers to a single repository hosted
on OSS platforms such as Github, e.g., tensorflow/tensorflow2. In
comparison, large projects, e.g., the Mozilla or GNOME projects
that include multiple sub-projects developed together [ 27,39], are
considered as ecosystems orsuper-repositories following [ 36,39]. In
this work, we focus on community evolution on the project level.
Adeveloper social network (DSN) around an OSS project include
the participants of the project and their relationships, which is typ-
ically modeled using a graph model [ 3,27] extracted from various
sources such as mailing lists [ 7,39,49,67], version repositories [ 39],
issue and bug-tracking systems [3, 49], etc.
Acommunity inside a DSN means a group of members in the DSN
with strongly interconnected links [ 46], or share similar features
and actions [ 40,53], which is also termed as a cluster [25,53], a
2https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflowclique [46,55], an emerging team [49], or a social group [46] in the
literature. We do not use the term to refer to OSS communities in
the broad sense [57], e.g., the Apache community studied in [67].
The evolutionary behaviors of communities studied in this paper
correspond to the six community evolution patterns studied in [ 3,
27,34,46], which is different from the general concept of ‘patterns
of community evolution’ used in [40, 67].
2.2 Overview
As shown in Fig. 1, the processing pipeline proposed in this work
involves three steps. First, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and as introduced
in Sec. 3 and Sec. 5, given an OSS repository, we retrieve publicly
available data about the conversations correspond to issues and
pull-requests from the GHTorrent data set [ 22] and the GitHub
GraphQL API3. Participants of the conversations are recorded to
extract the joint discussion relationships. The records are used
to build DSNs and to perform community evolution analysis in
subsequent steps. Next, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and presented in
Sec. 3, we segment the records with a siding-window, and build
snapshots of DSNs from the segments using weighted, undirected
graphs. Community detection is then performed by applying an
extension of the Clauset-Newman-Moore (CNM) algorithm for
weighted graphs to the snapshots. Finally, correspond to Fig. 1(c),
we measure the evolutionary behaviors, including the split,shrink ,
merge , and expand , of the communities detected in consecutive
steps with the information entropy-based indices proposed in Sec.
4. The index values are aggregated to quantify community evolution
at the network level before we perform our analysis in Sec. 5.
3 DSN AND COMMUNITY DETECTION
In this work, we use a weighted, undirected graph 𝐺=⟨𝑉,𝐸,𝑈,𝑊⟩
to model the structure of a DSN, where a vertex 𝑣𝑖∈𝑉represents
a user, and an edge 𝑒𝑖 𝑗∈𝐸represents social interactions between
users𝑣𝑖and𝑣𝑗. A positive, real-valued weight 𝑢𝑖∈𝑈is assigned
to each vertex 𝑣𝑖following Eq. (2) to quantify the user’s activeness.
And a weight 𝑤𝑖 𝑗∈𝑊is assigned to each edge 𝑒𝑖 𝑗following Eq.
(1) to quantify the strength of social interactions between the users
connected by the edge. The type of social interaction studied in
this paper is the joint discussion relationship between users on

159ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore Liang Wang, Ying Li, Jierui Zhang, and Xianping Tao
OSS platforms such as GitHub. Platform users can post issues and
pull-requests to an OSS repository to ask questions and making
contributions [ 8,60]. They can also provide responses by leaving
comments under posted issues and pull-requests. We use the term
a conversation to refer to the collection of the initial body and all
the comments to a single issue or pull-request. There is an edge 𝑒𝑖 𝑗
between two users, 𝑣𝑖and𝑣𝑗, if they join the same conversation.
3.1 Construct DSN Snapshots
We construct a series of DSN snapshots from the conversations of
an OSS repository.
3.1.1 Data Segmentation. Given a series of temporally ordered con-
versations obtained from a project’s repository, ®D=⟨𝑑1,𝑑2,···,𝑑𝑁⟩,
where𝑑𝑖=⟨𝑡𝑖,𝑉𝑖⟩,𝑖=1···𝑁, records the creation time 𝑡𝑖, and the
set of participants4𝑉𝑖of the𝑖-th record, we apply a non-overlapping
sliding window of length 𝜔to divide®Dinto a series of segments
®S=⟨𝑠1,𝑠2,···,𝑠𝑇⟩. The𝑡-th segment in®Sinclude conversations
created in the 𝑡-th window, i.e., 𝑠𝑡={𝑑𝑖|𝑡1+(𝑡−1)𝜔≤𝑡𝑖<
𝑡1+𝑡𝜔)},𝑗=1···𝑇, where𝑡1is the creation time of 𝑑1.
3.1.2 Build Local DSNs from Data Segments. For each segment 𝑠𝑡∈
®S, we build its corresponding local DSN 𝐺𝐿
𝑡=⟨𝑉𝐿
𝑡,𝐸𝐿
𝑡,𝑈𝐿
𝑡,𝑊𝐿
𝑡⟩
by letting𝑉𝐿
𝑡to include all the participants of conversations in 𝑠𝑡,
and𝐸𝐿
𝑡to include all the joint discussion relationships between
the users in 𝑉𝐿
𝑡, respectively. There is an edge between user 𝑣𝑖and
𝑣𝑗if there is at least one conversation 𝑑𝑘∈𝑠𝑡that both users are
participants of 𝑑𝑘.𝑈𝐿
𝑡and𝑊𝐿
𝑡include the weights of users and
edges in the local DSN, which are calculated as follows.
For each edge 𝑒𝑖 𝑗∈𝐸𝐿
𝑡, there is a weight 𝑤𝑖 𝑗∈𝑊𝐿
𝑡that quanti-
fies the strength of interactions between user 𝑣𝑖and𝑣𝑗. Let𝑐𝑛𝑡𝑖 𝑗
be the count of conversations both 𝑣𝑖and𝑣𝑗participate in segment
𝑠𝑡, we assign the weight 𝑤𝑖 𝑗as follows.
𝑤𝑖 𝑗=ln(𝑐𝑛𝑡𝑖 𝑗+1) (1)
We take the natural logarithm of counts to prevent large counts to
overwhelm small ones. From Eq. (1), we have 𝑤𝑖 𝑗=0if𝑐𝑛𝑡𝑖 𝑗=0,
and𝑤𝑖 𝑗>0if𝑐𝑛𝑡𝑖 𝑗≥0. Note we always have 𝑐𝑛𝑡𝑖 𝑗=0if𝑖=𝑗.
Further, we assign a weight 𝑢𝑖∈𝑈𝐿
𝑡for each user 𝑣𝑖∈𝑉𝐿
𝑡to
quantify the user’s activeness in the DSN as follows.
𝑢𝑖=ln(|𝑉𝐿
𝑡|∑︁
𝑗=1𝑤𝑖 𝑗+1) (2)
where|𝑉𝐿
𝑡|is the number of users in segment 𝑠𝑡, and𝑤𝑖 𝑗is as
defined in Eq. (1). Intuitively, a user with a large weight is a user
who actively interactions with many other users, and is considered
important in the DSN. The minimal weight of a user 𝑣𝑖is𝑢𝑖=0if
the user does not communicate with any other user in the segment.
With the above approach, we can extract a series of temporally
ordered local DSNs®G𝐿=⟨𝐺𝐿
1,𝐺𝐿
2,···,𝐺𝐿
𝑇⟩from the segments ®S.
4The participants of a conversation include its author and all of the commenting users.
In this work, we omit the duration of conversations, and use the creation time to mark
the time of a conversation and all the joint discussion relations between its participants.
Future work can increase the temporal resolution by building DSN segments using
the time of each comment inside conversations when necessary.3.1.3 DSN Snapshots with Aggregated Local DSNs. While it is pos-
sible to perform subsequent community detection and evolution
analysis with the local DSNs above, it is not trivial to decide the
optimal window size 𝜔for segmentation [ 27]. A large window (e.g.,
from several months to a year [ 27]) allows us to take a compre-
hensive snapshot of the DSN with rich data. However, it keeps us
from performing fine-grained community evolution analysis due
to the large time gap between consecutive windows. On the other
hand, a small window allows us to perform fine-grained community
evolution analysis. But a short window may cover too few data to
generate a useful snapshot.
To support fine-grained analysis with sufficient data, we generate
DSN snapshots by aggregating multiple local DSNs built from one
week’s data. We empirically set each snapshot to contain twelve
local DSNs to cover data in three months. We assign more credits
to recent data than early data in the snapshot by multiplying a
decaying factor to the edge weights of the local DSNs. Let 𝐺𝐿
𝑡−𝑖be
the𝑖thlocal DSN being included in the snapshot for time 𝑡, we decay
its edge weights, 𝑊𝐿
𝑡−𝑖, with a factor 𝛾𝑖, where𝛾is heuristically set
to𝑒−1. With the above approach, we can obtain a series of DSN
snapshots®G=⟨𝐺1,𝐺2,···,𝐺𝑇⟩by aggregating local DSNs.
3.2 Detect Communities in DSN Snapshots
The communities studied in this work are groups of users with
close and intensive interactions among each other in a snapshot of
DSN. Given the 𝑡-th snapshot of a DSN, 𝐺𝑡=⟨𝑉𝑡,𝐸𝑡,𝑈𝑡,𝑊𝑡⟩∈®G,
we adopt the extension [ 12,42] of the Clauset-Newman-Moore
(CNM) greedy modularity maximization algorithm [ 41,43] to de-
tect the communities within it. Developed from the traditional
CNM algorithm for unweighted graphs, the extended version of
CNM performs community detection on weighted graphs using
the strength of connections between nodes indicated by the edge
weights. The result of community detection for 𝐺𝑡is a set of non-
overlapping communities 𝐶𝑡={𝑐𝑡,1,𝑐𝑡,2,···,𝑐𝑡,𝑛}, where𝑐𝑡,𝑖⊆𝑉𝑡
contains a subset of users in the social network with strong internal
joint discussion relationships5. Communities involve only a single
member are removed. By applying community detection to all the
snapshots in®G, we obtain a series of evolving communities over
time®C=⟨𝐶1,𝐶2,···,𝐶𝑡,···,𝐶𝑇⟩. In the next section, we propose
metrics to measure community evolution in ®C.
4 COMMUNITY EVOLUTION INDICES
Based on the temporally ordered series of communities ®Cdetected
in the above section, this section presents the process and metrics
proposed to measure community evolution.
4.1 Community Member Migration Matrix
Given two consecutive sets of communities in ®C, e.g.,𝐶𝑡and𝐶𝑡+1,
we compute a community member migration matrix to quantify
member migration between the communities as shown in Fig. 2(a).
Let𝑛=|𝐶𝑡|and𝑚=|𝐶𝑡+1|be the number of communities in 𝐶𝑡
and𝐶𝑡+1(without loss of generality, we assume 𝑛≥1and𝑚≥1),
5This work focuses on quantifying community evolution based on community detec-
tion results. The proposed indices can also be applied to overlapping communities
detected with methods like the clique percolation method proposed in [46, 47].

respectively, we obtain a (𝑛+1)×(𝑚+1)matrix𝑀𝑡where the
𝑖𝑗-th element 𝑎𝑖,𝑗is the number of members migrate from 𝑐𝑡,𝑖to
𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗, calculated following Eq. (3), for 𝑖≤𝑛and𝑗≤𝑚.
𝑎𝑖,𝑗=𝑐𝑡,𝑖∩𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗,𝑖=1,2,...,𝑛,𝑗 =1,2,...,𝑚 (3)
where𝑐𝑡,𝑖∩𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗is the set of common users in 𝑐𝑡,𝑖and𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗, i.e.,
the set of users in 𝑐𝑡,𝑖who migrate to 𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗. Member migration
between existing communities in consecutive time steps correspond
to the solid arrows in Fig. 2(b) and (c), respectively.
Two𝑁𝑢𝑙𝑙 communities, 𝑁𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑡+1and𝑁𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑡, are added to 𝐶𝑡+1
and𝐶𝑡to include members not involved in these communities. The
𝑁𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑡+1community involves members of a community in 𝐶𝑡who
leave the project in time 𝑡+1, i.e., members of 𝐶𝑡who do not show
in any community in 𝐶𝑡+1. And the𝑁𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑡community include newly
joined members in a community in 𝐶𝑡+1who do not appear in any
community in 𝐶𝑡. Elements related to the 𝑁𝑢𝑙𝑙 communities are in
the last column and row of 𝑀𝑡as illustrated in Fig. 2(a), which are
calculated following Eq. (4).

(and join an arbitrary community) in time 𝑡+1, andÐ𝑛
𝑖=1𝑎𝑖,𝑗is the
set of members in 𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗who migrate from an existing community
in time𝑡. As a result, members from 𝑐𝑡,𝑖who leave the project
(into𝑁𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑡+1), and members in 𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗who are new comers (from

𝑖=1𝑎𝑖,𝑗, which correspond to the dashed arrows in Fig. 2(b) and

𝑎𝑖,𝑗,𝑏𝑖, and𝑑𝑗, to keep it concise.
The weights on arrows in Fig. 2(b) quantify the distribution of
members migrate to different communities from 𝑐𝑡,𝑖with respect
to their weights at time 𝑡, which are obtained following Eq. (5).

and the subscript 𝑡indicate the weights are given by snapshot 𝐺𝑡:

4.2 Entropy-Based Community Evolution
Indices for A Single Community
In this section, we propose to measure the evolution of a single
community between consecutive time steps, i.e., time 𝑡and𝑡+1,
based on the information entropy of the weight distributions shown
in Fig. 2(b) and (c). While existing works describe community evolu-
tion with six patterns including split,shrink ,extinct ,merge ,expand ,
andemerge [27], we omit the extinct andemerge patterns because
they are special cases of community evolution studied in this work,
as discussed in Sec. 4.2.4. More importantly, different from existing
works [ 27,46] that assign a single pattern to each matched pair
of communities, we propose that all the evolutionary patterns can
be assigned to a community simultaneously during its evolution
with a numerical degree assigned to each pattern. As a result, we
can assess the evolution of DSN communities comprehensively and
quantitatively without requiring to find the match between prior
and post communities. Technical details are as follows.
4.2.1 The Split and Shrink Indices of Community 𝑐𝑡,𝑖.We use a
community detected in time 𝑡, i.e.,𝑐𝑡,𝑖, as shown in Fig. 2(b) to
explain how the split andshrink indices are calculated.
Given the𝑚+1communities in the next time step (which include
the𝑚detected communities in 𝐶𝑡+1, and𝑁𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑡+1), and the weight
vector⟨𝜓𝑖,1,𝜓𝑖,2,···,𝜓𝑖,𝑚,𝜂𝑖⟩, we obtain the distribution of users’
weights who stay in the project by normalizing their actual weights:

ent conditions specified by 𝑚,𝜂𝑖, and ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗. The even distribu-
tion corresponds to case ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗=1
𝑚,𝑗=1,···,𝑚. The random
distribution is obtained by randomly assigning ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗’s values.
Clearly, we haveÍ𝑚
𝑗=1ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗=1. And we can calculate the informa-
tion entropy [56] of the normalized weight vector by:
H𝑐𝑡,𝑖=−𝑚∑︁
𝑗=1ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗log2(ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗) (8)
With𝑚fixed, the entropyH𝑐𝑡,𝑖is upper-bounded by the following
maximum entropy obtained when ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗=1
𝑚,𝑗=1,2,···,𝑚:
H∗
𝑡→𝑡+1=−log2(1
𝑚) (9)
Intuitively,H𝑐𝑡,𝑖measures the degree of 𝑐𝑡,𝑖’s members spread into
different communities (excluding 𝑁𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑡+1) in the next step. And
H∗
𝑡→𝑡+1−H 𝑐𝑡,𝑖measures the degree of 𝑐𝑡,𝑖’s members gather to a
single community in the next step. Both H𝑐𝑡,𝑖andH∗
𝑡→𝑡+1−H 𝑐𝑡,𝑖
are equal or above zero. Based on the entropy in Eq. (8), we compute
community 𝑐𝑡,𝑖’ssplit andshrink indices as follows.
The split index of𝑐𝑡,𝑖, denoted asI𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖, measures the degree of
separation of its members into concrete communities detected in
the next step, which is calculated as:
I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=(1−𝜂𝑖)H𝑐𝑡,𝑖 (10)
where𝜂𝑖is defined in Eq. (5).
The shrink index of𝑐𝑡,𝑖, denoted asI𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖, measures the degree of
its members move to the 𝑁𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑡+1community in the next step:
I𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=𝜂𝑖(H∗
𝑡→𝑡+1−I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖+𝜎𝜂𝑖) (11)
where𝜎𝜂𝑖is defined as follows to guarantee that the shrink index
is always positive when 𝑚≥1and𝜂𝑖>0.
𝜎𝜂𝑖=(
0.5𝜂𝑖,𝑚=1,
0,𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒.(12)
4.2.2 Properties of the Split and Shrink Indices. Fig. 3 illustrates the
curves of the indices under varying conditions. The proposed split
index,I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖, and shrink index, I𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖, have the following properties
that are desirable when measuring community evolution. Without
loss of generality, we assume 𝑚≥1.
P-1.I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖andI𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖arestrictly monotonic increasing functions of
𝑚, given 0<𝜂𝑖<1, and ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗=1
𝑚,𝑗=1,2,···,𝑚.
Intuitively, the property states that when a fixed portion of mem-
bers in community 𝑐𝑡,𝑖leave the project (i.e., 𝜂𝑖fixed), and the
remaining members of 𝑐𝑡,𝑖who stay in the project migrate evenlyto the communities detected in the next step (i.e., ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗=1
𝑚,𝑗=
1,2,···,𝑚), the split and shrink indices increase with the increasing
number of communities detected in the next step (i.e., 𝑚). There are
two special cases that we always have I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=0andI𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=0, given
any𝑚≥1, when𝜂𝑖=1, and𝜂𝑖=0, respectively. The two cases
mean that, a community cannot split ( I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=0) if all of its members
leave the project ( 𝜂𝑖=1), and cannot shrink ( I𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=0) if none of
its members leave ( 𝜂𝑖=0), regardless the number of communities
detected in the next step (i.e., for any 𝑚≥1).
P-2.I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖/I𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖is astrictly monotonic decreasing / increasing
function of 𝜂𝑖, respectively, for 𝜂𝑖>0, given𝑚>1, and member
migration distribution ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗,𝑗=1,2,···,𝑚withH𝑐𝑡,𝑖>0.
Intuitively, this property states that the split / shrink index de-
creases / increases with the increasing portion of users who leave
the project (i.e., 𝜂𝑖), respectively. For the split index, when 𝑚=1, or
only one of the ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗’s is one with rest of the ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗’s equal to zero, we
haveI𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=0,∀𝜂𝑖∈[0,1]becauseH𝑐𝑡,𝑖=0(as discussed later in
P-3). This case means that a community is not regarded as splitting
if all of its remaining members migrate to a single community in the
next step, regardless the amount of members who leave the project.
For the shrink index I𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖, we guarantee that I𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖is a strictly mono-
tonic increasing function of 𝜂𝑖for𝜂𝑖>0and𝑚≥1by introducing
the term𝜎as defined in Eq. (12).
P-3. Given𝑚and𝜂𝑖, the maximum split index I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=(1−
𝜂𝑖)H∗
𝑡→𝑡+1is obtained when the members of 𝑐𝑡,𝑖migrate to the com-
munities detected in the next step with a even distribution, i.e., when
we have ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗=1
𝑚,𝑗=1,2,···,𝑚. And the minimum split index
I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=0is obtained when 𝑚=1or all the members of 𝑐𝑡,𝑖who
stay in the project migrate to a single community in the next step,
i.e., there exists a 𝑗′-th community in time 𝑡+1that ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗′=1and
ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗=0,∀𝑗≠𝑗′, resulting inH𝑐𝑡,𝑖=0andI𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=0.
P-4. Given𝑚>1and𝜂𝑖, the maximum shrink index I𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=
𝜂𝑖H∗
𝑡→𝑡+1is obtained when the corresponding split index is min-
imized, i.e., all stayed members of community 𝑐𝑡,𝑖migrate to a
single community in the next step. And the minimum shrink index
I𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=𝜂2
𝑖H∗
𝑡→𝑡+1is obtained when the members of 𝑐𝑡,𝑖migrate
evenly to communities in time 𝑡+1. For the special case of 𝑚=1,
the shrink index is only determined by 𝜂𝑖.
From properties P-3andP-4we can further see that given 𝑚>1,
the community split and shrink indices vary in the same range given
byI𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖∈ [0,−log21
𝑚], andI𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖∈ [0,−log21
𝑚], with different
values of𝜂𝑖and the distribution of member migration specified
byˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗,𝑗=1,2,···,𝑚. As a result, it is feasible for us to draw
meaningful results, such as the community shows a stronger trend of
splitting / shrinking , by directly comparing the values of community
split and shrink indices.
The above properties are important in understanding how the
indices vary with the change of underlying community structures,
showing that the indices are intuitively correct in describing com-
munity evolution. The proof is omitted in this paper due to page
limits, which can be found in our online material6.

4.2.3 The Merge and Expand Indices of 𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗.Next, to measure
community evolution on community 𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗’s side as shown in Fig.
2(c), we develop the merge andexpand indices of𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗following a
similar framework as described above.
Themerge index of𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗, denoted asI𝜙
𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗, measures the degree
of its members that come from different source communities in the
previous time step, which is calculated as follows.
I𝜙
𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗=(1−𝜇𝑗)H𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗 (13)
where𝜇𝑗andH𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗are defined in Eq. (6) and Eq. (15), respectively.
Theexpand index of𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗, denoted asI𝜇
𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗, measures the degree
of its members emerge from 𝑁𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑡in the previous step as follows.
I𝜇
𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗=𝜇𝑗(H∗
𝑡+1←𝑡−I𝜙
𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗+𝜎𝜇𝑗) (14)
where𝜎𝜇𝑗is as defined similar to 𝜎𝜂𝑖as follows.
𝜎𝜇𝑗=(
0.5𝜇𝑗,𝑛=1,
0,𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒.
The entropy values in the above equations are computed by:
H∗
𝑡+1←𝑡=−log2(1
𝑛),andH𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗=−𝑛∑︁
𝑖=1ˆ𝜙𝑖,𝑗log2(ˆ𝜙𝑖,𝑗)(15)
where ˆ𝜙𝑖,𝑗=𝜙𝑖,𝑗Í𝑛
𝑖=1𝜙𝑖,𝑗is the normalized weights. The merge andex-
pand indices have similar properties as split andshrink , respectively.
We omit the details to keep the paper concise.
4.2.4 Community Extinction and Emergence. With the above in-
dices, community extinction and emerges are two special combina-
tions of index values as follows:
The extinction of a community 𝑐𝑡,𝑖happens if all of its members
leave the project and migrate to 𝑁𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑡+1, which leads to the case
that𝜂𝑖=1andH𝑐𝑡,𝑖=0. In this case, the shrink index takes the
maximum value of I𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=H∗
𝑡→𝑡+1+𝜎𝜂𝑖7. And the split index takes
the minimum value of I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=0.
The emergence of a new community 𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗happens if all its
members are from 𝑁𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑡, in which case we have 𝜇𝑗=1, and
H𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗=0. In this case, the expand index takes the maximum
value ofI𝜇
𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗=H∗
𝑡+1←𝑡+𝜎𝜇𝑗. And the merge index takes the
minimum value of I𝜙
𝑐𝑡+1,𝑗=0.
There are more combinations of the index values that form mean-
ingful cases, which we leave for our future studies.
4.3 Aggregate Indices for All Communities
Following the above process, for each community we can obtain
indices that quantify its degree of split and shrink with respect
to the next step, and its degree of merge andexpand with respect
to the previous step. We calculate the aggregated indices for the
four patterns across all communities in the snapshot by taking the
weighted average of the communities’ indices, where the weight
for a community is the sum of node weights in the community over
the total weight of nodes in all communities. We can then obtain
7WhenI𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖takes the maximum value, we have 𝜎𝜂𝑖=0.5if𝑚=1, and 𝜎𝜂𝑖=0if
𝑚>1. Similar for the value of 𝜎𝜇𝑗in the case of emergence .four aggregated indices that measure the overall, snapshot-level
community evolution for each time step.
5 EMPIRICAL STUDIES
In this section, we conduct empirical studies to evaluate the validity
and usefulness of the proposed community evolution measures.
5.1 Preliminaries
5.1.1 Data Set. As summarized in Table 1, we collect a data set
involving thirty-two OSS projects on GitHub to conduct the studies.
The projects are randomly selected from a candidate set of popular
(with #𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑠≥1000 ) projects with sufficient data (with #𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣.≥
800) that cover different topics including programming language
(e.g., rails/rails ), social networks (e.g., sferik/twitter ), database (e.g.,
apache/couchdb ), mobile (e.g., Prinzhorn/skrollr ), etc. Among the
projects, twelve inactive projects–determined following the process
in [13]–are included to cover projects in different stages. For each
project, we retrieve data starting from its earliest record on the
platform to the end of May, 2019 from two sources: the GHTorrent
database [ 22] and the Github GraphQL API8. The data for issue
and pull-request discussions are extracted for community detection
and calculating community evolution indices. We also retrieve the
commit history of the repositories to support correlation analysis
between community evolution and team productivity.
5.1.2 Research Questions and Organization. The studies are de-
signed to answer two research questions as follows.
RQ 1. Validity. Are the indices capable to quantify community
evolution in DSNs? We evaluate the construct validity of the pro-
posed indices with the concurrent and discriminant validity criteria
following existing work and guides [ 31,38,51]. As defined in [ 31],
construct validity is “ the extent to which your measure or instrument
actually measures what it is theoretically supposed to measure ”. In
this work, we aim at showing the proposed indices are effective in
capturing and quantifying community evolutionary behaviors of
DSNs around OSS projects.
First, we adopt the concurrent validity criterion to validate the
proposed indices. Concurrent validity assesses the ability of a mea-
sure to distinguish between groups it should theoretically be able
to distinguish between [ 31,51]. In this work, we compare the cate-
gorical evolution patterns detected following an existing approach
[27] with the patterns detected using the proposed indices.
Next, we evaluate the discriminant validity of the indices which
requires the dimensions to be independent or orthogonal to each
other. Based on the properties of the indices discussed in Sec. 4.2.2,
and by further evaluating the discriminant validity of the mea-
sures, we aim at showing that the proposed indices are capable of
measuring different aspects of community evolution.
Unfortunately, we are unable to assess the convergent validity
of the proposed indices because to the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work that quantifies the degree of community evolution
that include different evolution patterns simultaneously. Besides
validity, we also study the usefulness of the indices in predicting
OSS development with the following research question.

†The size of a community is the sum of its members’ node weights. We modify the rule
for shrink in [ 27] following [ 71] to compare the size of 𝑐𝑡,𝑖with its post community
to make the detection results temporally aligned and comparable with ours.
RQ 2. Usefulness. Are the proposed indices correlated to team pro-
ductivity? We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed indices
by studying their correlations with project teams’ productivity mea-
sured by the count of commits [ 11,64] using regression analysis.
Details of the studies and their results are as follows.
5.2 Concurrent Validity
We evaluate the concurrent validity of the proposed indices by com-
paring the community evolution pattern detection results of our
approach and existing approaches. We adopt the process proposed
in [27] to detect community evolution patterns in DSNs which serve
as the ‘ground-truth’ for evaluation. More specifically, for consecu-
tive time steps 𝑡and𝑡+1, we first calculate the similarity betweeneach pair of communities detected in the two DSN snapshots. The
generation of DSN snapshots and detection of communities are the
same as introduced in Sec. 3 to conduct a fair comparison. Slightly
different from the original algorithm, the size of a community is
defined as the sum of its members’ weights instead of the count
of its members. The similarity of two communities is the sum of
weights of their common nodes over the smaller value of the two
communities’ total weights. We take the threshold of 0.3 proposed
in the original work to perform community matching. Based on
the matching results, we adopt rules in Table 2 to determine the
evolution patterns for each community. We modify the rule for
determining community shrink by comparing a community’s size
with its matching community in the next step to make the results
comparable with ours. With these rules, for each community, we
can assign two evolution patterns to it: 1) one to describe how it
evolves towards the next step, which can be extinct ,split, orshrink ;
2) the other to describe how it evolves from the previous step, which
includes emerge ,merge , and expand . An undefined pattern is added
to label cases that are not included in the existing set of rules.
For community evolution pattern detection using the indices
proposed in this paper, we simply compare the index values to
determine the patterns of community split,shrink ,merge , and ex-
pand as shown in Table 2. For a community, say community 𝑐𝑡,𝑖, to
extinct , the ideal case is that its split index is zero ( I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=0), and
its shrink index takes the maximum value ( I𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖=H∗
𝑡→𝑡+1+𝜎𝜂𝑖)
as discussed in Sec. 4.2.4. However, this condition is too stringent
to effectively detecting community extinction in real-world data.
As a result, we relax the condition as shown in Table 2 that label a
community to extinct when its split index is close to zero, and its
shrink index is close to the maximum value. The same relaxation
also applies to the rule to detect community emerge .
The confusion matrix that compares the ground-truth and our
detection results is shown in Fig. 4(a). The overall accuracy of
our approach involving all six patterns and the undefined pattern
is 89.2%. Because the undefined pattern is not clearly defined in
existing work [ 27,46], we also evaluate the accuracy by removing
theundefined label (i.e., by removing the last column and row in the
confusion matrix). Without the undefined label, the overall accuracy
is 84.7%. From Fig. 4(a), we can observe that 52% of the shrink cases

are classified as split with our approach. And 45.8% of the expand
cases are detected as merge . This is because there is a threshold
of 0.3 to filter out matching but less similar communities in the
existing approach. As a result, the ground-truth is biased to shrink
and expand compared to our approach which does not perform
filtering. Since there is no evidence showing that the threshold of
0.3 is the optimal one, we repeat the test by setting a threshold of
0.1 to increase the chance of community matching when obtaining
the ground-truth. As shown in Fig. 4(b), we can observe that the
detection accuracy with and without the undefined pattern increases
to 92.7% and 94.1%, respectively.
The above results suggest that, with a simple set of rules, the
proposed indices can accurately distinguish between different pat-
terns of community evolution which are consistent with the results
obtained following the existing approach [ 27]. We conclude that the
proposed indices for community evolution are valid with respect
to the concurrent validity criterion.
5.3 Discriminant Validity
We calculate the Spearman’s Correlation Coefficients of each pair of
the indices given a project. Spearman’s Correlation Coefficients are
selected over the Pearson’s Correlation Coefficients because we find
that the indices do not always follow normal distributions. We adopt
the rule of thumb in [ 2,18] to interpret the correlation coefficients,
i.e., the𝑟values, as summarized in Table 3. It is worth noting that
a strong correlation alone does not invalidate the design of the
proposed measure because the correlations between community
evolution indices are largely determined by the members’ activities
in real-world OSS repositories. The phenomenon we would like
to observe in this study is that whether there are occasions that
the indices are weakly correlated in the real-world. Combining the
results in this study and the properties of the indices as discussed in
Sec. 4, we aim at showing that the proposed indices are measuring
different aspects of community evolution.Table 4: Pairwise correlation of the aggregated indices (Spear-
man’s Correlation Coefficient). Project No. follow Table 1.

over half of the projects only show a moderate correlation between
a single pair of indices. As summarized in the last row of Table 4,
most of the pairs show a weak, but significant correlation with 𝑟
values below 0.4. The merge andexpand indices show a moderate
correlation with a 𝑟value of 0.4, which is at the borderline between
a moderate and weak correlation.
An interesting discovery made from the results is that the split
andmerge indices show a moderate correlation for most of projects,
and even a strong correlation for five projects. The overall cor-
relation coefficient between split and merge is 0.68, suggesting
a positive, moderate correlation which is statistically significant.
Recall the way we calculate community split andmerge , and the
results of concurrent validity presented above, it is clear that the
two indices are capable of measuring different patterns of commu-
nity evolution. The correlation between split andmerge is a natural
result emerges from the issue and pull-request discussion activ-
ities of the community members. A possible explanation to this
positive correlation is that real-world communities often regroup
themselves in OSS projects studied in this paper. It is our future
work to inspect more patterns of community evolution based on
the proposed indices.
5.4 Correlation with Team Productivity
The last study demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed indices
in predicting OSS project teams’ productivity. We operationalize
OSS team productivity by the count of commits pushed to the
repository following existing work [ 11,64]. We perform regression
analysis with the linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) to study the
correlation between the indices and team productivity. Compared to
simple linear models, LMMs allow random effects to be included in
the analysis. In this study, the random effects are the effects caused
by the differences of OSS projects. For each snapshot extracted
following Sec. 3.1, we obtain a sample consists of six variables
as follows. First, the outcome variable is the count of commits in
a snapshot. Second, the aggregated indices for community split,
shrink ,merge and expand are used as the independent variables.
Log transformation is performed to the above variables to stabilize
variance and reduce heteroscedasticity [ 1,33]. Finally, the project
name is included in each sample as the indicator for random effects.
The results are shown in Table 5. The variance inflation factors
(VIFs) for predictors including split,shrink ,merge , and expand arebelow 1.5, which are well below the suggested threshold of 5 in exist-
ing guidelines [ 14,33], suggesting that there is no strong collinear-
ity among the predictors. The conditional R-squared 𝑅2𝑐=0.455 is
greater than the marginal R-squared 𝑅2𝑚=0.139, suggesting that the
adoption of LMMs for regression analysis is suitable.
The results suggest, after log transformation, all the indices
show a significant correlation with team productivity. Three indices
including split,shrink , and merge are positively correlated with team
productivity. It is surprising to find that expand shows a negative
effect. By further observing the coefficients and ‘Sum Sq.’, we can
find that split andmerge are more important predictors than shrink
andexpand . A possible explanation to the effects of split andmerge
is that members of communities with high degrees of split andmerge
are actively regrouping themselves to join issue and pull-request
discussions which results in productive teams. And a potential
reason for the negative effects of expand is that team performance
are known to be influenced by many factors beyond team size,
e.g., team diversity [ 52,64], developer synchronization [ 70], etc.
Growth in team size potentially increases the communication and
coordination costs which reduce the working efficiency. The above
results, together with the results in Sec. 5.3, inspire us to explore
different combinations of the indices as meaningful patterns, and
to conduct more studies to understand the effects of community
evolution in team productivity and performance in our future work.
In summary, the regression model achieves an accuracy (i.e., the
correlation coefficient between the actual and the predicted value of
the outcome [ 35]) of 0.718, suggesting that the aggregated indices of
community evolution are useful predictors of team productivity. A
potential threat to the robustness of the results is that non-normality
and heteroscedasticity of the residuals are detected. We consult
the literature [ 21,32,54], and conclude that the above results are
trustworthy after carefully inspecting the Q-Q diagram.
6 THREATS TO VALIDITY
We present a discussion the threats to validity as follows.
Internal Validity. We conduct a data-driven approach to reveal
the correlation between community evolution and OSS develop-
ment such as team productivity. However, there are many other
factors that are known to affect or characterize the operation of OSS
teams [ 11,55]. As a result, the conclusions made in this paper do not
fully explain how OSS teams behave or imply a causal relationship.
Instead, the proposed indices should be used as useful supplements
to existing measures of DSN and community evolution.
External Validity. We select thirty-two projects that cover var-
ious topics and status in our study. However, the collection of
projects is small compared to the number of projects hosted on
GitHub and other platforms. The conclusions made in this paper
may not generalize well to other projects. It is our future work to
include more projects in our studies.
Construct Validity. The indices are designed on top of the well-
established theory of information entropy to measure community
evolution with clear properties about how their values respond
to parameter changes. We evaluate the construct validity of the
proposed indices in terms of concurrent and discriminant validity.
We plan to seek more criteria to validate our approach in the future.

7 RELATED WORK
From a general perspective, this work belongs to the series of re-
search about the social aspects of OSS development started since
the beginning of the OSS movement [ 24,37,61]. In this section, we
introduce work closely related to this paper.
OSS projects are developed and maintained by the collaborative
efforts of OSS contributors over channels such as mailing lists [7],
and on “social coding platforms” [ 17,62,68] such as GitHub and Git-
Lab. The interactions of OSS contributors naturally generate social
networks around OSS projects, which is refer to as the developer
social networks (DSNs) in existing literature [ 27]. Different types of
DSNs–including communication [ 3,5,7,16,20,25,27,44,49,67],
collaboration [ 24,30,57,58,66], and hybrid [ 48,60] networks–have
been extracted by mining developer mailing lists and OSS reposito-
ries to study the properties and evolution of DSNs. The extracted
DSNs are often modeled as graphs [ 3,27]. In this work, weighted,
undirected graphs are used to model DSNs that reveal the commu-
nication structures of OSS contributors, based on which a series
of indices are proposed to quantify the evolution of communities
inside DSNs. It should be noted that the proposed approach can
also be applied to DSNs of other types.
Technologies for social network analysis (SNA) are applied to
DSNs to understand the properties, the structures, and the evolution
of DSNs. Readers can refer to [ 12,26,55] for comprehensive surveys
for social network and community analysis in DSNs. Different from
work that performs analysis to static DSNs [ 7,16,29,60,69], this
work focuses on understanding the dynamic evolution of DSNs
over time. Many studies about DSN evolution are conducted by an-
alyzing the changes and trend in series of DSN snapshots take over
time [ 3,25,27,28,30,39,44,66]. Network metrics, such as network
diameter, shortest path between nodes, node betweenness, modu-
larity, hierarchy, centrality, clustering coefficient, etc, are adopted
in existing work [ 3,12,25,28,30,50] to assess the properties of
DSNs. There are also metrics developed exclusively to measure
software communities [ 66]. Based on these metrics, statistical and
data mining technologies are applied to understand the evolution
of DSNs [ 28,59]. This work is related to the above work in that
we propose indices to quantify the evolution of DSN communities
which can support further analysis including but not limited to
regression analysis, and pattern detection as shown in our studies.
Different from the above work that takes the network perspective,
this work takes the community perspective [ 3] and analyzes the
evolutionary behaviors of communities in DSNs.
The patterns adopted in this paper that describe the evolution-
ary behaviors of DSN communities are originally proposed in [ 46],
which involve six patterns as introduced in the rest of the paper.
These patterns are shown to be promising in describing the evo-
lution of communities in various types of social networks such as
co-authorship, phone call, and blog networks [ 34,46]. In [ 27], the
authors adopt these patterns to characterize community evolution
in OSS projects including Firefox, and Bugzilla. Similar patterns
are also adopted in [ 3] to describe the evolution of DSNs at the
community level. This work is closely related to the above work in
that we also adopt the patterns as the basis to describe community
evolution. Different from these approaches that assign a unique,
nominal pattern to a matched pair of communities in consecutivetime steps, we quantify the degree of different patterns which can
occur simultaneously during the evolution of the communities.
Other differences of this work from the above work include: 1)
community emerge andextinct are defined by combinations of the
indices. As a result, we only include indices for four patterns as
introduced in the paper; and 2) we do not require to match commu-
nities detected in different time steps to recognize them as a single
evolving community, which is a challenging task [ 46] that can lead
to biases if not treated with caution.
Finally, we note that the community evolution patterns studied
in this work are about the patterns introduced above, which are
different from the general patterns of OSS evolution in existing
work, which include studies that characterize the process of prefer-
ential attachment in OSS developers when forming DSNs [ 67], or
the stages of OSS project evolution [40], etc.
8 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present four entropy-based indices to measure the
degree of community evolutionary behaviors with respect to pat-
terns including split,shrink ,merge , and expand to understand the
evolution of DSNs around OSS projects. This work bridges the gap
between pattern-based approaches which can provide meaningful
insights about the evolution of DSNs from the community perspec-
tive, and metric-based social network analysis which can support
comprehensive and quantitative analysis. The construct validity of
the proposed indices are evaluated on a real-world data set about
the issue and pull-request discussions in thirty-two OSS projects.
The results suggest the indices can accurately capture different
patterns of community evolution by achieving a detection accu-
racy of 94.1% compared to existing work [ 27], and show weak and
moderate correlations. The results also show that the indices can
accurately predict OSS team productivity after log transformation
with linear mixed-effects models.
The proposed indices can be used and extended in many ways
to support future studies. For example, we can use the indices
to assess and predict the behavior and status of OSS teams and
projects, e.g., to assess the health of OSS teams, and to predict OSS
projects’ sustainability [ 51]. More patterns of community evolution
can be developed based on combinations of the indices, e.g., com-
munity regroup as discussed in Sec. 5.3, following the way we define
community emerge and extinct . We can also apply the proposed
framework to other types of DSNs, e.g., collaboration networks
[30], to understand their evolution.
