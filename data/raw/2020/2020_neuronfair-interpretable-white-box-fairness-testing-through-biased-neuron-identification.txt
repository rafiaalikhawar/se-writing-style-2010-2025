ABSTRACT
Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their outper-
formance in various domains. However, it raises a social concern
whether DNNs can produce reliable and fair decisions especially
when they are applied to sensitive domains involving valuable re-
source allocation, such as education, loan, and employment. It is
crucial to conduct fairness testing before DNNs are reliably de-
ployed to such sensitive domains, i.e., generating as many instances
as possible to uncover fairness violations. However, the existing
testing methods are still limited from three aspects: interpretabil-
ity, performance, and generalizability. To overcome the challenges,
we propose NeuronFair, a new DNN fairness testing framework
that differs from previous work in several key aspects: (1) inter-
pretable - it quantitatively interprets DNNs’ fairness violations
for the biased decision; (2) effective - it uses the interpretation
results to guide the generation of more diverse instances in less
time; (3) generic - it can handle both structured and unstructured
data. Extensive evaluations across 7 datasets and the correspond-
ing DNNs demonstrate NeuronFair’s superior performance. For
instance, on structured datasets, it generates much more instances
(∼×5.84) and saves more time (with an average speedup of 534.56%)
compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the instances
of NeuronFair can also be leveraged to improve the fairness of
the biased DNNs, which helps build more fair and trustworthy
deep learning systems. The code of NeuronFair is open-sourced at

1 INTRODUCTION
Deep neural networks (DNNs) [ 39] have been increasingly adopted
in many fields, including computer vision [ 5], natural language pro-
cessing [ 21,22,40,41], software engineering [ 13,18,34,42,51], etc.
However, one of the crucial factors hindering DNNs from further
serving applications with social impact is the unintended individual
discrimination [ 47,49,59]. Individual discrimination exists when a
given instance different from another only in sensitive attributes
(e.g., gender, race, etc.) but receives a different prediction outcome
from a given DNN [ 3]. Taking gender discrimination in salary pre-
diction as an example, for two identical instances except for the gen-
der attribute, male’s annual income predicted by the DNN is often
higher than female’s [ 37]. Thus, it is of great importance for stake-
holders to uncover fairness violations and then to reduce DNNs’
discrimination so as to responsibly deploy fair and trustworthy deep
learning systems in many sensitive scenarios [12, 26, 32, 45, 50].
Much effort has been put into uncovering fairness violations [ 7,
8,11,16,24,27,31,46,56]. The most common method is fairness
testing [ 2,3,9,23,25,55,60,61], which solves this problem by
generating as many instances as possible. Initially, fairness testing
is designed to uncover and reduce the discrimination in traditional
machine learning (ML) with low-dimensional linear models. How-
ever, such methods are suffering from several problems. First, most
of them (e.g., FairAware [ 23], BlackFT [ 3], and FlipTest [ 9]) cannot
handle DNNs with high-dimensional nonlinear structures. Then,
though some of them (e.g., Themis [ 25], SymbGen [ 2], and Ae-
quitas [ 55]) can be applied to test DNNs, they are still challenged
by the high time cost and numerous duplicate instances. Recently,
several methods have been specifically developed for DNNs, such
as ADF [ 61] and EIDIG [ 60], etc. These methods make progress in

effectiveness and efficiency through gradient guidance, but they
still suffer from the following problems.
First, these methods can hardly be generalized to unstructured
data. As we know, DNNs are originally designed to process unstruc-
tured data (e.g., image, text, speech, etc.), but most existing fairness
testing methods [ 2,25,55] cannot be applied to these data. It is
mainly because these methods cannot determine which features are
related to sensitive attributes, and cannot implement appropriate
modifications to these features, e.g., how to determine pixels related
to gender attribute in face images, and how to modify these pixel
values to change gender [ 57]. However, even a seemingly simple
task such as face detection [ 36] is subject to extreme amounts of
fairness violations. It is especially concerning since these facial
systems are often not deployed in isolation but rather as part of
the surveillance or criminal detection pipeline [ 4]. Therefore, these
testing methods still cannot serve DNNs widely until we solve the
problem of data generalization.
Second, the generation effectiveness of these methods is chal-
lenged by gradient vanishing. They leverage the gradient-guided
strategy to improve generation efficiency, but the gradient may
vanish and cause instance generation to fail. Additionally, when
the gradient is small, the generated instances are highly similar.
However, the purpose of fairness testing is to generate not only the
numerous instances, but also the diverse instances.
Third, almost all existing methods hardly provide interpretabil-
ity. They only focus on generating numerous instances, but cannot
interpret how the biased decisions occurred. DNNs’ decision results
are determined by neuron activation, then we try to study these
neurons that cause biased decisions. We find that the instances gen-
erated by existing testing methods will miss the coverage of these
neurons that cause biased decisions (refer to the experiment result
in Fig. 6). More seriously, we cannot even know which neurons
related to biased decisions have been missed for testing when there
is a lack of interpretability. Therefore, we need an interpretable test-
ing method so as to interpret DNNs’ biased decisions and evaluate
instances’ utility for uncovering fairness violations. Based on these,
the interpretation results can guide us to design effective testing
to uncover more discrimination. In summary, the current fairness
testing challenges lie in the lack of data generalization, generation
effectiveness, and discrimination interpretation.
To overcome the above challenges, our design goals are as fol-
lows: 1) we intend to uncover and quantitatively interpret DNNs’
discrimination; 2) then, we plan to apply this interpretation results
to guide fairness testing; 3) furthermore, we want to generalize our
testing method to unstructured data. Due to the decision results
of DNNs are determined by the nonlinear combination of each
neuron’s activation state, thus we imagine whether the biased de-
cisions are caused by some neurons. Then, we try to observe the
neuron activation state in DNNs’ hidden layers through feeding
instance pair, which is two identical instances except for the sensi-
tive attribute. Surprisingly, we find that the activation state follows
such a pattern, i.e., neurons with drastically varying activation val-
ues are overlapping for different instance pairs. We observe that
DNNs’ discrimination is reduced when these overlapped neurons
are zeroed out. Therefore, we speculate that these neurons causethe DNNs’ discrimination. Then, we intend to quantitatively in-
terpret DNNs’ discrimination by computing the neuron activation
difference (ActDiff) values.
According to the interpretation results, we further design a test-
ing method, NeuronFair, to optimize gradient guidance. First, we
determine the main neurons that cause discrimination, called bi-
ased neurons. Then, we search for discriminatory instances with
the optimization object of increasing the ActDiff values of biased
neurons. Because the optimization from the biased neuron short-
ens the derivation path, it reduces the probability of the gradient
vanishing and time cost. Moreover, we can produce more diverse
instances through the dynamic combination of biased neurons. All
in all, we leverage the interpretation results to optimize gradient
guidance, which is beneficial to the generation effectiveness.
We leverage adversarial attacks [ 14,28,38] to determine which
features are related to sensitive attributes, and make appropriate
modifications to these features. The adversarial attack is originally
to test the DNNs’ security, e.g., slight modifications to some image
pixels will cause the predicted label to flip [ 10,15,19,53]. Taking
the gender attribute of face image as an example, we consider
training a classifier with ‘male’ and ‘female’ as labels, then adding
the perturbation to the face image until its predicted gender label
flips. Based on this generalization framework, we can modify the
sensitive attributes of any data, thereby generalizing NeuronFair to
any data type.
In summary, we first implement to quantitatively interpret the
discrimination using neuron-based analysis; then, we leverage the
interpretation results to optimize the instance generation; finally,
we design a generalization framework for sensitive attribute modi-
fication. The main contributions are as follows.
•Through the neuron activation analysis, we quantitatively inter-
pret DNNs’ discrimination, which provides a new perspective
for measuring discrimination and guides DNNs’ fairness testing.
•Based on the interpretation results, we design a novel method for
DNNs’ discriminatory instance generation, NeuronFair, which
significantly outperforms previous works in terms of effective-
ness.
•Inspired by adversarial attacks, we design a generalization frame-
work to modify sensitive attributes of unstructured data, which
generalizes NeuronFair to unstructured data.
•We publish our NeuronFair as a self-contained open-source
toolkit online.
2 BACKGROUND
To better understand the problem we are tackling and the method-
ology we propose in later sections, we first introduce DNN, data
form, individual discrimination, and our problem definition.
DNN . A DNN can be represented as 𝑓(𝑥;Θ):X→Y , including
an input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer [ 29,58].
Two popular architectures of DNNs are fully connected network
(FCN) and convolutional neural network (CNN). For a FCN, we
denote the activation output of each neuron in the hidden layer as:
𝑓𝑘
𝑙(𝑥;Θ), where Θis the weights, 𝑙∈{1,2,...,𝑁𝑙},𝑁𝑙is the number
of neural layers, 𝑘∈{1,2,...,𝑁𝑘
𝑙},𝑁𝑘
𝑙is the number of neurons in
the𝑙-th layer. For a CNN, we flatten the output of the convolutional
layer for the calculation of neuron activation. The loss function of

Figure 1: Illustration of discriminatory instance generation
on Adult dataset [37]. (i) The discriminatory instance gen-
eration process. The normal instance pair is <𝑥,𝑥′>and
the discriminatory instance pair is <𝑥𝑑,𝑥′
𝑑>.𝑥′=𝑥+Δ𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑡 ,
𝑥𝑑=𝑥+Δ𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠,𝑥′
𝑑=𝑥+Δ𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑡 +Δ𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠, where Δ𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠is the bias per-
turbation, Δ𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑡 is the perturbation added to the gender
attribute to flip gender. (ii) Discrimination exists when the
instance’s predicted label changes as the gender attribute is
flipped, i.e., the instance crosses the decision boundary.
DNNs is defined as follows:
𝐽(𝑥,𝑦;Θ)=−1
𝑁hÕ𝑁−1
𝑖=0Õ𝑀−1
𝑗=0 𝑦𝑖,𝑗×log(ˆ𝑦𝑖,𝑗)i
(1)
where𝑁is the number of instances, 𝑀is the number of classes, 𝑦𝑖
is the ground-truth of 𝑥𝑖,ˆ𝑦𝑖=𝑓(𝑥𝑖;Θ)is the predicted probability,
log(·)is a logarithmic function.
Data Form . Denote𝑋={𝑥𝑖},𝑌={𝑦𝑖}as a normal dataset, and
its instance pairs by <𝑋,𝑋′>={<𝑥𝑖,𝑥′
𝑖>},𝑖∈{0,1,...,𝑁−1}. For
an instance, we denote its attributes by 𝐴={𝑎𝑖},𝑖∈{0,1,...,𝑁𝑎−1},
where𝐴𝑠⊂𝐴is a set of sensitive attributes, and 𝐴𝑛𝑠={𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝑖|𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝑖∈
𝐴,and𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝑖∉𝐴𝑠}is a set of non-sensitive attributes. Note that
sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, age, etc.) are usually given in
advance according to specific sensitive scenes.
Individual Discrimination . As stated in previous work [ 3,23],
individual discrimination exists when two valid inputs which differ
only in the sensitive attributes but receive a different prediction
result from a given DNN, as shown in Fig. 1. Such two valid inputs
are called individual discriminatory instances (IDIs).
Definition 1: IDI determination. We denote <𝑋𝑑,𝑋′
𝑑>={<
𝑥𝑑,𝑖,𝑥′
𝑑,𝑖>}as a set of IDI pairs, which satisfies:
𝑓(𝑥𝑑,𝑖;Θ)≠𝑓(𝑥′
𝑑,𝑖;Θ)
s.t.𝑥𝑑,𝑖[As]≠𝑥′
𝑑,𝑖[As], 𝑥𝑑,𝑖[Ans]=𝑥′
𝑑,𝑖[Ans](2)
where𝑖∈{0,1,...,𝑁𝑑−1},𝑥𝑑,𝑖[As]represents the value of 𝑥𝑑,𝑖
with respect to attribute 𝐴𝑠. Note that our instances are generative
(e.g., maybe the age of a generated instance is 150 years old on
Adult dataset), thus we need to clip their attribute values that do
not exist in the input domain I.
3 NEURONFAIR
An overview of NeuronFair is presented in Fig. 2. NeuronFair has
two parts, i.e., discrimination interpretation and IDI generation
based on interpretation results. During the discrimination interpre-
tation, we first interpret why discrimination exists through neuron-
based analysis. Then, we design a discrimination metric based on
the interpretation result, i.e., AUC value, as shown in Fig. 2 (i). AUC
is the area under AS curve, where the AS curve records the percent-
age of neurons above the ActDiff threshold. Finally, we leverage the
AS curve to adaptively identify biased neurons, which serves for
Figure 2: An overview of NeuronFair.
IDI generation. During the IDI generation, we employ the biased
neurons to perform global and local generations. The global phase
guarantees the diversity of the generated instances, and the local
phase guarantees the quantity, as shown in Fig. 2 (ii). On the one
hand, the global generation uses the normal instance as a seed and
stops if an IDI is generated or it times out. On the other hand, the
generated IDIs are adopted as seeds of local generation, leading to
generate as many IDIs as possible near the seeds. Besides, we imple-
ment dynamic combinations of biased neurons to increase diversity,
and use the momentum strategy to accelerate IDI generation. In
the following, we first quantitatively interpret DNNs’ discrimina-
tion, then present details of IDI generation based on interpretation
results, and finally generalize NeuronFair to unstructured data.
3.1 Quantitative Discrimination Interpretation
First, we draw AS curve and compute AUC value to measure DNNs’
discrimination. Then, based on the measurement results, we identify
the key neurons that cause unfair decisions as biased neurons.
3.1.1 Discrimination Measurement. The ActDiff is calculated as
follows:
𝑧𝑘
𝑙=1
𝑁Õ𝑁−1
𝑖=0[abs(𝑓𝑘
𝑙(𝑥𝑖;Θ)−𝑓𝑘
𝑙(𝑥′
𝑖;Θ))] (3)
where𝑧𝑘
𝑙is the ActDiff of the 𝑘-th neuron in the 𝑙-th layer,𝑙∈
{1,2,...,𝑁𝑙},𝑁𝑙is the layer number, 𝑁is the number of normal
instance pairs <𝑋,𝑋′>={<𝑥𝑖,𝑥′
𝑖>},𝑖∈{0,1,2,...,𝑁−1},abs(·)
returns an absolute value, 𝑓𝑘
𝑙(𝑥;Θ)returns the activation output of
the𝑘-th neuron in the 𝑙-th layer, Θrepresents the model weights.
Based on Eq. (3), we plot AS curve and compute AUC value. We
first compute each neuron’s ActDiff and normalize it by hyperbolic
tangent function Tanh(·), as shown in Fig.3 (i). “L1” means the
1-st hidden layer of a DNN with 64 neurons. Then, we set several
ActDiff thresholds at equal intervals, count the neuron percentages
above the ActDiff thresholds, and record them as sensitive neuron
rate (SenNeuR). Finally, we plot AS curve according to the SenNeuR
under different ActDiff thresholds, and then compute the area under
AS curve as AUC value, as shown in Fig.3 (ii), where the x-axis is the
ActDiff value normalized by Tanh function, the y-axis is SenNeuR.

Save𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 as the AUC of the 𝑙-th layer.
13End For
Repeat such an operation for each layer, we can intuitively observe
the discrimination in each layer and find the most biased layer with
the largest AUC value. As shown in Fig. 2 (i), the 2-nd layer ‘L2’ is
selected as the most biased layer with AUC=0.7513.
More specific operations on AS curve drawing and AUC calcu-
lation are shown in Algorithm 1 . First, we compute the average
ActDiff values of each neuron 𝑧𝑘
𝑙at line 1. In the loop from lines
7 to 9, for each neural layer, we get SenNeuR for plotting the AS
curve. Then, we compute AUC value by integration at line 11.
3.1.2 Biased Neuron Identification. The most biased layer is se-
lected for adaptive biased neuron identification. A neuron with a
large𝑧𝑘
𝑙value demonstrates that it responds violently to the modi-
fication of sensitive attributes, thus it carries more discrimination.
We define biased neuron as follows.
Definition 2: Biased neuron. For a given discrimination threshold
𝑇𝑑of the most biased layer, the biased neurons satisfy the condition
𝑧𝑘>𝑇𝑑.𝑧𝑘is the average ActDiff normalized by Tanh(·)of the
𝑘-th neuron in the most biased layer, 𝑘∈{1,2,...,𝑁𝑘},𝑇𝑑∈(0,1).
Based on the Definition 2, we know that once 𝑇𝑑is determined,
biased neurons can be found. Here we give a strategy for adaptively
determining 𝑇𝑑. We draw a line 𝑦=𝑥that intersects the AS curve.
The x-axis’s value of this intersection is 𝑇𝑑. As shown in Fig. 3
(ii), the intersection is the point (0.33, 32.81%) and 𝑇𝑑=0.33, After
determining 𝑇𝑑, we record these biased neurons and save theirAlgorithm 2: Global generation guided by biased neurons.

works well in practice as the discrimination is often concentrated
on a few certain neurons, rendering a normal distribution of the
ActDiff’s frequency map.
3.2 Interpretation-based IDI Generation
NeuronFair generates IDIs in two phases, i.e., a global generation
phase and a local generation phase. The global phase aims to ac-
quire diverse IDIs. The IDIs’ diversity in the global phase is crucial
since these instances serve as seeds for the local phase. Instead, to
guarantee the IDIs’ quantity, the local phase aims to search for as
many IDIs as possible near the seeds.
3.2.1 Global Generation. To increase the IDIs’ diversity, we design
a dynamic loss as follows:
𝐽𝑑𝑙(𝑥;Θ)=−1
𝑁𝑁−1Õ
𝑖=0𝑁𝑘Õ
𝑘=1[(𝑝𝑘|𝑟𝑘)×𝑓𝑘(𝑥′
𝑖;Θ)× log(𝑓𝑘(𝑥𝑖;Θ))] (4)

the number of neurons in the most biased layer, 𝑓𝑘is the activation
output of the 𝑘-th neuron.𝑝is the position of biased neurons, 𝑟is the
position of randomly selected neurons to increase the dynamics of
𝐽𝑑𝑙(𝑥;Θ).𝑟=𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑(0,1)(𝑝𝑟), where𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑(0,1)(𝑝𝑟)returns a random
vector with only ‘0’ or ‘1’. 𝑟has the same size as 𝑝and satisfiesÍ𝑟=INT(𝑁𝑘×𝑝𝑟), where INT(·)returns an integer. Here, we set
𝑝𝑟=5%. ‘|’ means ‘or’, 𝑝𝑘|𝑟𝑘=0if and only𝑝𝑘=0and𝑟𝑘=0. The
optimization object of IDI generation is: arg max𝐽𝑑𝑙(𝑥;Θ).
Algorithm 2 shows the details of global generation with mo-
mentum acceleration. We first adopt k-means clustering function
KMeans(𝑋,𝑁𝑐) to process 𝑋into𝑁𝑐clusters, and then get seeds
from clusters in a round-robin fashion at line 3. We update random

vector𝑟at equal intervals from lines 5 to 7, not only to increase the
dynamics but also to avoid excessively disturbing the generation
task. According to Definition 1, we determine the IDIs from lines 8
to 12. We employ the momentum acceleration operation at lines
13 and 14, which can effectively use historical gradient and reduce
invalid searches. Note that we keep the value of the sensitive at-
tribute in𝑥at line 16. Finally, we clip the value of 𝑥to satisfy the
input domain I.
3.2.2 Local Generation. Since the local generation aims to find
as many IDIs as possible near the seeds, we increase the iteration
number of each seed 𝑚𝑎𝑥−𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑙, and reduce the bias perturbation
added in each iteration, as shown in Algorithm 3 . Compared to
the global phase, the major difference is the loop from lines 11 to
16, where we add perturbation to the non-sensitive attributes of
large gradients with a small probability. We automatically get the
probability of adding perturbation to each attribute in 𝑥at line 10.
3.3 Generalization Framework on
Unstructured Data
We intend to solve the challenge of 𝐴𝑠modification to generalize
NeuronFair to unstructured data. Here we take image data as an
example. Attributes of an image are determined by pixels with nor-
malized values between 0 and 1, i.e., the input domain of images
isI∈[0,1]. Motivated by the adversarial attack, we design a gen-
eralization framework to implement the image’s 𝐴𝑠modification,
which modifies 𝐴𝑠through adding a small perturbation to most
pixels, as shown in Fig. 4.
Figure 4: An overview of generalization framework on im-
age data type.
We consider a fairness testing scenario for face detection, which
determines whether the input image contains a face. The face de-
tector consists of a CNN module (i.e., Fig. 4 (i)) and a FCN module
(i.e., Fig. 4 (ii)). As shown in Fig. 4, for a given face image 𝑥and a
detector𝑓(𝑥,Θ), there are three steps: 1○build a sensitive attribute
classifier; 2○produce Δ𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑡 based on Eq. (5), Δ𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑡 is the pertur-
bation added to image to flip sensitive attribute; 3○generate Δ𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠
based on NeuronFair, where Δ𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠is the bias perturbation added
to an image to flip the detection result.
First, we need a sensitive attribute classifier 𝑓𝑠𝑎(𝑥;Θ𝑠𝑎)that
can distinguish the face image’s 𝐴𝑠(e.g., gender). We build the 𝐴𝑠
classifier by adding a new FCN module (i.e., Fig. 4 (iii)) to the face
detector’s CNN module (i.e., Fig. 4 (i)). Then, we froze the weights
of the CNN module, and train the weights of the newly added FCN
module.
Next, we modify the face image’s 𝐴𝑠based on the adversarial
attack. A classic adversarial attack FGSM [ 28] is adopted to flip the
predicted result of the sensitive attribute by generating Δ𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑡 as
follows:
Δ𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑡 =𝜖×sign(∇𝑥𝐽(𝑥,𝑦𝑠𝑎;Θ𝑠𝑎))
satisfying that 𝑓𝑠𝑎(𝑥;Θ𝑠𝑎)≠𝑓𝑠𝑎(𝑥+Δ𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑡 ;Θ𝑠𝑎)(5)
where𝜖is a hyper-parameter to determine perturbation size, sign(·)
is a signum function return “-1”, “0”, or “1”, 𝑥is an input image,
𝑦𝑠𝑎is the ground-truth of 𝑥about sensitive attributes, Θ𝑠𝑎is the
weights of the 𝐴𝑠classifier.
Finally, we leverage NeuronFair to generate Δ𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠, and then
determine whether the instance pair <𝑥+Δ𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠,𝑥+Δ𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠+Δ𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑡 >
satisfy Definition 1. We determine the discrimination at each layer
of the detector at first. For the CNN module, the activation output
of the convolutional layer is flattened. Then, in the process of image
IDI generation, only the global generation is employed, which is
due to the different data forms between image and structured data.
Taking the input image in Fig. 4 as an example, its attributes can
be regarded as 𝐴∈R64×64×3. Based on a seed image IDI generated
in the global phase, numerous image IDIs will evolve in the local
phase. However, these image IDIs are similar, with only a few pixel
differences, which have little effect on fairness improvement of the
face detector. Besides, we cancel the signum function sign(·)at line
15 of Algorithm 2 for image data.
For other unstructured data (e.g., text), we could first process it
into a vector structure similar to an image through standard embed-
ding techniques (e.g., word embedding), then apply the framework

in Fig. 4 in a similar way. To ensure the generated inputs are re-
alistic, we follow previous works (e.g., ADF [ 61] and EIDIG [ 60])
to limit the range of perturbed features for structured data (e.g.,
maximum age limit) and the maximum perturbation size for un-
structured data (e.g., human-imperceptible perturbation). Distance
evaluation results show that the distances between the generated
inputs and the seed inputs are relatively small, which means the
generated inputs are not overtly surprising in comparison to the
training data.
4 EXPERIMENTAL SETTING
4.1 Datasets
We evaluate NeuronFair on 7 datasets of which five are structured
datasets and two are image datasets. Each dataset is divided into
three parts, i.e., 70%, 10%, 20% as training, validation, and testing,
respectively.
The 5 open-source structured datasets include Adult, German
credit (GerCre), bank marketing (BanMar), COMPAS, and medical
expenditure panel survey (MEPS). The details of these datasets are
shown in Table 1. All datasets can be downloaded from GitHub1
and preprocessed by AI Fairness 360 toolkit (AIF360) [6].
The 2 image datasets (i.e., ClbA-IN and LFW-IN) are constructed
by ourselves for face detection. ClbA-IN dataset consists of 60,000
face images from CelebA [ 44] and 60,000 non-face images from
ImageNet [ 17]. LFW-IN dataset consists of 10,000 face images from
LFW [ 33] and 10,000 non-face images from ImageNet [ 17]. The
pixel value of each image is normalized to [0,1].
4.2 Classifiers
We implement 5 FCN-based classifiers [ 6,61] for structured datasets
and 2 CNN-based face detectors [ 30,50,52] for image datasets since
FCN and CNN are the most widely used basic structures in real-
world classification tasks.
The 5 FCN-based classifiers can be divided into two types. The
one is composed of 5 hidden layers for processing low-dimensional
data (i.e., Adult, GerCre, BanMar), denoted as LFCN. The another is
composed of 8 hidden layers for processing high-dimensional data
(i.e., COMPAS and MEPS), denoted as HFCN. The activation func-
tions in hidden layers and the output layer are ReLU and Softmax,
respectively. The hidden layer structures of LFCN and HFCN are
[64, 32, 16, 8, 4] and [256, 256, 64, 64, 32, 32, 16, 8], respectively.
The 2 CNN-based face detectors serve for face detection, which
are variants from two pre-trained models (i.e., VGG16 [ 52] and
ResNet50 [ 30]) of keras.applications. We use the CNN module of
VGG16 and ResNet50 as Fig. 4 (i), and design the FCN module of
Fig. 4 (ii) and (iii) as [512, 256, 128, 64, 16].
4.3 Baselines
We implement and compare 4 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with
NeuronFair to evaluate their performance, including Aequitas [ 55],
SymbGen [ 2], ADF [ 61], and EIDIG [ 60]. Note that Themis [ 25] has
been shown to be significantly less effective for DNN and thus is
omitted [ 2,61]. We obtained the implementation of these baselines

4.4 Evaluation Metrics
Five aspects of NeuronFair are evaluated, including generation
effectiveness, efficiency, interpretability, the utility of AUC metric,
andgeneralization of NeuronFair.
4.4.1 Generation Effectiveness Evaluation. We evaluate the effec-
tiveness of NeuronFair on structured data from two aspects: gener-
ation quantity and quality.
(1)Quantity . To evaluate the generation quantity, we first count
the total number of IDIs, then count the global IDIs’ number and
local IDIs’ number respectively, recorded as ‘#IDIs’. Note that the
duplicate instances are filtered.
(2)Quality . We use generation success rate (GSR), generation
diversity (GD), and IDIs’ contributions to fairness improvement
(i.e., DM-RS [55, 60, 61]) to evaluate IDIs’ quality.
GSR=# IDIs
# non−duplicate instances×100% (6)
where non-duplicate instances represent the input space.
GDNF(𝜌cons,baseline) =CRNF−bl
CRbl−NF(7)
where CRNF−bl =# IDIs of baselines fall in Π NF
# IDIs of baselinerepresents the cover-
age rate of the NeuronFair’s IDIs to baseline’s IDIs, ΠNFis the area
with NeuronFair’s IDIs as the center and cosine distance 𝜌consas
the radius; similar to CRbl−NF =# IDIs of NeuronFair fall in Π bl
# IDIs of NeuronFair. The
NeuronFair’s IDIs are more diverse when GDNF>1.
The generated IDIs serve to improve DNN’s fairness by using
these IDIs to retrain it. DM-RS is the percentage of IDIs in randomly
sampled instances. High DM-RS value represents that the DNN is
biased, i.e., the IDI’s contribution to fairness improvement is low.
DM−RS=# IDIs
# instances randomly sampled×100% (8)
4.4.2 Efficiency Evaluation. We evaluate the efficiency of Neuron-
Fair by generation speed [ 61], i.e., the time cost of generating 1,000
IDIs (#sec/1,000 IDIs).
4.4.3 Interpretability Evaluation based on Biased Neurons. To in-
terpret the utility of NeuronFair, we refer to paper [ 48] to design
the coverage of biased neurons, which is defined as follows: for a
given instance, compute the activation output of the most biased
layer; normalize the activation values; select neurons with activa-
tion values greater than 0.5 as the activated neurons; compare the
coverage of the activated neurons to the biased neurons.

4.4.4 Utility Evaluation of AUC Metric. In our work, based on
the interpretation results, we design AUC value to measure the
discrimination. We evaluate the utility of AUC metrics from three
aspects: consistency, significance, and complexity between AUC
and DM-RS.
(1)Consistency . To evaluate the consistency, we adopt Spear-
man’s correlation coefficient, as follows:
𝜌𝑠=1−6Í𝑛
𝑖=1𝑑2
𝑖
𝑛(𝑛2−1)(9)
where𝑑𝑖=𝑎𝑖−𝑏𝑖,𝑖∈{1,2,...,𝑛},𝑎𝑖and𝑏𝑖are the rank of AUC
and DM-RS values, respectively. High 𝜌𝑠means more consistent.
(2)Significance . To evaluate whether AUC can measure dis-
crimination more significantly than DM-RS, we use the standard
deviation, as follows:
𝜎=rÍ
𝑖=1𝑛(𝑐𝑖−𝜇)2
𝑛−1(10)
where𝑐𝑖is AUC or DM-RS of different testing methods, 𝑖∈{1,2,...,𝑛},
𝜇is the mean value of 𝑐𝑖. Large𝜎means more significant.
4.4.5 Generalization Evaluation on Image Data. We evaluate the
generalization of NeuronFair on image data from two aspects: gen-
eration quantity, and quality.
(1)Quantity . To evaluate the generation quantity on image data,
we only count the global image IDIs’ number, recorded as ‘#IDIs’.
(2)Quality . We adopt GSR and IDIs’ contributions to face detec-
tor’s fairness improvement based on AUC value to evaluate IDIs’
quality, then compute its detection rate (DR) after retraining.
4.5 Implementation Details
To fairly study the performance of the baselines and NeuronFair, our
experiments have the following settings: (1) the hyperparameters
of each method are set according to Table 2, where ‘Glo.’ and ‘Loc.’
represent the global and local phases, respectively; (2) the experi-
mental results are repeated 5 times and then averaged; (3) for the
FCN-based classifier, we set the learning rate to 0.001, and choose
Adam as the optimizer; for the CNN-based face detector, we set
the learning rate to 0.01, and choose SGD as the optimizer; the
training results are shown in Table 3, where “99.83%/92.80%/94.30%”
represents the accuracy of face detector, gender classifier, and race
classifier, respectively.
We conduct all the experiments on a server with one Intel i7-
7700K CPU running at 4.20GHz, 64 GB DDR4 memory, 4 TB HDD
and one TITAN Xp 12 GB GPU card.Table 4: Comparison with Aequitas, ADF, and EIDIG based

5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We evaluate NeuronFair through answering the following five re-
search questions (RQ): (1) how effective is NeuronFair; (2) how effi-
cient is NeuronFair; (3) how to interpret the utility of NeuronFair;
(4) how useful is the AUC metric; (5) how generic is NeuronFair?
5.1 Research Questions 1
How effective is NeuronFair in generating IDIs?
When reporting the results, we focus on the following aspects:
generation quantity andquality.
Generation Quantity . The evaluation results are shown in Ta-
bles 4, 5, and 6, including three scenarios: the total number of IDIs,
the IDIs number in global phase, and the IDIs number in local phase.
Implementation details for quantity evaluation: (1) SymbGen
works differently from other baselines, thus we follow the compar-
ison strategy of Zhang et al. [ 61], i.e., evaluating the generation
quantity of NeuronFair and SymbGen within the same time (i.e., 500
sec) limit, as shown in Table 5; (2) for a fair global phase compari-
son, we generate 1,000 non-duplicate instances without constrained
by𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑔, then count IDIs number and record it in Table 6, where
the seeds used are consistent for different methods; (3) for a fair
local phase comparison, we mix IDIs generated globally by differ-
ent methods, and randomly sample 100 as the seeds in local phase;
then generate 1,000 non-duplicate instances for each seed without
constrained by 𝑚𝑎𝑥−𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑙, count the IDIs number on average for
each seed and record it in Table 6.
•NeuronFair generates more IDIs than baselines, especially for
densely coded structured data. For instance, in Table 4, on Adult
dataset with different attributes, the IDIs number of NeuronFair
is 217,855 on average, which is 16.5 times and 1.6 times that of Ae-
quitas and EIDIG, respectively. In addition, in Table 5, NeuronFair
generates much more IDIs than SymbGen on all datasets. The
outstanding performance of NeuronFair is mainly because the
optimization object of NeuronFair takes into account the whole
DNNs’ discrimination information through the biased neurons
while Aequitas and EIDIG only depend on the output layer. How-
ever, the IDIs number on COMPAS dataset with race attribute is
11,232, which is slightly lower than that of EIDIG. Since the COM-
PAS is encoded as one-hot in AIF360 [ 6], we speculate the reason
is that too sparse data coding reduces the derivation efficiency
from biased neurons.
•As shown in Table 6, NeuronFair generates much more IDIs than
all baselines in the global phase, which is beneficial to increase
the diversity of NeuronFair’s IDIs in the subsequent local phase.
For instance, on all datasets, the IDIs number of NeuronFair is 866

on average, which is 9.45 times and 1.42 times that of Aequitas
and EIDIG, respectively. This is mainly because the optimization
object of NeuronFair takes into account the dynamics through
the dynamic combination of biased neurons. Thus, NeuronFair
searches a larger space to generate more global IDIs. Besides,
we conduct a preliminary T-test about “#IDIs” on the Adult and
GerCre datasets. The p-values of all models are small enough to
reject the null hypothesis (i.e., less than 0.05), which demonstrates
the significance of NeuronFair.
•In the local phase, NeuronFair is much more efficient than base-
lines in general. For instance, in Table 6, on average, NeuronFair
returns 78.97%, 45.35%, 10.81%, and 2.90% more IDIs than Ae-
quitas, SymbGen, ADF, and EIDIG, respectively. Recall that Ae-
quitas, ADF, EIDIG, and NeuronFair all guide local phase through
a probability distribution, which is the likelihood of IDIs by mod-
ifying several certain attributes (i.e., the loop from lines 11 to 16
ofAlgorithm 3 ). The probability determination of NeuronFair
takes into account the momentum and SoftMax activation (i.e.,
at line 10 of Algorithm 3 ) while the baselines do not. Hence,
NeuronFair generates more local IDIs.
Generation Quality . The evaluation results are shown in Ta-
bles 4, 5, 7, and Fig. 5, including the generation success rate (GSR ),
generation diversity (GD ), and fairness improvement (DM-RS ).
Implementation details for quality evaluation: (1) for a fair di-
versity comparison, we seed each method with the same set of 10
global IDIs and apply them to generate 100 local IDIs for each seed
without considering 𝑚𝑎𝑥−𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑙, as shown in Fig. 5; (2) we randomly
select 10% IDIs of each method to retrain DNNs, then compute their
fairness improvement results; to avoid contingency, we repeat 5
times and record the average DM-RS value in Table 7.
•As shown in Tables 4 and 5, the GSR values of NeuronFair are
higher than that of baselines on almost all datasets, i.e., Neuron-
Fair can search for a larger valid input space, where the input
space is calculated by ‘#IDIs/GSR’. For instance, in Table 4, on
all datasets, Aequitas has a GSR of 17.62% on average, whereas
NeuronFair achieves a GSR of 36.12%, which is ∼×2.1 more than
that of Aequitas. The outstanding performance of NeuronFair isTable 7: Fairness improvement measured by DM-RS, where

DNNs, respectively.

mainly because it not only considers the whole DNN’s discrimi-
nation through biased neurons, but also takes into account the
dynamics of the optimization object through the combination of
biased neurons. Thus, NeuronFair searches a larger valid input
space than Aequitas.
Meanwhile, the GSR value of NeuronFair on different sensitive
attributes is more robust than ADF and EIDIG. For instance, in
Table 4, on the GerCre dataset with gender and age attributes, the
GSR values of NeuronFair are 36.57% and 63.35%, whereas that
of EIDIG are 17.23% and 59.38%. We speculate the reason is that
the discrimination about the gender attribute in the output layer
is not obvious, but NeuronFair can find potential fairness viola-
tions through the internal discrimination information of biased
neurons. Therefore, we can realize stable testing for different
sensitive attributes.
In addition, the valid input space of NeuronFair is larger than
baselines in general, i.e., a larger input space supports more
diverse IDI generation. For instance, in Table 5, the average input
space of NeuronFair is 3.30 times that of SymbGen. It is mainly
because the momentum acceleration strategy employs historical
gradient as auxiliary guidance, which reduces the number of
invalid searches. Hence, NeuronFair generates more IDIs in a
large input space.
•In all cases, NeuronFair can generate more diverse IDIs, which
is beneficial to discover more potential discrimination and then
improve fairness through retraining. For instance, in Fig. 5, com-
pare to Aequitas and ADF, the GDNFvalues are all greater than
‘1’ under different radius values 𝜌cons, and as the radius increases,
the value of GDNFgradually converges to ‘1’. It demonstrates
that the IDIs generated by NeuronFair can always cover that
of baselines. We speculate the reason is that the dynamic loss

function expands the valid input space by combining different

Besides, a close investigation shows that there is a similar
trend in the generation diversity for the same sensitive attribute.
For instance, when 𝜌cons<0.1 in Fig. 5 (a) or 𝜌cons<0.02 in
Fig. 5 (b), the line ‘L2’ with race is always the highest, the line
‘L4’ with age is always the lowest, while lines ‘L1’ and ‘L3’ with
gender are in the middle. Since both datasets Adult and GerCre
are related to money (i.e., salary and loans), we speculate that
there is similar discrimination for gender in classifiers LFC-A
and LFC-G for similar tasks, thus GDNFshows similar trends in
gender attribute.
•In all cases, NeuronFair can obtain smaller DM-RS values, i.e.,
the IDIs generated by NeuronFair contribute more to the DNNs’
fairness improvement. For instance, in Table 7, measured by
DM-RS, NeuronFair realizes fairness improvement of 87.24% on
average, versus baselines, i.e., 81.18% for Aequitas, 80.78% for
SymbGen, 83.30% for ADF, and 84.49% for EIDIG. It is because the
IDIs of NeuronFair are more diverse than those of baselines, so
it can discover more potential fairness violations and implement
higher fairness improvement through retraining.
Answer to RQ1 : NeuronFair outperforms the SOTA methods (i.e.,
Aequitas, SymbGen, ADF, and EIDIG) in two aspects: (1) quantity
- it generates∼×5.84 IDIs on average compared to baselines;
(2)quality - it searches∼×3.03 input space with more than ∼×1.65
GSR on average compared to baselines, it generates IDIs that
are∼×6.24 and∼×1.38 more diverse than Aequitas and ADF
on average with 𝜌cons<0.02, it is beneficial to DNNs’ fairness
improvement of 87.24% on average.
5.2 Research Questions 2
How efficient is NeuronFair in generating IDIs?
When answering this question, we refer to the generation speed.
The evaluation results are shown in Table 8, where the time cost of
SymbGen includes generating the explainer and constraint solving.
Here we have the following observation.
•NeuronFair generates IDIs more efficiently, which meets the ra-
pidity requirements of software engineering testing. For instance,
in Table 8, on average, NeuronFair takes only 26.07%, 5.47%,
49.47%, and 79.32% of the time required by Aequitas, SymbGen,
ADF, and EIDIG, respectively. The outstanding performance of
NeuronFair is mainly because it uses a momentum acceleration
strategy and shortens the derivation path to reduce computa-
tional complexity. Hence, it takes less time than baselines.

vated by different instances.
Answer to RQ2 : NeuronFair is more efficient in generation speed
- it produces IDIs with an average speedup of 534.56%.
5.3 Research Questions 3
How to interpret NeuronFair’s utility by biased neurons?
When interpreting the utility, we refer to the biased neuron
coverage. The evaluation results are shown in Fig. 6.
Implementation details for interpretation: (1) we conduct exper-
iments on the Adult dataset with gender attribute for the LFC-A
classifier; (2) we compare the interpretation results of NeuronFair
with ADF and EIDIG; (3) for a fair interpretation, we randomly se-
lect 10% IDIs and 10% non-IDIs (i.e., the generated failure instances)
for each method, and then compute the coverage of biased neurons,
as shown in Fig. 6.
•Biased neurons can be adopted to interpret the utility of IDIs
and NeuronFair. First, IDIs trigger discrimination by activating
biased neurons. For instance, the neurons activated by IDIs can
cover most of the biased neurons in Fig. 6 (a), while the coverage
of the biased neurons by non-IDIs of different methods is 0 in
Fig. 6 (b). We can further interpret the utility of testing methods
is related to the coverage of biased neurons, i.e., NeuronFair is
more effective than ADF and EIDIG because they miss some
discrimination contained in biased neurons while NeuronFair
does not. For instance, in Fig. 6 (a), the NeuronFair’s IDIs activate
all 24 biased neurons in the 2-nd layer of LFC-A classifier, while
the neurons activated by other IDIs cannot cover all (15 for ADF
and 18 for EIDIG).
Answer to RQ3 : The main reason for NeuronFair’s utility is that
its IDIs can activate more biased neurons. NeuronFair’s IDIs ac-
tivate 100% biased neurons, while 62.5% for ADF and 75% for
EIDIG.
5.4 Research Questions 4
How useful is the AUC metric for measuring DNNs’ fairness?
When answering this question, we refer to the following as-
pects: the consistency, significance, and complexity between AUC
and DM-RS. The evaluation results on Adult and GerCre datasets
with multiple sensitive attributes are shown in Table 9. From the
results, we have the following observations.
•In all cases, AUC can correctly distinguish DNNs’ fairness vio-
lations, i.e., AUC can serve the discrimination measurement of
DNN. For instance, in Table 9, all of the 𝜌𝑠values are 1.00, indi-
cating that the discrimination ranking results of different DNNs

based on AUC are completely consistent with those based on DM-
RS. Since DNN’s decision results are determined by the neurons’
activation, we speculate that the biased decisions are also caused
by the neurons’ activation, i.e., neurons contain discrimination
information. Therefore, we can leverage the discrimination in-
formation in neurons to determine DNNs’ fairness.
•In all cases, AUC can distinguish the different DNN’s discrimi-
nation more significantly than DM-RS, which is beneficial for a
more accurate evaluation of IDIs of different testing methods. For
instance, in Table 9, all 𝜎values of AUC are higher than those
of DM-RS, and the average 𝜎value of AUC is 8.46 times that
of DM-RS. The outstanding performance of AUC is mainly be-
cause we use the neurons’ ActDiff to measure the discrimination,
which extracts more bias-related information from the whole
DNN; while DM-RS only uses the bias-related information from
the output layer.
•The computational complexity of AUC is much lower than that
of DM-RS, which is beneficial to quickly distinguish DNNs’ dis-
crimination or the IDIs’ effect. The time frequency of AUC is
T(𝑁𝑙)=(7+𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡)×𝑁𝑙+1based on Algorithm 1 . Thus the time
complexity of AUC is O(𝑁𝑙), while that of DM-RS is O(𝑛log𝑛),
where𝑛is the instance number, 𝑁𝑙is the layer number, 𝑛>>𝑁𝑙.
It is mainly because AUC only conducts matrix operations, while
DM-RS requires iterative operations until convergence.
Answer to RQ4 : The AUC is useful for discrimination measure-
ment. Compared to the results in Table 9, AUC is (1) 100% consis-
tentwith DM-RS, (2)×8.46 more significant than DM-RS, (3) low
computational complexity withO(𝑁𝑙).

Implementation details for NeuronFair generalized on image
data: (1) we only perform comparisons with ADF and EIDIG at
global phase, because the effect of ADF and EIDIG on DNNs is
much better than that of Aequitas and SymbGen; (2) we remove the
KMeans(·)operation, set 𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝−𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑔=0.15 for image, and all face
images are used as input; (3) we retrain the face detector with all
image IDIs of each method and measure its fairness improvement
by AUC, (4) we measure the bias perturbation Δ𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠and sensitive
attribute perturbation Δ𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑡 by𝐿2-norm.
Generation Quantity . The evaluation results are shown in Ta-
ble 10 measured by the IDIs number in global phase. From the
results, we have the following observation.
•In all cases, NeuronFair can obtain more IDIs than ADF and
EIDIG, especially for the discrimination against race attribute.
For instance, in Table 10, on average, NeuronFair generates 4.34
times and 2.07 times IDIs of ADF and EIDIG, respectively. The
outstanding performance of NeuronFair is because it adopts dy-
namic loss to expand the valid input space while ADF and EIDIG
do not consider the dynamics of search. Meanwhile, the number
of IDIs generated by NeuronFair for race is 3.91 times that for
gender. We speculate the reason is that the pixel information
related to race is mainly skin color (i.e., light & dark, or black
& white), while the pixel information related to gender is more
diverse (such as hair, makeup, face shape, etc.). Therefore, the
image IDIs generation for race is easier through manipulating
skin color.
Generation Quality . The evaluation results are shown in Ta-
bles 10 and 11, including three scenarios: the generation success
rate (GSR ), the fairness improvement (AUC ), and the detection rate
(DR).
•Among image data, image IDIs of NeuronFair are of higher qual-
ity than those of ADF and EIDIG, which can be applied to retrain
face detectors and contribute to their fairness improvement in
face detection scenarios. For instance, in Table 10, on average,
the GSR value of NeuronFair is 2.60 times and 1.63 times that of
ADF and EIDIG, respectively. It is because NeuronFair reduces
the probability of gradient vanishing, which in turn improves the
probability of non-duplicate IDIs generation guided by the gradi-
ent. Hence, all GSR values of NeuronFair are higher than those
of baselines. Meanwhile, the valid input space of NeuronFair is
1.67 times and 1.27 times that of ADF and EIDIG, respectively.
Since the probability of falling into a local optimum is reduced
by dynamically combining biased neurons, we can perform valid
searches in limited instance space.
•NeuronFair contributes more to the fairness improvement of the
face detector, i.e., its generalization on image data is better than
that of ADF and EIDIG. For instance, in Table 11, on average, the
discrimination of detectors retrained with IDIs of NeuronFair
dropped by 53.77%, while the AUC values of ADF and EIDIG
1528

only dropped by 8.06% and 10.90%, respectively. We speculate
that the valid input space of NeuronFair is larger, so its IDIs can
find potential discrimination that other methods’ IDIs cannot.
Then improve the detector’s fairness through retraining.
•NeuronFair hardly affects the detector’s DR values while improv-
ing its fairness. For instance, in Table 11, on average, the DR value
of detectors retrained with NeuronFair’s IDIs only dropped by
0.87%, while that of ADF and EIDIG dropped by 2.92% and 4.80%,
respectively. We compare the 𝐿2norm of Δ𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠andΔ𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑡 gen-
erated by different methods, and find that Δ𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠of NeuronFair is
much lower than that of ADF and EIDIG. Therefore, NeuronFair
can not only improve the detector’s fairness but also maintain
its detection performance.
Answer to RQ5 : The generalization performance of NeuronFair
on the image dataset is better than the SOTA methods (i.e., ADF
and EIDIG) in two aspects: (1) quantity - it generates∼×4.34 and
∼×2.07 image IDIs on average compared to ADF and EIDIG, re-
spectively; (2) quality - it searches∼×1.47 input space with more
than∼×2.11 GSR on average, it is beneficial to detectors’ fairness
improvement of 53.77% on average but hardly affects their detec-
tion performance. Thus, NeuronFair shows better generalization
performance than ADF and EIDIG.
6 THREATS TO VALIDITY
Correlation between attributes . The attributes of unstruc-
tured data are not as clear as structured data, so we provide a gener-
alization framework that can modify sensitive attributes. However,
there is a correlation between attributes, i.e., after the perturbation
for one sensitive attribute is added, another attribute may also be
changed. Since the transferability of perturbation is not robust. the
slight attribute change will not affect our IDI generation.
Sensitive attributes . We consider only one sensitive attribute
at a time for our experiments. However, considering multiple pro-
tected attributes will not hamper the effectiveness or generalization
offered by our novel testing technique, but will certainly lead to
an increase in execution time. This increase is attributed towards
the fact that the algorithm in such a case, needs to consider all the
possible combinations of their unique values.
Access to DNNs . NeuronFair is white-box testing that generates
IDIs based on the biased neurons, which means it requires accessing
to DNNs. It is widely accepted that DNN testing could have full
knowledge of the target model in software engineering.
7 RELATED WORKS
Fairness Testing . Based on the software engineering point of
view, several works on testing the fairness of traditional ML models
are proposed [ 1,2,25,54,55,59]. To uncover their fairness viola-
tions, Galhotra et al. [ 25] firstly proposed Themis, a fairness testing
method for software, which measures the discrimination in soft-
ware through counting the frequency of IDIs in the input space.
However, its efficiency for IDIs generation is unsatisfactory. To im-
prove the generation speed of Themis, Udeshi et al. [ 55] proposed
a faster generation algorithm, Aequitas, which uncovers fairness
violations by probabilistic search over the input space. Aequitas
adopts a two-phase operation in which the IDIs generated globally
are used as seeds for the local generation. However, Aequitas usesa global sampling distribution for all the inputs, which leads to the
limitation that it can only search in narrow input space and easily
falls into the local optimum. Thus, Aequitas’s IDIs lack diversity. To
further improve the instance diversity, Agarwal et al. [ 2] designed
a new testing method, SymbGen, which combines the symbolic
execution along with the local interpretation for the generation
of effective instances. SymbGen constructs the local explainer of
the complex model at first and then searches for IDIs based on
the fitted decision boundary. Therefore, its instance effectiveness
almost depends on the performance of the explainer.
The above-mentioned methods mainly deal with traditional ML
models, which cannot directly be applied to deal with DNNs. Re-
cently, several methods have been proposed specifically for DNNs.
For instance, Zhang et al. [ 61] first proposed a fairness testing
method specifically for DNNs, ADF, which guides the search direc-
tion through gradients. The authors proved that its effectiveness
and efficiency of IDIs generation for DNNs are greatly improved
based on the guidance of gradients. Based on the ADF [ 61], Zhang
et al. [ 60] designed a framework EIDIG for discovering individual
fairness violations, which adopts prior information to accelerate
the convergence of iterations. However, there is still a problem of
gradient vanishing, which may lead to a local optimum.
Neuron-based DNN Interpretation . Kim et al. [ 35] first intro-
duced concept activation vectors, which provide an interpretation
of a DNN’s internal state (i.e., the activation output in the hidden
layer). They viewed the high-dimensional internal state of a DNN as
an aid, and interpreted which concept is important to the classifica-
tion result. Inspired by the concept activation vectors, Du et al. [ 20]
suggested that interpretability can serve as a useful ingredient to
diagnose the reasons that lead to algorithmic discrimination. The
above methods study the activation output of one hidden layer,
while Liu et al. [ 43] studied the activation state of a single neuron.
They observed that the neuron activation is related to the DNNs’
robustness, and used the abnormal activation of a single neuron
to detect backdoor attacks. These methods leverage the internal
state to interpret DNNs’ classification performance and robustness,
which inspires us to use it to interpret DNNs’ biased decision.
8 CONCLUSIONS
We propose an interpretable white-box fairness testing method,
NeuronFair, to efficiently generate IDIs for DNNs based on biased
neurons. Our method provides discrimination interpretation and
IDI generation for different data forms. In the discrimination inter-
pretation, AS curve and AUC measurement are designed to quali-
tatively and quantitatively interpret the severity of discrimination
in each layer of DNNs, respectively. In the IDI generation, a global
phase and a local phase collaborate to systematically search the
input space for IDIs with the guidance of momentum accelera-
tion and dynamic loss. Further, NeuronFair can process not only
structured data but also unstructured data, e.g., image, text, etc.
We compare NeuronFair with four SOTA methods in 5 structured
datasets and 2 face image datasets against 7 DNNs, the results show
that NeuronFair has significantly better performance in terms of
interpretability, generation effectiveness, and data generalization.
