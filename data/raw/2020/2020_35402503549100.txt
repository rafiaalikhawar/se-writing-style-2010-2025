ABSTRACT
Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are safety-critical systems,
and safety violations of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in real traffic
will cause huge losses. Therefore, ADSs must be fully tested be-
fore deployed on real world roads. Simulation testing is essential
to find safety violations of ADS. This paper proposes MOSAT, a
multi-objective search-based testing framework, which constructs
diverse and adversarial driving environment to expose safety vio-
lations of ADSs. Specifically, based on atomic driving maneuvers,
MOSAT introduces motif pattern , which describes a sequence of
maneuvers that can challenge ADS effectively. MOSAT constructs
test scenarios by atomic maneuvers and motif patterns, and uses
multi-objective genetic algorithm to search for adversarial and di-
verse test scenarios. Moreover, in order to test the performance of
ADS comprehensively during long-mile driving, we design a novel
continuous simulation testing technique, which runs the scenarios
generated by multiple parallel search processes alternately in the
simulator and can continuously create different perturbations to

1 INTRODUCTION
Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are complicated and the
safety of ADSs is significantly important [ 12]. Therefore, ADSs
must be evaluated thoroughly before they are deployed into real
world [ 10]. However, testing ADSs in real world requires too many

driving miles and will take tremendous cost and time [ 34]. Com-
pared with physical tests, simulation-based testing provides lots of
advantages such as controllable environments, trying a large num-
ber of scenarios, and creating dangerous scenarios without risking
human life. Recently, researchers have raised lots of methods to
construct virtual simulative scenarios to assess ADSs [ 8,21,30,41].
A popular approach is leveraging naturalistic driving environ-
ment to construct virtual simulative scenarios [ 23,57]. However,
due to the rareness of safety-critical events under naturalistic con-
ditions, this approach is inefficient. To improve the efficiency, lots
of work focus on developing a set of pre-crash scenarios from crash
databases [ 42–44,56]. However, these test scenarios are pre-defined
and fixed. ADSs may perform well in these tests, but the perfor-
mance under broader conditions may not be adequately assessed1.
Considering the high dimensional and complex input space
of ADSs, in order to expose safety-critical scenarios effectively,
some recent studies[ 7,20,22,24,31,36,51,52,55] apply search-
based techniques which optimize the search process [ 29,50] to-
wards safety-critical scenarios [ 19,39,49,53]. Most of them (e.g.,
[6,11,37,46]) define the input of a test scenario as a vector con-
sisting of multiple variables with value ranges and apply multi-
objective evolutionary algorithm to explore the input space. How-
ever, the designed scenario is simple, and these techniques also
cannot test ADSs in an evolving traffic environment, in which vari-
ous perturbations of traffic participants to AVs can be performed to
try to expose the potential safety violations of ADSs.
This paper proposes MOSAT, a novel multi-objective, search-
based approach to ADS Testing. MOSAT applies Pareto optimality
to maximize perturbations of participants’ behaviors to ADS and
diversity of generated scenarios, while minimizing ETTC (estima-
tion time to collision of the AV), to generate adversarial and diverse
scenarios for exposing various safety violations of ADS. Specifically,
in order to challenge ADS effectively, based on atomic maneuvers,
MOSAT introduces motif pattern, which describes a sequence of
driving maneuvers that can generate challenging behaviors for ADS
to make it have more chances to run into safety violations. MOSAT
runs generated test scenarios in the simulator continuously by par-
allel execution of multiple search processes to test the performance
of ADSs comprehensively during the long-mile driving.
We demonstrate MOSAT on Baidu Apollo, an industrial-grade
ADS platform widely used to control AVs on public roads. The
experimental results show that MOSAT can effectively generate
safety-critical scenarios to crash ADS and can expose 11 distinct
types of safety violations in a short period of time. It also outper-
forms state-of-art ADS testing techniques by finding more 6 distinct
safety violations on the same road.
To summarize, this paper makes the following contributions:
•we formulate our ADS testing approach as a multi-objective
search technique, considering the degree of perturbations of
participants’ behaviors to AV and the diversity of scenarios
besides widely used ETTC [ 54] metric in existing work, and
can generate adversarial and diverse scenarios.
•in order to expose safety violations of the ADS effectively
during the search, based on atomic maneuvers, MOSAT in-
troduces motif pattern , which increases the chance to disturb
the ADS in the generated scenarios.•we design a spatiotemporally continuous driving environ-
ment, in which the scenarios generated by multiple search
processes are executed alternately in the simulator, to test
ADS comprehensively during the long-mile driving. It also
improves the efficiency of simulation testing by avoiding
ADS reconnection and simulator reset.
•we implement MOSAT and demonstrate its capabilities on
Baidu Apollo, an industry-grade ADS system, and the evalua-
tion results show that MOSAT can efficiently find more types
of safety violations than existing ADS testing techniques.
2 APPROACH OVERVIEW
The aim of MOSAT is to efficiently generate adversarial and diverse
safety-critical scenarios to find safety violations of ADSs. In the
test scenario, the vehicle connected to ADS under test is called ego
vehicle and other vehicles are called NPC ( non-player character )
vehicles.

Figure 1: Overall framework of MOSAT
MOSAT models NPC vehicles’ driving behaviors as low-level
atomic genes and high-level motif genes. An atomic gene represents
the basic driving maneuver supported by the simulator (e.g., lane
change, acceleration), while a motif gene is interpreted as a series of
atomic genes (driving maneuvers) related to ego vehicle, which can
challenge ADS effectively. A scenario in MOSAT is characterized
by a set of driving behavior sequences of NPCs.
The first population is generated by randomly initialized scenar-
ios. Based on initial scenarios, MOSAT uses genetic algorithm to
search for adversarial and diverse scenarios. The scenarios are eval-
uated by multi-objective fitness function, which guides the search
process to keep optimized parent individuals for next generation
(see Section 4.1). During the search, the variation operators, includ-
ing crossover and mutation operators, are defined to manipulate
individuals. We will explain them in detail in Section 4.2.
MOSAT runs generated scenarios in the simulator. To support
testing ADS continuously during long-mile driving, MOSAT runs
multiple search processes in parallel, and the generated multiple
scenarios will be executed in the simulator alternately to create
continuous perturbations to the ADS under test. MOSAT records
the running data (e.g., the actual trajectories of NPC vehicles and
ego vehicle) required for evaluating the fitness value of individuals
and feeds the monitored data back to the corresponding search
process when one scenario completes. During the execution of
the scenario in the simulator, MOSAT checks whether the safety
violation for ego vehicle will occur. If true, the running data will be

describes the proposed continuous simulation testing technique.
3 SCENARIO REPRESENTATION
3.1 Modeling Driving Maneuvers
We use𝐴𝑖
𝑡to denote the 𝑡𝑡ℎmaneuver of the 𝑖𝑡ℎNPC vehicle in
the scenario. The behaviors of 𝑖𝑡ℎNPC vehicles are determined by
a sequence of 𝐴𝑖
𝑡, which is represented by 𝜙𝑖={𝐴𝑖
1,𝐴𝑖
2,...,𝐴𝑖𝑚},𝑚
is the number of maneuvers in the vehicle’s driving. The maneu-
vers are implemented and supported by SVL simulator APIs [ 2],
including accelerate, decelerate, follow lane, and change lane.
However, the driving behaviors of NPC vehicles by random com-
binations of atomic maneuvers are very unlikely to disturb ego
vehicle, as the sequence of random maneuvers can make NPC vehi-
cle far away from ego vehicle during the driving, and thus cannot
challenge the ADS under test effectively. To address this limita-
tion, MOSAT introduces motif pattern based on atomic maneuvers,
which can make NPC vehicle move close to ego and do challenging
driving behaviors to create effective perturbations. A motif gene
is interpreted by a series of atomic maneuvers, triggered by the
relative position between the NPC vehicle and ego vehicle, such as
ahead, behind, left front, right front, left behind, and right behind.
Currently, we conclude four kinds of common motif patterns
based on the studies of some pre-crash scenarios in NHTSA [ 3,4],
in which participants near ego vehicle do specific maneuvers to
challenge ADSs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 shows
the behavior models (represented by Finite-State-Machine) of four
supported motif patterns in MOSAT, which are ahead ,side front ,
behind andside behind , respectively. Each model characterizes the
conditional maneuvers of NPC vehicles, in which 𝐷is the distance
between NPC vehicle and ego vehicle, 𝐷𝑠𝑎𝑓𝑒 is the minimum safe
distance,𝑉is the speed of NPC vehicle, 𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛is the predefined
minimum speed to decelerate, 𝐿is the lane where NPC vehicle lies
during the driving, 𝐿𝑒𝑔𝑜is the lane where ego vehicle lies, and 𝑅is
a random value between 0 and 1.
Note that, the driving behavior in each motif pattern will be
allocated with a fixed time slot to execute, and the driving maneuver
will be terminated when the given time slot is consumed. If the
driving behavior in the selected motif pattern has already been
completed before the time slot is exhausted, the NPC vehicle will
continue to drive at a constant speed (which is the last speed when
the time slot is consumed).
Figure 2 shows the behavior model of ahead motif pattern when
NPC vehicle is in the front of ego vehicle on the same lane. There
are three possible driving behaviors: decelerate, brake, and change
to the adjacent lane and then back to the original lane. All three
driving behaviors have the same possibility to be triggered.
Figure 3 shows the behavior model of side front motif pattern
when NPC vehicle is in the front of ego vehicle on a different lane
(including left front and right front). The NPC vehicle first changes
to the lane where ego vehicle locates, and then randomly performs
one of the following maneuvers: decelerate, change lane and brake
with the same probability.
Figure 4 shows the behavior model of the behind motif pattern
when NPC vehicle is behind ego vehicle on the same lane. If the
distance between NPC vehicle and ego vehicle, 𝐷, is greater than
ꓥ

MOSAT), the NPC vehicle will continue accelerating until 𝐷is less
than𝐷𝑠𝑎𝑓𝑒. Then the NPC vehicle will change to the adjacent lane
and accelerate until the relative position of NPC vehicle is in the
left front or right front of ego vehicle.

Figure 5 shows the behavior model of the side behind motif
pattern when NPC vehicle is behind ego vehicle on a different
lane (including left behind and right behind). When this pattern is

triggered, the NPC vehicle will accelerate until its position is in the
left front or right front of ego vehicle.

3.2 Genetic Representation of Test Scenario
MOSAT perturbs the driving maneuvers of NPC vehicles in an
evolving environment to challenge ego vehicle in the test scenarios.
The search of the perturbations can be considered as an optimiza-
tion problem that can be solved using genetic algorithm. In MOSAT,
each test scenario corresponds to an individual in genetic algorithm.
Figure 6 shows the genetic representation of a test scenario.

Figure 6: The genetic representation of a test scenario
Each individual(test scenario) consists of one or more chromo-
somes𝑆𝑖={𝐶1,𝐶2,...𝐶𝑛}. We encode the sequence of driving ma-
neuvers of one NPC vehicle as one chromosome, consisting of
atomic genes 𝐵𝑖and motif genes 𝑀𝑗. An atomic gene corresponds
to one atomic driving maneuver, and a motif gene corresponds to a
series of atomic driving maneuvers specified in the motif pattern.
During the execution, the motif pattern will be instantiated into a
sequence of driving maneuvers (motif gene) according to the NPC’s
relative position to ego vehicle, as shown in section 3.1. When exe-
cuting driving maneuvers in the simulator, for atomic gene 𝐵𝑖, the
time step is set to 1 second and for motif gene 𝑀𝑗, the time step is
set to 4 seconds. The running time of one scenario is determined by
the chromosome with the longest execution time in the individual.
When a new evolution starts, MOSAT will create kindividuals,
which are initialized randomly by sequences of atomic genes and
motif genes, as the first population.
4 MULTI-OBJECTIVE SEARCH
To search for adversarial and diverse scenarios which can expose
safety violations of ego vehicle, MOSAT adopts a multi-objective
genetic algorithm, NSGA-II, to build successfully-improved Pareto-
optimal solutions considering the following three objectives:
(1)objective 1: risk of the scenario. It concerns the proba-
bility of a collision between ego vehicle and NPC vehicles in the
constructed scenario;(2)objective 2: interference to ego vehicle. It concerns the
deviation of ego vehicle’s trajectory from the planned route, and
the jerk of ego vehicle (e.g., emergency braking) during driving;
(3)objective 3: diversities of the scenarios. It concerns the
difference of the NPC vehicles’ trajectories in each generated test
scenario with the already found safety-violation scenarios.
It should be noted that these objectives are equally important
and orthogonal. A multi-objective fitness function that contains the
three objectives listed above is designed to determine whether the
individual should be retained or eliminated. The optimal individuals
will further be variated by mutation and crossover operators during
the search. When the evolution gets stuck, MOSAT forces a restart.
4.1 Multi-objective Fitness Function
According to the objectives listed above, the multi-objective fitness
function consists of the following metrics: the minimal estimation
time to collision (METTC), the deviation of ego vehicle’s trajectory
from planned route (DFP), the variation rate of ego vehicle’s ac-
celeration (VOA), the average Euclidean distance of NPC vehicles’
trajectories for found safety-violation scenarios (AEDF). METTC
is the metric of objective 1. DFP and VOA are the metrics of objec-
tive 2. AEDF is the metric of objective 3. MOSAT maximizes DFP
and VOA for adversarial perturbations, and AEDF for diversities of
scenarios, while minimizing METTC for high collision risk.
(1) METTC: METTC of an individual is the minimal ETTC [ 47]
between ego vehicle and NPC vehicles in the scenario. ETTC is
defined as the time required for a vehicle to collide with an object if
both continue at their present speed and do not change their paths
[54].(𝑥2,𝑦2)is the position of the NPC vehicle when one gene ends,
and (x, y) is the position of ego vehicle at that time, ( 𝑥+,𝑦+) is the
estimated collision position at that time. 𝑉2is the speed of the NPC
vehicle and 𝑉is the speed of ego vehicle. 𝜃1and𝜃2is the driving
angle with road direction of ego vehicle and NPC vehicle.

𝑦+=𝑥2−𝑥1+𝑦1𝑐𝑜𝑡𝜃 1−𝑦2𝑐𝑜𝑡𝜃 2
𝑐𝑜𝑡𝜃 1−𝑐𝑜𝑡𝜃 2(3)
MOSAT calculates ETTC of each gene in the individual and the
minimal ETTC is the METTC. For a scenario where safety violations
of ego vehicle occurs, the corresponding METTC is 0. The smaller
the METTC, the higher the fitness score.
(2) DFP: DFP is the maximal offset between the planned route
and the actual driving path of ego vehicle. In the scenario, the
planned route of ego vehicle is following the lane and driving at a
constant speed. According to ego vehicle’s position and speed at
the start time of the scenario, MOSAT computes the position of its
planned route every 0.1 second and represents the planned driving
path as𝑡𝑟𝑒=(𝑒0,𝑒1,...,𝑒𝑛). MOSAT records actual driving path of
ego vehicle as 𝑡𝑟𝑎=(𝑝0,𝑝1,...,𝑝𝑛). The calculation of DFP is:
𝐷𝐹𝑃=max
𝑡∈[1,𝑛]q
(𝑝𝑡.𝑥−𝑒𝑡.𝑥)2+(𝑝𝑡.𝑦−𝑒𝑡.𝑦)2 (4)
The larger the DFP, the higher the fitness score.

(3) VOA: VOA is the maximal acceleration change during ego
vehicle’s driving. MOSAT records the actual speed of ego vehicle
during driving and computes the acceleration every 1 second. The
calculation is:
𝑉𝑂𝐴 =max
𝑡∈[2,𝑛]|(𝑣𝑡−𝑣𝑡−1)−(𝑣𝑡−1−𝑣𝑡−2)| (5)
The larger the VOA, the higher the fitness score.
(4) AEDF: MOSAT calculates the average Euclidean distance
of NPC vehicles’ trajectories in the individual with the ones in
each recorded safety-violations scenario. For the calculation of
Euclidean distance of two NPC vehicles’ trajectories (in different
scenarios), the initial position of ego vehicle is first converted to
origin coordinates in the map, and then the positions of NPC vehi-
cles’ trajectories are converted to the corresponding coordinates
according to their locations relative to ego vehicle’s initial position.
The larger the AEDF, the higher the fitness score.
MOSAT calculates the fitness score of one individual at the end
of scenario execution. When all the scenarios of this generation
have been executed, these individuals are further manipulated by
variation operators (see section 4.2) to generate new candidate
individuals for the next generation. Among these individuals and
their parents, MOSAT selects the top k ones as the new generation
by using Pareto optimality.
4.2 Variation Operators
The variation operators consist of two types: crossover and muta-
tion. We define a suite of variation operators to manipulate individ-
uals, which is shown as Algorithm 1.

The crossover operator is used across individuals. MOSAT ran-
domly generates crossover rate 𝑟𝑐∈(0,1)for each individual anddetermines whether it will be crossed (line 2-line 8). For all individ-
uals with𝑟𝑐≥𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑐, MOSAT conducts uniform crossover of
each two (line 9-line 11) to improve the diversity of individuals.
The mutation operator is applied in the individuals, which is
more complex, including gene mutation, two-point crossover, and
shuffle. For the scenarios without collision of ego vehicle, MOSAT
selects the gene with minimal METTC to conduct gene muta-
tion (line 15-line 17), to improve the perturbation to ego vehicle
and create more adversarial scenarios. For the scenarios where
safety violations occur, MOSAT randomly generates mutation rate
𝑟𝑚∈(0,1). According to 𝑟𝑚, MOSAT conducts two-point crossover
(𝑟𝑚≤𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑚) or shuffle ( 𝑟𝑚>𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑚) to increase the
diversity (line 19-line 23).
4.2.1 Crossover. The variation across individuals is achieved by
single-point crossover of chromosomes among different individuals.
figrefcrossover shows an example of crossover operation. For two
individuals𝑆1and𝑆2, the crossover point is chosen randomly within
the number of chromosomes in one individual. The crossover point
in this example is 1, and the child individuals 𝑆3and𝑆4are generated
by the crossover.
Figure 7: An example of crossover
4.2.2 Mutation. Mutation is the inner-individual variation. Muta-
tion operators are further classified as three types: gene mutation,
two-point crossover, and shuffle.
(1) Gene Mutation: gene mutation is to modify one gene in one
of the chromosomes of the individual. If the gene is an atomic
gene, MOSAT modifies its parameter values or replaces it with a
motif gene. If the gene is a motif gene, MOSAT replaces it with an
atomic gene and randomly generates its parameter values, including
direction and speed. Figure 8 shows an example of gene mutation
for a motif gene.
Figure 8: An example of gene mutation for a motif gene
(2) Two-point crossover: firstly, two chromosomes of the individ-
ual will be randomly selected. Two random points are then chosen
98ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore Haoxiang Tian, Yan Jiang, Guoquan Wu, Jiren Yan, Jun Wei, Wei Chen, Shuo Li, and Dan Ye
on each selected chromosome and the genes between them are
exchanged, shown as Figure 9. The chromosome 𝐶1and𝐶2in the
individual𝑆1are selected and the crossover points are 𝑝1and𝑝2.
The genes on 𝐶1and𝐶2between𝑝1and𝑝2are exchanged.
Figure 9: An example of two-point crossover
(3) Shuffle: shuffle is to randomly change genes’ orders in each
chromosome of the individual, shown as Figure 10. There are two
chromosomes 𝐶1and𝐶2in the individual 𝑆1. The shuffle opera-
tion of𝑆1will swap the gene orders randomly in the 𝐶1and𝐶2
respectively.
Figure 10: An example of shuffle
To determine the thresholds for 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑚and𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑐, we
tested different values within the range of thresholds that existing
genetic algorithms recommends [ 28], and chose 0.3 for 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑚
and 0.4 for𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑐respectively.
4.3 Restart
To resolve the convergence issue during the search process, MOSAT
designs restart mechanism, which will be triggered by the stagna-
tion of three consecutive generations, that is, the individuals in
three consecutive generations keep the same during the search (we
regard it as a sign that the evolution is less likely to generate new
safety-critical scenarios).
5 SIMULATION TEST
In this step, the generated scenarios by search process will be ex-
ecuted in the simulator. Existing search-based ADS testing tech-
niques execute each generated scenario in the simulator by recon-
necting ADS and resetting the simulator repeatedly, which has two
main limitations: 1) the scenarios generated by search process are
usually simple and have a short duration, and cannot challenge
the ADS continuously for long miles driving; 2) after executing
each scenario, the simulator needs to reset its state and reconnect
with ADS, which is time-consuming. According to our experiments,
simulator resetting and ADS reconnection time will account for
about two-thirds of the total scenario execution time.
In order to assess the ADS comprehensively in the long time
driving and improve the test efficiency at the same time, we de-
sign a spatiotemporally continuous driving environment, in which
the scenarios generated by multiple search processes are executed
alternately to construct a more complex scenario as a whole that

can challenge ADS continuously in one test. Figure 11 shows the
proposed scenario execution process in the simulator.
To execute the scenarios continuously, MOSAT runs multiple
search processes in parallel, and it also maintains a queue that
saves the scenarios generated by different search processes. Each
scenario also has a process id which denotes the search process
that generates it. Initially, MOSAT starts the simulator, connects
with ADS, sets ego vehicle’s starting point, and spawns it to drive
in the simulator. Then the scenarios saved in the queue will be
executed. MOSAT retrieves the scenario data from the head of the
queue, computes the real-time position of each NPC according to
its relative position to ego, and executes the maneuvers of NPCs
specified in each chromosome.
When NPC vehicles finish the specified behaviors, MOSAT feeds
the recorded data (positions and speeds of ego vehicle and NPC
vehicles) from the simulator back to the corresponding search pro-
cess according to process id of the scenario, Then MOSAT clears
NPC vehicles created by the last scenario and resets the state of
ego vehicle to drive by following the current lane at constant speed
if its behavior is abnormal (e.g., cannot move). Then it fetches the
next scenario from the queue, and computes the initial positions
of NPC vehicles relative to ego vehicle’s current position in the
simulator. After that, it spawns NPC vehicles to drive according
to the specified maneuvers. Before each scenario starts to execute,
MOSAT will take a snapshot of the current state of the ego vehi-
cle(e.g., its position and speed) and check whether a safety violation
for ego vehicle occurs during the execution of the scenario. If true,
the scenario will be saved and can be replayed automatically for
failure reproduction and diagnosis in the simulator.
6 EVALUATION
In this section, we apply MOSAT to generate safety-critical sce-
narios for testing Baidu Apollo, an industrial-grade, level-4 ADS
system. To evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of MOSAT, we
answer the following research questions.
RQ1: How effective is MOSAT in finding safety violations of ADS?
RQ2: How effective and efficient is MOSAT to expose safety viola-
tions compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques?
6.1 Experiment Setup
We conducted the experiments on Ubuntu 18.04 with 500 GB mem-
ory, an Intel Core i7 CPU, and an NVIDIA GTX2060 TI. Apollo
6.0 [1] and SVL 2021.2 [ 2] (an end-to-end autonomous vehicle sim-
ulation platform) were selected to evaluate MOSAT. Apollo 6.0
is equipped with a wide range of sensors, including two camera
sensors (one at the top and another in front of ego vehicle), one

GPS, one radar, and one lidar. During the experiments, all sensors
are turned on. For long-mile testing of Apollo, we choose the San-
Francisco map with the longest roads in the SVL map library to
run scenarios generated by MOSAT, shown as Figure 12, which
contains various types of roads. Note that, our approach is not tied
to particular simulators. Now we choose SVL as it supports the
connection with Apollo.

6.2 Experiment Design
For RQ1, we run MOSAT to generate scenarios and evaluate the
performance of the ADS in the scenarios. The collision listener is
set on the ego vehicle to monitor safety violations of Apollo, which
are then manually classified into different types based on the NPC
vehicles’ trajectories and possible design deficiencies in Apollo.
For RQ2, we evaluate MOSAT with two baselines: AV-Fuzzer [ 36]
and VERIFAI [ 18]. The first baseline, AV-Fuzzer, is an open-source,
search-based testing technique, which uses genetic algorithm to
evolve NPC vehicles’ movements to expose safety violations of
ADSs. The second baseline, VERIFAI, is a software toolkit for for-
mal analysis of AI-based CPS (Cyber Physical System), which can
generate test scenarios by optimized sampling in feature spaces to
falsify the defined property. Here, we use VERIFAI to find safety
violations of ADSs. We run MOSAT, VERIFAI and AV-Fuzzer for the
same amount of time, and compare their effectiveness and efficiency
from the following aspects:
•How many types of safety violations can be found?
•How much time does it take to generate one scenario?
•How many scenarios are generated to find a safety violation?
•How long does it take at least to expose all found types of
safety violations of ADS under test?
•How distinct are different types of safety violations?
Note that, to answer RQ1 and RQ2, we run each experiment
for 40 hours. The experiments were repeated 5 times considering
the randomness of the approaches, and the average results were
computed and compared in the following.
The operational design domain in our experiments includes fol-
lowing conditions:
•Road: road types include highway and urban-way, and road
shapes include straights, crossings, T-shaped, curves;
•Weather: sunny in daytime;
•Traffic facilities:traffic-lights and lane-markings on roads;
•Speed limit:the speed of NPC vehicles on urban way is below
16𝑚/𝑠, and below 32 𝑚/𝑠on highway. The deceleration/ac-
celeration of NPC vehicles is in [-5 𝑚/𝑠2, 5𝑚/𝑠2].The major safety requirement that MOSAT concerns is that the
ADS under test should avoid collision with participants in scenarios.
MOSAT computes METTC to estimate the collision risk of the ego
vehicle. The other potential safety factors include following traffic
regulations (e.g., pedestrian avoidance, following lane directions,
and traffic lights).
To set an appropriate number of vehicles in the scenario (too few
NPC vehicles cannot create perturbations to the AV, too many NPC
vehicles are likely to lead to collisions between NPC vehicles so that
they cannot fully perform the specified actions), we set the number
of chromosomes 𝑛∈[1,𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑚∗2]in each scenario, and 𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑚
is the number of lanes of the road. The number of chromosomes
in each scenario generated by each search process is the same. For
the number of genes in each chromosome, we set the number of
genes𝑙∈[4,10]in each chromosome, as too few genes cannot
create diverse and complex situations, while too many genes will
waste a large amount of running time. To ensure NPC vehicles have
more chances to impact ego vehicle, MOSAT sets the initial distance
between NPC vehicle and ego vehicle is no more than 50 meters. k
is the number of selected optimal individuals in each generation.
To balance the search effects and evolving costs, MOSAT randomly
generates k∈[4,8]for each search process.
6.3 Result Analysis: RQ1
For each run, on average, 5903 scenarios (min 5481 and max 6215)
are generated by MOSAT and 216 (min 182 and max 247) out of
them have safety violations. One safety violation of Apollo occurs
in 27 generated scenarios. Based on vehicle trajectories and possi-
ble design deficiencies in Apollo, all safety-violation scenarios are
categorized into 11 distinct types, which are all revealed in the first
19 hours of each experiment.
To study how distinct the different types of safety-violation
scenarios found by MOSAT are, we calculate Euclidean distances
between NPC vehicles’ trajectories across the 11 different types
of safety-violation scenarios above. The larger the distance, the
more different the safety-violation types. The results are shown in
Figure 13. The minimum distance is 35.77 meters (between type 2
and type 3), and the maximum distance is 90.70 meters (between
type 6 and type 11). The average distance between different types
of safety violations is 71.72 meters. It can be seen that the found
different types of safety-violation scenarios are distinct from the
perspective of NPC vehicles’ trajectories.
Before understanding the exposed potential deficiencies for the
found safety violations, we first introduce the main functionality of
each module in Apollo. Generally, there are seven main modules in
Apollo, including sensor module, perception module, localization
module, prediction module, routing module, planning module, and
control module. The sensor module preprocesses input data and fil-
ters sensor noise. The perception module receives data from sensor
module and uses computer vision and deep-learning techniques to
detect static objects (e.g. lanes, traffic signs) and dynamic objects
(e.g. vehicles) in the surroundings. The localization module provides
the real-time location of the AV. The prediction module predicts
the behavior of all objects detected by the perception module. The
routing module generates high-level navigation information based
on the current location and destination of the AV. The planning
module computes a safe driving trajectory for the AV using the

output from localization and prediction modules. The control mod-
ule generates control commands (e.g. throttle, brake, steer angle)
according to the trajectory from planning module. In the following,
we show an example for each type of safety violation and analyze
the potential deficiencies of Apollo.
Example 1: shown as Figure 14, ego vehicle rear-ends the NPC
vehicle which is overtaking ego vehicle. In the scenario, ego vehicle
is driving along the lane, and an NPC vehicle which has a short
distance with ego vehicle cuts into the lane where ego is driving.
Then the NPC vehicle brakes and ego vehicle rear-ends it. The
reason of this collision is that the prediction module fails to predict
the intention of overtaking vehicle, and the planning module fails
to make control module decelerate immediately when the NPC
vehicle brakes in the front. Hence ego vehicle doesn’t decelerate in
advance to keep a safe distance with the front vehicle, leading to
rear-end collision.

from the side. The NPC vehicle is driving on the lane line, and ego
vehicle hits it from the side. In this scenario, the sensor module has
sensed the NPC vehicle, but the perception module fails to detect
the size of the NPC vehicle correctly, leading to the collision.

of the NPC vehicle, leading to the collision.
Example 4: shown as Figure 17, ego vehicle collides with a start-
ing vehicle during the overtaking. The perception module detects
the vehicle has stopped ahead on the lane, and the planning module
outputs the overtaking instruction. When ego vehicle cuts into the
original lane, the NPC vehicle starts driving to the adjacent lane.
The perception module fails to detect the lane change action of the
NPC vehicle, leading to the collision.

the two lane-changing vehicles. The two NPC vehicles ( 𝑎and𝑏) are
changing lanes at the same time. The perception module detects
their lane-changing behaviors. The planning module of ego vehicle

the lane-changing action of vehicle 𝑏in time.

the lane-changing of the front vehicle, and the prediction module
predicts the NPC vehicle will finish the lane-changing within a
short time. Therefore, ego vehicle continues to drive at the current
speed. The reason for this collision is that the planning module
doesn’t change the planned trajectories although the perception
module detects the deceleration of the NPC vehicle.

close to it. As the prediction module fails to predict the trajectory
of NPC vehicle’s continuous behaviors, the localization module and
planning module do not keep the safe distance of ego vehicle with
the NPC vehicle on the adjacent lane, which makes too small time
for ego vehicle to avoid the collision.

To evaluate the benefits brought by motif patterns and spa-
tiotemporal continuous environment, we implemented two variant
versions of MOSAT, called 𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑚and𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑠, respectively.
In𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑚, sequences of driving maneuvers of NPC vehicles
consist of only atomic maneuvers (without motif patterns), and
chromosomes are crossed and mutated by only atomic genes. In
𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑠, each generated test scenario is executed separately with
repeated ADS connection and simulator reset. We run 𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑚
and𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑠for 40 hours on the same roads as MOSAT.

Table 1 shows the comparison result of 𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑚and𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑠.
𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑚exposes 6 types of safe violations (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th,
11th).𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑚generates 7885 scenarios (min 7096 and max 8288)
and 84 scenarios (min 69 and max 88) are safety-violation scenarios.
One safety violation occurs out of 93 generated scenarios on average
and all types of safety violations are revealed in the first 15 hours.
102ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore Haoxiang Tian, Yan Jiang, Guoquan Wu, Jiren Yan, Jun Wei, Wei Chen, Shuo Li, and Dan Ye
It can be seen that, for 𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑚, the safety-violation exposure
frequency and exposed types of safety violations are fewer than
MOSAT. We can conclude that motif pattern is more effective in
generating safety-violation scenarios and finding more types of
safety violations.
On average, 𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑠generates 2285 scenarios (min 2041 and
max 2403) 82 scenarios (min 74 and max 101) out of them have safety
violations. 11 types of safety violations are exposed by 𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑠
and all of them are revealed in the first 33 hours. It can be seen that
the test efficiency of 𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑠is lower than MOSAT. Based on the
experimental result, we can conclude that the proposed spatiotem-
poral continuous environment can improve the test efficiency of
scenario generation and execution.
6.4 Result Analysis: RQ2
We run AV-Fuzzer and VERIFAI on the same freeway and urban
way as MOSAT. In 40-hour running, VERIFAI generates more than
3000 scenarios, and AV-Fuzzer restarts more than 50 times and
generates more than 2000 scenarios. Note that, as the running time
of each experiment is long enough, there is little difference among
the experimental results of 5 runs. Therefore, we only analyze and
compare average results in the following.
We compare the three approaches from five aspects:
(1) number of found safety-violation types;
(2) time cost for one scenario;
(3) number of generated scenarios to expose one safety violation;
(4) time to find all safety-violation types that each tool can;
(5) average Euclidean distance across different types of safety
violations.
Figure 25 shows the growth in the number of safety-violation
types found by the three approaches over time. It can be seen
that the types of safety violations found by MOSAT are the most.
The convergence of VERIFAI is the fastest and the safety-violation
types found by VERIFAI are the least. The convergence speed of
AV-Fuzzer close to MOSAT, and most types of safety violations are
observed in the first 10-hour search. All types of safety violations
are revealed in the first 20-hour search.

MOSAT VS AV-Fuzzer. Table 2 shows the comparison result
of MOSAT and AV-Fuzzer. AV-Fuzzer generates 2619 scenarios in
40-hour running (min 2256 and max 2893), 26 of them are safety-
violation scenarios (min 19 and max 31). On average, it takes 55seconds to generate and run a scenario, and one safety violation of
Apollo occurs in 101 generated scenarios. AV-Fuzzer finds 5 types
of safety violations and all of them occur in the first 21 hours. We
calculate Euclidean distances of NPC vehicles’ trajectories across
the 5 types of safety violation scenarios. We randomly select one
safety-violation scenario for each type and calculates the Euclidean
distance among them. The calculations for MOSAT and AV-Fuzzer
are conducted and repeated for 5 times, respectively. The average
Euclidean distance for AV-Fuzzer is 65.35 meters, and for MOSAT
this value is 72.23 meters.

Compared with AV-Fuzzer, MOSAT can find more types of safety
violations in Apollo in a shorter time. The safety-violation expo-
sure frequency in MOSAT is higher, which shows that MOSAT
can efficiently generate more adversarial scenarios. The average
Euclidean distance across different types of safety violations found
by MOSAT is larger than AV-Fuzzer, which shows that MOSAT can
generate more diverse safety-violation scenarios. MOSAT generates
and executes test scenarios with less time. For MOSAT, the time to
find all types of safety violations is close to AV-Fuzzer. Moreover,
all 5 types of safety violations found by AV-Fuzzer, are all exposed
by MOSAT (1st, 3rd, 7th, 10th, 11th). This shows that MOSAT is
more effective to expose different types of safety violations. The
distinctions of different types of safety-violation scenarios found
by MOSAT are also larger.
MOSAT VS VERIFAI. Table 3 shows the comparison of MOSAT
and VERIFAI. VERIFAI provides three optimized sampling algo-
rithms to compute NPC vehicles’ trajectories: cross entropy (CE),
bayesian optimization (BO), and halton (HA). In 40-hour running
of each experiment, each sampling method is used to run for 13
hours as they fall into the local optimum quickly, and the results
are shown as Table 3.

Table 3 shows the effect of the three sampling algorithms in
VERIFAI. It can be seen that, for VERIFAI, it consumes more time
to generate and execute one test scenario. The sampling algorithms
make NPC vehicles’ trajectories close to ego vehicle in all scenarios,
so the safety-violation exposure frequency of scenarios in VERIFAI
is higher, but the convergence of VERIFAI is much faster than
MOSAT. However, VERIFAI only finds 4 types of safety violations
of Apollo, which are all discovered by MOSAT (3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th).
The smaller Euclidean distances across different types of safety-
violation scenarios show that the diversity of safety violations
found by VERIFAI is less than the ones found by MOSAT. From the
experimental result, we can conclude that MOSAT is more effective
to generate distinct critical scenarios.
7 DISCUSSION
To increase the chance to disturb the ADS in the generated scenar-
ios, we propose four types motif patterns based on four supported
atomic driving maneuvers in SVL simulator, which can be further
instantiated into nine different motif genes when running the sce-
nario in the simulator. It should be noted that the proposed motif
patterns can be extended, and we plan to investigate more atomic
driving maneuvers and motif patterns in the future.
Currently, our approach is implemented based on SVL simulator
and evaluated by using Baidu Apollo, as the connection between
Apollo and SVL is supported officially. Although we heard that SVL
simulator is not supported in the future [ 5], our approach does
not depend on any specific simulator, and it can also be applied to
other popular simulators (e.g., Carla) as long as they provide APIs
to connect with industrial-grade AV system.
8 RELATED WORK
Testing is a conventional technique to assess ADSs. Some studies
bridge conventional testing techniques to AVs [ 15,27,35,38]. Corso
et al. [ 16] inject noise into the input sensor data of AVs and leverage
adaptive stress-testing techniques to find both vulnerabilities and
failures of perception in AVs. Hauer et al. [ 27] present a suitable
test ending criterion and methodology for ADS testing. Majzik et
al. [38] combine various model-based techniques to address the
system-level testing of the situation-dependent behavior of AVs.
Tuncali et al. [ 52] design and demonstrate a testing framework
that is compatible with test case generation and automatic falsifica-
tion methods which are used to evaluate closed-loop properties of
ADS. Chen et al. [ 15] propose an efficient fault injector for finding
safety-critical bits in ML components. These approaches focus on
assessing components (i.e, AI modules, ML modules, etc) in ADSs.
However, as an ADS consists of many safety-critical components
that work together, it is important to assess ADS software end-to-
end to understand the deficiencies of the system.
Due to the huge input space and functional complexity of ADSs
[9,45,48], how to fully test ADSs have received significant atten-
tions in recent years [ 14,29,55]. Scenario-based techniques are
widely used in ADS testing [ 18,25,40,49,52]. Some researchers
[17,26,33] utilize machine learning techniques (e.g., reinforcement
learning, optimal sampling) to find the optimum solution of test
scenarios. Koren et al. [ 33] formulate the AV testing as a Markov
decision process and use reinforcement learning algorithms to findthe most likely failure scenarios. Dreossi et al. [ 17,18] apply formal
methods to model behaviors of systems that include artificial in-
telligence and machine learning in the presence of environmental
uncertainty and analyze the systems. Parameters of environments
are sampled in the input spaces and augmented to search for falsifi-
cations for specifications of the ADS. However, existing techniques
still require lots of time to optimize sampling, and generated sce-
narios tend to be similar, which is challenging to scale ADSs testing
to such a rapidly developing AV industry (such as Apollo, which
releases updates on a weekly basis).
The key task of testing ADSs is to create safety-critical scenarios.
To find out safety violations of ADSs effectively and efficiently,
evolutionary algorithms [ 13,49] are applied to improve the criti-
cality of the generated test scenarios [ 6,11,32,36,37,46]. Kluck
et al. [ 32] outline the use of genetic algorithm to aim at obtain-
ing critical scenarios that form the basis for virtual verification
and validation of ADss. Abdessalem et al. [ 11] provided an ap-
proach to generate critical scenarios for ADSs by combining multi-
objective search with surrogate models developed based on neural
networks. They further [ 6] propose to define a set of hybrid test
objectives (distance functions) that combine traditional coverage-
based heuristics with new heuristics specifically aimed at generat-
ing critical scenarios which can reveal feature interaction failures.
In these works, the input of a test scenario is defined as a vector
consisting of multiple variables with value ranges, and various
search-based testing techniques are used to explore the input space.
Different from these works, AV-Fuzzer [ 36] perturbs the driving ma-
neuvers of participants in an evolving traffic environment, which
generates test scenarios towards safety-violation scenarios through
high-level variation operations. Compared with AV-fuzzer, MOSAT
is more effective and efficient by introducing motif pattern and
spatiotemporal-continuous environment. The fitness function also
considers multiple objectives to generate diverse and adversarial
scenarios, while single objective is designed in AV-fuzzer.
9 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose MOSAT, a multi-objective search-based
testing framework for ADS testing by constructing diverse and
adversarial scenarios to expose safety violations of ADSs. Based
on atomic driving maneuvers, MOSAT introduces motif patterns
to generate adversarial behaviors for AVs. MOSAT applies Pareto
optimality to maximize the perturbations to AV and the diversity of
generated scenarios, and minimize ETTC metric to effectively ex-
pose various safety violations of ADS. MOSAT runs the generated
test scenarios in the simulator continuously by parallel execution
of multiple search processes to test the performance of AV compre-
hensively in long-mile driving. The experimental results based on
an industrial-grade ADS system, Baidu Apollo, show that MOSAT
can find more types of safety violations efficiently than existing
state-of-the-art techniques.
