ABSTRACT
Research has established the wide variety of security failures in
mobileapps,theirconsequences,andhowappdevelopersintroduce
or exacerbate them. What is not well known is whydevelopers do
so—what is the rationale underpinning the decisions they make
whicheventuallystrengthenorweakenappsecurity?Thisisallthe
more complicated in modern app development’s increasingly di-
versedemographic:growingnumbersofindependent,solo,orsmall

support that larger software developmenthouses enjoy.
Through two studies, we open thebox on developer rationale, by
performingaholisticanalysisoftherationaleunderpinningvarious
activities in which app developers engage when developing an app.
The ﬁrst study does so through a task-based study with app
developers (N=44) incorporating six distinct tasks for which this
developerdemographicmusttakeresponsibility:settingupadevel-
opmentenvironment,reviewingcode,seekinghelp,seekingtesters,
selecting an advertisement SDK, and software licensing. We found
that, while on ﬁrstglance in several activities participants seemed
to prioritizesecurity, only in the code tasksuch prioritization was
underpinnedbyasecurityrationale–indicatingthatdevelopment

1 INTRODUCTION
Security failures in mobile apps and their consequences are well
understood–rangingfromforgettingtosanitizeuserinputtothird
party libraries using dynamic code-loading to execute malicious
content [9,19,21,25], or simply copy pasting insecure or obsolete
codesnippets[ 22].But,secureappdevelopmentisaboutmorethan
just writing secure code. A range of activities, such as, choice of
development environment plugins, seeking help when things go
wrong andmonetizationoftheapp viathird partyad libraries,all
haveapotentialimpactonsecurity.Priorworkhasfocusedonwhat
developersdo—althoughprimarilyinactivitiesthatsurroundthe
actual writing of code—we instead ask what drives developers to do
thingssecurelyornotacrossthevarietyofappdevelopmentactivities :
whatrationaleunderpins their decisions?
To complicate matters, the demographic of app developers has
expanded signiﬁcantly as well : app development is no longer the
domain of the select few with deep technical skills, training and
knowledge. Apps are now being developed by a wide range of
people with diverse backgrounds. Already in 2012 reports showed
that 40% of app developers were independent solo developers [ 17],
1492020 IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)
ICSE ’20, May 23–29, 2020,Seoul,Republicof Korea van derLinden, et al.
and more recent reports have shown that solo hobbyistandam-
ateurdevelopersconstitute43%oftheappdevelopercommunity.
Professional app developers’ have moved towards smaller scales
as well: solo or small scale developer teams constitute a further
36%ofthedemographic[ 42].Withlittleabilitytodelegatethings
these(oftenindependent)developers donotknowhowtodo– or
do not want to do – they must tackle a number of activities and
considerations[ 18],exempliﬁedinFigure1.Whatdevelopersdo
duringalltheseactivities(andnotjustwhilewritingcode)–andthe
rationale underpinning their actions – may compromise or worsen
the security of the resultingapp.

“Who can I get

Figure 1: App development activities, with typical consider-
ations
developers run across, adapted from[18, 38].
Yet, this increasingly diverse and independent group of develop-
ers remains under-studied, much research (e.g., [ 6,7,33]) focusing
on experienced, well-established developers. Research also tended
to focus more on whatestablished developers do (wrong), e.g.,
programmingerrors[ 21],misuseofeitherAPIs[ 33]oronlineinfor-
mationsources(e.g.,Stackoverﬂow[ 3])–whilenoteliciting why
they do so. For instance, researchers have shown that copy/pasting
fromStackOverﬂowmaybeharmful[ 22].Therearereasons why
developersdoit:shrinkingdeadlines,frustrationwithcodenotcom-
piling,poordocumentation–allcontributetowardavalidrationale
for developers to ‘throw caution to the wind’ and do something
they mayvery well knowto be less secure.
Similarly,whiledevelopersmayunderstandthepotentialsecu-
rityimplicationsofallowingthird-partycodetoloadintotheirapp
and execute, the necessary step of monetization brings exactly this
threat of dynamic code loading. With developers often failing to
convince users to pay even $0 .99 for an app (let alone consider
subscriptionfeesforaservice),manyturntoadvertisementsasa
reliable way of income. An increasing number of these libraries
turn outto be malicious, e.g., Xavier[ 20] and Igexin [ 10]. Likewise,
most people would intuitively avoid accepting gifts from strangers.
Or, in the context of app development, a USB stick from a local
user group with a copy of one’s preferred platform development
tools. Yet,as the Xcode-ghost malware that aﬀected >500 million
iOS users [ 39] showed, there was a valid rationale behind doingexactly that: many developers lived in areas where they did not
have suﬃcient bandwidth to (easily) download Xcode.
This paper is the ﬁrst to present empirical insight into the ratio-
nale underpinning the various activities in which the ever-growing
partofthedevelopercommunityofdiverseandindependentappdevel-
opersengage(cf.Fig.1)andtheextenttowhichsecurityfeaturesin
thisrationale.Theinsightisbasedontwostudiesofappdevelopers
whohave gone through such activities andpublishedapps:
(1)An in-depth exploration of developers’ prioritization (and
subsequent rationalization) during tasks modeling these

(2)A survey of a large sample of app developers’ attitude to-
wardstheimpactofvariousactivitiesonappsecurity—whether

Our analysis is the ﬁrst to uncover that while developers may
oftenmakesecuredecisionsacrossthediﬀerentactivitiestheyhave
todealwith—evenactivitiesnotdealingwithcode—openingthebox
on theirrationale collapses the illusionof developers knowingly and
intentionallyacting securely.We contributethe following:
•When faced with acoding task, almost half (43%) of partici-
pantsrationalizetheirdecisionusingsecurityconsiderations.
However,whenfacedwithanyotherkindoftask,developers
rarely rationalize their decisions using security considera-
tions (supported by binomial test comparison of rationale
proportions,p<0.01).Thisindicatesthatdevelopersmayonly
really considersecurity when facing code.
•When faced with most other tasks (e.g., building a license
agreement),half(50%)oftheparticipantsperformedthem
securely but did so withoutexpressing a clear security ra-
tionale. This indicates that perceived secure development
behaviormayonly be an illusion.
•When faced with the two tasks that involve (the need for)
social interaction with others, few (14% and 23%) partici-
pants performed them securely (supported by binomial test
comparison of task solutions, p<0.01). This indicates that
developers may underestimate the impact their social inter-
action withotherpeople can have ontheir app’ssecurity.
•A wider survey of a representative app developer sample
(N=274) further supports the ﬁnding that security rationales

Developers need to be supported in understanding the security im-

2 BACKGROUNDAND RELATED WORK
2.1 Vulnerabilities in mobile apps
Security failures in mobile apps and their consequences – ranging
from developers forgetting to sanitize user input to third-party
libraries using dynamic code-loading to execute maliciouscontent
– are well understood [ 9,19,21,25]. The factors that inﬂuence
securityonmajormobileecosystemssuchasAndroidandiOS[ 1,
30],aswellasattackers’behaviortosomeextent[ 8],havealsobeen
studied.Onthedeveloperside,vulnerabilitymitigationtypically
focusesontool-basedinterventionstocatchvulnerabilitiesthrough
static or dynamic analysis (cf. [ 36,37,40]), assess third-party code
or binaries loaded into the app [ 35], and the promotion of APIs
which take critical code out of developers’ hands [ 41], the usability
of whichfor developers has been criticized[1].
Our focus on understanding what app developers prioritize and

ofworkbyhighlighting whyvulnerabilitiesarise.This,inturn,can
helptofocusinterventionsnotjustonidentifyingvulnerabilities
in code, but also on other tasks surrounding coding where the root
causes maylie.
2.2 Developermotivation
A2012studyofmobileappdevelopersfoundthat40%workedas
independents,27%in small 2–3person organizations [ 17]. Recent
professionalreports[ 43]showthatappdevelopershavelesspro-
fessional experience, and are not as motivated by ﬁnancial gains
as others. For example, the solo ‘hobbyists’ (15%) and ‘explorers’
(28%)–thoseworkingto gainexperience,constitutedalmosthalf
of the developer demographic in 2016. Other demographics consti-
tute a rather signiﬁcant proportion, such as ‘hunters’: independent
developersfocusedonthemoney(21%),and‘gunsforhire’:indepen-
dentdevelopersworkingoncommission(15%). Thesedemographics
clearlyemphasizetheneedtounderstandtherealityofthisnewgroup
oflessestablisheddevelopers. Whenitcomestomotivationsforse-
curity,developersvarytowhatextenttheyconsiderittobepartof
their development process [ 7]. While many developersare known
to pass responsibility for security to others if they can [ 49] and
focus instead on functionality [ 47], the growing demographic of
independentappdevelopersmaynothavethisluxury,orhaveto
rely on diﬀerent means to have recourse on others’ knowledge.
Intrinsicmotivationforsecuresoftwarehasbeenfoundtotranslate

anti-motivationinthecontextofappdevelopmentisaperceived
lackofself-competence,whicharisesthroughalackofextantre-
sourcesandsupport[ 5],whichmayarise especiallyinthecaseof

Our work shows that, notwithstanding code, by and large devel-
opersdonotreasonaboutsecurityinmanydevelopmentactivities—
providingacontrastingviewpointthatitisnotsomuchwhetherdevelopersare(de)motivatedtoworksecurely,butthatitmaynever
even occur to them.
2.3 Developer-centredsecurity
Recent work has started to focus on developer-centred security,
bothunderstanding(e.g.,[ 7,27,48])andimproving(e.g.,[ 28,46])
how they engage with security. Much of this work is focused on
security surrounding technical code activities (e.g., coding, testing,
deploying), or studying developers in traditional larger software
development organizations (e.g., [ 6,24]). Research has also shown
that security knowledge does not guarantee secure software: some
developers with good understanding of security practices fail to
applyit,whileotherdeveloperswithverylittlesecurityknowledge
somehow builtsecure software [31].
Littleworkhasyetfocusedonthisbreadthofknowledgenow
required of developers. For example, a recent survey of security
advicemostvisibletodevelopers[ 4]discussesguidancecentered
almost exclusively on code-related security concerns. A recent
researchagendasimilarlyfocusesoncodingactivities[ 3],ﬁnding
wildlydiﬀering attitudes towardssecurity inthis taskalone.
In contrast our ﬁndings oﬀer support for the position that, espe-
cially in the app development context characterized by individuals
andsmallteams,securityvulnerabilitiesshouldbeunderstoodin
contextoftherationalefortheactivitiesthatintroducedthem.Only
by understanding the lack of security rationale can we begin to
conceptualize interventions to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
3 STUDYI: SECURITYRATIONALESACROSS
APP DEVELOPMENTACTIVITIES
We designed a task-based online study to address three research
questions:
(1)Do app developers prioritize security during diﬀerent activi-
ties in whichthey engagewhile producing the app?
(2)Are activities where security is prioritized informed by a
security rationale?
(3)Whatexplanationsunderlietherationalesthatdevelopers
have for their prioritization?
Drawing on examples established in the literature, we identiﬁed
six tasks that reﬂect the activities that developers typically under-
take[18],allofwhichpresentsomeformofsecurityconcern.We
provided brief scenarios, and a selection of choices – some secu-
rity focused, and some not. An overview of the tasks as they were
presentedtoparticipants–andhowweoperationalizedwhether
participants’ selection and sorting of choices prioritizes security or
not, is given inFig. 2.

Task 1: Se/t_ting up an IDE IDEs are commonplace, and can
be conﬁgured to provide necessary support to developers. The
selectionwasdrawnfromalistofmostpopularplugintypes.Of
thegiventypeofplugins,thestaticanalyzerwithsecuritychecking

analysis of code vulnerabilities, and its inclusion can reasonably be
assumedto follow from an attitude of prioritizingsecurity.
Task 2: Fixing source-code Storingpasswordsinplaintextis
an obvious security concern which should be avoided. If partici-
pants select any other code fragment, they de-prioritize security
(or do not have the expertise and/or security-focused approach
to development). Thus, to prioritize security, participants should
selectthesecurityconcern.Anexampleofthecodepresentedto
participants(oneofthreerandomlyshownvariationstoruleout
primingbias) is shownin the onlineappendix [45].
Task3:SeekinghelponaconfusingAPI Researchhasshown
thatcopypastingsolutionsfromStackOverﬂowdoesnotbeneﬁtse-
curity [29]. Moreover, in a secure coding experiment, itwas shown
that between four groups only allowed to use either oﬃcial API
documentation,appdevelopmentbook,websearches,orStackOver-
ﬂow, it was the group who only used StackOverﬂow that produced
theleastsecuresolutions.Incontrast,thegrouponlyallowedtouse
oﬃcial API documentation produced the most secure solutions [ 3].
Thus, to prioritize security, participants should ﬁrst read the API’s
documentation, and only as a last resort go to StackOverﬂow to
copy-pastean example—and not justtrust any example.
Task4:Seekingtesters Researchonapptestingandreleasehas
shownthat‘just’releasingappsisfraughtwithissues[ 26].Using
dedicated user groups for testing helps to ensure that usability and
security do not oppose each other [ 16]. Thus, app testing via a
user group prioritizes a comprehensive testing approach while just
publishing the app withoutany testingde-prioritizes security.
Task 5: Selecting an advertisement SDK There has been a
steadyincreaseinthenumberofpermissionsusedbyadlibraries[ 11].
Research has stressed the need to carefully assess the permissions
requested by Android advertisement libraries before incorporat-
ing them [ 44] to avoid accidentally including malicious libraries.
Thus, to prioritize security, participants should rank analyzing the
requiredpermissionsoftheadlibraryhighly(viceversa,ahigher
ranking for including ad libraries at random, or including as many
as possible,de-prioritizes security).
Task 6:Building a so/f_tware licenseagreement Research has
shown that prohibiting reverse engineering and bench marking
promotesdiscoveryandsharingofvulnerabilitiesinblackhatcom-
munities, while denying this to white hat communities [ 12,14].
Thus, to prioritize security, prohibitions on reverse engineering
and/or bench marking should not be included.
We trialed an initial study among ﬁve professionals with a back-
groundincomputer scienceand/orprogramming.Their feedback
wasusedtoverifytheestimatedtimeneededtocompletethesur-
vey(30±5minutes)andremoveanypotentialmisunderstandings
inthephrasingandunintentionalconnotationsofdemonstrative

withthesameﬁveprofessionals,afterwhichnofurtherremarkson
its structure were found. Before conducting the study, we obtained
IRB approval. No personally identifying information was collected
in the study itself.3.1 Participants
Weusedsocialnetworksandpublicmailingliststoapproachappde-
velopers,regardlessofplatform(e.g.,Android,iOS).Inparticular,we
solicitedparticipation in the studyvia relevantprofessionalgroups
on LinkedIn and Facebook by searching for the terms ‘mobile soft-
ware’ or ‘app’ and ‘developer’, as well as ‘iOS’ and ‘Android’. After
identifying and joining several relevant groups we snowballed for
more potential sources of participants by looking at linked groups.
Since our goal was to study the rationale used by app devel-
opersacrosstheentiretyofappdevelopment,weimplementeda
strictexclusioncriterionofanydeveloperswhohadnotactuallyre-
leased/publishedatleastoneapponanappstore(e.g.,GooglePlay,
Apple App Store). While this signiﬁcantly reduced the potential
population, it was necessary in order to establish a realistic picture
of developers who can be expected to have had to deal with the
diﬀerentdimensionsof app development.
3.2 Materialsandprocedure
Thetasksgiventotheparticipants,seeFig.2,reﬂecttheactivities
thatdeveloperstypicallyundertake[ 18](cf.Fig.1).Eachtaskwas
followedbyanopenquestionelicitingtherationaleoftheirsolu-
tion.Thetaskswerepresentedaspartofanonlinequestionnaire
that also included background questions: 24 professional and 4
basicdemographics(age,gender,nationality,educationlevel).We
neither mentioned the security focus of the study nor elicited (self-
reported) security experience in the study. This would likely create
demand characteristics and, therefore, exaggerate pro-security an-
swers (relative to real-world decisions). Moreover, self-reported
security experience would be diﬃcult to interpret in a way that
compares objectively across participants as, for example, simply
measuringacquaintancewithOWASPTop10listsdoesnotmean
participants have also meaningfully engaged with such knowledge.
The study was open for four months, from March to June 2018. We

to elicit additional responses. All raw data of Study I is available
onlineat the onlineappendix [45].
3.3 Data analysis
Pre-processing. Intotal,wereceived47completeresponses.Be-
fore analysis, we manually detected any suspicious entries, dis-
carding three responses based on repetition of nonsensical texts as
answers to all open questions. This led to a ﬁnal set of 44 usable
responses.
Task analysis. To assess whether a task’s solution indicated a
potential security attitude ( RQ1) we used the options as per Fig. 2:
Task1should have at least “static code analayzer with security
checking rules” selected.
Task 2should have “security concern”selected.
Task3shouldhave“readtheAPI’soﬃcialdocumentation”sorted
as 1st or 2nd choice, while “Go to a speciﬁc online resource like
StackOverﬂow to ask forhelp and use a workingexample” should
be sortedas 4th or5th choice.
Task 4shouldhave“sendittoausergroupfortesting”sorted
as1stor2ndchoice,while“publishitrightawayand relyonuser

Rationale analysis. To assess whether the tasks were performed
withasecurityrationale, andwhetherthiscorrelatedtotheirso-
lution(RQ2), weanalyzedtherationale elicitedfromparticipants

Thematicanalysis. Weusedthematicanalysis[ 13]tofurther
understandparticipants’rationales( RQs1–3),especiallythosethat
were not security related. Two authors independently coded the
rationale data and compared codebooks, agreeing on dominant
themes emergingfrom the analysis.
Statistical tests. Task solutions and rationales were binarily

4 STUDYI –FINDINGS
4.1 Demographics– Who isthearchetypal app
developer?
The range of mobile developers we found in Study I is in line with
existing research [ 17,42] and may eﬀectively be stereotyped as
young independent men with at least a college degree, building
apps to improve their skills and know-how and have fun, while
being heavily reliant on knowledge from community websites like
StackOverﬂow.
Demographics. Participantswerepredominantlymale(89%),some
female(9%)andoneother(2%).Geographically,theyaredistributed
primarilyacrossNorthAmerica(32%),Europe(39%),andtheMiddle
East (27%), with one participant from Asia (2%). The majority were
young, with some published app developers even being under age,
<18(5%),18–24(18%),25–34(41%),35–44(23%),45–54(11%),55–64
(2%). Most ﬁnished a tertiary education, with highest completed
education being vocational training (9%), bachelor (55%), master
(20%), doctoral (9%).
Theprofessionalcontext. Mostdevelopersinthestudyarefairly
junior, having released (or been involved in) one to ﬁve apps (68%),
sixtoten(25%),andonlyafewwith11+(7%).Thebiggestsub-group
was solo developers (36%), followed by part of micro-enterprises
with fewer than 10 people (23%), and ﬁnally SMEs (20%) and large
enterprises (20%). Similarly, development team size tended toward
smallerteams:solodevelopers(39%),twotoﬁvepeople(39%),teams
ofsixtoninepeople(11%),10+people(11%).Evenwithmostpartici-
pantshavingﬁnishedatertiaryqualiﬁcation,themajorityprofessed

tributions from their education (59%), and a much smaller group
mentioning training at work (20%).
The development focus. Participants developed mostly for An-
droid (77%), with iOS (55%), and several others including Windows
Phone (7%). There is a fairly even split between those who develop
exclusivelyforoneplatform(57%),andthosewhodevelopformulti-
pleplatforms(43%).Ofthosedevelopingformultipleplatforms,42%
released simultaneously for all platforms (typically Android and
iOS). Most developed to improve their skills and know-how (68%),
tohavefun (66%),orforintellectualstimulation(55%).Somewhat
less-representedmotivationsincludenoappswithsimilarfunction-
alityexisting yet(41%), ﬁnancial gain(39%), and ﬁnally,building
their reputation within the app developer community (34%).

(the need for) social interaction with, and reliance upon others (i.e.,
askingthemtotestorovercomeacodingchallenge),showedfewer

4.3 Rationale analysis – Whatisin theBox?
We performed two distinct thematic analyses to build a holistic
understanding of developer rationales: one to understand the ratio-
nales driving the choices made in each task, and another to under-
standcross-taskthemes.Fortheﬁrstanalysis,keythemesprevalent
in the codebook are shown in Fig. 4. The three subgroups most

security rationales but non-security solutions, and (3) non-security
rationales with security solutions. Distribution of these subgroups
over the professional demographics of the participants showed no
signiﬁcant deviation acrossorganization size.
4.3.1 Security rationales,and securitysolutions.
Trust in other developers: Across diﬀerent tasks participants
154155ICSE ’20, May 23–29, 2020,Seoul,Republicof Korea van derLinden, et al.
This indicates that messaging about not rolling one’s own crypto is
reaching app developers.
Do input sanitization: Several participants noted this, whether
byexplicitlypointingoutthatthesource-codeintask2lackedthis:
“Variableshaven’tbeen sanitised.”(P39)
tomorenuancedstatementsexplainingoneshouldnotjusttrust
data provided byothers:
“...just inserting untrusted, unsanitised datais abadidea”(P32)
Don’tstorepasswordsinplaintext: Participantsshowedanun-
derstandingoftherisksofstoringpasswordsinplaintext,whether
simply calling itoutas being not done:
“Passwordsshould neverbestoredin plaintext.”(P39)
to re-iterating whythis should not be done:
“This stores the user’s plaintext password in a ﬁle. If the ﬁle was
compromised then user’s passwords would be leaked. Passwords
should neverbestored– Onlythe hash.”(P28)
Staticanalysisandbugspottershelpspotissues: Participants
alsoshowedaclearunderstandingoftheirownlimitationsincatch-
ing any and all possible coding mistakes or vulnerabilities, some
notingadditionallyhowimportantthisiswhendevelopingalone
withoutthe safetynetof awider team:
“Bug spotter and analyzer because it’d help ﬁx issues I create which
is importantas alone devwithno codereview” (P9)
“Themostimportantthingwould be detectingthingsthatare ‘oﬀ’
in the code. Syntax highlighting helps me do this myself, and the
bug spotter / static code analyzer plugins do this in an automated
fashion.”(P19)
Moreover, participants noted the importance of such tools because
even when armedwiththe relevant security knowledge,they
“[...]helppreventnon-obvious securityissues.”(P24)
4.3.2 Securerationales,butothersolutions. Thissubgroup,smaller
innumber than others, shared a number of themes with thosewho
chosesecuritysolutionsandprovidedsecurityrationales,namely,
trusting in other developers, and more technical matters like un-
derstanding permissions, not implementing their own crypto, and
alwaysperforminginputsanitization.
Be careful with personal data: The one particular theme that
cametotheforewithinthissubgroupisthatparticipantsalways
considered whether they would have to process and hold personal
dataoftheirusers,andadjustedtheirdecision-makingaccordingly:
“I’m assuming that if I’m writing an app that requires the user’s
personalinformationIwouldﬁrstmakesurethatIamwell-versed
in the ﬁeld ofdatasecurity.”(P6)
Some participants noted the same reservations in the context of
speciﬁc resourcessuch as adlibraries:
“I would want to know what data libraries want to collect on my
usersandwhatthey plan on doingwithit.”(P24)
Donottestbyyourselfanddon’tassumeusersarepredictable:
This again variedfrom participants simply calling itout,
“Adevelopershould nevertest the codehebuilt.”(P1)
togivingamoredetailedreasoning,e.g.,thatonecanneverpredict
howsoftwareisactuallyused,andthusaccountforthisasmuch
as possible:“Ineverrelyonjustmyselffortesting,sinceIcannotalwaysknow
howpeoplearegoing to use the app beforehand.”(P1)
Similarly,developersgavemoretechnicalconsiderationstodealing
withthe unpredictable nature of their users:
“Nevertrust user input. Sanitizeit beforedoinganything ...”(P18)
4.3.3 Other rationales, but security solutions. By far the largest
subgroupintheanalysis,manyparticipantsproducedasecuresolu-
tion, but seemingly almost by accident. Unclear rationales such as
“nospeciﬁcreason”(P18),orsimplybecauseit’sthe“best[solution]
I could come up with” (P34), or that solutions “looked OK like this.”
(P14)meansthatweareunabletodeterminetheirintentions(i.e.
focusing onsecurity ornot).
Throughsomelatentknowledgeorbehavior,participantspro-
ducedsecurityrelevantsolutions–yetwecannotbesurewhythey
solved the tasksthe way theydid. From asecurity standpointthis
is particularly troubling, as there is no insight into whether this
group of developers are consistently acting in a secure way (but
subconsciously),followingsecuredevelopmenttrends,orsimply
doing whatever feels right at the moment.
4.3.4 Whatelsecharacterizesparticipants’rationales? Thethematic
analysis of the rationale data gave rise to several recurring themes
thatspannedacrossdiﬀerenttasks.Thesearedescribedbelowto
allowforfurtherunderstandingofwhydevelopersmayprioritize
the waythey do.
Caring about users: Many participants, across several tasks,
reﬂect on the impact of their decisions on users of the app. This
manifests in altruistic orempathetic context as, for example, in
reﬂection onthe advertisement andlicensetasks:
“I don’t want to putmyusersat riskwithweird permissions.”(P30)
“Iprioritized based on how ‘extortionist’or‘evil’ theclauses would
feel to meas aconsumer.”(P19)
Additionally, participants manifest the attitude in an egotistic
contextaswell.Forexample,caringaboutusersinordertopreserve
orimprove one’sreputation as adeveloper:
“[...] it is better to have a small group [of testers] ﬁnd bugs than
your users. This way, your reputation would be secured with the
whole world.”(P3)
Avoidingdealingwithothers: Inthetaskswhereparticipants
had to reason about interacting with others, a theme arose indicat-
ingtheirreluctancetoengagewithothersbeforeputtingintheir
owneﬀort.For example:
“This problem should be solved as fast as possible but without being
needysoﬁrstlyIwouldreaddocumentationandtrytoﬁndasolution
on myown.”(P17) (emphasis added)
“First I’ll use resources I can use without the help from other people
(theirtime is importantas well).(P7)
All about the ﬂow: In rationales for setting up an IDE, a key
distinctionwasIDEconﬁgurationssupportingthedeveloperget-
ting into a state of ﬂow during development, rather than selecting
plugins that interveneandsteer their behavior:
“Movingforwardandgettingbetteratprogrammingtakespractice
andIreallyenjoytheprocess.Programmingatmyownspeedwithout
interruptions from pluginsis mymost productiveworkﬂow.”(P30)
156157ICSE ’20, May 23–29, 2020,Seoul,Republicof Korea van derLinden, et al.
impact of writing code and selecting external SDKs (r=.27, p<0.01),
as well as a low negative correlation between writing code and
under what license their software is released (r= −.14, p<0.05). This
may indicate that writing code and selecting external SDKs are
indeed the two key factors which developers perceive to aﬀect the
securityoftheirsoftware.Additionalcorrelationswerefound,in
particular the two strongest correlations between the test and help
question(r=.39,p<0.01),andthehelpanddevelopmentenvironment
question(r=.37,p<0.01).
Thecorrelationbetweentestandhelp–andthatitdidnotscore
asaﬀectingsecurity–corroboratestheﬁndingsfromStudyIwhere
participants also prioritizedsecurity the leastin the same tasks.
The correlation between how participants set up their develop-
mentenvironmentandwhatsourcestheygotoforhelpmayreﬂect
somewaysofworkingwefoundinStudyI.Forexample,partici-
pantswhodeemitimportanttosetuptheirIDEcarefully,e.g.,by
incorporatingstaticanalysisandbugspotters,maydoso because
they trust in authoritative sources and communities which set out
best practices for secure coding and thereby ensure the security of
their apps. This needsto be validatedthrough further research.
7 THREATS TO VALIDITY
ConstructValidity. WebasedtheitemsinStudiesIandIIdirectly
on activities found in recent literature summarizing the wide spec-
trumofactivitiesinsoftwaredevelopment[ 18].Moreover,forStudy
I we took care to ground the deﬁnitions of security solutions in
relevantliteratureshowingtheeﬀectofinsecuredecisionsinlicens-
ing [12,14], incorporation of advertisement SDKs [ 11,44], seeking
outoftesters[ 16,26],anduseofdiﬀerentsourcesforhelp[ 3,29].
We do not claim to exhaust the security challenges faced by devel-
opersthroughthesetasks,butrather,sampleadiversevarietyof
challenges they mustface.
Internal Validity. Wedonotclaimtoinferactualbehaviorfrom
theself-reporteddataelicitedinStudiesIandII.Moreover,inStudy
I we explicitly only investigated estimated correlation between
solutions prioritizing security and anykind of rationale indicating
security.Wedonotclaimthatthislackofsecureactionandrationale
implies a lack of knowledge, which requires further psychological
work.
Moreover, given the nature of the tasks and their stand-alone
design,itnecessarilymeans thatparticipants’decision-makingis
doneinahypotheticalcontext.Thismayaﬀectthewayinwhich
participants prioritize particular answers over others as, for exam-
ple,timepressurefrommanagingconcurrenttasksandactivities
in a real-worldscenario could lead todiﬀerent prioritization. This
was,however,anecessarycompromiseinordertorevealthehet-
erogeneityof reasoning thatdevelopers hold fordiﬀerent kinds of
tasks.
Notably,therefore,thethematicanalysisofparticipants’ratio-
nales did not expose any evidence that: they considered real-world
contextsdiﬀerently;theirdecisionsweredrivenbypriorsecurity
knowledge; or some choices were taken to be much more likely or
‘obvious’thanothers.
External & Ecological Validity. We used purposive sampling
complemented with snowballing for both Studies I and II – speciﬁ-
cally wantingto include onlythosewithexperienceof the varietyofactivitiesencounteredinappdevelopment.Whilethisprovedno
problemforStudyIIduetotheminimumtimeinvestmentrequired
of participants,we couldn’trecruit as manydevelopers willingto
invest the required average half hour into Study I. Nonetheless,
a comparison of the personal and professional demographics de-
tailedinSec.4.1indicatessigniﬁcantoverlapwithdemographics
established in earlier research [ 42]. Given that Study I’s ﬁndings
among a much wider sample of the mobile developer population is
inlinewithourkeyﬁndingsofStudyII:asecurityfocusoncode-
related tasks and under-appreciation of security impact of other
activities, we feel conﬁdent that the samples of both studies show
a valid picture of the typical developers encountered in mobile app
development.
Moreover,thelackofsecurityknowledgeofparticipantsinStudy
Imaylimitthegeneralizationoftheﬁndings,aswecannotconﬁrm
whether security knowledge is normally distributed across partici-
pants, orskewed towardsa particularextreme. However,eliciting
self-reportedexperiencehasitslimitationsasdiscussedbefore,and
wouldnotnecessarilyenrichtheﬁndings.Thus,furtherstudiesmay
attempt to use objective measures of security knowledge (rather
than self-reported experience) in focused task studies to assess
whether the level ofsecurity knowledge has aneﬀecton diﬀerent
tasks. This was not deemed feasible in the present study due to the
need to incorporate a wider variety of tasks, which already led to a
study with signiﬁcant duration, limiting the potential of recruiting
willing participants.
8 DISCUSSION:FILLING THE BOX WITH
SECURITY
As we mentioned in Sec. 2.3, we need to understand developers’
rationalesinordertobeginconceptualizinginterventionstomit-
igate vulnerabilities stemming from these rationales. Without a
holisticfocusonappdevelopment–lookingbeyondsolelytheactof
writingcode–wecannoteﬀectivelysupportdevelopersin producing
secureapps,ratherthan‘just’ writingsecurecode.Wediscusssome
keyinsightsleadingtotakeawaysonhowappdeveloperscanbe
supportedto do so.
8.1 Be social,but alsobecritical
StudiesIandIIbothindicatedthatdeveloperslackacriticalattitude
towardssecurityinactivitiesthatinvolve(theneedfor)socialin-
teractionwithothers.Inparticular,the seekinghelp andseekingout
testerstasksofStudyIwhichrequiredparticipantstoconsiderthird
partiesandwhethertheycanbetrustedshowedthelowestamount
of security rationalization. This may indicate that developers do
not make the leap of thinking of people and sources they use to
aid in their app’s development as potentially misguided, or even
adversarial.
These kinds of social interactions are vitally important for inde-
pendent and small scale developers, as they need to reach out to
externalsupportnetworks,ratherthanrelyonexistingorganiza-
tionalstructure.Inreality,thiswilloftencomedowntoconsidering
whether libraries and friendly advice or useful code fragments
posted on forums such as StackOverﬂow can be inherently trusted
tobeprovidedingoodfaith,letalonecompetence.Toavoidtherisk
ofincorporatingvulnerablecode,promotingamorecriticalattitude

to how social interactions can aﬀect the security apps would be
warranted.
Takeaway— toensureamorecriticalattitudetowardssecurity
among developers, we need to promote critical reﬂection on the
trustingof people andresourcesonwhichthey rely.
8.2 Flowingtowards asecureenvironment
Most of the rationales in task 1 (Study I) – in which participants
hadtoreasonaboutsettinguptheirdevelopmentenvironment–
focusedonsettinguptheenvironmentenablingthemtoworkin
aparticularway.Soitshouldnotbeasurprisethatthesolutions
expressing security considerations would mention so similarly. For
example, P9 made their selection because “it’d help ﬁx issues I
create which is important as a lone dev with nocode review” (P9),
and P24 did so because the “static analyzer helps prevent non-
obvious security issues.” This can be interpreted as the basis for
developersgettingintoastateof‘ﬂow’–theypreparetoworkina
waywheretheycanbeentirelyabsorbedinthatwork[ 32].Thekey
link between the ﬂow rationale and the security mindset seems to
be a realization ofthose participants who workas solodevelopers
thatthey cannotexpect themselves to catcheverything, but that
they are stillresponsible for everything at the end of the day.
Takeaway— soloandsmall-scaleappdevelopersneedsupportto
make the ‘right’ choices in terms of security, but not only for code.
Researchcouldfocusonincorporatingsupportforsuchactivities
within IDEs but in a manner that is unobtrusive to the ﬂuidity that
developers desire.
8.3 Thinking aboutusers, thinking about
security
Someparticipants’rationaleexplicitlyshowedthattheywerean-
ticipatingthewaytheiruserswouldbehave:“Ineverrelyonjust
myself for testing, since I cannot always know how people are go-
ing to use the app beforehand” (P1). Others mentioned considering
whomtoinvolvebasedontheirrelationships,andhowitmightthen
aﬀecttheirusers:“Friendsandfamilyareterribletesters,because
they don’t want to hurt your feelings. You yourself are even worse,
and relying on your users will ﬁnd you all the bugs, but might lose
youyourreputation”(P20).Thishintsthatexplicitconsiderationof
how users are aﬀected by the software they develop leads them to
morecarefullyconsiderthedecisionstheymake.Weﬁndfurther
evidenceofthisespeciallyintask5,inwhichparticipantshadto

grant minimal privacy impact to users”.
Takeaway— toreasonaboutsecurity,andtoactuponit,devel-
opers should be encouraged to take a user-centric view – under-
standingthe consequences vulnerabilitieshave for theirusers.
9 CONCLUSION AND FUTUREWORK
We investigated the rationale of app developers during diﬀerent
activities in the app development process, performing an in-depth
task-based study with 44 app developers assessing the extent towhichtheyprioritizesecurityandhowtheyrationalizetheirchoices.
We followed this up with a larger survey of 274 app developers
assessingtheirperceptiontowardstheimpactofthediﬀerentactiv-
itiesonthe security of their producedapps.

or testers), economic (monetization) and legal(licensing) aspects
of app development, there were no prevalent security rationales
underpinningtheir choices.
