ABSTRACT
To analyse local robustness properties of deep neural networks
(DNNs), we present a practical framework from a model learn-
ing perspective. Based on black-box model learning with scenario
optimisation, we abstract the local behaviour of a DNN via an
affine model with the probably approximately correct (PAC) guar-
antee. From the learned model, we can infer the corresponding
PAC-model robustness property. The innovation of our work is the
integration of model learning into PAC robustness analysis: that is,
weconstructaPACguaranteeonthemodellevelinsteadofsample
distribution,whichinducesamorefaithfulandaccuraterobustness
evaluation.This isin contrastto existingstatistical methodswith-
out model learning. We implement our method in a prototypical
tool named DeepPAC. As a black-box method, DeepPAC is scalable
and efficient, especially when DNNs have complex structures or
high-dimensionalinputs.WeextensivelyevaluateDeepPAC,with4baselines(usingformalverification,statisticalmethods,testingandadversarial attack) and 20 DNN models across 3 datasets, including
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. It is shown that DeepPAC out-
performsthestate-of-the-artstatisticalmethodPROVERO,andit
achieves more practical robustness analysis than the formal ver-ification tool ERAN. Also, its results are consistent with existing
DNN testing work like DeepGini.

1 INTRODUCTION
Deepneuralnetworks(DNNs)arenowwidelydeployedinmany
applications such as image classification, game playing, and the
recent scientific discovery on predictions of protein structure [ 58].
Adversarial robustness of a DNN plays the critical role for its trust-
worthyuse.Thisisespeciallytrueforforsafety-criticalapplications
suchasself-drivingcars[ 69].Studieshaveshownthatevenfora
DNNwithhighaccuracy,itcanbefooledeasilybycarefullycrafted
adversarialinputs [64].This motivatesresearchon verifyingDNN
robustnessproperties, i.e.,the predictionof theDNNremains the
same after bounded perturbation on an input. As the certifiable
criterion before deploying a DNN, the robustness radius should be
estimated or the robustness property should be verified.
In this paper, we propose a practical framework for analysing
robustness of DNNs. The main idea is to learn an affine model
which abstracts local behaviour of a DNN and use the learned
model (instead of the original DNN model) for robustness analysis.
Different from model abstraction methods like [ 4,17], our learned
modelisnotastrictlysoundover-approximation,butitvariesfrom
theDNNuniformlywithinagivenmarginsubjecttosomespecifiedsignificance level and error rate. We call such a model the probably
approximately correct (PAC) model.
There are several different approaches to estimating the max-
imum robustness radius of a given input for the DNN, includingformal verification, statistical analysis, and adversarial attack. Inthe following, we will first briefly explain the pros and cons of
each approach for and its relation with our method. Then, we will
highlight the main contributions in this paper.

Bound via formal verification is often too conservative. A DNN
is a complex nonlinear function and formal verification tools [ 7,
33,38,59,60,68,84] cantypically handleDNNs withhundreds to
thousandsofneurons.ThisisdwarfedbythesizeofmodernDNNs

of formal verification is that its resulting robustness bound is guar-

the lower bound proved by the formal verification approach dis-cussed above, as the reference for evaluating the quality of our
PAC-model robustness results, and comparing them with the latest

2 PRELIMINARY
In this section, we first recall the background knowledge on theDNN and its local robustness properties. Then, we introduce thescenario optimization method that will be used later. In this fol-
lowingcontext,wedenote xiastheithentryofavector x∈Rm.
Forx∈Rmandλ∈R, we define x+λas(x0+λ,...,xm+λ)/latticetop.
Givenx,y∈Rm, we write x≤yifxi≤yifori=1,...,m.W e

as/bardblx/bardbl∞:=max1≤i≤m|xi|. We use the notation B(ˆx,r):={x∈
Rm|/bardblx−ˆx/bardbl∞≤r}torepresenttheclosed L∞-normballwiththe
centerˆx∈Rmand radius r>0.

Example 2.1. We illustrate a fully connected neural network
(FNN), where each node (i.e., neuron) is connected with the nodes
from the previous layer. Each neuron has a value that is calculated
as the weighted sum of the neuron values in the previous layer,
plus a bias. For a hidden neuron, this value is often followed by an
activation function e.g., a ReLU function that rectifies any negative
valueinto0.InFig. 1,theFNNcharacterizesafunction f:R2→R2.

Straightforwardly,thisfunctionmeasuresthedifferencebetween
thescoreofthetargetedlabelandotherlabels.Forsimplicity,we
ignoretheentry f/lscript(x)−f/lscript(x)andregardthescoredifferencefunc-
tionΔas a function from RmtoRn−1. For any inputs ˆxwith the
class label/lscript, it is clear that Δ(ˆx)<0if the classification is correct.
For simplicity, when consideringan L∞-norm ballwith thecenter
ˆx, we denote by Δthe difference score function with respect to the
label ofˆx. Then robustness property of a DNN can therefore be
defined as below.
Definition2.2(DNNrobustness). GivenaDNN f:Rm→Rn,an
inputˆx∈Rm, andr>0, we say that fis (locally) robustinB(ˆx,r)
if for allx∈B(ˆx,r), we have Δ(x)<0.
Intuitively, local robustness ensures the consistency of the be-
haviour of a given input under certain perturbations. An input
x/prime∈B(ˆx,r)that destroys the robustness (i.e. Δ(x/prime)≥0) is called
anadversarialexample.Notethatthispropertyisverystrictsothat
the corresponding verification problem is NP-complete, and the
exact maximum robustness radius cannot be computed efficiently
except for verysmall DNNs. Even estimatinga relatively accurate
lowerboundisdifficultandexistingsoundmethodscannotscale

DNNrobustnessanalysis,thepropertyisrelaxedbyallowingsome
errors in the sense of probability. Below we recall the definition of
PAC robustness [5].

us to innovate the PAC robustness with PAC-model robustness in
this paper (Sect. 3).
2.2 Scenario Optimization
ScenariooptimizationisanothermotivationforDeepPAC.Ithas
been successfullyused in robustcontrol design forsolving a class
of optimization problems in a statistical sense, by only consider-ing a randomly sampled finite subset of infinitely many convex
constraints [9, 10].
Let us consider the following optimization problem:
min
γ∈Γ⊆Rmb/latticetopγ
s.t.fω(γ)≤0,∀ω∈Ω,(3)
wherefωisaconvexandcontinuousfunctionofthe m-dimensional
optimization variable γfor every ω∈Ω, and both ΩandΓare
convex and closed. In this work, we also assume that Ωis bounded.
Inprinciple,itischallengingtosolve (3),asthereareinfinitelymanyconstraints. Calafiore et al. [ 9] proposed the following scenario
approach to solve (3) with a PAC guarantee.
Definition2.4. LetPbeaprobabilitymeasureon Ω.Thescenario
approach to handle the optimization problem (3)is to solve the
followingproblem.Weextract Kindependentandidenticallydis-
tributed(i.i.d.)samples (ωi)K

s.t.K/logicalanddisplay.1
i=1fωi(γ)≤0.(4)
Thescenarioapproachrelaxestheinfinitelymanyconstraints
in(3)by only considering a finite subset containing Kconstraints.
In [9], a PAC guarantee, depending on K, between the scenario
solution in (4)and its original optimization in (3)is proved. This
isfurtherimprovedby[ 10]inreducingthenumberofsamples K.
Specifically, the following theorem establishes a condition on K
for(4)which assures that its solution satisfies the constraints in (3)
statistically.
Theorem 2.5 ([ 10]).If (4) is feasible and has a unique optimal
solutionγ∗
K, and
ϵ≥2
K(ln1
η+m), (5)
whereϵandηare the pre-defined error rate and the significance
level, respectively, then with confidence at least 1−η, the optimal
γ∗
Ksatisfies all the constraints in Ωbut only at most a fraction of
probability measure ϵ, i.e.,P(fω(γ∗
K)>0)≤ϵ.
In this work, we set Pto be the uniform distribution on the Ω
setin(3). Itis worthy mentioningthat Theorem 2.5stillholds even
if the uniqueness of the optimal γ∗
Kis not required, since a unique
optimal solution can always be obtained by using the Tie-break
rule [9] if multiple optimal solutions exist.
Thescenariooptimizationtechniquehasbeenexploitedinthe
context of black-box verification for continuous-time dynamicalsystems in [
81]. We will propose an approach based on scenario
optimization to verify PAC-model robustness in this paper.
3 PAC-MODEL ROBUSTNESS
The formalisation of the novel concept PAC-model robustness is
our first contribution in this work and it is the basis for developing
our method. We start from defining a PAC model. Let Fbe a given
set of high dimensional real functions (like affine functions).
Definition3.1(PACmodel). Letд:Rm→Rn,B⊆RmandPa
probability measure on B. Letη,ϵ∈(0,1]be the given error rate
and significance level, respectively. Let λ≥0 be the margin. A

with confidence 1 −η.
In Def.3.1, we define a PAC model /tildewideдas an approximation of the
original model дwith two parameters ηandϵwhich bound the
maximal significance level and the maximal error rate for the PAC

model, respectively. Meanwhile, there is another parameter λthat
bounds the margin between the PAC model and the original model.
Intuitively, the difference between a PAC model and the original
one is bounded under the given error rate ϵand significance level
η.
ForaDNN f,ifitsPACmodel /tildewidefwiththecorrespondingmarginis
robust,then fisPAC-modelrobust.Formally,wehavethefollowing
definition.

/tildewideΔ(x)+λ<0. (7)
Weremindthat Δisthescoredifferencefunctionmeasuringthe
difference between the score of the targeted label and other labels.
A locally robust DNN requires that Δ(x)<0, and a PAC-model
robust DNN requires the PAC upper bound of Δ, i.e./tildewideΔ(x)+λ,i s
always smaller than 0.
InFig.2,weillustratethepropertyspaceofPAC-modelrobust-
ness, by using the parameters η,ϵandλ. The properties on the
λ-axis are exactly the strict robustness since Δ(x)is now strictly
upper-bounded by /tildewideΔ(x)+λ. Intuitively, for fixed ηandϵ, a smaller
marginλimpliesabetterPACapproximation /tildewideΔ(x)oftheoriginal
oneΔ(x)and indicates that the PAC-model robustness is closer
to the (strict) robustness property of the original model. To esti-
matethemaximumrobustnessradiusmoreaccurately,weintend
to compute a PAC model with the margin λas small as possible.
Moreover, the proposed PAC-model robustness is stronger than
PAC robustness, which is proved by the following proposition.
Proposition3.3. IfaDNNfis(η,ϵ)-PAC-modelrobustin B(ˆx,r),
then it is(η,ϵ)-PAC robust in B(ˆx,r).
Proof. With confidence 1 −ηwe have
P(Δ(x)≤0)≥P( Δ(x)≤/tildewideΔ(x)+λ)
≥P(||/tildewideΔ(x)−Δ(x)||∞≤λ)≥1−ϵ,
which implies that fis(η,ϵ)-PAC robust in B(ˆx,r). /square
In this work, wo focus on the following problem:
Given a DNN f,a nL∞-norm ball B(ˆx,r), a signifi-
cance level η, and an error rate ϵ, we need to deter-
mine whether fis(η,ϵ)-PAC-model robust.
Beforeintroducingourmethod,werevisitPACrobustness(Def. 2.3)
in our PAC-model robustness theory. Statistical methods like [ 5]
infer PAC robustness from samples and their classification output
in the given DNN. In our PAC-model robustness framework, these
methods simplify the model to a function ξ:B(ˆx,r)→{0,1},
where0referstothecorrectclassificationresultand1awrongone,
and infer the PAC-model robustness with the constant function
/tildewideξ(x)≡0o nB(ˆx,r)as the model. In [ 2], the model is modified to a

4 METHODOLOGY
Inthissection,wepresentourmethodforanalysingthePAC-model
robustnessofDNNs. Theoverallframeworkis showninFig. 3.In
general, our method comprises of three stages: sampling, learning,
and analysing.
S1:We sample the input region B(ˆx,r)and obtain the corre-
sponding values of the score difference function Δ.
S2:We learn aPACmodel /tildewideΔ(x)≈η,ϵ,λΔ(x)of the scorediffer-
ence function from the samples.
S3:Weanalysewhether /tildewideΔ(x)+λisalwaysnegativeintheregion
B(ˆx,r)by computing its maximal values.
Fromthedescriptionabove,weseeitisablack-boxmethodsince
we only use the samples in the neighbour and their corresponding
outputs to construct the PAC model. The number of samples is
independentofthestructureandthesizeoforiginalmodels,which
willbringthe goodscalabilityandefficiency. Moreover,wearees-
sentiallyreconstructingapropermodeltodepictthelocalbehavior
oftheoriginalmodel.Comparedwiththestatisticalmethods,the
PACmodelcanpotentiallyextractmoreinformationfromthescore
differences of these samples, which supports us to obtain more
accurate results.
Note that our framework is constructive, and the PAC model
andits maximalpoints intheregion willbe constructedexplicitly
during the analysis. Then, we can obtain the maximal values of the
PACmodel,andinferthattheoriginalDNNsatisfiesthePAC-model
robustness when all maximal values are negative. Thus, DeepPAC
can be considered as a sound approach to verify the PAC-model
robustness.
4.1 Learning a PAC Model
To obtain a PAC model of the original score difference function
Δ(x), we first create a function template, and then determine its
parameters by model learning from the samples. Hereafter, we set
Fto be the set of affine functions, and consider the PAC model
/tildewideΔ(x)tobeanaffinefunctionwithboundedcoefficients.Areason
forchoosinganaffinetemplateisthatthebehavioursofaDNNinasmall
L∞-norm ball B(ˆx,r)are very similar to some affine function
[53], due to the almost everywhere differentiability of DNNs. In

In the above formulation of PAC model learning, the problem boils
down to a linear programming (LP) optimisation. We reuse λto
denote the optimal solution, and /tildewideΔito be the function whose co-
efficients ciare instantiated according to the optimal solution λ.
Specifically, we aim to compute a PAC model /tildewideΔofΔ. By Theo-
rem2.5, the confidence and the error rate can be ensured by a
sufficientlylargenumberofsamples.Namely,tomake (6)holdwith
confidence1 −η,wecanchooseany K≥2

corresponding to the number of the variables in (8).
Forfixed ηandϵ,thenumberofsamples KisinO(mn),sothe
LP problem (8)containsO(mn)variables and O(mn2)constraints.
Therefore, the computational cost of the above LP-based approach
canquicklybecomeprohibitivewithincreasingthedimensionof
input and output.

andmorethan630,000constraints,whichtakesuptoomuchspace
(memory out with 10GB memory).
To further make the PAC model learning scale better with high-
dimensionalinputandoutput,wewillconsiderseveraloptimisa-
tions to reduce the complexity of the LP problem in Section 4.3.
FromtheLPformulationinEq. (8),itcanbeseenthatthePAC
model learning is based on the sampling set ˆXinstead of the norm
ballB(ˆx,r). That is, though in this paper, for simplicity, B(ˆx,r)
is assumed to be an L∞-norm ball, our method also works with
Lp-norm robustness with 1 ≤p<∞.4.2 Analysing the PAC Model
We just detailed how to synthesise a PAC model /tildewideΔof the score
difference function Δ. When the optimisation problem in (8)is
solved, we obtain the PAC model /tildewideΔ(x)≈η,ϵ,λΔ(x)of the score
differencefunction.Namely, /tildewideΔ(x)±λapproximatestheupper/lower
boundofthescoredifferencefunction ΔwiththePACguarantee
respectively. As aforementioned, all maximal values of /tildewideΔ+λbeing
negative implies the PAC-model robustness of the original DNN.
According to the monotonicity of affine functions, it is not hard
to computethe maximumpoint ˘x(i)of/tildewideΔi(x)in theregion B(ˆx,r).
Specifically, for /tildewideΔi(x)in the form of c0+/summationtext.1m
j=1cjxj, we can infer
its maximum point directly as
˘x(i)
j=/braceleftBiggˆxj+r,cj>0,
ˆxj−r,cj≤0.
Notethatthechoiceof ˘x(i)
jisarbitraryforthecase cj=0.Here,we
chooseˆxj−ras an instance. Then let ˘xbe the˘x(i)corresponding
to the maximum /tildewideΔi(˘x(i)), and the PAC-model robustness of the
original DNN immediately follows if /tildewideΔ(˘x)+λ<0. Besides, each
˘x(i)is a potential adversarial example attacking the original DNN
with the classification label i, which can be further validated by
checking the sign of Δi(˘x(i)).
Example 4.2. We consider the neural network in Fig. 1. Given
an input ˆx=(0,0)/latticetop, the classification label is Cf(ˆx)=1. The
networkisrobustif f2(x)<f1(x)forx∈B(ˆx,1),orequivalently,
f2(x)−f1(x)<0.Thus,ourgoalistoapplythescenarioapproachto
learnthescoredifference Δ(x)=f2(x)−f1(x).Inthisexample,we
taketheapproximatingfunctionoftheform /tildewideΔ(x)=c0+c1x1+c2x2
with constant parameters c0,c1,c2∈[ −100,100]to be synthesised.
For ease of exposition, we denote c=(c1,c2,c3)/latticetop.
We attempt to approximate Δ(x)by minimising the absolute
difference between it and the approximating function /tildewideΔ(x). This
process can be characterised as an optimisation problem:
min
c,λλ
s.t.|/tildewideΔ(x)−Δ(x)| ≤λ,∀x∈[ −1,1]2,
c∈[ −100,100]3,

Therefore, the network is PAC-model robustness.
4.3 Strategies for Practical Analysis
We regard efficiency and scalability as the key factor for achieving
practical analysis of DNN robustness. In the following, we propose
three practical PAC-model robustness analysis techniques.
4.3.1 Component-basedlearning. AsstatedinSection 4.1,thecom-
plexityofsolving (8)canstillbehigh,soweproposecomponent-
based learning to reduce the complexity. As before, we use /tildewideΔi
to approximate Δi(x)=fi(x)−f/lscript(x)for eachiwith the same
template.Theideaistolearnthefunctions Δ1,...,Δnseparately,
andthencombinethesolutionstogether.Insteadofsolvingasin-
gle large LP problem, we deal with (n−1)individual smaller LP
problems,eachwith O(m)linearconstraints.Asaresult,wehave
/tildewideΔi(x)≈η,ϵ,λiΔi(x), from which we can only deduce that
P/parenleftBig/logicalanddisplay.1
i/nequal/lscript|/tildewideΔi(x)−Δi(x)| ≤λi/parenrightBig
≥1−(n−1)ϵ
withtheconfidencedecreasingtoatmost1 −(n−1)η.Toguarantee
theerrorrateatleast ϵandtheconfidenceatleast1 −η,weneedto
recomputetheerror λbetween /tildewideΔ(x)andΔ(x).Specifically,wesolve
the following optimisation problem constructed by resampling:
min
λλ
s.t.|/tildewideΔi(x)−Δi(x)| ≤λ,
∀x∈ˆX,i/nequal/lscript.(10)
whereˆXis a set of Ki.i.d samples with K≥2
ϵ(ln1
η+1). Applying
Theorem 2.5again, we have /tildewideΔ(x)≈η,ϵ,λΔ(x)as desired.
We have already relaxed the optimisation problem (8)into a
familyof (n−1)small-scaleLPproblems.If nistoolarge(e.g.for
Imagenetwith1000classes),wecanalsoconsidertheuntargeted
scoredifferencefunction Δu(x)=f/lscript(x)−maxi/nequallfi(x).Byadopt-
ing the untargeted score difference function, the number of the
LP problems is reduced to one. The untargeted score difference
function improves the efficiency at expense of the loss of linearity,
which harms the accuracy of the affine model.
4.3.2 Focused learning. In this part, our goal is to reduce the com-
plexity further by dividing the learning procedure into two phases
with different fineness: i) in the first phase, we use a small set of
samplestoextractcoefficientswithbigabsolutevalues;andii)thesecoefficientsare“focused”inthesecondphase,inwhichweusemoresplit

samples to refine them. In this way, we reduce the number of vari-
ablesoverall,andwecallit focusedlearning,whichnamelyrefers
to focusing the model learning procedure on important features. It
is embedded in the component learning procedure.
The main idea of focused learning is depicted below:
(1)Firstlearningphase: Weextract K(1)i.i.d.samplesfromthe
input region B(ˆx,r). We first learn Δion theK(1)samples.
Thus,ourLPproblemshave O(K(1))constraintswith O(m)
variables. For large datasets like ImageNet, the resulting LP
problemisstilltoolarge.Weuseefficientlearningalgorithms
such as linear regression (ordinary least squares) to boost
the first learning phase on these large datasets.
(2)Key featureextraction: After solvingthe LP problem(or the
linear regression for large datasets), we synthesise /tildewideΔ(1)
ias
the approximating function. Let KeyFi(κ)⊆{1,x1,...,xm}
denotethesetofextractedkeyfeaturesforthe ithcomponent
corresponding to the κcoefficients with the largest absolute
values in /tildewideΔ(1)
i.
(3)Focused learning phase: We extract K(2)i.i.d. samples from
B(ˆx,r). For these samples, we generate constraints only for
our key features in KeyFi(κ)by fixing the other coefficients
using those in /tildewideΔ(1)
i, and thus the number of the undeter-
minedcoefficientsisboundedby κ.BysolvinganLPprob-

5 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate our PAC-model robustness verifica-tion method. We implement our algorithm as a prototype calledDeepPAC. Its implementation is based on Python 3.7.8. We use
CVXPY [14] as the modeling language for linear programming and
GUROBI [ 25] as the LP solver. Experiments are conducted on a
Windows 10 PC with Intel i7 8700, GTX 1660Ti, and 16G RAM.
Three datasets MNIST [ 36], CIFAR-10 [ 35], and ImageNet [ 57] and
20 DNN models trained from them are used in the evaluation. The
details are in Tab. 1. We invoke our component-based learning and
focusedlearning forall evaluations,and applystepwise splitting
for the experiment on ImageNet. All the implementation and data
used in this section are publicly available1.
In the following, we are going to answer the research questions
below.
RQ1:Can DeepPAC evaluate local robustness of a DNN more
effectively compared with the state-of-the-art?
RQ2:Can DeepPAC retain a reasonable accuracy with higher sig-
nificance, higher error rate, and/or fewer samples?

5.1 Comparison on Precision
We first apply DeepPAC for evaluating DNN local robustness by
computingthemaximumrobustnessradiusandcompareDeepPAC
with the state-of-the-art statistical verification tool PROVERO [ 5],

ϵ=0.01 and the significance level
η=0.001. We set K(1)=2000 and K(2)=8000 for DeepPAC.
In addition, we apply ERAN [ 60] and PGD [ 43] to bound the
exact maximum radius from below and from above, respectively.
ERANisastate-of-the-artDNNformalverificationtoolbasedon
abstract interpretation, and PGD is a popular adversarial attackalgorithm. In the experiments, we use the PGD implementationfrom the commonly used Foolbox [
52] with 40 iterations and a
relative step size of 0 .033, which are suggested by Foolbox as a
defaultsetting.NotethatexactrobustnessverificationSMTtools
like Marabou [ 33] cannot scale to the benchmarks used in our

bustnessradiusestimatedbythePROVEROisfarlargerthanthose
computed by other tools. In most cases, PROVERO ends up with a
maximum robustness radius over 100 (out of 255), which is even
larger than the upper bound identified by PGD. This indicates that,
while a DNN is proved to be PAC robust by PROVERO, adversarial
inputs can be still rather easily found within the verified bound. In
contrast,DeepPACestimatesthemaximumrobustnessradiusmore
accurately, which falls in between the results from ERAN and PGD
mostly. Since the range between the estimation of ERAN and PGD
containstheexactmaximumrobustnessradius,weconcludethat
DeepPAC isa moreaccurate toolthan PROVEROtoanalyse local
robustness of DNNs.
DeepPAC also successfully distinguishes robust DNN models
from non-robust ones. It tells that the CNNs, especially the ones
with defence mechanisms, are more robust against adversarial per-
turbations.Forinstance,24outof25imageshavealargermaximum

comparisons reveal the limitations of using PAC robustness (by
PROVERO) that the verified results are not tight enough.
ERAN is a sound verification method, and the robustness rate
verifiedbyitisastrictlowerboundoftheexactresult.However,
this lower bound could be too conservative and ERAN quickly
becomes not usable. In the experiments, we find that it is hard for
ERAN to verify a robustness radius greater than or equal to 4 (out
of 255).
DeepPAC verifies greater robustness rate and larger robustness

that the affine model used in DeepPAC abstraction converges well,
and the resulting error bound is even smaller than the specified

DeepPAC is also tolerant enough with a small sampling size.
When the number of samples in the first learning phase decreases
fromK(1)=20,000 toK(1)=5,000, we can observe a minor de-
crease of the maximal robustness radius estimation. Recall that we

tant features. When the sampling number decreases, the learned
modelwouldbelesspreciseandthusmakevaguepredictionson
key features and make the resulting affine model shift from the

smaller when we reduce the number of sampling in the first phase.

5.4 Relation with Testing Prioritising Metric
We also believe that there is a positive impact from practical DNN
verification work like DeepPAC on DNN testing. For example, the
toolDeepGiniusesGiniindex,whichmeasurestheconfidenceof
aDNNpredictiononthecorrespondinginput,tosortthetesting
inputs. In Tab. 4, we report the Pearson correlation coefficient
between the DeepGini indices and the maximal robustness radii
obtained by DeepPAC, ERAN and PROVERO from the experiment
in Sect.5.1.
As in Tab. 4,themaximumrobustnessradiusiscorrelatedtothe
DeepGiniindex,alargerabsolutevalueofthecoefficientimplies
astrongercorrelation. Itrevealsthedatathathas lowprediction
confidence is also prone to be lack robustness. From this phenome-
non, webelieve DeepGinican bealso helpful indata selectionfor
robustness analysis. Interestingly, the maximum robustness radius
computed by our DeepPAC has higher correlations with DeepGini
indexontheCNNs,whicharemorecomplex,thanonFNNs.Fur-
thermore,DeepPACshowsthestrongestcorrelationontheCNNs
trainedwithdefensemechanisms,whilethecorrelationbetween
PROVERO or ERAN and DeepGini is relatively weak on these net-
works. Intuitively, complex models with defense are expected to
be more robust. Again, we regard this comparison result as theevidence from DNN testing to support the superior of DeepPACover other DNN verification tools. From the perspective of test-ing technique, it is promising to combine these two methods for
achieving test selection with guarantee.
Answer RQ4: Themaximumrobustnessradiusestimatedby
DeepPAC,ERAN,andPROVEROareallcorrelatedtotheDeep-

official example in its illustration.
By setting η=0.001 andϵ=0.01, we verify the PAC-model
robustnessforitstoplabel“dandelion”withintheradiusof5 /255.
A total of 49,600 samples are utilised in the whole procedure. By
DeepPAC, we obtain the PAC-model of the difference function, but
unfortunately, its maximal value in the input L∞ball is larger than
zero.Asanintermediateoutput,wegenerateapotentialadversarial

Aninterestingobservationisthatthelabelsoutputbytheimage
recognition API may be not independent. For instance, the class
labels “dandelion” and “plant” may appear in the output list at the
sametime,andbothofthemcanbeconsideredcorrectlabels.There-
fore, we believe that in the future new forms of DNN robustness
propertiesalsoneedtobestudiede.g.,thesumoftheoutputscores

some threshold. DeepPAC is a promising tool to cope with these
emergingchallengeswhenconsideringreal-worldapplicationsof
DNN robustness analysis, by conveniently adjusting its difference
function.
6 RELATED WORK
Herewediscussmoreresultsontheverification,adversarialattacks
and testing for DNNs. A number of formal verification techniques
have been proposed for DNNs, including constraint-solving [ 8,16,
19,22,24,32,39,47],abstractinterpretation[ 21,37,59,60,84],layer-
by-layerexhaustivesearch[ 29],globaloptimisation[ 15,55,56],con-
vexrelaxation[ 31,49,50],functionalapproximation[ 76],reduction
totwo-playergames[ 77,79],andstar-set-basedabstraction[ 66,67].
Sampling-based methods are adopted to probabilistic robustness

plex.TheprimarydifferencebetweenthesemethodsandDeepPAC
is that our method is model-based and thus more accurate. We use
samplestolearnarelativelysimplemodeloftheDNNwiththePAC
guarantee via scenario optimisation and gain more insights to the
analysis of adversarial robustness. The generation of adversarial
inputs [64] itself has been widely studied by a rich literature of ad-
versarialattackmethods.Somemostwell-knownrobustnessattack

ucts andservices. In recentyears, significant work hasbeen done
forthetestingforDNNssuchastestcoveragecriteriaspecialisedfor
DNNS [34,40,51,62,83] and different testing techniques adopted
for DNNs [ 30,41,42,54,63,65,70,80,82,86]. In particular, our
experiments show that the results from DeepPAC are consistent
with the DNN testing work for prioritising test inputs [ 20,73], but
with a stronger guarantee. This highlights again that DeepPAC is a
practical verification method for DNN robustness.
7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
WeproposeDeepPAC,amethodbasedonmodellearningtoanal-
yse the PAC-model robustness of DNNs in a local region. With
the scenario optimisation technique, we learn a PAC model which
approximates the DNN within a uniformly bounded margin with a
PACguarantee.WiththelearnedPACmodel,wecanverifyPAC-
modelrobustnesspropertiesunderspecifiedconfidenceanderror
rate. Experimental results confirm that DeepPAC scales well on
large networks, and is suitable for practical DNN verification tasks.
As for future work, we plan to learn more complex PAC models
rather than the simple affine models, and we are particularly inter-
estedinexploringthecombinationofpracticalDNNverification
by DeepPACandDNN testing methodsfollowing thepreliminaryresults.
