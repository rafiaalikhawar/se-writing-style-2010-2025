1 INTRODUCTION
Recentadvancesinchatbotshaveincreasedinterestinthesoftware
engineeringcommunity,asevidencedbythegrowingnumberof
conferences and workshops that focus on bots for developers. Bots
are helping developers to generate and maintain architectures [ 66],
mine repositories [ 5] and Stack Overflow posts [ 4,123], perform
loadtest[ 81],andpatch/debugcode[ 109,120,121].Botsfrequently
(26%)automatetasks inopensourcesoftware(OSS) such as main-
tainingcode,reporting continuousintegration failures, reviewing
code and pull requests, ensuring license agreement signatures, and
assigning reviewers [ 116]. These bots help developers by saving
timeandeffortontedioustasks[ 116].Althoughbotsincreasede-
velopers’ productivity, the primary limitation is their lack of in-
teraction with human developers [ 35], unlike existing voice-based
chatbots (alsoknownas conversational agents) inotherdomains.
Conversationalagentsarewellestablishedindomainssuchas
health, politics, and daily life. They have increased accessibility for
physicallydisabledpeople[ 67,108],formedemotionalconnections

fected US presidential elections [ 100]), met customer needs for
two-thirdsofbusinessesontheweb[ 1],andtransformeddailycon-
versations (e.g., Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant). Inspired from
the conversational agent literature, Robe and Kuttal [ 91] reported
designguidelinestoimprovedeveloper-agentinteractionsforacon-
versational agent to facilitate pair programming ś an agile method

developers when analyzing their productivity, code quality, and
self-efficacy [ 62]; however, the development of such a pair pro-
grammingconversationalagentorvoice-basedbotsforsoftware
developers poses the following challenges:
•LackofBenchmarkDatasets: Currently,nobenchmark
dataset for developer-agent conversations exists for pair-
programming. The only methodology feasible for collect-
ing Human-AI conversational data is by conducting Wizard
ofOzstudies[ 124],whereresearcherssimulateanagent’s

•No SoftwareEngineering Labels: Currently, no software
engineering labels exist to annotate the data needed to train
conversational agents for pair-programming. Past research
on conversational agents usedDialogue Acts for represent-
ing generic human-human conversations. Dialogue Acts are
insufficient toexpresstheuniqueintent of developer’s con-
versations,astheserevolvearoundimplementationandtest-
ingofsoftware.
•Understanding Developer Conversations: Algorithms
fornaturallanguageunderstanding(NLU)needtobetrained
ondeveloper-agentconversationsforbetterclassifyingde-
veloper dialog. Transformer-based language models have
become standard for naturallanguage understanding tasks
[30,40,84,125].These language models are capableof con-
textually representing words by utilizing neural networks
with a large range of parameters, from 110 million [ 30] to
175billion[ 40],andaretrainedonvastamountsoftextdata
(e.g., Wikipedia, BookCorpus, Reddit). However, this text
data excludes programming concepts such as data types,
loops,andmethods.
This paper takes the first step to address these challenges and
lays the groundwork towards understanding developer-agent con-
versations. Hence,we formulatedRQ1:
•RQ1:TowhatextentcanNLU-basedalgorithmsunder-
stand developer-agentconversations? Towards creating
a dataset of developer-agent conversations, we conduct a
Wizard of Oz study with a simulated agent using the de-
sign guidelines from Robe and Kuttal [ 91]. Our study task
and design is inspired by Robe et al. [ 90] to augment the
collected data. We collected 4,443 utterances from 14 par-
ticipantsconversingwithasimulatedagent.Basedonthis
dataset, we created software engineering labels using an
open coding process to develop a hierarchical classification
scheme that allows identification of intent and applicable
sub-intents.A hierarchical approachwas usedoverlinearto
reducethenumberofoverallintents,thisreducedourlabels
to 26. We used three transformer-based language models
for NLU, BERT [ 30], GPT2 [ 84], and XLNet [ 125], for clas-
sifying developer-agent dialog. We found that these mod-
els largelyperformed interchangeably; however, BERT per-
formedmarginallybetter(Precisionof+0.6%andRecallof
+0.1%).ThissuggestsTransformer-basedLanguagemodelscan be utilized for modeling the intent and understanding
ofdeveloper-agentconversations.
Inordertobegincreatingadeveloper-agentdataset,researchers
and practitioners need to conduct resource intensive Wizard of
Oz (WoZ) studies. At present, there are vast amounts of developer-
developerconversationsonvideohostingwebsites,suchasTwitch.tv
andYoutube,thatcouldbetranscribedandlabeled;however,itis

•RQ2: To what extent can developer-developerconver-
sations be utilized for training a pair-programming
conversationalagent? Tounderstandwhetherdeveloper-
developer conversations can be utilized to train pair pro-
gramming agents, we used the existing developer-developer
datafromRobeetal.[ 90]andlabeleditwithourhierarchical

2.1 BotsforDevelopers
Researchers and practitioners have created tools to aid various
softwaredevelopmenttasks.Forexample,IDEtoolsdetectsyntax
errors in real-time, automate repetitive tasks, and debug code. OSS
projectsonGitHubmakeampleuseofbots[ 116]andchatbotshave
assisted newcomers and assigned them a task [ 32,98]. Lin et al.

rectness and Mussbacher et al. [ 76] created an intelligent modeling
assistantforcodefeedback.Urlietal.[ 109]developedabottoauto-
maticallysuggestpatchesbasedonfailedtestcases,andOkanovićet
al.’s [81] bot helped developers perform load testing. Chatbots also
helpeddeveloperseffectivelyfindStackOverflowposts[ 4,123]and
mine repositories [ 5]. Outside of traditional software development
activity Matthies et al. [ 70] explored developing a chatbot for agile
retrospectivestohelpteamstrackissuesacrossdevelopmentcycles.
Additionally, platforms for training agents have been created such
as Google’s RecSim and Meta’s web-enabled simulation. Finally,
Bradley et al. [ 19] envisioned a voice-based context-aware agent
that works via the Amazon Alexa Platform. While past research
focusesonspecificpointsinthesoftwarelifecycle,noneofthemen-
vision an immersive, interactive pair-programming conversational
agent.
Woodsetal.[ 121]collectedconversationaldataonbugrepair,
generated labels using open coding, and then used a logistic re-
gression model to classify the data. Our study design for RQ1 was
inspired from their WoZ study, while they envisioned a Q/A agent,
we envision an interactive pair-programming agent. Later, Woods
etal.[120]analyzeddifferentapproachesfortransferlearningstart-
ing with the AMI business meeting corpus and fine-tuning with
their previously collected bug-repair data [ 121]. Our paper investi-
gatedthefeasibilityoftransferlearningforlanguagemodelstrained
on developer-developer dataand fine-tuned with developer-agent
data.
2.2 Pair-programmingConversational Agent
Robe and Kuttal [ 91] recently reported design guidelines for a
pair-programming conversational agent. Later, Kuttal et al. [ 62]
investigated the feasibility of their designed pair-programming
conversationalagentbyconductinglabandWizardofOzstudies.
They found no significant differences in code quality, productivity,
orself-efficacybetweendeveloper-developeranddeveloper-agent
participants. They found developers were trusting, humble, and
agents facilitate knowledge transfer. These results motivate the
developmentofapair-programmingconversational agent.
Further, Robe et al. [ 90] investigated the feasibility of a third-
party facilitation agent in developer-developer conversations by
conducting a lab study to simulate remote pair programming. The
data collected from this study was then annotated using generic
DialogueActsthatrepresentthefunctionofanutteranceinhuman-
human conversations [ 12,97,105]. Robe et al. found annotating
programming dialog using only Dialogue Acts to be insufficientat capturing the sporadic nature of remotepair programming con-
versations. Further, they analysed results using support vector ma-
chines (SVMs) to classify the utterances, achieving a 57.9% accu-
racy. In contrast, we collected data for developer-agent conver-
sation using WoZ studies, generated new labels specifically for
developer-agent conversations, investigated transfer learning of
developer-developeranddeveloper-agentdata,andusedstate-of-
the-art pre-trained language models for analyzing the data. We
envision a conversational pair programming agent rather than a
thirdpartyfacilitation agent.
2.3 Labeling ofData
Researchers have created labels and annotated data for software
design and development tasks. Viviani et al. [ 111,112] studied the

ties (code reviews, design processes) or speech types (questions),
whereaswecreated26hierarchicallabels,tailoredspecificallyto

3 RQ1: DEVELOPER-AGENTDATA
3.1 Data Collection
To address the challenge of lack of developer-agent datasets, we
conductedvirtuallabstudies,simulatinganagentusingtheWizard
ofOz (WoZ) methodto collectdeveloper-agentconversations.
3.1.1 Wizard of Oz Method. WoZ is a simulation study where par-
ticipantsinteractwithanautomatedagent,secretlycontrolledby
another human, the “wizardž. This simulated experience allows
researchers to analyze human-AI interactions prior to the imple-
mentation of an agent [ 64,118,124]. WoZ has been extensively
usedfor(1)machinelearning(ML)feasibilitystudies[ 49,62],(2)
designresearch[ 20,80],(3)naturallanguageinterfacessuchascon-
versationalagents[ 18,89,115,121,124],and(4)question/answer
conversations about bug repair with an agent [ 121]. Transcripts
gathered from WoZ studies lay the foundation for the use of ML
algorithms, as it considers the unique qualities of human-agent
dialogas opposedto typical human discourse [ 26].

disciplinaryresearchonsoftwareengineering,conversationalagents,
human-computer interactions, human-robotic interactions, educa-
tion, intelligent tutoring systems, psychology, and management
science. Further, technical and social skills are crucial for being
an effective team member in the software engineering industry
[7,25,79,94];therefore,both are simulated.
Social Skills of a Developer To give the agent a human-like
embodiment, it was given a 3D avatar [ 61,126] and text-to-speech
synthesistocommunicate.Whenactingasadriver,codewaspasted
withinasharedwindow inchunkstoappearmorerobotic. When
acting as a navigator the agent gave guidance by suggesting or
clarifying goals, offering abstract code ideas, and asking questions
to promote divergent thinking. As the agent would not have an all
encompassing knowledge, it would deflect with its’ own questions
(e.g.,łWhatdoyouthink?ž )orsuggestedthatthedeveloperwrite
the implementation (e.g., łWhat would that idea look like? Can
you write it?ž ) when participants asked questions outside of its’
capabilities. The agent negotiated the driver and navigator roles
withtheparticipanttobalancecontributions.Theagentadopted
the personality of an anthropomorphic and effective developer
by introducing itself [ 54], acting as a team-player [ 53], showing
uncertainty and asking for verification [ 11,55,61], and motivating
its’partner[ 9,23,29,42].Thesefeaturesprovideclearbenefitstoa
developers’ performance,productivity,andcreativity[ 61].
Technical Skills of a Developer To simulate technical skills,
both as a driver and a navigator, the agent design was informed
byvastresearchonsoftwareengineeringliterature.Whenacting
as a driver, automatic code contribution was facilitated by code
search [56,57,85] and feedback generation [ 28,127] techniques.
Test case generation was based on past research, including the
conversionofdiagrams,suchasUMLandFSMs,totestcases[ 72,
73],andconversionofuserstoriestoscenarios,thentotestcases
[8,86].Codelocationwasbasedonpreviouslyinvestigatedstatic
and dynamic techniques [ 68,95], unnecessary code was found
through automated tools such as UCDetector [ 103], and missingcode was found through research in the Haskell programming
language[ 44].
3.1.3 WizardofOzStudy. We designedour studyto mimicRobe

4.3.1).SimilartoRobe’sstudy,ourstudyparticipantsweretasked
to complete a tic-tac-toe game implementation within a 40 minute
timeframe(toavoidfatigue)usingtest-drivendevelopment.Our
participants completed a demographics background questionnaire
prior to starting the study.
Participants learned the concepts of pair programming, think-
aloudmethod,andtest-drivendevelopmentthroughvideotutori-
als. Participants were also provided with a tutorial outlining the
functionality of the agent. The think-aloud method encourages
participantstovocalizetheirthoughtsandfeelingsastheyperform

and, in our study, to collect conversations with an agent. To collect

Theagent’s3DavatarwasgeneratedbytheFacerigembodiment

and GoogleText-to-Speechsynthesizedthewizard’s voice. Video
and audio communication, with the agent, was conducted over
Skype,Discord,orGoogleHangouts.Twowizardsmonitoredthe
participant’s face, voice, and screen, while collaboratively control-
ling the agent’s actions. One wizard was a graduate student with 5
years of programming experience and the other was an undergrad-
uate student with 3 years of experience. Both wizards were trained
by conducting preliminary studies. They maintained the illusion
of an agent by adhering to a script of templated dialog options
[3].Basedon theutterancefromtheparticipant,thewizard chose

UsingaconstrainedWoZprotocol[ 88],thewizardssimulated
all components of a conversational agent [ 43] including intent un-
derstanding, dialogue state tracking, dialogue policy, and response
generation. Wizard 1 interacted with the participant using our

In the future, Copilot [ ?] can be utilized for the automated code

3.2 Labeling
Toaddressthelackofsoftwareengineeringlabels,wecreatedan
initialsetofdialogintentlabels.
To mimic the agents actions, the wizards based their actions on
the developer’s intent. If a participant asked, łCan I drive now?ž
the wizard determined that the developer intended to switch roles
and drive. However, agents cannot intuitively understand intent,
andmustclassifydialogintodiscretecategories.Wedevelopeda
hierarchicalclassificationschemeonthedeveloper-agentdatato
reflectthedialog-intentofdeveloper-agentconversations.Thiswas
done because (1) developers’ conversations are uniquely specific to
the implementation and testing of code. The existing conversation
benchmarkscontaindialogspecifictodomainssuchascustomer
support, restaurant ordering; which can not be adapted for soft-
wareengineeringdomain;(2)Theagentinteractedwithdevelopers
usingaspecific, hand-craftedprotocol,so the emergingrange of
interactions with developers became quite narrow. By capturing
this specific style of engagement, the labels will effectively satisfy
theinformationneedsofafuturepair-programmingconversational
agent;(3)Lastly,ahierarchicalscheme reducesthenumberofpo-
tentialclassifications.
3.2.1 Hierarchical Classification Scheme . For generating labels,
weadoptedanopencodingprocessfromsocialsciences[ 17]and
pastresearch[ 121].Asafoundationweadoptedgenerallabelssuch
as Feedback, Thanking, and Answers from Dialogue Acts (blue
rowsin Table 1). DialogueActsrepresent the function of an utter-
ance within the domain of computational modeling [ 12,97,105].
Dialogue Acts have been used to (1) categorize intent in the devel-
opmentofconversationalagentsinotherdomains[ 48,99,105,110],
and (2) study conversational speech in co-located [ 87] and remote
pair programming studies [ 90]. While Dialogue Acts generally cap-
turesyntacticandstylisticinformationcommonacrossallformsof
communication, the kind of information exchanged via pair pro-
gramming dialog necessitates a further specialized set of labels.
For example, if a developer asked, łWait, are we working on the
horizontal win test?ž traditional Dialogue Acts would be able to
identifythatitisayes-no-question,butmightnotknowthatthe
developer is requesting a clarification of the current programming
task goal. Hence, through an open coding process, we generated
more specific pair programminglabels, useful to our domain.

(e.g., restaurant reservation). We chose BERT, as it is a state-of-
the-art language model, GPT-2 as it is another well-established
language model that uses its own transformer architecture, and
XLNet asit has out-performed BERT in other benchmark datasets
[27].

GPT-2:GenerativePre-trainedTransformer2(GPT-2)wasre-

fromBERTsinceitusesastackoftransformerdecoder(ratherthanencoder) blocks, and it is uni-directional meaning it only uses left-
to-rightcontext.Additionally,itistrainedonanincrediblylarge

XLNet incorporates ideas from the state-of-the-art auto-regressive
model, Transformer-XL [ 27], including relative position encoding
andasegment recurrence mechanism.
3.3.2 Implementation. Inthis paper,we usedthe transformers py-
thon package from Huggingface [ 119] and specifically selected the
following pre-trained models: bert-base-uncased ,xlnet-base
-cased, andgpt-2. For our classification task, we connected the
pooledoutputofeachmodelwithadropoutandalinearregression

3.3.3 Metrics. We report the result of each classifier as an average
over 5 separate runs using new train/validate/test splits. The splits
followed the same trainingmethodology as performedby Nguyen

4 RQ2: DEVELOPER-DEVELOPERDATA
To utilize the vast arrays of existing developer-developer conversa-
tion data available though video hosting websites such as Youtube
andTwitch, we were motivatedto frameRQ2.
4.1 Data Collection
We used the developer-developer conversational data from Robe
et al. [90] as they used a machine learning algorithm (SVM) to
understand developer conversations inpair programmingcontext.
4.2 Labeling
We labeled the data obtained from Robe et al. [ 90] studies using
our hierarchical classification scheme (Figure 2). For the developer-
developer data we found Cohen’s Kappa of 0.743 for the two re-
searchers each labelling 20% of the transcripts. The remaining data
waslabeledbyoneresearcher.Thetranscribingandlabelingtook
~126 hoursofwork.
4.3 Classification andModeling
As discussed in section 3.3.4, we used BERT to compare developer-
developer anddeveloper-agentconversations to answer RQ2:
4.3.1 FeasibilityofUsingDeveloper-DeveloperData. Tomeasure
the utility of developer-developer data, we compared two BERT
language models trained exclusively on either developer-developer
ordeveloper-agentdatatopredictlabelsfordeveloper-agentdialog.
ThefirstBERTmodel(DA)wasentirelytrained/validated/testedonTable3:Resultsofclassifyingdeveloper-agentdialogusing

Overall results can be found in Table 3. Precision and recall scores
for eachcategory can be foundinTable 4.
Thedeveloper-agentdataisrepresentativeofanidealizeddataset
andthedeveloper-developerdataissymbolicofthereadilyavail-
able data. For our baseline DA model, Roleperformed the best
(95.2%, 94.6%) followed closely behind by Intent(80.1%, 80.0%),
Delivery (80.1%,76.6%),and Tone(80.2%,79.9%). Itisnotablethat
Programming Acts (74.4%,73.7%)performedtheworst;however,it
isthe secondlargestclassifier bynumber of sub-intents.
Based on the overall metrics, training with developer-developer
data(DD)had10.2%lowerrecall,8.7%lowerprecision,and10.2%
lower F1-measure. Results forDD (Table 4),IntentandTonehad
the highest precision and recall (72.4%, 69.9% and 75.9%, 75.0%),
while for Programming Acts they were moderately high (67.2%,
65.2%)consideringitdistinguishedbetween seven separatelabels;
however,theprecisionandrecallof Delivery andRolewere66.2%,
64.0%and63.7%,63.7%,evenwhenonlyclassifyingbetweenfour
and three labels respectively. These results show that at least for
some categories, training exclusively with developer-developer
conversations isfeasible.
4.3.2 FeasibilityofApplyingTransferLearning. In4.3.1,wewere
able to demonstrate that developer-developer data can be used
withreducedaccuracy.Theefficacyofusingtransferlearningbe-
tween human-human and human-agent conversations for clas-
sifying dialog has been widely demonstrated in AI community

Implicit vs. Explicit Communication. Our analysis of the
supportmetricsidentifiedacommontrend:developer-developer
studies relied on more implicit means of communication while
developer-agent studies utilized more explicit questions and re-
quests. Developer-developer studies focused on the exchange of
ideas,Idea(38.87% vs. 16.39%) through the use of Directions
(53.29%vs.25.52%).However,whenworkingwithanagent,develop-
ersoftenasked Questions (13.06%vs.33.67%)and Clarifications
(3.45% vs. 13.57%) related to the Task Goal (14.55% vs. 27.21%),
Attend Location (2.61% vs. 10.27%), and Run Code /Test (4.02%
vs.10.05%).Whiledeveloperscouldeasilyprogressthroughtasks
withanotherdeveloper,developer-agentstudiesrequiredexplicit
communication which led to a higher number of Task Control
(1.05% vs. 5.25%) requests and accompanying Answers (3.67% vs.

Further,bothstudies switchedpair programmingrolesat sim-

the agent had to explicitly ask, as seen with Participant 3, łCan

Pointedvs. NeutralFeedback. Participantsof thedeveloper-

orNegative (9.42% vs. 13.25%) Tone, while developer-developer

with a fellow developer, participants would often “nod alongž asthe navigator, using dialog such as łOkay,ž łUh huh,ž andłYeah.ž
Thisleadto higher Feedback occurrencesindeveloper-developer

lessworriedaboutthesocialcostofgivingtheiropinionwithan
agent,as foundinprior research [ 62].
Askingforvs.GivingOpinionsRegardingCodeVerifica-
tion.After writing code, participants (in driver role) were more
likelytoasktheagentforverificationoftheirworkusing Clari-
ification (3.45%vs.13.57%) togetherwith Code.For instance, af-
ter writing a section of code, Participant 12 asked, łAre you okay
with that?ž Similarly, Participant 13 asked, łIs this good?ž Likely,
participantsassumedthattheagentknewthecorrectanswerand
wanteditsfeedback,asParticipant9said, łItrustedthecodethat(the
agent)gavemebecauseIknewitalreadyknewtheanswer.ž While
verification did occur often within developer-developer studies,
participants voiced their opinions on their own (in Navigator role),
rather than waiting for the driver to ask. For example in developer-
developer study 4, Participant 2 said łLike when it equals to zero,
the three minus zerož , and her partner Participant 1 responded with
łOh ya ya. Definitely. Yes.ž These results align with [ 63] where they
foundthatdevelopersgivemoreinstructionsandfeedbacktoother
developers as well as ask more questions to agents rather than
humans.
WeconjecturetheloweraccuracyoftheBERTmodelfordeveloper-
developer conversations was because the dialogs were more im-
plicit,neutral, andopinionatedthandeveloper-agentdialog.

Threats to internal validity may arise based on the design of our
agent.Thisisduetothe factthatthe scope oftheagentmaynot
be representative of all pair programming agents. Further, alterna-
tive agent models may spur different kinds of dialog. However, the

6 OPPORTUNITIES FORSE COMMUNITY
The implementation of a pair-programming conversational agents
for developers encompasses challenges that present opportunities
for further research.
6.1 CreatingPair ProgrammingBenchmark
AkeytosuccessinemergingAIresearch,suchasconversational

[21], PERSONA-CHAT [ 39], AVSD [ 38], Alexa Prize Data [ 36], and
SWITCHBOARD[ 46].Eachbenchmarktargetsdataforspecificap-
plicationsand domains[ 43];for example, MultiWOZis comprised
of10-thousand touristreservationdialogs.Creatingabenchmark
dataset is challenging, in AI, researchers have collected benchmark
datasets using various mechanismssuch as participant compensa-
tion platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (MultiWoz), live user
interactionsfromAlexaPrizecompetitions[ 36],websitessuchas
Reddit and Twitter (DSTC [ ?]), and Bing users’ search queries (MS
MARCO [ 75]). Currently, our dataset consists of dialogs related
to the implementation of a tic-tac-toe game, but more data must
be collected for different tasks to increase the robustness of future
conversational agentsfor programming.Ourdataset laysground-
worktowardthecreationofaholisticbenchmarkdatasetforpair
programming.Thoughprogresshasbeenmade,weasasoftware
engineering community need to collect robust conversational data
allowing researchers and practitioners to more easily develop and
compare conversational agentsandpedagogical tools.
6.2 Generalizability forTraining Data
A pair programming conversational agent must be generalizable
acrossanynumberoftaskobjectives,codebases,orprogramming
languages,andtherefore,mustbetrainedoveradiverserangeofap-
plications.Itisimpracticaltorelysolelyondeveloper-agentdatafor

paperdemonstratedthefeasibilityofusingtransferlearningand
our transfer-learning model (DD->DA) was only marginally better
(+0.1%and+0.6%)thanourbaselinedeveloper-agentmodel(DA).
Previously,Ahmadvandetal.[ 6]achievedanadditional2.7%im-
provement using transfer learning from human-human to human-

Anotherpromisingavenueisutilizingunsupervisedpre-training,
a common technique to tailor deep-learning language models to

on human-human task-oriented datasets via unsupervised masked

natural language understanding of conversational agents. These

6.3 Implementing Conversational Agent
PlatformsfordevelopingconversationalagentssuchasIBMWat-
sonAssistant[ 50],SAPConversationalAI[ 2],andOracleDigital
Assistant[ 82]cannotbeusedbecausetheyfocusonsimple/basic
enterprise problems such as answering questions and solving tasks
based on web or enterprise data. A conversational agent for pair
programming depends strongly on unique aspects such as code
state, test cases, success and errors obtained by interacting with an
IDE. Also, stylistic differences between pair programming and nor-
mal conversations require an alternative feature selection strategy
whenusingmachinelearningalgorithms.Hence,theconversational
agentandit’scomponentsneedto be developedfrom scratch.
Figure3shows the overall architecture and related components
ofaconversationalagent.Apairprogrammingconversationalagent
should be able to track developer’s dialog as well as programming
states on IDE (to implement Dialogue State Tracking), generate
policy based on developers context (Dialogue Policy), and generate
responsestothedeveloper(NaturalLanguageGeneration).Forcode
generation we can either rely on the previously collected samples
or future work should explore utilizing tools such as CodeBERT
[41]andCopilot[ ?]to generatecode.
6.4 Implications forTools

questions from our developer-agent studies that can be utilized
forcreatingavirtualQuestion/Answer(Q/A)agent.Ourqualitative

mingrelatedapplications,suchasintelligenttutoringsystems(ITS)
and assisting developers with disabilities. Future ITS agents should
be designedtobe explicitsincedevelopersprefer explicitcommu-
nication with agents. Researchers and practitioners of ITSs can
design their agents to support more precise dialog. Furthermore,
allofourclassifiers,exceptfor role,canbeutilizedbyITSs,specif-
icallyfocusedonprogramming.Finally,abetterunderstandingof
these differences allows us to make programming more accessible.
Past research [ 71,93,104] has revealed different ways in which
programmingislargelyinaccessibletothosewhoarevisuallyim-
paired.Bycreating interactive tools suchas conversationalagentsand virtual Q/A assistants, we open up the world of programming
to more diversedevelopers, includingthe visually impaired.
6.4.3 Supporting Software Engineering Activities. A fully imple-
mented conversational agent can be adapted to support current

7 CONCLUSIONS
Oursisthefirststudythatcollecteddeveloper-agentconversational
data,generatedsoftwareengineeringspecificlabels,investigated
theefficacyofusingtransformer-basedlanguagemodels,andex-
plored the feasibility of transfer learning for pair programming
conversations. Our paper makes the following contributions: (1)
We provide hierarchical label scheme for developers’ intent, de-
velopedusingamanualopencodingprocessandtailoredforpair
programmingagents.Oursetoflabelscanbeusedforbothmachine
learningalgorithmsaswellasmetricsforqualitativeanalysisofpair
programmingconversations.(2)Wemanuallylabeledtranscripts
ofutterancesfordeveloper-agent(4,443)anddeveloper-developer
(3,436) with our hierarchical labels. Our dataset serves as a starting
point for the creation of a future pair programming benchmark
dataset. For reproducibility, our data can be found at [ 3]. (3) We
gatheredandcategorizedquestionsthatdevelopersaskedouragent.
(4) We demonstrated the applicability of transfer learning between
developer-developer and developer-agent data for an agent and
establishedtheutilityofusingtransformer-basedlanguagemod-
els for developer-agent dialog. Our results have implications for
programming virtualQ/Aassistants, intelligenttutoringsystems,
and bots that support software engineering activities. Addition-
ally,wehighlightopportunitiesforresearchersandpractitioners
