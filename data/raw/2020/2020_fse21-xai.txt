Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become so ubiquitous that many
decisions nowadays in our daily life are shaped by it, e.g., news
feed suggestions and shopping item recommendations.To putthe
flourish of AI into perspective, Adadi and Berrada [ 2] highlight the
reportsforecastingthatfrom2017to2021,theglobalinvestment
on AI will increase from $12 billion US dollars to $52.2 billion, and
the revenues from the AI enabled industries worldwide is expected
to growfrom $480 billionto $2.59 trillion.
TheunstoppablepenetrationofAIalsoreaches intothepublic
sector.Forexample,theEuropeanCommissionenvisionsthatAI
could be used to serve citizens 24/7 in faster, more agile, and more
accessibleways[ 22].However,somepublicAIserviceshavealready
shown harmful consequences. In the U.S., for instance, AI was
used to allocate caregiver hours for people with disabilities, but
dramaticallyloweredthenumberofhoursinmultiplecaseswithout
anyexplanationormeaningfulopportunitytocontestthedecisions
madebythe proprietary algorithm [ 52].
AlthoughAImistakesareinevitable,thelackof explainability
raisessignificantconcernsfromthecitizensandpublicorganiza-
tions about AI-based decision making’s accountability, fairness,
responsibility, and transparency. Explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) addresses these concerns by aiming to make AI more under-
standable to users,soas to increasethe users’ trustandrelianceon
the AI system.
Consequently,many XAItoolsare builttoautomaticallygener-
ate explanations from deep learning models. Deep learning models

Even the seminal work on LIME scored the lowest on Miller et al.’s

To gain insights into application-grounded XAI evaluations, we
conducted a case study on how public services might exploit deep
learningtopredictcombinedseweroverflows(CSOs).Combined
sewer systems transport various sources of water from residential,
industrial, and commercial customers as well as storm runoff. A
problem with these systems is handling CSO events when the sys-
tem is overwhelmed by surges of water and the combined sewer
system is forced to discharge untreated water into the local en-
vironment. With infrastructures like sensor networks collecting
real-timewaterflowdata,alongwiththeavailabilityofcontribut-
ing sources like the rainfall data, public sewer services show keen
interestsindeeplearningtechniquesthatarecapableofoffering

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Explainable Artificial Intelligence(XAI)
andTools
InAI,thehighlevelofdifficultyforthesystemtoprovideasuitable
explanation for how it arrived at an answer is referred to as the
black box problem [ 2]. This difficulty is particularly prominent for
deep learning models, because a deep neural network trained end-
to-end can be as complex as an accurate explanation of why the
modelworks[ 17].ThecomplexitycanbeillustratedbyResNet[ 21],
which incorporates about 5 ×107learned parameters and executes
about 1010floating point operations to classify a single image. XAI
triestodemystifytheblackboxesastheybeginmakingdecisions
previouslyentrustedtohumans.Thus,explainabilityÐtheability
tointerprettheinnerworkingsorthelogicofreasoningbehindthe
decision makingÐhelps to achieve an AI system’s:
•accountability : justifyingthe decisions andactions,
•fairness: havingimpartialtreatment andbehavior,
1By ‘Data Driven’, we mean explicitly referencing articles on explanation in social
science, and testing if the produced explanations are appropriate for the intended
users [31].•responsibility : answering for one’s decisions and identify-
ingerrorsorunexpectedresults, and
•transparency : describing, inspecting, and reproducing the
mechanismsthroughwhichthe decisions are made.
AdadiandBerrada[ 2]identified17XAItechniquesbysurveying
381 papers published between 2004 and 2018. According to the sur-
vey, most recent work done in the XAI field offers a post-hoc,local
explanation.Becauseonlyafewmodels,suchaslinearregression
or decision trees, are inherently interpretable, generating post-hoc
explanations is necessary for complex models like deep neural net-
works. Post-hoc XAI tool can therefore be applied to any classifier
orregressorthatisappropriatefortheapplicationdomainÐeven
those that are yet to be proposed [ 43]. Local explanations justify
why asingleprediction was made,whichare incontrastto global
explanations tryingto understandthe entire reasoningleading to
allpossible outcomes.
What the XAI tools do can be classified by how they emulate
the processing of the data to draw connections between the in-
puts and outputs. Gilpin et al.’s taxonomy [ 16] organizes XAI tools
by their function to (1) extract rules to summarize decisions, (2)
createasaliencemaptohighlightasmallportionofthecomputa-
tion which is most relevant, and (3) employ a simplified proxy that
behaves similarly to the original model. For instance, Benítez et
al.[5]transformeddeepneuralnetworkstofuzzyrulesthroughan
equivalence-by-approximation process, Simonyan et al.[45] pro-
ducedasaliencemapbydirectlycomputingtheinputgradient,and
Ribeiroet al.[43] used a local linear model in LIME as a simplified
proxyfor the full model.
With the increased usage of XAI techniques, evaluating their
efficacybecomesimportanttoinformpractitionersabouttooladop-
tions.Miller etal.’ssurveyof23XAIpapers[ 31]showsthatrigorous
humanbehavioralexperimentsarenotcurrentlybeingundertaken.
As the verb to explain is a three-place predicate: łSomeone ex-
plainssomethingtosomeone[ 23]ž,Millerandhiscolleagues[ 31]
argue that most XAI tools explain things (e.g., feature or neuron
importance) to the AI researchers but notto the intended users.
Doshi-Velez and Kim [ 15] further argue thatthe best way to show
how an XAI technique works is to evaluate the tool by consulting
domain expert grounded in the exact application task. Although
costly, the application-grounded evaluations provide direct and
strongevidence(orlackthereof)ofXAI’sfulfillmentoftherequire-
ments.
2.2 Explainability as aNon-Functional
Requirement(NFR)
In software engineering, functional requirements describe what the
system does, whereas non-functional requirements (NFRs) focus on
how well the system does it [ 10,38]. Making classifications, rec-
ommendations, and predictions are among the common functional
requirements of an AI system [ 11], and doing so in an explain-
able wayis often regardedas a non-functional concern [ 28]. Thus,
researchersconsiderexplainabilityto be an NFR.
In a survey study with 107 participants (90 from Brazil and 17
fromGermany),ChazetteandSchneider[ 9]elicitedtheparticipants’
expectations from an explanation. Chazette and Schneider’s online

and 55 (53%) expressedwillingness to understand whysomething

łbenefitsofthe newroute when comparedto the usualž[ 9]).
Thesurveyresultsclearlyshowthatpeople’sexplainabilityre-
quirementsaredifferent.ChazetteandSchneider[ 9]furtherpointed
outthatelicitingexplainabilityshouldalsoconsiderlawsandnorms,
culturalandcorporatevalues,domainaspects,andpracticalproject

stance, debated about a general łRight to Explanationž [ 18] which
is partly enshrined in certain regulations [ 41]. Such policies, along
with thegloballyemergingethicsguidelines [ 25],are makingAIÐ
especiallyAI incitizenservicesÐmore auditable.
NFRs may interact: the attempts to achieve one NFR can hurt or
help the achievement of another [ 34]. For example, generating a
post-hocexplanationimposesadditionalcomputationaloverhead,
possiblyhurtinganAIservice’sresponsiveness.Meanwhile,35%of
thecodesin[ 9]correspondedtotheresponsesinwhichtheusers
perceived explanations as a way to reduce obscurity due to the
moreinformationabouttheAIsystemanditsoutcomes.Yet15%
cautioned that too technical or lengthy explanations might add
more obscurity. Recognizing the trade-offs between explainability
andotherNFRsisthereforeimportantforprioritizingrequirements
andmakingdesignchoices.
Insummary,therequirementsengineeringliteraturesuggests
that explainability is an NFR, or a softgoal whose satisfaction is
a matter of degree without a clear-cut criterion [ 10]. Because ex-

what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers
to be the largest unaddressed risk to human health from the water
infrastructure [ 50]. According to an EPA report [ 50], about 850 bil-
lion gallons of untreated wastewater is discharged into waterways
annually in the U.S. The excess water from storms carries dust,
trash, and debris from developed regions and washes them into
the combined sewer system. When these combined sewer systems
areoverwhelmed,theywilldischargeuntreatedwastewaterinto
nearby waterways at an outfall site. This is defined as a combined
sewer overflow (CSO) event. Figure 1shows a simplified view of
the causes ofCSOevents.

in London, UK annually due to the CSO events [ 13]. Even mod-

Simply giving our deep learning model to the wastewater treat-

to our deep learning solution. There are quite a few tools that pro-

compare tools for our work, the tools we used must be available
to the engineers at the wastewater treatment organization even
without our direct input so they can continue to use and expand

compatible withour solution, andeasyto use.
In addition to the above selection criteria, we wanted to use the

3.3 Research Questions
Wefollowthegoal-question-metric(GQM)approach[ 46]tocrit-
ically understand the three chosen XAI tools in the context of
deep learning based CSO prediction. The analysis is drawn from
our GQM analysis of visual requirments analytics tools [ 37,40].
ComparedwithmanyXAIstudiesthatfocusedonevaluatingthe
produced explanations with lay persons or AI researchers [ 31], we
collected the feedback directly from two domain experts, i.e., a
hydrologistandanoperationalmanagerattheMSDGC.Wewere
in constant email communications with the two domain experts.
Furthermore,we heldthreeone-hourvirtualmeetingswiththese
two experts to understand the data shared with the research team,
toelicittheirexplainabilityrelatedconcerns,andtointerviewthem
whilepresenting the explanation results from the XAItools.
The structure of our GQM analysis is presented in Figure 4
where two general goals of accuracy and explainability of CSO
prediction are addressed. Relevant questions are used to refine the
goals. While we measure accuracy by well-known metrics of recall
and precision, the questions of explainability are explicitly built on
human behavioral studies, making our case study directly ‘Data
Driven’accordingtoMiller etal.[31].Inparticular,weconsidertwo
studiesonexplainabilityfromcognitivepsychologyandbehavioral
sciences.
Lombrozo [ 29] conducted human subject experiments to decide
whatcausedagiveneventfromasetofpossiblechoicesthenjus-
tify these decisions, and showed that people disproportionately
preferred simpler explanations over more likely ones, indicating
sometrade-offbetweenthesimplicityandsoundnessofexplana-
tions.Moreover,Thagard[ 49],indevelopinghiswell-knownECHO
model to characterize the cognitive processes responsible for se-
lecting between competing explanatory hypotheses, reported that
peoplepreferredtheexplanationsconsistentwiththeirpriorknowl-
edge. Therefore, we also investigate how disruptive the XAI tools’explanations are, compared to the domain experts’ existing CSO
understandings. As shown in Figure 4, our case study addresses
five researchquestions(RQs):
•RQ1: How complete does the XAI-enabled deep learning
solution predict CSOs?
We measured this through recallwhich is the number of
correctly identified CSO events out of all CSO events in the
dataset. LIME and SHAP make post-hoc predictions directly
fromtheLSTM-baseddeeplearningmodel.Consequently,
LIME and SHAP have the same recall value as the LSTM.
RuleMatrix, on the other hand, requires a re-computation of
recallaccording to the generatedrules.
•RQ2: How much noise is there as the XAI-enabled deep
learningsolution predicts CSOevents?
Wemeasuredthisthrough precision,thenumberofcorrectly
identifiedCSOeventsoutofallpredictedeventsbythedeep
learning model. Just as with recall, LIME and SHAP make
post-hoc predictions and thus have the same precision as
the original LSTM, whereas this metric will need to be re-
computedfor the rule-basedmodelcreatedbyRuleMatrix.
•RQ3:HowsimplearetheexplanationsgeneratedbytheXAI
tools?
In order to evaluate the simplicity of these tools, we used
bothnumericmetricsaswellasinterviews.Foraquantita-
tive metric, we computed the entropyof the explanations
produced by the XAI tools. Entropy measures the uncer-
tainty,ordisorder,ofadistribution[ 42]whichcanbeused
to approximate how much unique information and variabil-

Wealso interviewedthetwodomain expertsto assesstheir

•RQ5: How much new insight, if any, do the XAI tools’ ex-

To our stakeholders from the MSDGC, performance is an
important aspectas anAIsystem must bothperformbetter
and be as interpretable as their existing system to justify its
use. It is clear to us that our stakeholders want to know if
deeplearningcanprovideanewperspectiveontheproblem.
However,havingamodeldeviatetoomuchfromtheirexpec-

4 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
As mentioned in Section 3, we designed an LSTM deep learning
solutiontopredictCSOsfortheMSDGC.Weanalyzedtheresults
fromthisdeeplearningmodelaswellastheXAItoolsdescribed
in Section 3.2. These results are from an LSTM that predicts if a
CSO event will occur within the next hour after being given the
previous 12 hoursofdata.

thenevaluatedthepredictionsbasedonthegivenlabelsfromthe
wastewater treatment organization: łelevatedž means CSO events

TherecallandprecisionresultsareplottedinFigure 5.Thefigure

henceLIMEandSHAP)areapproximately80%and45%respectively.
TherecallandprecisionforRuleMatrixareonlyabout40%and20%
respectively, representing a 50% recall drop and a 55% precision
drop.
While disappointed in the RuleMatrix’s accuracy levels, the two
domain experts believed LSTM’s CSO predictions were encour-
aging and agreed with our suggestions of improving the model
performances by incorporatingdata from more CSO sites. During
the interviews, the experts were also interested in how the LSTM’s
performances would comparetotheMSDGC’s currentpracticeofRecall Elevated

Toinvestigatethis,wefurthercollectedrainfalldatafromNOAA

and time range that our deep learning model was tested on. When
usingaconstantrainfallthresholdforagivenday(i.e.,0.5inches

obtained. The low precision level helped illustrate the exploration
ofthedeeplearningsolutions.AlthoughLSTM’s41.3%doubledthe
CSOpredictions’precision,itisimportanttonotethattheNOAA
dataset can only collect rainfall data for each day, whereas the
LSTM-based deeplearning model makes predictions continuously
for a time range in the future. This continuous prediction of the
deep learning model could lead to lower recall as a prediction one

eventmaybeincorrect.LSTMdoesnotpredicteveryintervalbefore

are low,LSTM (andhence LIMEandSHAP) achieves

the currentpractice.In addition,LSTM providesnew
predictive capabilities for every five minutesbefore a

explanation size (i.e., the number of parameters in an explanation).
This trend is expected as more unique values are being added to
the explanations. As far as the XAI tools are concerned, LIME
had complexity almost equivalent to a random sampling, and it
could also be filtered to the most significant results. SHAP had

that challengedtheirinitialview.
Another major insight was the prominence of Rainfall in the
decisionmakingprocessofthemodel,asshowninFigure 8.This
confirmed our stakeholders’ expectations as excess storm water
is the main cause of CSO events and helped them to trust the
results. However, the dominant influence of Rainfall leveled off not
only when LIME’s explanations involved more features, but also
when SHAP was applied. Given that LIME and SHAP achieved the
samerecallandprecisionlevels,thepatternsrevealedinFigure 9
offers remarkable insights into whento focus on which features.
While weather forecast’s Rainfall could still be dependent upon
in alerting CSOs to the relevant citizens 12 hours ahead of the
time, paying additional and equal attention to sensor network data
likevelocitycouldpotentiallyleave2ś4hoursfortheMSDGCto

5 DISCUSSION
5.1 SatisficingExplainability
Explainability, as an NFR discussed in Section 2.2, is satisficed [ 10]
inamatterofdegrees.BasedonourGQManalysisfromFigure 4
andthe quantitative and qualitative results presentedin Section 4,
webuildaSoftgoalInterdependenceGraph(SIG)inFigure 10.Inthe
SIG,eachoftheXAItoolscontributeseitherpositivelyornegatively
tothesoftgoals.FromFigure 10,wenotethatnoneoftheXAItoolsthat we investigated makes all positive contributions, indicating
thetoolsarealllimitedinsomeaspects.Atoolcannothelpmeet
somesoftgoalwithouthurtingsomeothers,suggestingthetrade-
offs among the softgoals. Interestingly, Figure 10does not reveal
the well-known trade-off between recall and precision. Instead,
theLSTM (andhenceLIMEandSHAP) achieved higherrecall and
higher precision than RuleMatrix, showing that RuleMatrix is less
fit for making CSO predictions. However, as of now, LIME and
SHAP do not perform accurately enough to be adopted by our
stakeholders.
Onemightarguethekeytoimprovingaccuracyiswiththeun-
derlyingdeeplearningmodel(namely LSTMinour case),making
explainabilityless ofa concern. We argueconsideringexplainabil-
ity, even when accuracy levels are not ideal, is still valuable. For
example,aninterestingcontrastbetweenLIMEandSHAPiswhere
theinfluencefor CSO predictionscomes from.Although different,
theexplanationsprovidedbyLIMEandSHAParebothvalidand
showhowtheseXAImethodologiesdivergeinoperation.Thedeep
learning model predicts events one hour into the future. However,
LIMEprioritizesinfluenceofrainfallfrommanyhoursbeforeaCSO
event, whereas SHAP prioritizes influence from all features evenly
immediately preceding a CSO event. Deciphering the black-box
deeplearningmodels,thoughwithvaryingdegreesofsatisficing
explainability, is of vital importance for ensuring public sector’s
transparency andaccountability.
5.2 Data DrivenExplainability
As we drive our inquiry by explicitly referencing the explainability
findingsfrom[ 29,49],wecastourcasestudy’sresultsinlightof
therelevantliterature.Lombrozo[ 29]showedthatpeopledispro-
portionately prefer simpler explanations over more likely ones;
however,Lombrozo’sworkwascarriedoutwithstudentsubjects
who were not domain experts in the field. Through our case study,
we have seen that the hydrologist and the operational manager
greatly favoredthe soundness of the explanations.It isalso worth
mentioning that simplicity does not necessarily correlate with size
(i.e., the number of features an explanation has). By computing
entropytomeasuretherandomnessoftheinformationcontained
intheexplanations(cf.Figure 6),weobservethatsoundnessand
simplicity co-exist inSHAP’sexplanations.
Thagard[ 49]reportedthatpeopleprefertheexplanationsthat
are consistent with their prior knowledge. Our domain experts
conformedlargelytoThagard’sconjecture.TheyconfirmedtheXAI
tools’ outputs generally cohered with what they expected. In some
occasions, we noticed that the XAI tools’ explanations refuted our
domainexperts’expectations.Theexpertskeptanopenmindset,
andwereabletofindnewinsightsfromthedataset.Specifically,the
resultsofSHAPgavemoreinfluencetovelocitythantheexperts
initially expected (cf. Figure 8). Since SHAP mostly drew influence
from right before the CSO event (cf. Figure 9), they were able to
reasonthatthisexplanationdrewuponinformationthattheymight
have overlooked. Because of these observations, LIME or SHAP

6 CONCLUDINGREMARKS
Research on explainability of XAI tools with domain experts using
real-worlddataissignificanttoensuringthetool’sabilitytobeused
with new topics. Our work is a proof of concept for how a GQM
analysis might be used to assess various XAI tools. Despite not
developingan immediately applicable product fordomain experts,
we believe that this research can serve as a foundation to assist
development of XAI tools that are more useful for a broader set of
stakeholdersbyprovidingaframeworkbasedonGQMforpotential
analysis.
Inourexploratorycasestudy,weemployedqualitativeandquan-
titativemethodstoevaluatethepredictions’accuracyandtheexpla-
nations’simplicity,soundness,anddisruptiveness.Throughcom-
paring thenumeric metrics and reviewing the resultsof thestake-
holder interviews, we are able to build upon existing psychological
results and contextualize them with respect to the modern XAI
tools. Domain experts welcome new insights and more complex
explanations with multiple causes. Our findings do not directly re-
fute the work of Lombrozo [ 29] and Thagard [ 49], but rather build
upon their work in noting that the different levels of complexity
maybeappropriatefordifferentstakeholdersdependingontheir
background [ 16].
To further expand upon this work, explanations from more XAI
toolscanbeinvestigatedfornewinsightsandforsupportingdiffer-
entsoftwareengineeringtasks(e.g.,[ 12,24,48,51]).Futurework
can also explore how to effectively, efficiently, dynamically, and
continuously present value-added explanations of deep learning
modeltostakeholders[ 33].Additionally,wewanttousemoredata
to expand our case study and investigate how seasonal rainfall
differences affect the XAI results. Last but not least, we seek to
employ diverse empirical methods in our future work, such as case
studiesco-designwithdomainexperts[ 53,54]andtheoreticalrepli-
cations [26,35]. Investigating explainability as a non-functional
