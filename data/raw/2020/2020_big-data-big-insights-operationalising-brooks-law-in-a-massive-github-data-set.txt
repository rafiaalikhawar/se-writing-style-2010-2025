ABSTRACT
Massive data from software repositories and collaboration tools
are widely used to study social aspects in software development.One question that several recent works have addressed is how a
software project’s size and structure influence team productivity, a
question famously considered in Brooks’ law. Recent studies using
massive repository data suggest that developers in larger teams
tendtobelessproductivethansmallerteams.Despiteusingsimilar
methods and data, other studies argue for a positive linear or even
super-linear relationship between team size and productivity, thus
contestingtheviewofsoftwareeconomicsthatsoftwareprojects
arediseconomiesof scale.
In our work, we studychallenges that can explain the disagree-
mentbetween recent studies of developer productivity in massive
repository data. We further provide, to the best of our knowledge,
thelargest,curatedcorpusof GitHubprojectstailoredtoinvestigate
the influence of team size and collaboration patterns on individual
andcollectiveproductivity.Ourworkcontributestotheongoing
discussion on the choice of productivity metrics in the operational-
isation of hypotheses about determinants of successful softwareprojects. It further highlights general pitfalls in big data analysis
andshowsthattheuseofbiggerdatasetsdoesnotautomatically
leadto more reliable insights.

Empirical research across disciplines is nowadays driven by the
availabilityofbigdataandmethodstoprocessandanalysethem
efficiently. In empirical software engineering, massive data from
softwarerepositoriesandonlinecollaborationtoolsarewidelyused
toinvestigatesocialandhumanaspectsinsoftwaredevelopment.
This intersects with computational social science, which uses big
data to test hypotheses about individual and collective human be-
haviour originally developed in sociology, social psychology, or
organisational theory. Data-driven studies of developer productiv-
ityinlargesoftwareprojectsareanexemplarycaseofhowresearch
inempiricalsoftwareengineeringcanadvancecomputationalsocial
science. The question of how factors like, e.g., team size, influence
theproductivityofteammemberswasalreadyaddressedbyMaxim-
ilien Ringelmann [ 1] in 1913. In social psychology, his finding that
individual productivity tends to linearly decrease with team size is
known as the Ringelmann effect. In software project management,
asimilarobservationisfamously paraphrased as Brooks’law [2].
Here, the anecdote that “adding manpower to a late project makes
itlater”capturesthattheoverheadassociatedwithgrowingteam
sizescanreduceteamefficiency.Studiesofcollaborativesoftware
projectsfoundevidenceforastrongRingelmanneffectfordifferentteamsizes,programminglanguages,anddevelopmentphases[
3–6].
Otherstudies,however,foundapositivelinearorevensuper-linear
relationship between the size of a team and the productivity of its
members[7–9].
Thefactthatdifferentworksstudyingthesameresearchques-
tion yield qualitatively different results, despite applying similar
methods to data from similar or even identical sources, should con-
cern us.Referring tothe massive number of projects,commits, or
developers covered in their studies, authors often corroborate their
findings by the size of the data used to obtain them, thus implying
thattheanalysisofbiggerdataautomaticallyyieldsmorereliable
insights. This points to an important general issue relevant forempirical research beyond software engineering: Apart from ad-
vantages in terms of coverage, resolution, or statistical confidence,
theuseofbigdata alsointroduces new threatsforthevalidityof
results. To address this issue, in this work, we explore four chal-
lenges in the analysis of big data. We study those challenges in a
massiveGitHubdatasetandarguethattheyarelikelytoexplain

conflicting results on the Ringelmann effect that were reported in
recent works.
A first challenge is the quality of big data that, rather than
being carefully collected and curated to address a specific research
problem, are often incidentally generated as “digital exhaust” of
largeonlineplatforms.Inempiricalsoftwareengineering,thisholds
for massive data on software repositories harvested from online
platformslike,e.g., GitHuborSourceForge.Whilemassivereposi-
torydatapromiseinsightsintouniversalsofcollaborativesoftware

These originate, e.g., from the inclusion of repositories that do not
relate to software projects, projects whose development history is
onlypartiallyrepresentedinthedata,orambiguitiesthathinderthe
reliable identification ofdevelopers [ 10–13]. Thisposesparticular
problemsforstudiesaddressingtheeffectofteamsizeondeveloper

Asecondchallengeis population validity ,whichdetermines
whether findings obtained in a given data sample can be extrap-
olated to a larger population. On the one hand, for reasons of
computational efficiency, researchers often base their results on
asubsetoftheobservationsavailableinmassivedata,whichcan
introduce biases that question population validity. On the other
hand,wecannotnecessarilyavoidsuchbiasesbyusingallavailable
datasincepopulationvaliditydependsonthepopulationforwhich

data, using full information on all GitHubprojects may be justified
if we want to answer a question about the population of GitHub
projects.However,ifweusedataon GitHubtoobtaingeneralisable

to avoid biased samples in which either small or large teams are

2 SYSTEMATIC CONSTRUCTION OF DATA
CORPUS
We first introduce a framework to select and mine projects from
GitHubthat can be used to address the first two challenges of
data quality andpopulation validity. We use it to systematically
sample 201 OSS projects covering the entire range of team sizesonGitHub. We further extract time-stamped editing events that
we use to investigate whether collaboration structures can explain
teamproductivity.
2.1 Dataquality
To select suitable projects from GitHub, we propose the project
selectionand samplingpipelineshown inFigure1. Asafirst step,
we need to gain access to the information required to apply our
selection criteria. Because GitHub’s REST API is rate-limited to
5,000 requests per hour1, retrieving the metadata of more than
100 million repositories hosted on GitHub[17] becomes untenable.
We,therefore,usethedatabasemadeavailablebythe GHTorrent
project[15],whichhascrawledmostof GitHub’sRESTAPIusing
donatedAPIkeys.Weusethelatest1availabledumpfromJune2019
that contains data on a total of more than 125 million repositories.
Asasecondstep,wedeterminewhichprojectsinthe GHTorrent
database are suitable to study collaborative OSS development.I th a s
alreadybeenreportedbytheauthorsof[ 11]thatthemajorityof
projects on GitHubare either personal, inactive, or very small and
shouldbeexcludedwhenanalysingcollaborativesoftwaredevel-
opment. We adopt the filtering criteria proposed by the authors of
[11], namely excluding repositories with a single developer, fewer
than 50 commits, or a span of fewer than 100 days between the
first and last commit in the repository. The resulting data set re-
ducestoaround4.5millionOSSprojects,i.e.,3.6%ofall GHTorrent
repositories. In other words, following [ 11], at least 96.4% of the
repositories in the latest GHTorrent database are not suitable for
studyingcollaborative software development.
Wefurtherimproveonthesefilteringcriteriainthefollowing
two ways. First, GitHubis frequently used for applications not
related to software development, such as free file storage or web
hosting [ 11]. Our own analysis revealed a substantial number of
popular repositories2not representative of collaborative software
development, e.g., tutorials on git, code snippet repositories, or
git-based “clocks”, which are updated with a new commit every
second. Excluding these repositories is crucial to avoid misleading
results.
Second, as a result of the functionality to forkany public reposi-
tory,GitHubcontains a substantial amount of repositories that are
inlargepartsexactcopiesofotherprojects.Wedropallrepositoriesthataredesignatedas forkstoavoidbiasesfromanalysingthesame

importance of proper data selection when analysing collaborative
software development on GitHub.
2.2 Population validity
Besidesprojectsthatareoriginalandcollaborative,ourstudyon
team productivity requires projects that fulfil additional conditions
regarding their (i) activity, (ii) size, and (iii) purpose, i.e., collabora-
tive projects for developing software (step 3 in Figure 1).
Project activity. To avoid issues that could arise from mixing
activeprojectswiththosewheredevelopmenthascededlonginthepast,wefocusonprojectsthatareactivelydevelopedatthetimeofourstudy.Weregardaprojectasactiveifthelastcommitwasmade
after May 2020. To ensure this, we take a two-fold approach: we
firstselectprojectsfrom GHTorrent thathavearecordedcommit
activity after May 2019. In a subsequent step, we then use theGitHubRESTAPItofilterthoseprojectsthatadditionallyhavea
recorded commit after May 2020.
Project size. To facilitate an unbiased sampling of projects based
on team size, we first need to determine the size of a development
team.ForOSSprojectswithoutformalteammemberships,thisis
a challenging task. The authors of [ 3] found that the probability
of making future contributions to an OSS project drops below 10%
afteraninactivityofapprox.42weeks.Basedonthisfinding,we

computethesizeofanOSSdevelopmentteamattime 𝑡bycounting
all developers who committed within a moving time window of
294 days, i.e., between 𝑡−294 days and 𝑡. Thus, to compute a team
size, projects need to have existed for at least 294 days, increasing
therequirementsbeyondthe100daysconsideredbytheauthorsof
[11].
Table 1 shows the number of projects for different team sizes,
whereteamsizeiscomputedforthelatestavailable294-daytime
window. The project counts are reported for ten log2-spaced strata,
which yields a distribution where the team size roughly doubles
for each consecutive stratum. The resulting distribution is right-
skewed, where the vast majority of projects have small team sizes.
A uniform sample from the complete set of projects would thus
primarilyselectsmallprojects,whichwouldfailtocoverabroad
spectrumofteamsizes.Toremedythis,wesample28projectsfrom
eachstratum,where28isthesizeofthestratumwiththefewest
projects.
While sampling, we ensure that all sampled projects are soft-
waredevelopmentprojectsandcontinuetobe activelydeveloped
at the time of mining. We further remove duplicate projects that
originatefrommanualclonesofotherrepositories.Weachievethis
by applying the following selection criteria:
Project purpose. To identify a project’s purpose, we query the
GitHubREST API to obtain the most recent information on all
consideredprojects.Wefirstensurethatallsampledprojectsare
softwaredevelopmentprojectsandcontinuetobeactivelydevel-
oped at the time of mining. We consider a project as a software
development project if at least 75% of the code in the repository is
writteninthe17programminglanguagessupportedbythecode
analysis tool lizard[19]. In total, the languages supported by
lizardaccount for over 85% of the code submitted to GitHub[20].
Deduplication. Finally, our set of projects still contains duplicate
repositoriesthatoriginatefrommanualclonespushedtoadifferent
repository rather than using the fork mechanic recorded in the
GHTorrent data. Removing these clones is an important challenge
when selecting repositories for analysis, and independent data sets
listing duplicate repositories have been developed [ 21]. Unfortu-
nately, these data sets were not yet available at the time of our
analysis.Therefore,wemanuallyremovedtheclones,retainingthe
originalproject that was cloned.
Thetwo selection criteria require us to query the GitHubREST
API or perform manual filtering, respectively. Due to the API’sratelimit,thismeansthatneithercanbeperformedatlargescale
beforesamplingprojects.Instead,theyneedtobeperformedduring
the sampling process. We treat all strata equally and apply the
additionalselectioncriteriatothesampled28projectsfromeach
stratum.AsshowninthefinalcolumnofTable1,thisyieldsbetween
6 and 27 projects for each of the ten strata, resulting in a total of
201 projects with a total of more than 100,000 developers and over
3 million commits (step 4 in Figure 1). Overall, we obtain relatively
similarprojectcountsforallstrata,exceptforthestratawithlargest
andsmallestteamsizes.
2.3 Mining co-editing networks from git
repositories
Weminealleditsandco-editsforthefullhistoryofthe201projects
usingtheOpenSourcePythontool git2net[16].Besidesco-editing
relations,wealsoextractbothcommit-andcode-basedproductivity
measures. To this end, we apply lizard[19] and an optimised ver-
sion of multimetric [22] to the source code before and after each
change.Obtaininghighlygranularinformationonthedevelopment
processofover200OSSprojectsrequiressubstantialcomputational
resources, in our case, over 1 million CPU-hours. Therefore, we
performallcomputationson256computecoreswithinatimeframe
of over six months on the ETH Zurich scientific compute cluster
Euler.
An additional challenge in the analysis of gitrepositories is
theneedtodisambiguatecommitauthors.Thisstepisnecessary
asdeveloperscanmakecontributionsusingdifferentcredentials,
e.g.,duetospellingerrorsinusernamesortheuseofnicknames.Considering different aliases as different users would lead us to
overestimatetheteamsizeandunderestimatetheproductivityof
developerswithmultiplealiases.Wethususetherecentlyproposed
toolgambit[13]to disambiguate all developers in all repositories.
Uponmanualinspection,wefoundthatsomeprojectscontain
very large commits originating from code imports or automated
code refactoring tools. Such, mostly automated, commits are notrepresentative for the coordination requirements between devel-opers. However, due to their size, they could lead to a bias oursubsequent analysis. Therefore, as a final data cleaning step, we
drop outliers by excluding all commits outside the 2 .5th and 97 .5th
percentile regarding their total Levenshtein distance.
A complete list of projects as well as anonymised raw data of all
projects considered in our analysis is archived on zenodo.org3.
3 OPERATIONALISING PRODUCTIVITY AND
COLLABORATION STRUCTURE
To study how team size affects the productivity of OSS projects,
we need to operationalise (i) the size of OSS teams, and (ii) the
productivity of OSS teams. In addition, we aim to understand how
coordination between different team members affects this relation.
Therefore, we need to also operationalise (iii) the collaboration
structure of OSS teams.
We base our operationalisations of all three concepts on the
editsandco-editsobservedwithinnon-overlapping42-weektime
windows. As discussed in Section 2.2, the choice of 42 weeks is

motivated by [ 3] who found that after this time, the probability of
a developer making future contributions to a project is less than
10%. Ensuring that the time window is divisible by full weeks is
essentialtoensurethattheweeklyproductivitypatternspresent
onGitHub[23]do not bias our results.
In the next three sections, we will discuss each of the opera-
tionalisationsin detail.
3.1 Team size
OSSprojectsutilisetheprinciplesofopencollaborationtocreate
newsoftware.Thismeansthattheyrelyoncontributionsofloosely
coordinated participants, who differ significantly regarding the
size of their contributions. Contributors can further join and leave
the team at any time. Due to this method of collaboration, no
organised ledgers listing the members of OSS teams exist. This
makesoperationalising the size of such teams non-trivial.
Theconsensusofpriorliteratureisthatallindividualscontribut-
ing to an OSS project should be considered as team members [ 24].
Withthiswork,westudytheproductionofcodeartefacts.There-
fore, we operationalise team size as the count of all individuals
who contribute code to a project within a given time window. This
includesalldevelopersadding,modifying,orremovingcodefrom
theproject’s codebase.
3.2 Productivity measures
Before discussing how we operationalise team productivity, we
needtopreciselydefinethisterm.Productivitycapturesoneaspectofthebroaderconceptof teameffectiveness.Here,teameffectiveness
is defined as (i) the productive output of the work group, (ii) the
effectivenessof processesto maintaintheteam’s capabilityinthe
future, and (iii) the satisfaction of group member’s personal needs
[25, p. 323]. With our study on team productivity, we focus on the
firstaspect.Specifically,weassesstheinput-outputrelationconsid-
ering the size of the code changes made by an OSS development
teamas a function of the team’s size.
Tooperationaliseteamproductivity,weneedtodefinemeasures
thatallowustocapturethesizeofachangeinaproject’scodebase.
For this, many different measures have been proposed in the litera-
ture. Addressing construct validity, we consider eight productivity
measures and investigate the extent to which they provide inde-
pendentinformationontheconstructofproductivity.Wefurther
carefullyinvestigateand assesshow these measures interrelate.We categorise our eight productivity measures as commit- or
code-basedmeasures[ 26].Commit-basedmetricsrelysolelyonthe
sizeofthechangeswithinarepository,e.g.,thenumberofcommits,
thenumberofchangedlines,orthenumberofmodifiedcharacters.
Commit-basedproductivitymeasuresrequirelowcomputational
effort and are independent of the programming language used in a
repository. However, by not assessing the content of a repository’s
code, they do not allow us to distinguish, e.g., between lines of
codeorcommentsthatareadded.Therefore,wealsoconsidercode-based measures that take these aspects into account. These include
measuresbasedonthenumberofmodifiedlinesofcode(NLOC),
thenumberofcodetokensorfunctions,changesinMcCabe’scy-
clomatic complexity [ 27], or the Halstead effort [ 28]. We provide a
complete overview of the productivity measures considered in our
studyinTable2.Wecomputeproductivityforeachtimewindow
andnormalisetheproductivity by the respective team size (TS).
To illustrate how different productivity measures can introduce
the challenge of construct validity, consider the exemplary Python
code shown in Figure 2. We start with version one of a file that
containsthreelinesoftextwithatotalof53characters(whitespaces
included).Creatingthisfilefromscratchwouldrequirethree line
modification events, i.e. three line-additions where lines 1 and 3
contain actual code, and line 2 contains a comment. Therefore, the
number of line modification events is three, while the lines of code
(NLOC)istwo.Intheexample,wehavehighlightedallcodetokens.
To compute the Halstead effort, we need to distinguish between
tokensthatareoperandsandoperators.Thesearehighlightedin
blueandred,respectively,whereasallothertokensareprintedin
purple.Intotal,wehave12tokens.With aandb,thecodecontains
𝜂2=2 distinct operands that appear a total of 𝑁2=4 times. We
further have 𝑁1=6 operators that are all different from each
other (i.e. 𝜂1=6). The Halstead effort to create this file is thus
defined as 𝐸=(𝑁1+𝑁2)·log2(𝜂1+𝜂2)·𝜂1
2·𝑁2
𝜂2=180. Finally,
the file only has one function without any branches resulting in
Functions =CycC =1.
Withthefirstmodification,weaddasecondfunctionimplement-
ing the multiplication of two values. The bottom-left green box in
Figure 2 shows the productivity of this change. The code-based
productivity measures are computed as the productivity difference
tocreatethetwoconsecutiveversionsofthefile.Forthecommit-
basedmeasures,thecontentsofthetwofilesarecompareddirectly.
Withthesecondmodification,wemergethetwofunctionsintoone.
Despitetheincreaseincharacters,thetokenandfunctioncounts
and the Halstead effort of version three are lower than those of
version two. If measures such as the number of functions or the
cyclomatic complexity were to only increase, this would make the
code difficult to maintain and prone to bugs [ 29,30]. Therefore, we
also consider contributions reducing code complexity, e.g., by con-
solidating functions or refactoring code, as productive. We achieve
thisbycomputingtheproductivityofamodificationastheabsolute
valueoftheproductivityvaluestocreatetheversionsbeforeand
aftertheobserved change.
Thissimpleexampleshowsthatoureightproductivitymeasures
can yield considerably different results. This prompts the question
ofwhichmeasureweshoulduseasatargetvariablethatweseek

productivity measures are highly correlated.
3.3 Collaborationnetworks of OSS teams
Addressing the challenges of omitted-variable bias, we explore how
the collaborationstructure of teams might modulate team produc-
tivity. In this way, we capture team characteristics beyond mereteam size, highlighting additional variables that we need to control
for when studying Brooks’ law in rich data. The inclusion of addi-
tionalmeasurescapturingcollaborationstructurewasmotivatedby
[3],whichfoundthat ateam’snetworkstructureaffectsthe slope
oftherelationintheirdata.Therefore,forthiswork,weconsider
network-based measures that fit this prior work. In addition, we
also includesoftware-engineering-specific measures.
Specifically, to capture characteristics of different aspects of the
collaborationstructuresofdevelopmentteams,weusemeasures
thatwecomputeontheco-editingnetworkconstructedforournon-
overlapping42-weektimewindows.Intheseco-editingnetworks,
nodes represent different developers and edges 𝐴→𝐵represent
eventswheredeveloper 𝐵modifiesalineofcodelasteditedby 𝐴.
The direction of the edge indicates the change of line ownership
from𝐴to𝐵.Multipleco-editingeventsbetweentwodevelopersare

Number of nodes (N). The number of nodes in the co-editing

equal to the team size.
Number of edges (Edges). The number of edges counts the co-
editing events within a time window.

The definitions above enable us to capture the collaboration
structure of software development teams in a multi-dimensional
featurespace.Similartotheproductivitymeasures,wefindthatthe
distributions of some network measures are highly skewed. There-
fore, we again apply logarithmic or square-root transformations.
We report the applied transformation for all measures throughout
theremainder of this manuscript.We next aim to select a minimum set of features that capture
independent dimensions of collaboration networks. For this, westudy pair-wise correlations between all features, identify clus-ters of highly correlated features, and select one representative
featurepercluster.Whilewecouldinsteadusedimensionalityre-

provides the advantage that it allows us to analyse interpretable
network features rather than principal components.

We finally consider cross-correlations between the network and
productivity measures shown in Figure 3c. The results of this anal-

4 TESTING BROOKS’ LAW IN MASSIVE
GITHUB DATA
Wenowaddresstheongoingscientificdiscourseontherelationship
between team size and productivity [ 7,8,40]. For this, we apply
linear and polynomial regression models to different productivity
target variables, where we additionally use the network metrics
identified in section Section 3.3 as control variables.
Figure4ashowstheproductivityperteammemberasafunction

clomatic complexity. We fit a linear ( CycC∼TS) and a polynomial

Thelinearmodelenablesustoinferapossiblerelationshipbetween
teamsizeandproductivity.Themodel CycC∼TS+TS2isthebasis
to test for the existence of an optimal team size, which is captured
by the existence of a global maximum of the quadratic function.
The linear model yields a significant negative relationship be-
tween TS and productivity, as reported in Table 3a. Similarly, as
showninTable3b,wefindasignificantnegativecoefficientforTS2
for the quadratic model. This means that, on average, individual
productivity decreases with team size.
That said, all coefficients for TS in the quadratic models are
positive,andthecoefficientsforCycCandHalEffarealsosignifi-
cant. This means that these models can be represented as inverted
parabolas, e.g., as shown by the red curve for CycC in Figure 4a.
The maxima of the parabolas for CycC and HalEff provide some
evidence for an optimal team size of 7 or 19 team members, re-
spectively,whichisroughlyinlinewiththeoptimalteamsizeof
9 suggested by [ 41]. However, we argue that the key insight of
this result is not the exactteam size for which the maximum is
reached,whichislikelyanartefactofthesimplifiedmodelusedfor
ouranalysis.Instead,thekeyinsightisthepossibleincreaseinindi-
vidualproductivityforverysmallteams—comparedtotheanalysed
range from 2 to 1,711 members—with decreases thereafter. Due to
the large amount of remaining variance and the small slope of the
parabolaaroundthemaximum,interpretingaspecificnumberas
optimalteamsizeislikelytobemisleading.Wefurthernotethat
fortheregression analyses using theremaining productivity mea-
suresastargetvariables,thecoefficientforteamsizeisinsignificant.
Hence, despite the coefficients being consistently positive, these
models do not provide sufficient statistical evidence to conclude an
increaseinindividualproductivityeveninsmallteams,resulting
in an overall negative relation between productivity and team size.
Importantly, the models considered so far only partially explain
the variance in the relationship between productivity and teamsize. This can be seen from the low
𝑅2values of less than 15%
in Table 3a and b. Moreover, Figure 4a shows that, especially forsmall teams, the productivity of team members varies over four
decades. This suggests that additional aspects other than team size
have a substantial influence on the productivity of developers. We
thusconsiderregressionmodels that additionallycontrol for the
networkfeatures identifiedin Section 3.3. Specifically, we addthe
meannumberofinteractionpartnersperteammember(InD)and
theaverageamountofeditedforeigncode(FModR)asadditional
variablesin our regression models.
As shown by the 𝑅2values in Table 3c, the regression models

in the productivity observations. We further again find a negative
relationship between team size and productivity for all five opera-
tionalisations.Assumingconstant InD andFModR, theregression
results suggest that by doubling the size of a development team,
we reducethe average productivity ofteam members by between
22%and30%.Notably,ahighermeanindegreeisaccompaniedby
higher productivity. Moreover, the foreign modification ratio has a
strongnegative relationship with productivity.
Adding a quadratic term (TS2) to the model, i.e.,
PROD∼TS+TS2+InD+FModR, (1)
wefindthatcontrarytobefore,thecoefficientofteamsizeremains
negativeandsignificantwhileteamsizesquaredisinsignificant(see
Table3d).Thus,thenon-linearrelationshipbetweenproductivity
and team size found in Table 3b does not persist when accounting
forthemeanindegree and foreign modification ratio.
In conclusion, in a large-scale study using 201 collaborative
GitHubprojects sampled in a systematic and unbiased fashion
acrossdifferentstrataofteamsizes,weconfirmthenegativerela-
tionshipbetweenteamsizeandproductivityfoundbypriorstudies.
Thisnegativerelationshipisrobustagainstthechoiceofproduc-
tivity measure and persists when controlling for the team’s collab-
oration structure. Only considering team size as a predictor, our
data provide some evidence for an optimal team size of 7 or 19
membersfortwooftheeightoperationalisationsofproductivity.
However, for six out of eight productivity measures, the optimal
productivityperteammemberisreachedforateamsizeofone.This
finding is further supported by the fact that the squared team size
has no significant relationship when controlling for other network
measures.
As mentioned above, our results suggest that the mean indegree
ofdevelopers ispositively relatedtoproductivity, whileteam size
is negatively related to productivity. Importantly, the regressionmodels considered so far assume that the effect of the team sizeon productivity is independent of the mean indegree and vice-
versa,i.e.,theireffectispurelyadditive.However,itisreasonable
to assume that the productivity of developers in a team with dense
collaboration structures is more strongly affected by team size,comparedtoateamwhereeachdevelopercollaborates,onaverage,
with few other team members. This motivates a last experiment,
where we includean interaction term that capturesthe combined
effect of team size and mean indegree as an additional variable:
PROD∼TS+InD+TS×InD+FModR (2)
The results in Table 3e suggest a negative coefficient for this inter-
action term. However, the effect is only significant for Comms and
NLOC.The analysisof the marginal effect of the mean indegree on
the relationship between team size and productivity is shown in
Figure4b.Inlinewiththepositivecoefficientofthemeanindegree,
wefindthatdevelopersinteamswithlargermeanindegreetendto
bemoreproductiveonaverage,i.e.linescorrespondingtolarger
meanindegreestendtohavelargerintercepts(butnegativeslopes).
Moreover,asshownbythenegativecoefficientoftheinteraction
term,thenegativeeffectofteamsizeonproductivitygrowswith
the mean indegree, i.e. lines corresponding to larger mean inde-grees tend to have steeper negative slopes. The whisker plot inFigure4cfurtherrevealsapositiverelationshipbetweenthesizeof a team (x-axis) and the mean indegree of developers (y-axis),
i.e. developers in larger teams tend to edit code of a larger number
of other developers. This positive relationship specifically holdsfor smaller team sizes, while the mean indegree in larger teams
withmorethanapproximately50developersissimilar.Importantly,
the fact that (i) developers in larger teams tend to have a higher
indegree and (ii) developers in teams with higher indegree tend to
be more productive does notimply that developers in larger teams
are,onaverage,moreproductive.Thisisconfirmedbythenegative
coefficients of team size in all our regression models as well as the
clearnegative marginal effects shown in Figure 4b.
We note that the positive relationship between team size and
themeanindegreecouldexplainthepositivecoefficientforTSin
Table 3b that suggests the existence of an optimal team size. We
further conjecture that this non-trivial finding could be a reason
why empirical studies that do not account for the distribution of
team sizes in GitHubrepositories, and thus inadvertently focus
onprojectswithsmallteamsize,erroneouslyfindapositiverela-
tionship between team size and productivity. Specifically, projects

withsmallteamsizestendtohaveasmallmeanindegree,which
corresponds to a line with smaller intercept (and negative slope)
in Table 3b. Conversely, teams with larger team sizes tend to have
a larger mean indegree, which corresponds to a line with larger
intercept (and negative slope) in Table 3b. The failure to control
for this effect can lead to a reversal of the relationship between
productivityandteamsize,i.e.,awrong positiveslopefortheeffect
iserroneouslyfound.Thiscanbeviewedasaspecificinstanceof
Simpson’s paradox, where the aggregate effect in a sample that
combines data from different “groups” of projects—i.e., teams with
different mean indegrees—can be positive, even though a negative

Afirstthreattothevalidityofourresultscouldbetheoperationali-
sation of productivity. To guard against this, we have studied eight
different measures that capture different notions of productivity. A
commonissueof productivitymeasures thatare basedon commit
logdataisthattheydonotaccountforthestructureofcontributed
code. To guard against this issue and appropriately value commits
thatdecrease the complexity of code and thus make it more main-tainable, we consider measures that account for tokens, functions,
andcontrol structures.
A second aspect that could potentially influence our results is
the method toassess the size of a softwareteam. We compute the
team size at a given time 𝑡by counting all developers who have
made a commit up to 42 weeks before 𝑡. This approach to infer the
teamsizeisnecessarysincethereisnoformalisednotionofteam
size inGitHub. The specific choice of this time window is based on
theinter-committimedistributionfor GitHubprojectsfoundin[ 3].
Wehavetestedtherobustnessoftheresultsbychoosingadifferent
windowsizeoftwoyears.Duetothecomputationaleffortthatis
due to the recalculation of all network metrics, a comprehensive
study of different window sizes was beyond the scope of our study
butcouldbe an interesting question for future work.
InSection2.1, weidentifiedprojectselectionand dataprepara-
tionasamajorthreattothevalidity.Wethusspentconsiderable
efforttodevelopageneralprojectselectionpipelineaswellasOpen
Source software tools to infer collaboration networks from commit
data. Despite these efforts, there may be remaining issues, such as
thepossibilitytomanuallymodifythehistoryofa gitrepository,
which we can neither detect nor account for. Due to data issues
relatedtosomemergecommits,wewerefurthernotabletoprocess
allcommitsof the Linux Kernel project4. We therefore excluded
thisproject from our analysis.
Addressingtheissueofomittedvariables,ourregressionmodels
explain roughly 50% of the variance in the relationship between
teamsizeandproductivity,which considerablyimproves thevari-
ance explained by prior studies. Nevertheless, there is additional
variance in the relationship that we cannot explain. This could
either be due to the stochastic nature of the underlying process
or the existence of additional variables that are not included in
our models. To address this issue, future studies could additionally
studydatafrom issue trackers and mailing lists [42–44].

6 RELATED WORK
Ourworktouchesonissuesthathavebeenstudiedinempiricalsoft-
wareengineering,computationalsocialscience,networkscience,
and organisational theory. Namely, how we can use repository log
data to quantify productivity in software development, how the
sizeofteamsinfluencestheproductivityofitsmembers,andhow
networkmodelscanbeusedtostudysocialaspectsincollaborativesoftwareprojects.Atameta-level,ourstudyfurtheraddressescom-
monchallengesandpitfallsintheanalysisofbigrepositorydata,
someof which have been previously highlighted in [10–12, 45].
A large body of works has investigated methods to measure
theproductivity of developers based on repository data [ 48,49].
Commit-basedproductivitymeasures calculateproductivitybased
onthenumberofcommits[ 7,50]orpushes[ 8].Whilethisapproach
doesnotrequireadetailedanalysisofthecommittedsourcecode,it
hastheproblemthattheamountofcodechangedwitheachcommit
can vary significantly both within and between projects [ 23]. [26]
found that productivity rankings based on commit-based measures
only show low correlations with rankings obtained from team
leaders.Therefore,morefine-granularmeasuressuchasthenumber
ofmodifiedlinesorthenumberofmodifiedcharacters[ 3]havebeen
proposed. Code-basedproductivitymeasures aimtoovercomethis
limitationbyanalysingthecodecontainedinacommit.Commonly
usedmetricincludethenumberofcodelines[ 5,51–53],function
points [54, 55], or tokens [56] changed per time interval.
Alarge bodyofworks inorganisationaltheory, computational
social science and empirical software engineering have studied the
question of how the size of a team is related to its performance. In
the context of software development, [ 2] argues that the increased
coordination requirements in larger teams lead to a reduction of
developerproductivity.Whilethisproposedmechanismhasbeen
corroboratedbyquantitativestudies[ 3,57],otherworkssuggest
synergisticeffectsthatleadtoanincreaseindeveloperproductivity
as teams grow in size [ 7,8]. The combination of these findings
indicatesthatanoptimalsizeforasoftwaredevelopmentteammay

an optimal team size with respect to productivity is achieved for
nineteammembers.
Utilising a method to construct a network representation of co-
editingrelationsfromthecommit-loghistoryofaproject,ourwork
finallyaddressesquestionsthatreceivedattentionfromthenetwork
science and computational social science community. A number of
works have investigated how the topology of communication, col-
laboration, or coordination networks is related to the performance
[59–61], resilience [ 62,63], or productivity [ 3] of teams in various

to shared code ownership can explain the decrease in productivity
observed for larger teams [3, 4].
7 CONCLUSION
Massive data from software repositories and collaboration tools
provide compelling new opportunities to study social aspects in
softwaredevelopment.Withinthiscontext,thequestionofhowthe
sizeandcollaborationpatternsofsoftwaredevelopmentteamsin-
fluencetheproductivityofdevelopershasemergedasanimportantresearchquestionattheintersectionofcomputationalsocialscience
andempiricalsoftwareengineering.Recentempiricalstudiesusing
big data from software repositories have come to contradictory
answers to this important research question, even though those
studiesused similar data sets and empirical methods.
Addressingcommonchallengesandpitfallsintheanalysisofbig
repository data, our work offers a possible explanation for this dis-
agreementbetweenrecentworksinempiricalsoftwareengineering.
Tothisend,weprovidethe,tothebestofourknowledge,largest,
curated corpus of GitHubprojects that is specifically tailored to
investigatetheinfluenceofteamsizeandcollaborationpatternsonindividualandcollectiveproductivity.Theprojectsincludedinthiscorpusare systematically chosensuchthatweavoidcommonperils
inGitHubmining. We use a stratified sampling that supports unbi-
ased analyses of the impact of team size on developer productivity.
We systematically compare a set of eight code- and commit-based
productivity measures and study which of the measures are likely
to be interchangeable and which capture independent dimensions
ofproductivity.Buildingonamethodtoconstructtime-evolvingco-
editing networks from gitrepositories, we consider eight network
metrics that capture different dimensions of the social organisa-
tion of software teams. We finally use those methods to study the
Ringelmanneffectin collaborativesoftwaredevelopment.Our re-
sultshighlightarobustnegativerelationshipbetweenteamsizeand
developerproductivitythatcanbeexplainedbasedontheteam’s
collaborationstructure.Wearguethatneglectingthehighlyskewed
distribution of team sizes on GitHubcan lead to a reversal of the
relationship between team size and productivity, thus offering a
possible explanation for recent contradictory results.
Apart from this, our work provides several insights that are rel-
evantforthemanagementofsoftwareprojects:Inparticular,we
find(i)anoverallnegativerelationbetweenindividualproductivity
andteamsize,and(ii)anon-linearrelationshipthatgivesriseto
an optimal team size for small teams. These findings can be useful
to define advanced cost estimation models that incorporate the
found non-linear relationship between team size and productivity,
thusprovidingbetterestimatesfortheworkforcerequiredtode-
velop projects with a known (estimated) size of the code base. Our
analysisfurtherhighlightsadditionalfactorsthatinfluenceteam
productivity, such as the amount of foreign code that is edited and
the number of interaction partners of developers. This insight not
only allows us to further improve cost estimation models, it alsopoints to factors that can possibly be optimised by project main-
tainers, e.g., by carefully decomposing the code base into modulesaddressed by different (sub-)teams or by optimising organisational
structures of the development team.
In summary, our work contributes to the ongoing discussion on
how the size and structure of teams influence productivity. Investi-
gatingthecross-correlationsofproductivityandnetworkmetricsinasystematicallyconstructedcorpusofsoftwareprojects,wefurthercontributeavaluablenewresourceforresearchersinempiricalsoft-
wareengineeringandcomputationalsocialscience.Byfocusingon
generic network measures, we further provide the perspective that
our results can generalise beyond empirical software engineering.
Highlighting pitfalls in the analysis of big data, our work finally
demonstratesthattheuseofbiggerdatasetsdoesnotautomatically
lead to more reliable insights.
