ABSTRACT
According to the World Health Organization(WHO), it is estimated
thatapproximately1.3billionpeoplelivewithsomeformsofvision
impairment globally, of whom 36 million are blind. Due to their
disability, engaging these minority into the society is a challenging
problem. The recent rise of smart mobile phones provides a new
solution by enabling blind users’ convenient access to the infor-
mation and service for understanding the world. Users with vision
impairmentcanadoptthescreenreaderembeddedinthemobileoperating systems to read the content of each screen within theapp, and use gestures to interact with the phone. However, the
prerequisite of using screen readers is that developers have to add
natural-language labels to the image-based components when they
aredevelopingtheapp.Unfortunately,morethan77%appshaveissues of missing labels, according to our analysis of 10,408 An-
droidapps.Mostoftheseissuesarecausedbydevelopers’lackof
awareness and knowledge in considering the minority. And even if
developers want to add the labels to UI components, they may not
come up with concise and clear description as most of them are of
no visual issues. To overcome these challenges, we develop a deep-
learning based model, called LabelDroid, to automatically predict
thelabelsofimage-basedbuttonsbylearningfromlarge-scalecom-
mercialapps inGooglePlay.Theexperimentalresultsshowthat

1 INTRODUCTION
GivenmillionsofmobileappsinGooglePlay[ 11]andAppstore[ 8],
the smart phones are playing increasingly important roles in daily
life.Theyareconvenientlyusedtoaccessawidevarietyofservices
such as reading, shopping, chatting, etc. Unfortunately, many apps
remain difficult or impossible to access for people with disabili-
ties. For example, a well-designed user interface (UI) in Figure 1
oftenhaselementsthatdon’trequireanexplicitlabeltoindicate
their purpose to the user. A checkbox next to an item in a task
list application has a fairly obvious purpose for normal users, asdoes a trash can in a file manager application. However, to users
withvisionimpairment,especially fortheblind,otherUIcuesare
needed. According to the World Health Organization(WHO) [ 4], it
isestimatedthatapproximately1.3billionpeoplelivewithsome
formofvisionimpairmentglobally,ofwhom36millionareblind.

5.2 Model Implementation
We use ResNet-101 architecture [ 46] pretrained on MS COCO
dataset [57] as our CNN module. As you can see in the leftmost
ofFigure6,itconsistsofaconvolutionlayer,amaxpoolinglayer,
four types of blocks with different numbers of block (denoted indifferent colors). Each type of block is comprised of three convo-
lutionallayerswithdifferentsettingsandimplementsanidentity
shortcut connection which is the core idea of ResNet. Instead of
approximating the target output of current block, it approximates
the residual between current input and target output, and then the
target output can be computed by adding the predicted residual
andtheoriginalinputvector.Thistechniquenotonlysimplifiesthe

For transformer encoder-decoder, we take 𝑁=3,𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑 =512,
𝑑𝑘=𝑑𝑣=𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 =64,𝑑𝑓𝑓=2048,ℎ=8andthevocabularysize
as 633. We train the CNN and the encoder-decoder model in anend-to-end manner using KL divergence loss [
53]. We use Adam

WeevaluateourLabelDroidinthreeaspects,i.e.,accuracywith
automated testing, generality and usefulness with user study.
6.1 Evaluation Metric
Toevaluatetheperformanceofourmodel,weadoptfivewidely-
used evaluation metrics including exact match, BLEU [ 62], ME-
TEOR [26], ROUGE [ 56], CIDEr [ 69] inspired by related works
about image captioning. The first metric we use is exact match
rate,i.e.,thepercentageoftestingpairswhosepredictedcontentdescription exactly matches the ground truth. Exact match is a
binarymetric,i.e.,0ifanydifference,otherwise1.Itcannottellthe
extent to which a generated content description differs from theground-truth.Forexample,thegroundtruthcontentdescription
maycontain4words,butnomatteroneor4differencesbetween
thepredictionandgroundtruth,exactmatchwillregardthemas
0. Therefore, we also adopt other metrics. BLEU is an automaticevaluation metric widely used in machine translation studies. Itcalculates the similarity of machine-generated translations andhuman-created reference translations (i.e., ground truth). BLEU
isdefinedastheproductof 𝑛-gramprecisionandbrevitypenalty.
As most content descriptions for image-based buttons are short,
we measure BLEU value by setting 𝑛as 1, 2, 3, 4, represented as
BLEU@1, BLEU@2, BLEU@3, BLEU@4.
METEOR[ 26](MetricforEvaluationofTranslationwithExplicit
ORdering)isanothermetricusedformachinetranslationevalua-
tion.ItisproposedtofixsomedisadvantagesofBLEUwhichignores
theexistenceofsynonymsandrecallratio.ROUGE(Recall-Oriented
Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) [ 56] is a set of metric based on
recallrate,andweuseROUGE-L,whichcalculatesthesimilaritybetween predicted sentence and reference based on the longestcommon subsequence (short for LCS). CIDEr (Consensus-BasedImage Description Evaluation) [
69] uses term frequency inverse
documentfrequency(tf-idf)[ 64]tocalculatetheweightsinrefer-
ence sentence 𝑠𝑖𝑗for different n-gram 𝑤𝑘because it is intuitive to
believethatararen-gramswouldcontainmoreinformationthana
commonone.WeuseCIDEr-D,whichadditionallyimplementsalength-basedgaussianpenaltyandismorerobusttogaming.We
then divide CIDEr-D by 10 to normalize the score into the range
between 0 and 1. We still refer CIDEr-D/10 to CIDEr for brevity.
All of these metrics give a real value with range [0,1] and are
usually expressed as a percentage. The higher the metric score, the
moresimilarthemachine-generatedcontentdescriptionistothe
ground truth. If the predicted results exactly match the groundtruth, the score of these metrics is 1 (100%). We compute these
metrics using coco-caption code [39].
6.2 Baselines
We set up two state-of-the-art methods which are widely used for
image captioning as the baselines to compare with our contentdescription generation method. The first baseline is to adopt the

Tounderstandthesignificanceofthedifferencesbetweenfour
kindsofcontentdescription,wecarryouttheWilcoxonsigned-rank
test [74] between the scores of our model and each annotator and
between the scores of any two annotators. It is the non-parametric
version of the paired T-test and widely used to evaluate the differ-
ence between two related paired sample from the same probability
distribution. The test resultssuggest that the generated labels from
our model are significantlybetter than that of developers ( 𝑝-value
<0.01 for A1, A2, and <0.05 for A3)6.
For some buttons, the evaluator gives very low acceptability
scoreto thelabelsfrom developers.According toourobservation,
we summarise four reasons accounting for those bad cases and
give some examples in Table 7. (1) Some developers are prone to
write long labels for image-based buttons like the developer A1.
Although the long label can fully describe the button (E1, E2), it is
too verbose for blind users especially when there are many image-
based buttons within one page. (2) Some developers give too short
labelswhichmaynotbeinformativeenoughforusers.Forexample,
A2 and A3 annotate the “add to favorite” button as “like” (E2).
Since this button will trigger an additional action (add this song to
favoritelist),“like”couldnotexpressthismeaning.Thesamereason

which may confuse users. For example, A2 and A3 annotate “play
thelastsong”or“last”to“previoussong”button(E4)whichmay
misleadusersthatclickingthisbuttonwillcometothefinalsong

We also receive some informal feedback from the developers
and the evaluator. Some developers mention that one image-based
buttonmayhavedifferentlabelsindifferentcontext,buttheyare
not very sure if the created labels from them are suitable or not.

7 RELATED WORK
Mobile devices are ubiquitous, and mobile apps are widely usedfor different tasks in people’s daily life. Consequently, there are
manyresearchworksforensuringthequalityofmobileapps[ 29,
43,47]. Most of them are investigating the apps’ functional and
non-functional properties like compatibility [ 73], performance [ 58,
81], energy-efficiency [ 24,25], GUI design [ 31,36], GUI animation
linting[80],localization[ 72]andprivacyandsecurity[ 37,38,40,
331Unblind Your Apps: Predicting Natural-Language Labels for Mobile GUI Components by Deep Learning ICSE ’20, May 23–29, 2020, Seoul, Republic of Korea
42,76]. However, few of them are studying the accessibility issues,
especiallyforuserswithvisionimpairmentwhichisfocusedinour
work.
7.1 App Accessibility Guideline
Google and Apple are the primary organizations that facilitate
mobiletechnologyandtheappmarketplacebyAndroidandIOS
platforms.Withtheawarenessoftheneedtocreatemoreaccessibleapps,bothofthemhavereleaseddeveloperanddesignerguidelines
for accessibility [ 6,15] which include not only the accessibility
designprinciples, butalso thedocumentsfor usingassistive tech-
nologies embedding in the operating system [ 15], and testing tools
or suits for ensuring the app accessibility. The World Wide Web
Consortium(W3C)hasreleasedtheirwebaccessibilityguideline
long time ago [ 21] And now they are working towards adapting
theirwebaccessibilityguideline[ 21]byaddingmobilecharacter-
istics into mobile platforms. Although it is highly encouraged to
followtheseguidelines,theyareoftenignoredbydevelopers.Differ-
ent from these guidelines, our work is specific to users with vision
impairmentandpredictsthelabelduringthedevelopingprocess
without requiring developers to fully understand long guidelines.
7.2 App Accessibility Studies for Blind Users
Many works in Human-Computer Interactionarea have explored
the accessibility issues of small-scale mobile apps [ 63,75] in differ-
ent categories such as in health [ 71], smart cities [ 60] and govern-
mentengagement[ 50].Althoughtheyexploredifferentaccessibility
issues, the lack of descriptions for image-based components has
beencommonlyexplicitlynotedasasignificantprobleminthese
works. Park et al [ 63] rated the severity of errors as well as fre-
quency, and missing labels is rated as the highest severity of tenkinds of accessibility issues. Kane et al [
49] carry out a study of
mobiledeviceadoptionandaccessibilityforpeoplewithvisualand
motor disabilities. Ross et al [ 66] examine the image-based button
labeling in a relative large-scale android apps, and they specify
some common labeling issues within the app. Different from their
works, our study includes not only the largest-scale analysis of
image-basedbuttonlabelingissues,butalsoasolutionforsolving
those issues by a model to predict the label of the image.
There are also some works targeting at locating and solving the
accessibility issues, especially for users with vision impairment.
Eleretal[ 41]developanautomatedtestgenerationmodeltody-
namicallytestthemobileapps.Zhangetal[ 78]leveragethecrowd
sourcemethodtoannotatetheGUIelementwithouttheoriginal
content description. For other accessibility issues, they further de-
velop an approach to deploy the interaction proxies for runtime
repair and enhancement of mobile application accessibility [ 77]
withoutreferringtothesourcecode.Althoughtheseworkscanalso
helpensurethequalityofmobileaccessibility,theystillneedmucheffortfromdevelopers.Instead,themodelproposedinourworkcan
automaticallyrecommendthelabelforimage-basedcomponents
and developers can directly use it or modify it for their own apps.
7.3 App Accessibility Testing Tools
It is also worth mentioning some related non-academic projects.
There are mainly two strategies for testing app accessibility (forusers with vision impairment) such as manual testing, and auto-mated testing with analysis tools. First, for manual testing, the
developerscanusethebuilt-inscreenreaders(e.g.,TalkBack[ 12]
for Android, VoiceOver [ 20] for IOS) to interact with their Android
device without seeing the screen. During that process, developers
can find out if the spoken feedback for each element conveys its
purpose.Similarly,theAccessibilityScannerapp[ 5]scansthespec-
ifiedscreenandprovidessuggestionstoimprovetheaccessibility
ofyourappincludingcontentlabels,clickableitems,colorcontrast,
etc. The shortcoming of this tool is that the developers must run it
ineachscreenoftheapptogettheresults.Suchmanualexplorationoftheapplicationmightnotscaleforlargerappsorfrequenttesting,
anddevelopersmaymisssomefunctionalitiesorelementsduring
the manual testing.
Second,developerscanalsoautomateaccessibilitytasksbyre-
sortingtestingframeworkslikeAndroidLint,EspressoandRobolec-tric,etc.TheAndroidLint[
1]isastatictoolforcheckingallfilesof
an Android project, showing lint warnings for various accessibility
issuesincludingmissingcontentdescriptionsandprovidinglinks
totheplacesinthesourcecodecontainingtheseissues.Apartfrom
the static-analysis tools, there are also testing frameworks such as
Espresso [ 10] and Robolectric [ 18] which can also check accessi-
bilityissuesdynamicallyduringthetestingexecution.Andthere
are counterparts for IOS apps like Earl-Grey [ 9] and KIF [ 16]. Note
thatallofthesetoolsarebasedonofficialtestingframework.For
example, Espresso, Robolectric and Accessibility Scanner are based
on Android’s Accessibility Testing Framework [7].
Although all of these tools are beneficial for the accessibility
testing,therearestillthreeproblemswiththem.First,itrequires
developers’ well awareness or knowledge of those tools, and un-
derstanding the necessity of accessibility testing. Second, all these
testing are reactive to existing accessibility issues which may have
alreadyharmedtheusersoftheappbeforeissuesfixed.Inadditiontothesereactivetesting,wealsoneedamoreproactivemechanism
ofaccessibilityassurancewhichcouldautomaticallypredictsthe
contentlabelingandreminds thedeveloperstofillthem intothe
app.Thegoalofourworkistodevelopaproactivecontentlabeling
model which can complement the reactive testing mechanism.
8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
More than 77% apps have at least one image-based button without
natural-language label which can be read for users with vision im-
pairment. Considering that most app designers and developers are
of no vision issues, they may not understand how to write suitable
labels.Toovercomethisproblem,weproposeadeeplearningmodel
based on CNN and transformer encoder-decoder for learning to
predict the label of given image-based buttons.
We hope thatthis work caninvoking the communityattention
inappaccessibility.Inthefuture,wewillfirstimproveourmodel
for achieving better quality by taking the app metadata into the
consideration.Second,wewillalsotrytotestthequalityofexisting
labels by checking if the description is concise and informative.
