ABSTRACT
Cannabis is one of the most common mind-altering substances.
It is used both medicinally and recreationally and is enmeshedin a complex and changing legal landscape. Anecdotal evidencesuggests that some software developers may use cannabis to aid
some programming tasks. At the same time, anti-drug policies and
tests remain common in many software engineering environments,
sometimes leading to hiring shortages for certain jobs. Despite
these connections, little is actually known about the prevalence of,
and motivation for, cannabis use while programming. In this paper,
we report the results of the first large-scale survey of cannabis
use by programmers. We report findings about 803 developers’ (in-
cluding450 full-timeprogrammers’)cannabis usage prevalence ,
perceptions , andmotivations . For example, we find that some
programmers doregularlyusecannabiswhileprogramming:35%of
oursamplehastriedprogrammingwhileusingcannabis,and18%
currentlydosoatleastonceamonth.Furthermore,thiscannabis
usageisprimarilymotivatedbyaperceivedenhancementtocer-
tain software development skills (such as brainstorming or getting
intoaprogrammingzone)ratherthan medicinal reasons(suchas
pain relief). Finally, we find that cannabis use while programming
occurs at similar rates for programming employees, managers, and
studentsdespitedifferencesincannabisperceptionsandvisibility.

Globally, cannabis legality is changing rapidly, with many coun-
tries(e.g.,theUnitedKingdom,Colombia,andMalawi)legalizing
medical cannabis, and a subset (e.g., Uruguay, Mexico, and Canada)
alsolegalizingcannabisforrecreationaladultuse.1IntheUS,for
example,medicalcannabisisallowedin36states,and17stateshave
legalized cannabis2for adult use despite its federal classification as
aScheduleIdrug,whichcriminalizescannabisanddefinesitashav-
ing no accepted therapeutic value and a high abuse potential [ 47].
This classification has hampered research on its therapeutic ef-
fects[47],andprohibitioniscontrarytopopularopinion:91%of
Americans believe cannabis should be legal for medical or recre-
ationalpurposes[ 56].Similarly,81%ofAmericansbelievecannabis

16% and 11% cited improved creativity and focus, respectively.
Despite legal concerns, anecdotes of cannabis use intersect-
ingwithsoftwareengineeringabound.Questionsinquiringabout
cannabis’s effects on programmingare common on online forums
such as Reddit,3Quora,4Hacker News,5and Dev,6often inspiring
numerous conflicting answers. Similarly, popular tech-related me-

medical cannabis policy[ 28]. Insoftware engineering workplaces,
drug tests remain common: we find that 29% of programmers have
taken a drug test for a programming-related job (see Section 5.1).
This prohibition of cannabis use in software engineering has
contributed to a widely-reported hiring shortage for certain US
governmentprogrammingjobs[ 14,34,42].In2014,afterstruggling
to meet hiring goals, then-director of the American Federal Bureau
ofInvestigationJamesComeystatedthatwhilehehad“tohirea
greatworkforcetocompetewith...cybercriminals[,]...someof
those kids want to smoke weed on the way to the interview”, a
behavior counter to the FBI’s current policy that “prohibits anyone
working for it who has used cannabis in the past three years” [ 34].
Despite such evidence highlighting the intersection of cannabis
and programming, little empirical research has been conducted on
cannabis use in software development. To our knowledge, previ-
ous related publications either combine cannabis use with other
illegal substances such as cocaine [ 32], show data about computer
scientists as a sub-population in a much larger survey [ 45], and/or
includeprogrammingonlyaspartofamuchbroadersectorsuch
as engineering or business services [ 45]. These previous studies do
not sufficiently investigate the intersection of cannabis and pro-gramming for several reasons. First, substances such as cocaine

are usedfor different reasons: groupingsuch disparate substances
may result in ineffective blanket drug policies and misleading con-
clusions.Second,studiesthatgroupjobsbysectoroftenfocuson
physicalconsequencesofcannabisusage(e.g.,impairmentwhile
operating a machine) that are less relevant to software (where our
participantsplacemoreofafocuson,e.g.,creativity).Thus,itre-

large-scale empirical survey of cannabis use in software engineer-
ing, reporting data from 803 programmers, including 450 full-time
developers (via an online, anonymized and confidential survey):
•We find that some developers (18% of our sample) use cannabis
while programming at least once a month, with many even
choosing to use it for work-related tasks.
•Wefindthatcannabisusewhileprogrammingismorecommonlymotivatedbyperceivedprogramming-relatedskillenhancement

enhance creativity or cognitive performance [1, 21].
•We find that cannabis use while programming occurs at simi-

despite differences in perception of cannabis approval level and
cannabis visibility between the three groups.

GeneralCannabisBackground —Inthepastcentury,cannabis
legalityhasshifteddramaticallyintheUS.Whilemanycannabis
preparationswere listedin theUS pharmacopoeiain theearly 20th
century, cannabis was officially criminalized under the Controlled
Substances Act in 1970. Since 1996, however, 36 states have le-galized cannabis for medical purposes, and 17 for adult use. Thepolicy whiplash has been largely driven by politics and popular
opinion rather than science, with the re-emergence of cannabis oc-
curring partially due to: 1) acknowledgement of the cruel excesses
and ineffectiveness of the War on Drugs [ 20,64]; 2) increasing
acknowledgement of cannabis’s therapeutic benefits [ 47]; and 3)
theongoingopioidcrisis,whichhasdrivenhometheneedforal-
ternative, less harmful pain medicines [ 15]. In conjunction with
liberalizingpolicies,past-yearcannabisusehasincreasedamong
Americans 12 or older: 11% in 2002 to 17.5% in 2019 [26].
Cannabis is used for many reasons, including medical (e.g., pain,
nausea) and recreational (e.g., social or perceptual enhancement,
alteredconsciousness)purposes[ 9,41].Thiswidevarietyofuses
is enabled by the pharmacopeia of compounds in cannabis, which
includemorethan100activecannabis-derivedcompounds(cannabi-
noids) such as cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC)aswellasterpenesandflavanoids,whichareresponsiblefor
tasteandodor[ 47].Themostcommonmedicalreasonforcannabis
useischronicpain,demonstratedbypatientsurveys[ 3,51]andreg-
istrydataformedicalcannabispatients[ 7].Withinbroadcategories
of medical vs. recreational use, however, there is subtle shading of
motivations.Lee etal.developedthecomprehensivemarijuanamo-
tivesquestionnaire,inwhichtheyidentifiedfactorsassociatedwith
cannabis use, including enjoyment, coping, experimentation, al-
tered perception, sleep/rest, and availability [ 41]. These factors are
quite broad, and may encompass recreational, medical or other use
patterns such as for creative work or performance enhancement.
Cannabis and Programming —Within this complex environ-
ment, cannabis interacts with software development. For instance,
cannabis use in Silicon Valley appears to be high, with area dispen-
saries reporting that around 40% of their clientele are tech work-
ers [59]. Similarly,a qualitativestudy of codingbootcamps identi-
fied “lots and lots of [weed]” as one key element of support [11].
Nopreviousempiricalstudieshavedirectlyinvestigatedtheinter-
section of software and cannabis. Reports either combine cannabis
with other illegal substances or include programmers only as a
sub-population[ 32,45].Forinstance,onestudyhasatableofthe
percentageofworkersinvariousfieldsreportingillegaldruguse[ 32,
Tab 3.5, p. 26]. Programmers appear in the table, with 10.4% report-
ing usage in the last y ear. However, this is the only mention of
programmers, cannabis is not separated from other drugs, and the
dataisfromtheearly 1990s,wellbeforecannabiswaslegalizedin
numerousstates.Thus,questionsofcannabisprevalence,usagemo-
tivations, and culture in software engineering remain unanswered.

However, cannabis use has been studied in the context of cre-
ative problem solving, a key component of many software engi-
neeringtasks[ 23,24,43].Generally,cannabisisseenasacreativity
enhancer: in one study, 54% of participants believed it increased
their creativity [ 22]. Similarly, Steve Jobs, who was regularly us-
ing cannabis when he founded Apple, stated that “the best way
[he]woulddescribetheeffectofthemarijuana ...isthatitwould
make[him]relaxedandcreative”[ 66].Fromacognitiveperspec-
tive, the link between creativity and cannabis use is more tenuous.
LaFrance etal.foundthat cannabis userswere morecreative than
non-cannabisusers,however,thisdifferencemaybeexplainedby
underlying personality [ 39]. On the other hand, Kowal et al.found
that highly potent cannabis can actually impairdivergent thought,
a type of creative thinking [ 37]. These conflicting results linking
cannabis and creative problem solving may motivate future obser-
vational studies of cannabis and programming.
Apartfromcreativity,cannabishasarangeofothercognitiveef-
fectswhichcouldimpactsoftwaredevelopment;long-termcannabis
use can impair memory and attention control [ 38]. However, even
forgeneralcognitiveeffects,thecurrentscientificliteratureisoften
insufficient; evidence regarding cannabis’s long-term effects on
skills used in software engineering such as decision making, motor
ability,andworkingmemoryisinconsistent(seeKroon etal.[38]
for a review of the current research on cannabis and cognition).

early PC and internet developers as a source of innovation and
creativity[ 61],aphenomenonlikelyconnectedto1960scountercul-

3.1 Survey Construction
Our survey included questions on demographics, programming
background,cannabis attitudes,and cannabisusage. Forcannabis
sections, we asked questions about cannabis in general and in
relationtoprogramming.Weemployeddisplaylogicasappropriate
tominimizeexposuretoirrelevantquestions.Whenpossible,we
based questionson previous studies aboutcannabis [18, 26,56]o r
software development [55] to allow comparisons with prior work.
Demographics –Querying age, gender, and employment sta-
tus, our demographics questions were adapted from those askedby Boehnke et al.in their recent survey of cannabidiol use for fi-
bromyalgia[ 6].Tohelpensureparticipantsafety,wedid notcollect
identifying information such as names or IP addresses. As a result,
we included additional validity checks as described in Section 3.3.
Programming background –Participants reported how long
they had programmed, their programming education, and their
programming-related job history. We also asked participants with
programmingjobsiftheyself-identifiedasamanager,andweaskedparticipantstoindicatehowoftentheyconductedvarioussoftware-
engineering related tasks such as brainstorming and requirements
elicitation, adapted from those used by Tilley et al.[55,S ec .2 ] .
Cannabis attitudes —We asked questions regarding attitudes
toward cannabis, both in general and also in programming-specific
contexts. To gauge general cannabis attitudes, we asked questions
aboutcannabislegalizationandperceivedriskdrawnfromprevi-
ous American national surveys from the Pew Research center [ 56]
and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health [ 13,26]. For
programming-specific cannabis attitudes, we adapted questionspreviously used to assess cannabis attitudes or perceptions from
othercontexts,e.g.,fromastudyofhighschoolseniors’disapproval
about individuals carrying out cannabis-related activities [2].
Cannabis usage –We asked questions regarding general and
programming-specificcannabisuse.For generalcannabisuse,w e
asked questions from the Daily Sessions, Frequency, Age of Onset,
and Quantity of Cannabis Use Inventory (DFAQ-CU) [ 18], a vali-
datedmeasureofcannabisusebehaviorandhistory.Weincluded
questionsthatquantifycurrentusefrequency,pastperiodsofheavy
use, medicinal vs. recreational cannabis, and the percentage of the
timeparticipantsusecannabisproductswithTHC(seeSection 2).
We also asked how COVID-19 affected cannabis usage patterns. To
measure cannabis use while programming, we adapted questions
fromtheDFAQ-CU,addingthephrase“whileprogramming,coding,
orcompletinganyothersoftwareengineering-relatedtask?”.We
also asked for which types of programming projects or tasks are

their motivation(s) for using cannabis with choices reflecting those
we observed in anecdotal online posts as well as a free text option.
3.2 Ethical Considerations
IntheUS(thesourceofourpopulation),cannabisremainsillegal
at a federal level and in many states, so use can result in fines or
incarceration. Further, cannabis is often explicitly prohibited by
corporate policy, potentially resulting in employee termination. As
such, weworked closely withour IRB tominimize legal risksand
ensureparticipantsfeltcomfortableansweringhonestly.First,we
madeoursurveyanonymousandconfidential:wedidnotcollect
namesorIPaddresses,eventhoughdoingsonecessitatesadditionaldata-qualitychecks.Second,allparticipantsgaveinformedconsent,
and all questions were optional. Third, we focused our recruitment
of professional developers on open source projects rather than
through softwareengineering companycontacts to avoidthe risk
ofworkplaceretaliationorcoercion.Fourth,wecollectedemails
for our optional incentive on a separate platform where they could
not be connected back to survey responses. Finally, we are un-
abletopublishourfulldataset:althoughanonymous,itcontains
demographic data which may inadvertently identify participants.
3.3 Survey Distribution
Surveyplatform —When choosing a survey platform, we wanted
toensurethedatawecollectedwasanonymousandconfidential
while also providing data quality assurance. Through consultation
withourIRB,weusedtheQualtricsXMPlatformwhichenabled
anonymousandconfidentialcollectionaswellasdata-qualityop-
tions such as preventing multiple submissions and bot detection.
As mentioned in Section 3, we scoped this initial study of
cannabis use and programming to United-States-based develop-
ersduetothehighvarianceofcannabislawsandculturesworld-
wide.Allrecruitmentmaterialsstatedthatthesurveywasoptional,
anonymous, and confidential. To help mitigate participant self-
selectionbias,wealsomadeitclearthatpriorcannabisusewasnot
required to participate. Finally, survey participation was encour-
aged through an optional drawing for one of five $100 awards. All
data was collected between March 31 and May 2, 2021.
Survey recruitment —To encourage diverse responses, we re-
cruited from several populations: open-source GitHub developers,
current and former computing students at the a large public uni-
versity, and social media users.
For participants recruited from GitHub, we used GitHub’s REST
API to obtain the top 1000 developers and top 100 repositories
associatedwitheachof25“popular”programminglanguages(as
identified in the GitHub interface) and 8 additional common lan-
guages such as MATLAB and R. For each repository, we pulled the
profiles of the top 25 contributors. We filtered for profiles with apublicemail,resultingin31,259potentials.Usingregularexpres-sions and manual review, we identified 7,372 with a US location.Eliminating an additional 1,613 using DNS verification, we sent
5,759emails,ofwhich36failed,andreceived440validresponses(7.7%), a rate similar to previous studies of open-source develop-
ers [29,53]. This use of GitHub profiles for research is permitted
by the terms of service.8

a mix of more senior CS undergraduates and young industrial
developersratherthanonlycurrentstudents.WealsoemailedCS
graduatestudentsfor56responses.Finally,wepostedthesurvey
on Twitter, yielding 24 responses. While our study is not a random
sample, we note that convenience samples are common in the
cannabis and hidden populations literature [46] (see Section 7).
Survey data validation —In total, 1045 participants started our
survey. To ensure we analyzed only high-quality data, we imple-
mented several post-collection checks. First, 236 partial responses
were removed. While participants could skip individual questions
duetothesensitivityofthesurveytopic,validresponsesmusthave
answeredatleast:1)iftheyhadprogrammed;2)iftheyhadused
cannabis, and; 3) if they had used cannabis while programming.
To mitigate rushing through the survey, we removed responses
completed faster than 1.5 standard deviations below the median.
Finally, we checked for consistency between reported age, years of
programmingexperience,professionalprogrammingexperience,
andcannabisuse.Combined,ourcompletiontimethresholdand
consistency checks eliminated 6 participants, leaving 803 valid par-
ticipants for analysis.

engineeranddeveloper(30%and34%ofoursamplerespectively),a
significant number of participants identified as a systems engineer,
computer science researcher, computer science instructor, data sci-
entist, project manager, or information technician (between 2–10%
of our sample for each).9This wide array of jobs indicates that our
sample contains a diverse sample of programmers in various fields.
9Participants could select multiple job titles. We do note that 27 respondents (around
3% of our sample) self-reported as only CS Instructors. As suggested by our reviewers,
we conducted an additional sub-population analysis removing these participants from

5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS
We organize our analysis around the following questions:
•RQ1—Usage: Do programmers use cannabis while program-
ming? If so, how often?
•RQ2—Context: In what contexts do programmers use cannabis?
•RQ3—Motivation: Why do programmers use cannabis?
•RQ4—Perception: Howdoopinionsofprogrammingcannabis
use vary between managers, employees, and students?
Statistical Methods— Our analysis was conducted in a Python
Jupyter Notebook using Pandas[63]. For our statistical analyses,
weprimarilyused SciPy[60]and Statsmodels [52].Whentesting
the significance of a difference between continuous variables (e.g.,
age) or Likert scores (e.g., 5-point scale) of two independent sub-populations, we use the Student’s
𝑡-test. While Likert scores are
ordered categorical variables, previous research shows that withlarge samples, parametric tests are sufficiently robust for analyz-
ingLikertdataeventhoughitisordinalandnormalitycannotbe
assumed [ 48]. Thus, theStudent’s 𝑡-test isbest statistical practice.
For testing the significance of a difference between two binary
variables, we use the 𝑛-1𝜒2-test (i.e., the proportions 𝑧-test) [12].
We consider results significant if 𝑝<0.05. As this is a large
surveystudy,weinvestigatemultipleresearchquestionsandcon-
ductmultiplestatisticaltests.Toavoidfishingand 𝑝-hacking,we

5.1 RQ1: Cannabis Usage While Programming
Wefirstinvestigateifandhowoftenprogrammersinoursample
use cannabis while coding. We analyze usage trends in our sample
overall and by gender, age, and recruitment pool.
Overall cannabis usage while programming —Overall, we
findthat35%(280/803)ofourparticipantshavetriedcannabiswhile
programming or completing another software engineering-related
task,approximatelyhalfofthosewhotriedcannabisingeneral(69%
=557/803).Ofthosethathaveusedcannabiswhileprogramming,
73%(205/280,26%ofourpopulationoverall)usedcannabiswhile
programming in the last year. While not a perfect comparison, we
observehighercannabisusethanthatinrecentnationalsurveys:
35% of Americans ages 18–25 and 15% of those 26 and older report
usingcannabis inthe lastyear[ 26]compared to54%of oursample.
However, considering our population (and open source developers
in general) skews young and male, higher reported use is expected.
Cannabisusagefrequency —Wealsoinvestigate howoften par-
ticipants currently use cannabis while programming. In the last
year, 53% (147/280, 18% of our full sample) reported using cannabis
while programming at least 12 times (monthly). Furthermore, 27%
(76/280)reportedusingwhileprogrammingatleasttwiceaweek

longer term: 46% of our sample of cannabis-using programmers
(128/280)alsoreportthattheyhave,atapointinthepast,regularly
used cannabis while programming (2 or more times per month for
at least one six-month span). Our results regarding cannabis use
frequency while programming are visualized in Figure 1.Thesefindingsgivethefirstformalinsightintotheprevalence
of cannabis in programming communities, and have important im-
plications for drug tests in software engineering. Urine-based drug
testsdetectcannabisupto30daysafteruse[ 25],muchlongerthan
the interval between cannabis sessions reported by many develop-
ers.Additionally,programmers’cannabisproductstypicallycontain
THC, the compound detected by most drug tests [ 25]: on average,
developersreported that87% oftheir cannabishad THC, withthe
median reporting 100% of products included the compound. Simul-
taneously,wefoundthatdrugtestsremaincommonforsoftware:
29% of our sample reported that they had taken a drug test for aprogramming-related job. Thus, cannabis-using developers may
avoid applying to jobs with drug tests, limiting application pools.
Cannabis use demographic context—We further contextual-
ize our results by investigating variance by gender, age, and re-
cruitment pool. Regarding gender, we do not observe a significantdifference between men and women in the percent of participants
whohavetriedcannabis(70%vs.69%, 𝑝=0.87).However,wedo
findthatmenaremorelikelythanwomentohavetriedcannabis
while programming (36% vs. 25%, 𝑝<0.0001). This aligns with
surveys of general populations not limited to programmers which
findthatmenusecannabismorefrequentlythanwomen[ 17].Even
though our sample size is smaller, we also observe that non-binary
andtransgenderparticipants(notbrokendowninTable 1forspace)
are significantly more likely to have tried cannabis while program-
ming (57% vs. 34%, 𝑝=0.01) than the rest of the population.
We also find a small but significant positive correlation between
age and current frequency of cannabis use while programming
(𝑟=0.21,𝑝=0.003):10ofthosewhocurrentlyusecannabiswhile
programming,olderprogrammerstendtouseitslightlymoreoften.
Whenplottingthiscorrelation,weobservethebulkofthisincrease

5.2 RQ2: Cannabis Use Programming Context
We now investigate in what programming-related contexts pro-
grammers use cannabis, including both high-level project qualities
(e.g., personal projects vs. work-related projects) and also software-
engineering task types (e.g., refactoring, debugging, or require-
ments elicitation). We also analyze the impact of remote work.
In which programming contexts is cannabis used? —We
firstinvestigatewhichprogrammingprojecttypes(e.g.,personal
or work projects) developers are most likely to choose to complete
whileusingcannabis.WeprovideourfullresultsinTable 2,butwe
emphasize our result that 95 participants (34% of cannabis usingprogrammers and 12% of our population overall) sometimes use
cannabis for work-related tasks. While we anticipated our finding
thatpersonalprogrammingprojectswouldbethemostcommon
projecttypecompletedwhileusingcannabis,wehypothesizedthat
the percentage using cannabis for work-related projects wouldbe lower than observed. This indicates that cannabis routinelyinteracts with professional software engineering environments,underlining the potential impact of corporate drug policies and
motivating future studies of cannabis in software-engineering.
Forwhichsoftwaretasksdoprogrammersusecannabis? —
We now investigate how likely participants are to use cannabis
while completing common software engineering tasks adapted
fromTilley etal.[55].OurfullresultsareinFigure 2:programmers
reportedahigherlikelihoodofusingcannabiswhilebrainstorming
or prototyping and a lower likelihood of using cannabis whileperforming quality assurance, requirements elicitation, or tasks
with animminent deadline.These results indicatethat developers
mayself-regulatecannabisuseforwhenitismostbeneficial(i.e.,
for creative, open-ended tasks) while avoiding use for time- or
safety-criticaltasks.Wenotethatparticipantswhoareunableto
self-regulate cannabis use (e.g., are dependant on cannabis) maybe unlikely to admit so in our survey. Even so, our results call
intoquestiontheusefulnessofblanketanti-cannabispolicies.We
investigate the motivations of these choices further in Section 5.3.
Cannabis use and remote work —Many developers work re-
motely. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic was ongoing during recruit-
ment.Wefindthat52%(145/280)ofcannabis-usingprogrammers

ming cannabis use since the onset of COVID-19 compared to only

withotherpopulationssuchasmedicinalcannabisusers[ 8].This
indicates that workplace culture, environment, and policies can
tangibly effect the frequency of cannabis use while programming.
Developers most commonly choose to use cannabis during
personalprogrammingprojects(63%).However,overathird
of cannabis-using programmers also sometimes choose to usecannabis during work-related tasks, use that is more common
during remote work. Programmers also self-regulate whenthey use cannabis: cannabis is more likely during creative
open-ended software tasks vs. time- or safety- critical tasks.
5.3 RQ3: Cannabis Use Motivation
Having established that some developers regularly use cannabis
while completing both personal and work-related programming
projects, we now investigate whyprogrammers use cannabis. Un-
derstandingwhydevelopersusecannabisisimportantbecauseit
can help inform company drug policies and developer support.

were more likely to report enjoyment or programming enhance-
ment motivations than wellness motivations: the most common
reasons were “to make programming-related tasks more enjoyable”
(61%) and “to think of more creative programming solutions” (53%).
In fact, all programming enhancement reasons were selected by
at least 30% of respondents. On the other hand, general wellness
related reasons (such as mitigating pain and anxiety) were all cited
bylessthan30%ofrespondents.Thus,whilewellnessdoesmotivate
some cannabis use while programming, it is not the most common
motivation.Thisresultisfurthercorroboratedbyonly19%(54/280)
of cannabis using programmers indicating that they have a physi-
cian’srecommendationtousecannabismedicinally.Additionally,
of those that have such a recommendation, two thirds report using
cannabisforbothmedicinalandrecreationalreasons.Thisisimpor-
tant because it indicates that any cannabis policy should consider
medicinal, recreational and performance enhancing marijuana use.
We also investigated cannabis-use motivations by population
pool (i.e., GitHub-recruited vs. University-recruited participants)—
while percentages varied slightly, thetop four rationales were the
same regardless of recruitment pool. Wellness responses were also
consistently below programming-enhancement motivations.
Additional Qualitative Responses —While we leave a formal
qualitativeanalysistofuturework,wealsoobservetheemphasisofprogramming-enhancement-related reasons for cannabis use while
programming in the textual free-response section. For instance,
one participant said that when using cannabis while programming,
they are “able to better connect ideas and think about things on
abroaderlevel,whichtypicallyleadstomorewell-roundedsolu-
tions.” Similarly, another participant stated that cannabis use while
programming helped brainstorming, allowing them “to organize
[their]thoughtsbetterandkeepthemseparate,whichhelps[them]
follow threads further and come up with new paths to follow”.
Beyond cannabis’s apparent usefulness during programming
itself, participants also cite its usefulness during adjacent tasks.
For example, one participant said that they used cannabis “to stay
awake/focusedwhen...grading70programmingassignments.If[I]haveadeadlineandneedtobingeworkformanyhours,itiseasier
to keep going if I periodically get high. When your life is mostly
work, cannabis is something that makes it bearable.” Finally, some
participantsindicatedreasonsotherthanenjoyment,wellness,or
programming-enhancementforusingcannabiswhileprogramming.
Forinstance,someparticipantsindicatedthatcannabisusewhile
programming was a coincidence of regular cannabis use while a
few others saidtheytried cannabis to enhance programming,but
did not observe any effect.
Finally,whileweobservedlittlequantitativeevidenceofnegative
experiencesofcannabisusewhileprogramming,wedidobservea few qualitative reports. For example, one participant stated: “I
generally don’t use [cannabis] while programming because [...]it
affects my short-term memory, which is a huge part of program-ming for me [...] My managers wouldn’t have an issue with me
usingcannabisduringmyjob,butIdohaveanissuejustduetothe
nature of cannabis.” Similarly, another participant stated “I wanted
to see if [cannabis] would help, but all it did was make it harder to
keep track of what I was doing. I’m glad I tried it, but I wouldn’tdoitagain.”Thesequotesshowthatevenamongcannabis-usingReason for cannabis use while programming Cat Count %

programmers, there is a wide array of experiences and reactions, a
variancethatinvitesfurtherandmorein-depthqualitativeanalysis.
Implications —As a result of these conflicting experiences, our
findings raise the question of whether the programming-related
benefitsofcannabisperceivedbysomedevelopersactuallytrans-
late to verifiable programming enhancement. For example, eventhough many participants report using cannabis to enhance pro-
grammingcreativity,itisunclearifthisactuallyoccurs.Wenote
this concern was raised by some non-cannabis using programmers.
Forinstance,onesuchprogrammerwrotethatthey“hadaseries
of developers work for [them] that used cannabis to varying de-
grees.Allofthemfullybelievedthatitmadethembetterengineers,
that is sparked creativity and capability. From the outside however
the results have consistently not been that way. Not just from less
code productivity, but far more often inability to work as well with
others,and codequality issues.” Thus,our resultsmotivate future
observational study of the effects of cannabis on programming.
This motivation and considerations surrounding any such study
are discussed further in Section 6.
We found that programmers who use cannabis were more
likely to be motivated by potential programming ability en-
hancement or programming enjoyment than wellness-related
reasons. This pattern was observed in both open source de-
velopers and university participants, and motivates future
workinvestigatingiftheperceivedprogrammingbenefitsof
cannabis manifest in a more rigorous observational study.

5.4 RQ4: Perception of Cannabis Use
Wealsoinvestigatehowprogrammersperceivecannabisuse.Under-
standingthisperception isimportantbecauseifperception varies
from actual usage, this may result in sub-optimal cannabis-related
policies or biases in programming environments. We investigate
cannabis perceptions in general and programming-specific con-texts. For the former, we compare to national cannabis attitudessurveys. For the latter, we analyze attitude differences betweenprogramming students, employees, and software managers. We
then compare any differences to each group’s cannabis usage.
General Cannabis Perceptions— Programmers in our sample
have more positive attitudes towards cannabis than the population
overall.Forexample,91%ofourparticipantssaythatmarijuanauseshouldbelegalforbothrecreationalandmedicinalusecomparedto
60% of the general United States population in 2021 [ 56]. Similarly,
only 5% of our population views smoking marijuana once or twice
a week to be of “great risk” as opposed to 29% of the US popula-tion [
26]. This difference is likely explained by the demographic
differencesinage,gender,andpoliticalleaningbetweenprogram-
mers in our sample and the population overall (see Section 4).
Programming and Cannabis Perceptions Setup—To under-
stand cannabis perceptions in a programming context, we first ask
participants to rate their approval or disapproval of someone who
usescannabiswhileworkingwiththemonsoftwareengineering
tasks such as programming, brainstorming, debugging, or security
testing, on a 5-point Likert scale (from -2 for disapproval to +2 for
approval).Weaveragetheseresponsesintoanoverall“cannabisap-
proval score”. This approval/disapproval format was adapted from
previousresearchoncannabisattitudes[ 2].Second,weindirectly
asked about cannabis use visibility by asking ifrespondents knew
of a colleague who regularly used cannabis while programming on
a 5-point Likert scale (from -2 for a solid no to +2 for a solid yes).

ticipants.Differentiatingbetweengroupsadmitsinvestigatingmore
nuanced perception differences. For example, we ask employees to
indicate if they think their manager would disapprove of cannabis

do not necessarily manage employees in our sample, it still allows
a first investigation into perception differences between these two
groups overall. Table 4lists our population-specific questions.
Perceptions ofProfessionals vs.Students— Forstudentpro-
grammers, we considered those who were currently a student in
computer science, software engineering, or another programming-
relatedfield.Forprofessionalprogrammers,weconsiderthosenon-studentswhowereeitherfull-timeemployees,part-timeemployees,
orself-employedwithaprogrammingjob.Wehypothesizedthat

evidence of a differencebetween employee approval of colleagues

using cannabis while completing programming tasks: the average
frombothgroupswasbetweenneutral(0)andslightdisapproval(-1)
(-0.25forstudentonstudentsand-0.36foremployeeoncolleagues,
𝑝=0.26). This indicates that perceptions of cannabis use while
programming are similar in academic and professional contexts.For visibility, however, we do observe a significant difference.

while programming than a professional programmer is to know a
colleaguewhodoesthesame( 𝑝<0.0001):48%ofstudentsreport

cultural differences despite similar approval and usage levels be-
tween the twogroups, differences perhaps drivenby higher levels
ofsupportforcannabislegalizationamongyoungerAmericans[ 56]
orthefactthatsomestudentswereundertheageof21,themost
common age limit for legal cannabis use in the United States.
Perceptions of Managers vs. Employees— For programming
employees, we consider full-time, part-time, and self-employees
with a programmingjob. Managers were thosewho reported they
weremanagers.Theaveragelevelof expectedmanagersdisapproval
ofcannabisusebyemployeeswasbetweenslightandstrong.How-ever,managersreportedan actualdisapprovallevelbetweenneutral

Wefoundnosignificantdifferencebetweenmanagerdisapproval

(questions2and4, 𝑝=0.15),bothreportingbetweenneutraland
slight disapproval. We also found no significant cannabis usage dif-ferencesbetweenemployeesandmanagers.Additionally,managers
rarely report witnessing negative cannabis-related effects: while
27% (51/189) of managers suspect a supervisee uses cannabis, less
than3%(5/189)reportthatsuchprogrammerswerelessproductive,
and only one reported reprimanding an employee for cannabis use.
Thus, our results indicate a perception mismatch of programming
cannabis use between employees and managers: employees expect
managers to disapprove of such use more than they actually do.
Thismismatchbetweenmanagersandemployeesisfurthercom-
pounded by a difference in cannabis-use visibility. Professionalprogrammers are more likely to know or probably know a col-
league who regularly uses cannabis while programming than they
aretoknowamanagerwhoregularlyusescannabiswhileprogram-
ming (23% vs. 8%, 𝑝<0.0001). One potential implication is that

We found that US-based programmers have more favorable

ployees, and managers despite finding no significant differ-ences in cannabis usage between the three groups. For ex-ample, we found that managers disapprove of cannabis less
than employees expect them to. These results may indicate a
mismatch between perception and reality.

6 DISCUSSION
In this paper, we report that cannabis frequently interacts with
programminginbotheducationalandprofessionalsoftwareengi-
neeringcontexts.However,ourworkisalsoonlyafirststeptoward
understanding this intersection. In this discussion, we considerthe impacts of our findings on programming workplace cultureand policies. We also discuss questions raised by our results andpotential directions for future work including focus groups andobservational studies. We conclude with a broader discussion of
the intersection of cannabis and software engineering in general.
CannabisUseandCompanyPolicies— Ourfindingshaveim-
plications for software company anti-drug policies. While perhaps
less prevalent than in other industries (notably, many FANG (Face-
book,Amazon,Netflix,Google)companiesdonotdrug-testemploy-
ees), anti-cannabis regulations remain common in programmingenvironments(e.g.,[
16,p. 12]and[ 30,pp. 12–13]),policiesoften
enforced through drug testing: 29% of our participants reported
taking a drug test for a programming job.
At the same time, we found cannabis use is common among
programmers, with 35% of our sample having used cannabis while
programming,34%ofwhichsometimesdosoforwork-relatedtasks
(especiallyduringremotework).Cannabis-usingprogrammerstyp-
ically use THC products, the chemical detected by most drug tests.
Furthermore, perceptions of cannabis use while programming are
mostly ambivalent from both managers and employees, and we
observelimitedreportsofcannabisusenegativelyimpactingpro-
gramming work-places: while 27% of programming managers sus-
pect cannabis use by a supervisee, less than 3% report that those
programmerswerelessproductive,andonlyonemanagerinour
sample reported reprimanding an employee for cannabis use.
Thus, our results indicate that software company anti-drug poli-
ciesmayconflictwiththepreferredpracticeofmanydevelopers,
adissonancethatcanleadtosmallerapplicationpoolsandhiringdifficulties for drug-testing jobs (as evinced by the 2014 FBI cyber-
security hiring shortage [ 34]). Our results support additional study
and reassessment of extant anti-drug policies for programmingjobs including further contextualization on when and how oftenprogrammers currently take drug tests for programming-related
jobs11and if such policies are actually necessary or effective.
Outstanding Questions and Future Directions— One direct
question is functional: does cannabis use while programming actu-
allyaffectcodequality,andifso,how?Fromcreativitytoreadabilitytodefectdensity,thereareanumberofpurportedeffectsofcannabis
use on code. This is particularly compelling because programming
cannabis use is often motivated by the desire to enhance program-
mingskillssuchasbrainstormingandfocus(seeSection 5.3).Obser-
vational studies, in which programmers complete various software
taskswithandwithoutcannabis,provideonewaytoinvestigate
suchquestions. Bothfunctionaloutcomes andalsomedical mark-
ers (e.g., eye tracking, blood testing, etc.) are relevant. Such studies
are currently legally challenging in most parts of world. However,
cannabis laws are increasing in leniency, and in the US, both CBD
and THC have synthetic versions approved for medicinal use by
federal regulatory boards. Finally, some observational studies have
beenconducted withreal-worldcannabis. Forexample,Bidwell et
al.measured impairment with state-legalized cannabis (comparing
THC dosages) using a series of cognitive tests [ 5], encouraging the
pursuit of similar observational studies in a software context.
Other research techniques may be more immediately applicable.
Qualitative studies employing interviews or focus groups could
deepenunderstandingofcannabisprogrammingculture.Suchstud-iescouldalsohelpidentifyifandwhenanti-drugpolicesimpactjob
application or hiring decisions. Other directions include additional
11Unfortunately,wedidnotcollectdataregardingthetypesofdrugtestingexperienced
by programmers (e.g., once during hiring vs. continuous spot-checking), data that
would provide useful context. We encourage future work to explore this gap more
directly.

cannabis usage in countries beyond the United States.
Broader Software Engineering Impacts— Our work also has
broader implications on software engineering ecosystems and
cannabis-connected human-computer interactions. The intersec-
tionofcannabisuseandhuman-computerinteractionremainsunex-plored,inbothgeneralandsoftwarecontexts.Ascannabisbecomes
moreacceptable,itmayinteractmorewithsocio-technicalissues
includingaccessibility,end-usersecurity,dataprivacy,andprogram-
ming identity. This possibility was emphasized with “CHI-nnabis”,
a recent panel at Computer Human Interaction (CHI) calling for
more research at the intersection of cannabis and technology [ 33].
Whilewefocusedoncannabisuse,theremaybeotherunderstud-
iedmind-alteringsubstances thatinteractwithprogramming.For
instance,whilepsychedelicshadconnectionstothenascentcom-
mercial computing industry [ 44,61], little is known about current
prevalenceinsoftwareengineering,letalonetheaccuracyofany
perceivedbenefits.Similarly,whilecollegestudentsoftenabusepre-scriptionstimulantsas“studydrugs”[
57],littleisknownaboutthe
use of andculture surrounding such drugsby computing students
or in a programming context. Overall, we hope our work spursresearch on the intersection of programming and mind-alteringsubstances from multiple angles, such as company drug policies,
programming productivity, and socio-technical considerations.
7 LIMITATIONS AND THREATS TO VALIDITY
Otherlimitationsincludeself-selectionbiasanddataqualitycon-
cerns,commonforsurveyresearchingeneralandforself-reported
drug research in particular [ 27]. Due to interest, cannabis-using
programmers may be more likely than non-users to participate.Simultaneously, cannabis users may be less willing to report use
duetoretaliationworries.Tomitigatethesebiases,wemadeitclear
thatpriorcannabisusewasnotnecessary(seeSection 3),andour
survey was anonymous and confidential to encourage honesty. To
checkforself-selectionbias,wevalidatedthatkeydemographics
in our sample match those of our recruitment populations (see
Section4). We also note that online cannabis use surveys typically
producehighqualityandinternallyconsistentdata[ 50].Evenso,
these biases are important when interpreting our findings and may
result in our findings overestimating the prevalence of cannabis
use while programming.
One additionallimitation is timingduring COVID-19:our find-
ingsmaybeinfluencedbythisperiodofprimarilyremotework.Wemitigatethisthreatbyaskingaboutcannabis-usebehaviorchanges
resulting from the onset of COVID-19 (see Section 5.2). We note,
however, that while this is a potential limitation, it also admits
timely and useful analysis in light of our finding that remote work
increases cannabis use while programming for work-related tasks.
8 CONCLUSION
Inthispaper,wepresentedresultsof thefirstempiricalstudyof
cannabis’s prevalence, perceptions, and usage motivationsin programming environments
. To do so, we conducted a sur-
veyof803programmers(including450full-timeprofessionalde-
velopers) recruitedfrom open source, university, andsocial mediaprogramming communities. We found that some programmers reg-
ularlyusecannabiswhileprogramming(18%ofoursampledoso
atleastonceamonth),manychoosingtousecannabisforbothper-sonalandwork-relatedprojects.Furthermore,wefindthatcannabis
use while programming is primarily motivated by perceived en-
hancementtoprogramming-relatedskillsandincreasedenjoymentratherthanbymedicinalreasons.Finally,wefindthatprogramming
employees,managers,andstudentsusecannabiswhileprogram-
mingatsimilarrates,despitedifferencesincannabisperceptions
and visibility.
Such cannabis usage, however, is in conflict with anti-drug poli-
cies currentlyenactedfor many softwareengineering jobs: 29% of
oursamplereportedtheyhadtakena drugtestfora programming-
relatedjob,ahiringpracticethatmaylimitdeveloperapplication
pools. Thus, our results have implications for programming work-
placesthatcurrentlyhaveanti-drugpoliciesandmotivatefuture
research into the effects of cannabis use while programming.
