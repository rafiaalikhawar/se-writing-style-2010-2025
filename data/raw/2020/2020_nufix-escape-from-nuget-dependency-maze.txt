ABSTRACT
Developers usually suffer from dependency maze (DM) issues, i.e.,
package dependency constraints are violated when a project’s plat-
form or dependencies are changed. This problem is especially seri-
ous in .NET ecosystem due to its fragmented platforms (e.g., .NET
Framework, .NET Core, and .NET Standard). Fixing DM issues
is challenging due to the complexity of dependency constraints:multiple DM issues often occur in one project; solving one DM
issueusuallycausesanotherDMissuecroppingup;theexponential
search space of possible dependency combinations is also a barrier.
In this paper, we aim to help .NET developers tackle the DM
issues.First,weempiricallystudiedasetofrealDMissues,learn-
ing their common fixing strategies and developers’ preferences in
adopting these strategies. Based on these findings, we propose Nu-
Fix,anautomatedtechniquetorepairDMissues.NuFixformulates
therepairtaskasabinaryintegerlinearoptimizationproblemto
effectively derive an optimal fix in line with the learnt developers’
preferences. The experiment results and expert validation showthat NuFix can generate high-quality fixes for all the DM issues
with 262 popular .NET projects. Encouragingly, 20 projects (includ-
ing affected projects such as Dropbox) have approved and merged
our generated fixes, and shown great interests in our technique.

1 INTRODUCTION
.NET is an open-source development platform for building various
types of projects (e.g., mobile apps, microservices) implemented
using C#, F# and VB [ 76]. Microsoft provides a tool, NuGet, for
buildingprojectsandsharingpackagesonmultiple.NETplatforms
at a central repository nuget.org [16]. As of August 2021, nuget.org
maintains over three million package versions.
Withtherapidevolutionofthe.NETecosystem,managingde-
pendencies in .NET projects becomes a critical challenge. This is
mainly due to the fragmentation of .NET ecosystem, which makes
dependency constraints between packages especially complicated:
(1) There are nine actively used and updated platform variations(e.g., .NET Framework, .NET Core), involving 220 platform ver-
sions[2].Most.NETpackagesarespecifiedtosometargetplatform
versions while incompatible with other ones. (2) At different target
platform versions, a packagetypically requires different transitive
dependencies. As a package evolves, new versions may require
different dependencies or support different target platforms.
Duetofragmentationof.NETecosystem,aproject’sdependency
graph can be greatly changed when developers upgrade/migrate
its .NET platform or depended packages. These changes can easily
introducebuilderrors.BasedonNuGet’sbuildrules,thepackage
installationsofaprojectwillbeblockedifthereareconflictingcon-straints (e.g., constraints on package versions and target platforms)
imposed by the project or its depended packages. In this paper, we
refer to such build errors as dependency maze(DM) issues.
Figure 1 shows a real DM issue and illustrates the complication
in fixing it. In Figure 1(a), a .NET project received a build error
when upgrading its direct dependency EasyNetQ.DI to version
6.0.1. This is because the upgrade introduced a new dependency

inducedmany changestothe project’sdependencies.Aseries of
new build errors arose. It is difficult to figure out a solution toresolve all these DM issues, the developers finally rolled back all
thechangesandfiledanissuereport#1139[ 5]to EasyNetQ.DI ’s
developers, seeking for assistance to downgrade its dependency of
DependencyInjection to (≥2.1.1)) as shown in Figure 1(d). The
example illustrates the complexity of DM issues. It also shows that
DM issues can manifest themselves in multiple types with respect
to different root causes (see § 2.2).
Fixing a DM issue can be challenging. Multiple DM issues often
occurinaprojectatthesametime.Forthoseprojectswithlargedependency graphs, fixing such issues is a time-consuming and
error-proneprocessthatexercisesaseriesofchangesindependency
constraints in response to newly induced DM issues.
Among our collected 169 DM issue reports from 500 representa-
tive .NET projects, 42.6% of them involves more than five simulta-
neous build errors (error count varied from 1 to 150), and 24.9% of
them involves more than two error types (see § 3.1). Out of the 169
issues, 124 have documented fixes. On average, each fix requires a
combination of 8.8 dependency changes and each change involves
27.5possiblechoicesinpackageversionconstraints,whichinvolves
alargesolutionsearchspace.Moreimportantly,whendecidinga
fixingsolution,developersoftenconsidertheirdesiredproperties
of configuration (e.g., inducing fewer risky build warnings), which
are echoed by the discussions in many issues such as #5696 of
aspnetcore [14].However,it isdifficultfordeveloperstoimagine
allpossibledependencygraphsaffectedbydependencychanges,to
figure out an optimal solution that satisfies their preferences.In this paper, we aim to develop a technique to help .NET de-
velopers tackleDM issues. We canformulate a DM issuescenario
(including installed and available package versions and user up-
graderequirements),buildrulesanddevelopers’preferencesasa
linearoptimizationproblemtofindfeasibleDMissuefixingsolu-
tions.Toachievethis,threetechnicalchallengesshouldbecarefully
studied:(1)howtoformallydefinetheconfigurationpreferences
in line with .NET developers’ practices; (2) how to rigorously as-
sign weights for the preferences encoded in a linear programming
model; (3) how to find an acceptable fixing solutions that can in-
duce build warnings (based on NuGet’s build rules) if the fully safe
solutions do not exist. The existing work [ 26] adopted a linear pro-
gramming model to resolve the package upgradeability problem
for GNU/Linux-based distributions. However, it cannot be directly
adapted to repair DM issues since the three challenges are still
unresolved in this approach (see baseline comparisons in § 5.2).
Toaddresstheabovechallenges,weproposeaneffectivetech-
nique, NuFix, to repair DM issues. NuFix is built on top of ourcomprehensive study of developers’ preferences in fixing DM is-sues. Since deriving a developer preferred solution typically re-
quiresrichdomainknowledgeofdependencyconfigurations,we
first empirically studied a collection of real DM issue reports, to
learnthecharacteristicsoffixingstrategies.Byencodingtheem-
piricalfindingsintoalinearoptimizationmodel,NuFixseeksfor
the global optimal fixing solution. Furthermore, we proposed a
variantoptimizationmodelbasedonNuGet’sbuildrules,toseek

Finally,wecollectedasetofrealdocumentedfixesofDMissuesby
.NET developers as a training dataset to learn the role played by
each preference in determining a solution.

Figure 2: The severity of fragmentation in the .NET ecosystem
•Platform-level fragmentation. .NET supports nine platform
variations, which are actively updated. For instance, five .NET
platforms,including.NETFramework,.NETCore,.NETStandard,
Mono,andUniversalWindowsPlatform(UWP),wereintroducedtosupportWindowsOS.ByAugust2021,thefiveplatformshave
released 60 versions [ 2]. Two evolution characteristics across
these versions lead to the platform-level fragmentation problem:
(1)Installingadifferent.NETplatformversioncanintroducechanges
intransitivepackagedependencieswithspecificversionconstraints
toaproject’slocalenvironment. Figure2(a)givesanexampleof
thechangeintransitivedependenciesintroducedby.NETcore
platformtothelocalenvironmentfrom38packagesto3packages
after upgrading the platform from version 1.1.1 to 2.1.0.
(2)A.NETplatformmaybeincompatiblewiththepackagesthat
targetother.NETplatformsorotherversionsofthesame.NETplat-
form.For instance, packages targeting one of the four platforms
including .NET Framework, .NET Core, Mono, and UWP, areincompatible with the other three platforms. As shown in Fig-
ure2(b),package Log4net 2.0.12isincompatiblewith.NETCore,
since it only supports the .NET Framework ≤4.0. To broaden
the.NETpackageecosystem,since2016,Microsoftintroduced
.NETStandardplatformforpackagedevelopers,toprovideauni-
fiedclasslibrarythatareavailablefordifferent.NETvariations.
Hence the packages targeting .NET Standard can be installed on
multiple platforms. Nevertheless, the uniformity of ecosystemhas not been realized, since each .NET Standard version onlysupports limited versions of .NET platforms. Figure 2(c) givesan illustrative example. Based on .NET Standard’s documenta-
tion[1],apackagetargeting.NETStandard2.1canbeinstalled
on.NETCore3.0and3.1,Mono6.4,andUWPTBD,whileitis
incompatible with other platforms.
•Package-levelfragmentation. Packagesinthe.NETecosystem
are mostly platform-specific, which target only specific versions
of some .NET platform variants. Each package version providesan isolated assembly for each supported platform version. When
building a package version, NuGet selectively installs an assem-
bly compatible with the target .NET platform version. The set
of dependencies required by each isolated assembly varies. Con-
sider package Nlog4.7.0 described in Figure 2(d). Its assemblies
that target .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.0 require no dependen-cies whereas its assemblies that target .NET Standard 1.3 and
1.5 require 3 and 6 different dependencies, respectively. More-
over, different versions of a package may (1) provide assemblies
requiring different dependencies for the same target platform,
and(2)supportdifferent.NETplatforms.Forinstance, Nlog4.6.6
and Nlog4.6.7requiredifferentdependenciesforthesametarget
platform .NET Standard 1.5. In another example, the upgrade
ofRF.Contracts from 4.3.0 to 4.3.1 migrate its target platform
from.NETStandard2.1to.NET5.0.Thesepackagecharacteristics
induce many variations across various .NET platforms.
2.2 NuGet Dependency Maze
We briefly describe the DM issues numbered by NuGet:
•ὁBNU1605 (Downgrading dependency due to the direct depen-
dency priority rule ): Suppose that different version constraints
of the same package are introduced into a project as a direct
dependency and transitive dependencies, respectively. Based on
NuGet’sdirectdependencypriority rule,itinstallssuchapackage
based on the direct dependency’s version constraint. NuGet will
reportaNU1605error,iftheresolvedpackageversionislower
than its transitively introduced version constraint(s).
•ὁBNU1107 (Unable to resolve dependency constraints between
transitivepackages ):Ifdifferentversionconstraintsofthesame
package are introduced into a project as transitive dependen-
cies, NuGet will report a NU1107 error when it cannot resolve a
version satisfying all the constraints of conflicting dependencies.
•ὁBNU1202(Packagedoesnotcontainanyassembliescompatible

containanyassembliescompatiblewiththeclientproject’starget
platform, NuGet will report a NU1202 error when installing it.
•ὁBNU1203(PackagedoesnotsupporttheOSwheretheclientproject

Identifier to designate on which OS they can be installed. NuGet
will report a NU1203 error, if the Runtime Identifier of a required
assembly is inconsistent with the OS where client project runs.
•ὁBNU1108(Circulardependencyisnotallowed ):NuGetwillreport
aNU1108error,ifacirculardependency(e.g., PKG𝑎→PKG𝑏→
PKG𝑎) is introduced into the project.
3 EMPIRICAL STUDY
We empirically study the characteristics of DM issue fixing solu-
tions, with the aim to answer two research questions:
•RQ1 (Fixing Strategies): What are common practices for fixing
DM issues? What are challenges of figuring out a fix?
•RQ2 (Configuration Preferences): What are developers’ pref-
erences when determining fixes for DM issues?
To answer RQ1-2, we collected top popular 3,000 .NET projects
on GitHub (by Starcount) and randomly selected 500 subjects (de-
noted as subjectSet 1) to mine DM issue reports from their issue
trackers. We focused on the build failures due to conflicting con-
straints imposed by build rules. To identify the fixing strategies of
DMissues,weanalyzedtheirissuedescriptions,developers’discus-
sions and fixes. Note that the rest 2,500 collected .NET projects not
used in RQ1-2 (denoted as subjectSet 2), were adopted to evaluate
our DM issue repair technique later (see § 5).
3.1 Data Collection
Step1: Collecting .NET projects. We collected top popular 3,000
.NET projects from GitHub based on their Starcounts, and from
whichwerandomlyselected500subjectsas subjectSet 1.Figure3
shows the 500 projects’ demographics. They are: (1) non-trivial
in size (on average having 63.1 KLOC); (2) well-maintained (on
average having239 codecommits); (3)popular(63% ofthem have
over 300 stars); (4) complicated in dependencies (74.1% of themhave more than 15 direct dependencies); (5) diverse (concerning
projects targeting nine types of .NET platforms).Step2: Collecting DM issues.
We collected DM issues from the
500 projects in subjectSet 1. To locate DM issues, we searched the
projects for the issue reports filed between May 2018 and May2021 (i.e., in the past three years) using keywords “version con-
flicts”,“incompatibletargetplatform”,andbuilderrornumbers(e.g.,
“NU1107”).Thoseissuereportsthatdonothaveaclearerrornumber
werefoundbythefirsttwokeywords.Keywords“versionconflicts”,
“incompatibletargetplatform”andinstallationerrornumbersre-
turned1,631,922and1,012issuereports,respectively.Weremoved
duplicated reports from the search results and then retained those
that explain the issues as well as their root causes.
Eventually,wecollected169DMissuereports,covering116.NET
projects. Among them, 124 issues have fixes and 45 issues have
clear fixing plans agreed by developers. There are 72 (42.6%) issues

Step3:Dataanalysis. ToanswerRQ1-2,weperformedanin-depth
analysis on: (1) fixes of the 124 issues, (2) planned solutions of the
remaining 45 issues, and (3) comments in the issue reports. We fol-
lowedan opencoding procedure[ 33],a widely-usedapproach for
qualitative research, to categorize the fixing strategies and configu-
ration preferences discussed in issue reports. Initially, two authors
of this paper, who have over three years .NET development experi-
ence, independently analyzed the fixes and developers’ discussions
of85issuereports.Afterthefirstroundofanalysisandlabeling,thetwo authors gathered to compare and discuss their results, in order
toadjustthetaxonomy,withthehelpofathirdauthortoresolve
conflicts. In this manner, we constructed the pilot taxonomy. Next,
thefirsttwo authorscontinuedtolabel thefixesordiscussionsof
the remaining 84 issue reports and iteratively refined the results as
wellasthelabelingstrategy.Theconflictsoflabelingwereagain
discussed during meetings and resolved by the third author. We
adjusted the pilot taxonomy and obtained the final result.
3.2 RQ1: Fixing Strategies
Viaanalyzingourcollecteddata,weobservedthreefixingstrategies.
Strategy 1: Upgrading/downgrading the direct dependencies that
directly or transitively introduce the problematic package versions
(116/169).Thisstrategywasadoptedby116(68.6%)ofissuereports
to resolve five types of DM issues. For example, in issue#81 [ 7],
project Installer directlyreferencespackage NETCore.App with
constraint ( ≥2.1.0) and transitively depends on NETCore.App
again with ( ≥2.1.2) via package ReverseProxy . NuGet resolves

NETCore.App ’s version as 2.1.0, based on the direct dependency’s
constraint ( ≥2.1.0) (i.e.,direct dependency priority rule). It then
reports a NU1605 error, since ReverseProxy has to reference a
lower version of NETCore.App than it expects. Developers faced
thechoiceoftwopossiblesolutions:(1)upgrading NETCore.App
to 2.1.2; (2) downgrading ReverseProxy to a version that was
compatible with NETCore.App 2.1.0. They adopted solution (2), as
their project was incompatible with NETCore.App 2.1.2.
WhileStrategy1canfixtheoriginalDMissues,itmayintroduce

can affect the rest of a project’s dependency graph, introducing
multiple types of new DM issues (e.g., issue#1139 [ 5]o f EasyNetQ
as discussed in § 1). As a result, developers may need to change
more dependencies to resolve the new DM issues.
/lightbulbFinding 1: Upgrading/downgradingthedirectdependenciesthatin-
troducethe problematicpackage versionsis themost commonstrategy
to fix all types of DM issues. The fixes can induce new DM issues.
Strategy 2: Adding direct dependencies with appropriate version
constraints to override the problematic package versions (61/169).
36.1% of issue reports adopted this strategy to solve NU1107 issues.
For example, in issue#886 [ 8], two conflicting constraints ( ≥10.0.1)
and(=9.0.1)on Newtonsoft.Json weretransitivelyintroducedby
directdependencies Tokens.Jwt 5.2.1and Sdk.Functions 1.0.8,
respectively.WiththeaidofNuGet’s directdependencypriority rule,
developersexplicitlydeclared Newtonsoft .Json 10.0.1asadirect
dependency to override its other required versions. After the over-
riding, these packages can be successfully installed. While the orig-
inalNU1107issuewasresolved,NuGetgeneratedanewNU1608
warning that the installed version (10.0.1) of Newtonsoft.Json
exceededtheconstraint(=9.0.1)specifiedby Sdk.Functions 1.0.8.
At the end, the developers chose to ignore the warning and enable
the<NoWarn> property for NU1608 in the configuration file.
Weobservedthatallthe61issuereportssolvedNU1107issues

cussedinissue#18of ServiceFabric [6],sinceitsdeveloperscould
not figure outhow tofix theirNU1107issues using Strategy 1,they
temporarily tolerated the NU1608 warnings induced by Strategy 2.
/lightbulbFinding 2: Addingdirectdependenciesisacommonstrategytofix
NU1107 issues. However, it often causes NU1608 warnings.
Strategy3: Upgrading/migratingtheclientproject’stargetplat-
form(34/169). 34 (20.1%) of the issue reports solved NU1202 issues
by upgrading/migrating the client project’s target platform. For
example, in issue#11 [ 4]o f Unmocakable , a project got an error
when installing Unmocakable 3.0.89. The above package only sup-
ports.NETStandard2.1,whichisnotcompatiblewiththeproject’s
target platform .NET Core 2.2.0. By analyzing the interactive com-
patibilitymatrix[ 1]of.NETStandard,developersupgradedtheir
target platform to .NET Core 3.0.0 (compatible with .NET Standard
2.1) in order to work with the desired Unmocakable version.
Sincepackagescontain multipleassemblieswithdifferenttran-
sitive dependencies that support different target platform versions,
Strategy 3 may greatly affect client project’s dependency graph.
Weobserved that8 out of10 issue reportsadopting Strategy 3 to
solve NU1202 issues, introduced a series of new DM issues (e.g.,issue#1039of refit[3]).Insuchcases,developerscontinuedtofix
the new issues using a combination of Strategies 1, 2and3.
/lightbulbFinding3: Upgrading/migratingtargetplatformissometimesadopted

cies and tend to induce new DM issues.
Finally,in30outof169issuereports,developerscannotfigure
outfixing solutions. Theyhaveto coordinatewiththedevelopers
of problematicpackages to adjusttheir configurations. We donot
consider this solution as a recommended strategy, since it requires
developer coordination and is not subject to full automation.
3.3 RQ2: Configuration Preferences
For RQ2, we found clues for developers’ configuration preferences
in 54 issue reports and summarized as follows:
Avoid inducing incompatibility issues. In 16 of the 54 issue
reports(29.6%),toavoidinducingincompatibilityissuesatruntime,
developers tend to adopt a combination of fixing strategies with
two preferences below.
•Preference 1: Fewer upgrades/downgrades of dependencies’ major
versions (6/16). Based on the semantic versioning strategy [23],
developers are suggested to increase their projects’ major ver-
sion number, if they make incompatible API changes. Whenexploring DM issue solutions, developers tried to make fewerupgrades/downgrades that change direct dependencies’ major
versionstoavoidincompatibilityissues.Theaboveviewpointwas
discussed in six issue reports, e.g., issue#972 of EasyNetQ [15].
•Preference2: Fewerchangesindirectdependencies’versions(10/16).
Developers favored fixing solutions with fewer changes in the
version constraints of direct dependencies because this can usu-
allylowerthechancesthatincompatibilitiesariseafterresolving
DM issues. Moreover, upgrading is preferable to downgrading if
eitherofthemcanresolveDMissues.Developersexpressedsuchapreferenceintenissuereports,e.g.,issue#153of
AndroidX [10].
Avoidaffectingprojectmaintainability. Weobservedthefol-
lowingthree preferencesused in38 ofthe 54issue reports(70.4%)for the sake of project maintainability.
•Preference 3:
Fewer installed packages (15/38). Introducing too
many packages into a project will complicate the topological
structureofitsdependencygraph.Hence,developerspreferto
install the package versions with fewer transitive dependencies,
to prevent potential DM issues. Such preference was echoed by
discussions in seven reports, e.g., issue#545 of standard [13].
•Preference4: Fewerinstalledpackagestargetinginconsistent.NET
platform with client project (7/38). Many .NET Standard pack-
ages can be directly or transitively introduced into the .NET
Core/.NET Framework/UWP/Mono projects. While the projects
targeting .NET Standard 2.0 and above can install specific ver-
sions of .NET Framework packages. Since each .NET Standard
version supports limited versions of other .NET platforms, in-
troducingmorepackagestargetinginconsistentplatformwith
client project would be more likely to cause DM issues when theprojectsupgrade/migratetheirtargetplatformsinfuture.Toease
maintenance, developers try to ensure that more packages intro-
duced in their projects support the same .NET platform as the
localones.Suchpreferencewasrevealedinsevenissuereports,
e.g., issue#14393 of aspnetcore [9].

(2)/exclamation-triangleNU1103(Nostablepackageversionsarefoundintheversion
constraint ): If there are no stable versions within a package’s
specified version constraint but only pre-release versions (e.g.,
3.0.0-beta-00032 ), NuGet will reports a NU1103 warning. Since
the pre-release package versions were not reliable, developersdid not adopted the fixing solutions introducing such NU1103
warnings in six issue reports (e.g., issue#36550 of corefx[11]).
(3)/exclamation-triangleNU1701 (Package does not specify its target platforms ):
If an introduced package does not specify its target platforms,
NuGet will reports a NU1701 warning as its assemblies may not
be 100% compatible with the client project. To avoid potentialincompatibility issues, developers gave up the fixing solutions

4 METHODOLOGY
From our empirical study, we understand the pervasiveness and
seriousnessoftheproblem,andlearntheatomicfixingstrategies
and developers’ preferences from real DM issue fixes. Motivated
byourempiricalfindings(§3),thesolutiondesignisexpectedto
meetfourproperties:(1)modelingabilitytorepresentvariousde-
pendency constraints (§ 2.2), problematic projects with multiple
DM issues (§ 3.1), and potential fixes composed of multiple atomic
fixing strategies (§ 3.2 ); (2) learning ability to better adapt develop-
ers’ preferencesby distillingcharacteristics ofreal DMissue fixes
(§ 3.3); (3) online inference efficiency to derive the fixes within
users’ acceptable waiting time.
Based on the above analysis, we propose NuFix, a novel tech-
nique to derive fixes for DM issues. The key idea is to leverage
binary integer linear programming, upon which we can systemati-
callyreformulatethistaskandencodeourempiricalfindings(i.e.,
fixingstrategiesanddevelopers’preferences)intolinearconstraints
andoptimization functions.Binaryinteger linearprogrammingis
a well-studied technique that meets our efficiency requirements.
Moreover,totunehyperparametersrigorouslybylearningfromreal
documentedfixes,weincorporateBayesianoptimizationintoour
model to optimize the hyperparameters in a non-gradient manner.

•Candidate range of direct dependencies’ versions (developers’ re-quirements) (optional). NuFix allows developers to customize

aware of the incompatible versions ( ≥4.0.0) through experience.
Onealternativedesignistoonlyconsiderthepackageversions
without introducing API breaking changes, but this is too strict:
itisacommonpracticethatdevelopersmaybewillingtoresolve
the DM issues at an acceptable cost of adapting the API changes.
NuFix mainly consists of 5 modules:
•Generating Dependency Maze Graph (§ 4.2). Given a target
platform and the dependency configuration with customizedpackage versions, this module generates a dependency mazegraph consisting of all possible dependencies (both direct and
transitive) and the constraints among them.
•Seeking Safe fixes (§ 4.3). Given a DM graph, this module tries
to seek the fixes that does not introduce risky build warnings
(refer to as safe fixes). These fixes are based on Strategy 1 (up-
grading/downgrading direct dependencies), the most commonly
adoptedstrategyinourempiricalstudy(Finding1).Toaddressthe
combinatorial explosivesearch space problem, we firstpropose
toformulatetherepairtaskasabinaryintegerlinearprogram-
mingmodel,andthenwecanobtainthefixesusingmathematical
optimization solvers (in NuFix we use python-mip [22]).
•SeekingRiskyfixes (§4.4).Sometimesthereisnosafefix.There-
fore, we propose a variant optimization model to seek fixes that
may introduce some risky build warnings (NU1608, NU1103 and
NU1701). This model allows not only Strategy 1 but alsoStrat-
egy 2(adding direct dependencies to override the problematic
package versions).
•Tuning Hyperparameters (§ 4.5). The aforementioned two op-
timizationmodelsinvolvesomehyperparameters.Inthismodule,
we tune these hyperparameters based on Bayesian optimization.
Note that this is an offline step.

fixes,NuFixalsoreportstheirproperties(e.g., alistofbuildwarn-
ings induced by this fix ). The developers can review these fix
reports to choose their preferred one.
NuFix also provides a test validation feature that triggers client
project’sbundledtestcases.Thishelpsdevelopersawareofprogram
behavior changes induced by the fix. This is an optional step, as it
is time-consuming to re-compile the project and trigger its tests.
4.2 Dependency Maze Graph
Consideradirectedgraph 𝐺=(𝑉,𝐸)with𝑉thesetofverticesand
𝐸={(𝑖,𝑗)|𝑖,𝑗∈𝑉}the set of edges:
•Each vertex 𝑣∈𝑉denotes a package version (e.g., NLog4.6.7).
Weusetwoattributes, 𝑣.PKGand𝑣.VERtodenotethepackage
andtheversion,respectively.Eachedge 𝑒=(𝑖,𝑗)∈𝐸indicates
that𝑖directly depends on 𝑗.PKG, and𝑗.VERsatisfies the version
constraintspecifiedby 𝑖.Weexcludethepackageversionsthat
may lead to NU1202/1203/1108 errors or NU1103/1701 warnings.
•Weuseaspecialvertex 𝑣∗∈𝑉torepresenttheclientproject.For
each vertex 𝑣satisfying (𝑣∗,𝑣)∈𝐸, it means that: this project
depends on 𝑣.PKG, and𝑣.VERis a candidate version of 𝑣.PKG
for this project. For each 𝑣∈𝑉, there is always at least one path
from𝑣∗to𝑣. Moreover, to handle the transitive dependencies of
platform(Figure2(a)),thespecifiedplatformwillalsobeadded
as a successor vertex of 𝑣∗.
Given𝐺,ourmaintaskistofindaset ˆ𝑉⊆𝑉,whichrepresentsa
dependency (both direct and transitive) configuration of the client
projectthatcanresolveDMissues.Foreach ˆ𝑉,NuFixautomatically
generates the corresponding fix.
4.3 Seeking Safe Fixes
Weformulatetherepairingtaskasabinaryintegerlinearprogram-
ming model as follows.
Variables. For each 𝑣∈𝑉, we introduce a binary variable 𝑣.𝛿
(i.e.,𝑣.𝛿∈{0,1}), representingwhether 𝑣should bea dependency
(either direct or transitive) in the fix:
ˆ𝑉={𝑣|𝑣∈𝑉∧𝑉.𝛿=1} (1)
Constraints. First,𝑣∗.𝛿=1. Second, each project will not de-
pend on more than one version of the same package (according to
NuGet’s build rules):
𝑖.PKG=𝑝/summationdisplay.1
𝑖∈𝑉𝑖.𝛿≤1,∀𝑝∈{𝑣.PKG|𝑣∈𝑉} (2)
Third, for each vertex in ˆ𝑉(i.e., the variable of this vertex takes
thevalue1),wedivideitssuccessorsintoseveralgroupsbythePKG
attribute. For each group, there should be one and only one vertex
that is in ˆ𝑉. These constraints guarantee that: for each package
inthefinalsolution,itsdependencyrequirementswillalwaysbe
satisfied. Formally, we have:
(𝑣,𝑖)∈𝐸,
𝑖.PKG=𝑝/summationdisplay.1
𝑖∈𝑉𝑖.𝛿≥𝑣.𝛿,∀𝑣∈𝑉,𝑝∈{𝑣/prime.PKG|(𝑣,𝑣/prime)∈𝐸}(3)
Last,transitivedependenciesshouldconformtothe “lowestap-
plicable version” rule in NuGet dependency resolution:
(𝑗,𝑖)∈𝐸/summationdisplay.1
𝑗∈𝑉𝑗.𝛿∗𝐼LB(𝑗,𝑖)≥𝑖.𝛿,∀𝑖∈{𝑣|(𝑣∗,𝑣)∉𝐸}\𝑣∗(4)
where𝐼LBis an indicator function of whether or not 𝑖.VERis a
lowestapplicationversionof 𝑖.PKGfor𝑗.Thisconstraintguaranteesthat dependency configuration ˆ𝑉is entirely based on Strategy 1
(upgrading/downgrading the direct dependencies).
Objective Function. We design the objective function based on
the identified preferences discussed in §3.3.
To encourage Preference 1 (developers prefer fewer dependency
upgrades/downgrades crossingtheir major versions),we incorpo-
rate it into our objective function as a factor:
max𝑧1=/summationdisplay.1
𝑣∈𝑉𝑣.𝛿∗𝐼MV(𝑣) (5)
where𝐼𝑀𝑉is an indicator function of whether or not 𝑣.PKGis a
direct dependency and 𝑣.VERshares the same major version as the
original version.
To encourage Preference 2 (developers prefer fewer changes on
direct dependencies’ versions), we have:
max𝑧2=−/summationdisplay.1
𝑣∈𝑉𝑣.𝛿∗𝐼U(𝑣),max𝑧3=−/summationdisplay.1
𝑣∈𝑉𝑣.𝛿∗𝐼D(𝑣)(6)
where𝐼U/𝐼Dis an indicator function of whether or not 𝑣.PKGis
a direct dependency and 𝑣.VERis greater/lower than its original
versionintheproblematicconfigurationfile.Weuseindicatorfunc-
tions𝐼Uand𝐼Dto distinguish between upgrades and downgrades.
To encourage Preference 3 (developers prefer to introduce fewer
packages in project’s dependency graph), we have:
max𝑧4=−/summationdisplay.1
𝑣∈𝑉𝑣.𝛿 (7)
To encourage Preference 4 (fewer installed packages targeting
inconsistent .NET platform with client project), we have:
max𝑧5=−/summationdisplay.1
𝑣∈𝑉𝑣.𝛿∗𝐶(𝑣) (8)
where𝐼𝐶isanindicatorfunctionofwhetherornot 𝑣targetsincon-
sistent .NET platform with client project.
In this section, we ignore Preference 5 (introducing fewer warn-
ings), because this model will never introduce warning.
We define our overall objective function as:
max𝑧=5/summationdisplay.1
𝑘=1𝛼𝑘∗𝑧𝑘 (9)
where(𝛼1,𝛼2,𝛼3,𝛼4,𝛼5)∈[0,1](/summationtext.15
𝑖=1𝛼𝑖=1)are hyperparame-
ters. §4.5 details the tuning hyperparameter procedure.
4.4 Seeking Risky Fixes
Sometimesitisinfeasibletofindsafefixes.Therefore,inthissection
we propose a variant model that can seek risky fixes (i.e., fixes that
may introduce build warnings). As introduced in § 3.3, we need to
considerthreetypesofbuildwarnings:(1)NU1608( packageversion
isoutsideofdependencyconstraint );(2)NU1103(nostablepackage
versions are found in the version constraint ); (3) NU1701 (package
does not specify its target platforms ).
TofindfixeswithNU1103andNU1701,weallowunstablever-
sions (denoted as 𝑉NU1103) and versions that do not specify their
target platforms (denoted as 𝑉NU1701)i n𝐺. We have:
max𝑧6=−/summationdisplay.1
𝑣∈𝑉NU1103𝑣.𝛿,max𝑧7=−/summationdisplay.1
𝑣∈𝑉NU1701𝑣.𝛿(10)
It is challenging to find fixes with NU1608, because NU1608
means that some constraints in Equation 3 will be violated. Con-
cretely, Equation 3 should be relaxed as:
𝑖.PKG=𝑝/summationdisplay.1
𝑖∈𝑉𝑖.𝛿≥𝑣.𝛿. (11)
1551
Authorized licensed use limited to: LAHORE UNIV OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCES. Downloaded on August 07,2025 at 08:30:33 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA Zhenming Li, Ying Wang, Zeqi Lin, Shing-Chi Cheung, and Jian-Guang Lou
This relaxation makes the model intractable because the search
space explodes and we cannot trace the number of violated con-
straintsinEquation3.Toaddressthisproblem,weintroduceanaux-
iliarybinaryvariable 𝑥𝑣,𝑝foreach𝑣∈𝑉\𝑣∗and𝑝∈{𝑣/prime.PKG|(𝑣,𝑣/prime)∈
𝐸}.Thisvariableindicateswhetherornot 𝑣’sdependencyconstraint
on𝑝is violated. Then we have another relaxation for Equation 3:
𝑥𝑣,𝑝+(𝑣,𝑖)∈𝐸,
𝑖.PKG=𝑝/summationdisplay.1
𝑖∈𝑉𝑖.𝛿≥𝑣.𝛿. (12)
We want to violate constraints in Equation 3 as few as possible:
max𝑧8=−/summationdisplay.1
𝑣,𝑝𝑥𝑣,𝑝 (13)
Similar to 𝑧(Equation 9), the overall objective function of the
variant model for seeking risky fixes is:
max𝑧/prime=8/summationdisplay.1
𝑘=1𝛼/prime
𝑘∗𝑧𝑘 (14)
4.5 Tuning Hyperparameters
We use Bayesian optimization to tune the hyperparameters 𝜶in
our models: 𝜶=(𝛼1,...,𝛼5)for safefixes, and 𝜶=(𝛼/prime
1,...,𝛼/prime
8)for
riskyfixes.Bayesianoptimizationisaglobaloptimizationalgorithm
built upon Bayesian inference and Gaussian process, that attempts
to find the maximum/minimum value of a black-box function in
as few iterations as possible. Here black-box means that we do not
have access to the gradient of our models with respect to 𝜶.
To start a Bayesian optimization task, we need to specify the
function 𝑓tobeoptimized.Intuitively,wewishtofindan 𝜶that
makes the fixes returned by our model as similar as possible to
realfixesprovidedbydevelopers.Concretely,consideratraining
datasetDconsisting of some pairs in the form of (𝐺,ˆ𝑉):𝐺is a
DM graph,and ˆ𝑉is thereal fix(this trainingdataset isdetailed in
Sec 5.3). Then we have:
min𝑓(𝜶)=/summationdisplay.1
(𝐺,ˆ𝑉)∈D(𝑧∗(𝐺,𝜶)−𝑧(𝐺,ˆ𝑉,𝜶)) (15)
, where𝑧∗(𝐺,𝜶)is the maximum value of the objective function 𝑧
that our model solves (given 𝐺and𝜶).
5 EVALUATION
We study two research questions in our evaluation section:
•RQ3(Effectivenessof NuFix): How effective is NuFix in fixing
DM issues for .NET projects?
•RQ4 (Usefulness of NuFix) Do the fixes generated by NuFix
make sense from practitioners’ perspectives?
To answer RQ3, we constructed a high-quality benchmark, to
evaluate NuFix’s capability of fixing DM issues.

Evaluation Metrics. We define four evaluation metrics below:
•FR(FixingRatio):theproportionofDMissuecasesforwhichthe
technique can derive fixes.
•SFR(SafelyFixingRatio):theproportionofDMissuecasesfor
which the technique can derive safe fixes.
•TPR(TestPassing Ratio):the proportion ofderived fixesthat can
pass the projects’ bundled tests.
•Similarity :howsimilararethederivedfixestothecorresponding
real fixes. We define Similarity based on IoU:
Similarity =|Changes𝑁∩Changes𝑅|
|Changes𝑁∪Changes𝑅|(16)
whereChanges𝑁andChanges𝑅arethechangesinducedbythe
derived and real fix, respectively. We define two types of simi-larity based on how the equivalence operator between two de-pendency changes: (a) Type A: two changes will be regarded
equivalent,iftheysharethesamepackage,majorversion,and
directdependencyconstraints;(b) Type B:twochangeswillbe

Hyperparameters. Table2showsthetunedhyperparameters,by
applyingBayesianoptimizationalgorithmtoourtrainingdataset.
To understand how NuFix balances the developers’ preferences,
we compared the average value of each weighted preference-based
factor (i.e., 𝛼𝑘*𝑧𝑘and𝛼/prime
𝑘*𝑧𝑘for our two optimization models, re-
spectively), which indicates the factor influence for seeking fixes.
FromTable3,wecantellthatfor.NETpractitioners:(1)ensuring
the compatibility of packages (indicated by 𝑘=1,2,3) plays a
leading role in DM issue fixing; In practice, dependency upgrades
(𝑘=2) are preferable to downgrades ( 𝑘=3); (2) NU1608 warnings
(indicatedby 𝑘=8)aremuchmoreintolerablethanNU1103and
NU1701warningsfordevelopers;(3)developersindeedpreferto
install packages as few as possible ( 𝑘=4) and introduce fewer
packages targeting inconsistent .NET platform with their client
projects (𝑘=5), but these two preferences are not the top priority.

it does not support a variant model to seek risky fixes if safe fixes

cause test failures. Encouragingly, NuFix achieves 73.3% TPRon
average, owing to its well-defined objective function (i.e., prefer
fewerupgrades/downgradesofdependencies’majorversionsand
fewer changes in direct dependency versions). The above TPRcan
be improved via iteratively refining the search scope of package
versions by developers. However, CUDF and PyDFix do not re-
strict their algorithms to seek solutions with fewer package up-
grades/downgradescrossingmajorversions.Instead,theyreward
thefixeswithmoreup-to-datepackages.Asresult,onaverage,they
achieve 34.6% and 20.8% TPR, respectively.
NuFix achieves the Type AandType Bsimilarities of 55.7% and
74.3%,respectively,whichsignificantlyoutperformsthebaseline
approaches. Figure 7 shows the distribution of five properties of
the generated fixes. We can observe that: (1) N-fixes can better
satisfyPreferences 1 and2than real fixes, which is indicated by the
fact that𝑃/prime

it considers Properties 2 and3as user preferences. (4) CUDF and

Similarity, we performed expert validation in § 5.3.
5.3 RQ4: Usefulness of NuFix
Inthisresearchquestion,weaimtovalidatetheusefulnessof NuFixbymeansofthefeedbackfrom.NETexpertsandprojectdevelopers.
Setup for Expert Validation. A DM issue can have multiple
fixing solutions. As such, we want to evaluate if a fix generated by
NuFix is valid even if it differs significantly from the real fix. To
conducttheevaluation,weinvited.NETexpertsfromindustryto
manually assess the generated fixes.
•Participants. Weinvitedten.NETexpertswithoverthreeyears
development experience from Microsoft to participate in our
study.
•Subjects.All the top fixes generated by NuFix in § 5.2 were se-
lectedif(1)their Similarity (eitherType AorB)withthecorre-
sponding real fixes is less than 50%; and (2) they do not result in
test failures. 123 pairs of N-fixes and real fixes were selected.
•Procedure. Theformalstudysessionwassupervisedbytwoau-
thors.Weprovideda10-minutebriefingtothetenparticipants
on the two tasks before starting the tasks.–
Task1.Backgroundinformationcollection. Wecollectedfrom
the participants (1) their experience in years, (2) the .NET
platforms that they have worked on, and (3) whether they
haveencounteredDMissues intheirprojectsinthe pastthree
months. We collected the information to investigate whether
the participants had experience in dealing with DM issues.
–Task 2. Fix assessment. Each participant was assigned to exam-
ine 12 or 13 fix pairs. The participant was asked to choose the
preferred fix in each fix pair. To facilitate that, the participantwasgiventheoriginaldependencyconfigurationaswellasthe
DMissuesaroseforeachfixpair.Wealsoprovidedeachpar-
ticipant a visualization of the package dependency graph after
adopting a fix. The graph contains the updated packages and
the information of their five properties (Figure 7) as auxiliary
info.Toavoidbiasedresults,wedidnotdisclosetoparticipants
which of the fix in a fix pair is the real fix or the N-fix.
Setup forProject Developer Validation. Wefurthervalidated
the usefulness of N-fixes by checking if the project developers
would replace their real fixes with N-fixes. We wanted to focus on
the N-fixes of those projects whose developers were more likelyto give us feedback. Therefore, from the 123 N-fixes (selected in
expert validation), we chose the ones if they satisfy: (1) their code
repositories have commit records in the past month (actively main-
tained),and(2)therearenodependencyupdatessincethesereal
fixesaremerged(ensuringthecurrentconfigurationsequaltherealfixes). Following these two criteria, we finally chose 25 N-fixes. We
made pull requests (PRs) to revise their configurations based on
the N-fixes. The pull requests also explained the improvements of
oursuggested configurationsin termsof thefive properties(e.g.,
inducing fewer packages).
EthicalConsiderations. Weprovidedall.NETexpertswitha
form that informed them about the study purpose, the data we col-
lectedandstored,andemailtocontactusincasetheyhadconcerns.
Additionally, before making PRs to project developers for valida-
tion,wehavethoroughlytestedthefixesderivedbyNuFix,toavoid
spamming the open-source community. All PRs were submitted in
compliance with projects’ contribution guidelines and licenses.
Results of Expert Validation. Figures 8(1) and (2) show the
experience background of our participants. 40% of participants
have 10-15 years experience in .NET development and 70% of themare proficient with more than four types of platforms. In particular,
they all have experience with DM issues in the past three months.
TheexpertvalidationresultsaredescribedinFigure8(3).In70.7%
of the cases, participants preferred the fixes generated by NuFix to
therealfixes.Whilein22.8%ofcases,theyconfirmedthateitherof
thetwofixeswasacceptableforthem,sincethefixeswereevenly

commented on a pair of fixes for resolving DM issues (2 NU1107
and 12 NU1202 errors) in commit#3bb49c4 ofh5[20]: “One fix (real
fix)addressedtheissuesatthecostofinducingtwoNU1608warnings.
While the other fix (N-fix) is excellent because it did not cause any
warnings with one more upgrade of package’s major version.”
In eight cases (6.5%), experts only adopted the real fixes. We fur-
theranalyzedtheseinstancesandfoundthattoguaranteefewerup-grades/downgradesofdependencies’majorversions(higherweight
in NuFix’s objective function), NuFix derived the fixes at the ex-pense of introducing numerous additional packages. For exam-ple,toresolveeightNU1202issuesincommit#008e928 ofproject

Developers of these projects have not made decisions. We have
not received rejection of our suggestions. The results indicate that
N-fixes can resolve the encountered DM issues better than or as
good as the original fixes. A developer specially left a comment in
PR#43[18]ofcharlessolar :“Atthetimeconfigurationhadissues,
but I believe that they were fixed by these commits.”
Developers also showed interest in the NuFix tool. For example,
one developer commented “For my own curiosity, what is the name
of the tool you used to generate the fixes? Please do share it once you
are ready! ”, in Fortnox’s PR #41 [ 17]. Details of our PRs can be
found on NuFix’s website.
6 THREATS TO VALIDITY
Subjectivity of Inspection. In our empirical study, we adopted
manual analysis to construct the taxonomy of fixing strategies
and discuss developers’ configuration preferences. The manual
analysis may pose threats to the validityof empirical findings. To
minimizethisthreat,weadoptedanopencodingprocedure[ 33],to
categorize the results. Each issue report was inspected and labelled
bytwoco-authorsindependently.Anydiscrepancywasdiscussedand resolved by the third author, until consensus was reached.Biasin ExpertValidation.

besubjecttobias.Tolimitthisbias,weinvestigatedparticipants’
profiles and ensured they have over three years .NET development
experience.Inparticular,theyhavedealtwithDMissuesinthepast
three months. To guarantee that they fully understand the tasks,
we gathered ten experts and gave them a 10-minute briefing at
the beginning of study session. We did not disclose to participants
which fix was the real fix/N-fix in each given fix pair.

Various studies have been made on depen-

Studies[49,70,83–85]mainlyfocusondetectingdependencyissues

for GNU/Linux-based distributions. Vouillon et al. [ 81,82] identify
a set of packages that cannot be installed/upgraded together, us-
ing graph-theoretic transformations. Mancinelli et al. [ 65] propose
an approach that formulates the resolution of dependencies andinter-package conflicts as a linear optimization problem amongfeasible upgrade solutions. Recent techniques [

However, these existing works are inapplicable to resolve the

for the defined user preferences, (2) a rigorous process to assign
weights for user preferences, and (3) providing an optimal sub-
solution when a perfect solution fixing all issues does not exist. In
this paper, we address these limitations and propose an effective
techniquetoderiveDMissuefixes,inwhichdevelopers’preferences
are empirically investigated and systematically explored.
