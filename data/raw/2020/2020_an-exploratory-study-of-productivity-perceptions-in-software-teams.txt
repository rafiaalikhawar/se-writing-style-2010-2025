1 INTRODUCTION
Software development organizations face constant pressure to in-
crease the speed, volume, and quality of their software production.
As companies may not have the resources to address these goals
by increasing team size, organizations must look to improving the
productivity of those involved in producing the software. A desire
to improve software development productivity is not new: Boehm
wrote eloquently about the need for improved software productivity 
in the late 1980s [8]. Many have since studied appropriate measures

impact software development productivity (e.g., [ 29]). Recognizing
thesignificantimpactindividualshaveontheproductivityofasoft-
waredevelopmentorganization,recentresearchhasplacedmore
emphasis on the individuals involved in the development process,
andinparticular,onhowtheyviewtheirownproductivity[ 31,40].
Recent research also suggests that the measurement of produc-
tivityneedstoincludemultipledimensionsofindividualmetrics,
including such aspects as satisfaction, activity, and flow [29, 35].
However, individuals do not work alone on a software develop-
ment project. Software development teams, comprising multiple
individuals,areattheheartofmostcomplexsoftwaredevelopment
projects. Individuals constantly must make trade-offs to balance
makingprogressontheirindividualworkversushelpingateam-
mate (e.g., [ 39]). Despite the necessary and central role of teams in
software development, surprisingly few studies focus on team soft-
waredevelopmentproductivity,andthosethatdo,studyasnapshot
of development. For instance, Lakhanpa et al., using a one-time
survey, found team cohesion to be the dominating factor wheninvestigating team performance [
32]. These studies leave open
manyquestionsabouttheinterplaybetweenindividualandteam
productivity. We focus our analysis on the following:RQ1:
What is the relationship between perceived team and indi-
vidual productivity in software teams?
RQ2:Whichteamfactorsaffectindividualandteamproductivity
perceptions?
To investigate these questions, we undertook a three-month
multi-modal study in which we collected daily self-reports from25 software developers within five companies in North America
andEurope.Thesesurveys,collectedonadailyandbi-hourlybasis,

2 RELATED WORK
Traditionally, productivity is defined as the ratio of outputs over
inputs,whereoutputisvalueproducedandinputistimeorother
costs invested [ 47]. While this definition can work well in some
contexts, like manufacturing, it is not easily applied to software
development as outputs and inputs tend to be difficult to quantify.
We consider how our work builds on and compares to quantifying
software development productivity, as well as individual developer
andteamproductivity.AsourstudywasconductedduringCOVID-
19, which provides a unique work situation, we also consider how
our study compares to other efforts to study software development
during COVID-19.
Quantifying Software Development Productivity
Two primary approaches are employed in the effort to quantify
development work: automated process metrics and self-reported
perceivedproductivity.Automatedprocessmetricstypicallyrelyon
activitymetrics,suchasthelinesofsourcecode(SLOC)written[ 22,
55], function points [ 1,27], or change requests fulfilled [ 14,43].
These‘objectivemeasures’mayonlybecapturingasmallpartof
a developer’s work [ 52] and may not be commensurate with the
actualvalueproducedorprogressmade.Somequestionthevery
concept of measuring productivity [ 31], noting that people tend to
optimizeforwhatevermetricisbeingused—aphenomenonknown
as Goodhart’s law [ 15,24]. These metrics may underestimate work
donefortasksthatareessential,butthatdonotproduceimmediate
tangibleoutput,suchastrainingforanewskillormentoringanew
hire. To overcome these challenges, recent efforts have considered
perceivedproductivityandwhatimpactsit[ 29,40,41].Inthispaper,
we use self-reported productivity to explore the interplay between
individual and team productivity.Individual Developer Productivity
Researchershaveinvestigatedhowtheperceivedproductivityof
individualdevelopersrelatestoanumberoffactors.Forexample,
job aspects that motivate developers or bring enjoyment correlate
with higher productivity and job satisfaction [ 5,29]. Positive af-
fect states, indicating happier moods, have been shown to boost
developer problem-solving skills and productivity [ 2,25,40,44].
Likewise,developer’smoodswereshowntoinfluenceperformance

hand,areoftencitedasoneofthemostprominentfactorsinfluenc-
ing productivity, increasing anxiety and error rate, and reducing
performance[ 3,18,34,46]. Ourstudydiffers fromthese effortsin
focusingonhowperceptionsofindividualandteamproductivity
relate.
Team Productivity
Otherresearchhaslookedintosoftwaredevelopmentteamproduc-
tivity.Severalaspectshavebeenshowntopotentiallypredictthe
success of software teams, including organization, teamwork struc-
tures, and cohesion. Early research by Boehm [ 9] indicated that
productivity on a software development project is most affected
by who develops the system and how well they are organized and
managedasateam.BendifallahandScacchi[ 6]foundthatvariation
in teamwork productivity and quality could best be explained in
terms of recurring teamwork structures, categorized by patterns of
interaction. Lakhanpa et al. found team cohesion to be the domi-
nating factor when investigating the influence of team cohesion,
experience, and capability on team performance [ 32]. A recent
literature review [ 12] revealed 37 factors to be pertinent to team
productivity in software development, including individual charac-
teristicssuchasworkexperience[ 21]andskill/competence[ 36,45].
Among interaction factors, collaboration [ 16,17], team member
availability[ 21,36]andeaseofcommunication[ 54,56]werefound
tobe predictiveof teamproductivity. Konotes thatthere arefour
lensesthroughwhichtothinkaboutproductivityinsoftwaredevel-
opment:theindividual,team,market,andthefull-spectrum,and
suggest that a single measure may not suffice for capturing perfor-
mance[30].Thoughpastworkhaslookedatindividualandteam
productivity separately, we aim to bridge this gap by exploring
howindividualsperceivetheirteam’sproductivityandhowthey
understand their own productivity in the team context.
Remote Work and the Pandemic
Our study took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the
resultthatparticipantsworkedprimarilyfromtheirhomeoffices.
Whileworkingfromhomeisoftenclaimedtoimproveproductiv-
ity [13,20,37], a study by Russell et al. found that working from
homeisassociatedwithgreaterlevelsofbothworkpressureand
work-lifeconflict[ 49,p.92]becauseworkintrudesintodevelopers’
homelivesthroughworkingunpaidovertime,thinkingaboutwork
in off hours, exhaustion, and sleeplessness [ 26]. It should be noted
that working from home in a pandemic is not representative of
regular remote work situations in which the employee might work
from a home office or elsewhere outside the office. A recent study
exploredhowhumanandorganizationalfactorsinfluencesoftware

3 STUDY DESIGN
As the activities related to software development can vary sub-
stantiallyweektoweek[ 38],amajorobjectiveforourstudywas
toconsidersoftwaredevelopersandsoftwaredevelopmentteams
acrossseveralweeks.ThestudytimelineispresentedinFigure1.
We targeted a study duration of 8 weeks to capture a longer period
of development (all teams participated for 10 to 14 weeks); as most
teams were using an agile approach, this time span worked out
to a few sprints. Given the length of the study and the need to
gather input from the software developers, we needed to choose
study instruments that allowed collection of data frequently; we
used bi-hourly self-reports, daily surveys, and monthly interviews
to gather data frequently while not causing our participants to
disengage from survey fatigue. We describe the participants in our
study,thesurveyinstrumentsusedandcollecteddata,andreport
on the quantitative and qualitative analysis methods we applied to
the data.
In the interest of transparency and reproducibility, we have
posted the survey materials, deidentified quantitative data (from
the daily surveys and bi-hourly self-reports), and the data analysis
scripts on the Open Science Framework at [ 50]. We have not made
public the qualitative data from the daily surveys or interviews
due to the risk of deanonymization, but include the corresponding
survey and interview material for replication.3.1 Participants

3.2 Survey Instrument & Collected Data
To gain a broader perspective of productivity, this multi-modal
studycombinedbi-hourlyself-reports,dailysurveys,monthlyin-
terviews, and post-study follow-up surveys. Though the minimum
requirement for participation was 8 weeks, all five teams partici-
pated for 10 to 14 weeks (mean = 12.4, SD = 1.625). We collected
624 daily surveys and 2899 bi-hourly self-reports, with an average
of 25 daily surveys and 116 bi-hourly self-reports per participant.

Daily surveys were filled out via an online portal at the end of
each workday. These surveys asked participants about the individ-
ual and team productivity they had reported throughout the day
Figure 3: Team Productivity Graph in Daily Survey
(usingavisualizationgeneratedfromtheirbi-hourlyself-reports)
and to reflect on any patterns or differences. Further questions
centered around several teamwork-related factors, such as how
many team interactions they had experienced that day and how
related these interactions were to work; time spent in meetings
and time spent in unplanned work; how negatively they felt about
interruptions that day; how collaborative their tasks were, and
whetheranythingelsehadinfluencedtheirwork(openquestion).
Table 1 provides an overview of the questions, and Figure 3 shows
an example of the graphs the survey presented for reflection.
Audio-recorded Interviews were conducted monthly (at the
start, middle, and end of the study). These were primarily used
tocheckinwithparticipantsandmonitorforanymajorchanges
in their work or team. Additionally, we used them to question
participants about their perceptions of productivity and their team,
including how they assess productivity, which factors influence
their productivity, and how they define their team. An overview of
the questions asked in these interviews can be found in Table 1.
Follow-up surveys were employed via an online form to ask
participantsseveraladditionalquestions,includingdemographics
and the criteria by which they believe their supervisor assesses
them. The full survey is included in the replication package [50].
3.3 Quantitative Analysis
We performed statistical analysis to investigate correlations be-
tweendifferentfactors(presentedinTable3),visualizeratingsover
time(Figure4),andgeneratearegressionmodeloffactorsaffecting
teamproductivity (Table4). Thedata sourceincluded Likert-style
ratings from both the daily surveys and bi-hourly self-reports. We
included in the analysis participants who submitted at least two
bi-hourly self-reports and one end-of-day survey per day for a
minimumoftwoweeks(i.e.,tendailysurveysand20bi-hourlyself-
reports in total), as we considered two weeks a minimum baseline
for balancing out possible day-to-day variation. This resulted in 24

anddeviationwerecalculatedperparticipant.Thisnormalization
step eases comparison between participants. Quantitative analyses
were conducted with R (version 4.0.5, https://www.R-project.org/).
Linear regression models were created using the lme4package
[4]. Tables were created in part using the apaTables package [ 51].
To facilitate transparency, we have posted the survey materials,
deidentified quantitative data, and scripts for data analysis here
[50].
Means, standard deviations, and correlations with confidence
intervals are shown in Table 3.
Figure 4 shows the weekly average individual productivity (dot-
ted) and team productivity (solid) for Teams 3 and 5. It can be seen
that both lines are highly individual for each team.
Quantitative scores were further used to give context to qual-
itative (open-text) answers from the same daily survey response.
For example, when a participant talked about "meetings" when
respondingtothefactorsthathadaneffectontheirproductivity,
we referenced the rating they gave for individual productivity and
whether it was lower, higher, or equal to the participant’s average
to understand the sentiment behind the response.
3.4 Qualitative Analysis
Qualitative analysis focused on open-ended questions and was
performed on the following data:
Interview transcriptions: questions on team definition (in-
forming results in 4.1) and assessing productivity (4.2 and 4.3).
Follow-up survey: question on assessing productivity (4.3).
Dailysurveys: questionsonteam-relatedactivities,natureof
unplanned work, and factors affecting productivity (4.4).
For all three, we employed the reflexive thematic analysis intro-
duced by Braun and Clarke [ 10] from a critical-realist perspective.
The6-stepprocessincludedgainingfamiliaritywiththedata,in-
ductively generating codes, searching for themes/clusters of codes,
reviewing these themes, defining and naming themes, and produc-
ing a final summary. One author led the process, with two other
authorsinvolvedintheinitialcodingandthefinalthemeclustering.
Forboththeinterviewsandfree-formsurveyanswers,webegan
by coding half of the sample set and continuing until no novel
codeswereidentified,atwhichpointweconsideredconvergence
and saturation to be reached. In the end, we reached saturation
after fully coding the interviews of 14 participants (56%) and the
daily surveys of 20 participants (80%). Below, we discuss the most
frequently occurring themes. For the qualitative data, we use the ×
sign to indicate how many developers mentioned the theme.
4 RESULTS
In the following, we present the key themes of our analysis: (1)
thefluidnotionofteams,(2)thewaysanddifficultiesofgauging
team productivity by individual developers, (3) the discrepancy
betweenmanagers’anddevelopers’viewsonanindividual’spro-
ductivitywithinateam,and(4)theinterplaybetweenteam-related
factors and productivity perceptions. We focus primarily on the
team aspect of software development, though the collected data
also corroborates many earlier findings on individual productivity,
such as the positive effects of having clear goals, or the negative
effects of frequent context switches.4.1 The Fluid Notion of Teams
Inthethreemonthlyinterviews,weaskedparticipantshowthey
define their team and whether this team has changed since the
start of the study. We found that the concept of team is more fluid
than we initially expected. In the literature, a team in software
developmentisoftentreatedasawell-definedandfixedconcept.
Forinstance,inScrum–acommonagileprocessmodel–ateamis
defined as “small” (7 ±2 people) with “no sub-teams” and people
working“fulltimeintheteam”.1,2However,inpractice,theconcept
ofateammaybefluid,makingtheassessmentofteamproductivity
more difficult.
All participants in our study stated that they are part of a larger
team with up to 15 people. The participants described that these
larger teams sometimes change due to reorganizations; over the
courseofourstudy,fluctuationsinthemakeupoftheselargerteams
happenedinseveralcases.Participantsalsoexplainedthatthereare
teamsorsub-teamswithintheselargerteams (6×,43%).These
sub-teams were typically defined in terms of the people which
participantsinteractwithonaregularbasis,whomtheyhavethe
most knowledge about, and with whom they share tasks and goals.

This fuzzy and fluid notion of teams, combined with a lack of
interactionandknowledgeofthepeopleonthebiggerteams,makes
theassessmentof teamproductivitydifficult.Italsoraisesquestions
of whether there can be a single, or a few, definitions of what a
team is and how to determine what makes up a good team. For the
self-reportinginourstudy,weaskedparticipantstofocusonthe
“peoplethatyouinteractwithonaregularbasis,andwithwhich

thisasanappropriatedefinition,evenifthatmeantthedefinition
of a team was fluid.
4.2 Gauging Team Productivity by Individuals
Howdo developersgaugethe productivityoftheir team?Various
themes were identified in the final interviews regarding team pro-
ductivity, including that assessing team productivity is difficulteven when activity metrics are available. As a result, developers
use several proxies to gauge team productivity.
Assessingteamproductivityisdifficult,especiallyduetolimited
team awareness. Many participants explicitly stated that it was
difficultforthem toassesstheproductivityof theirteam,inlarge
partbecauseofalackofawarenessofwhattheirteamwasworking
on.Almosthalfofthecodedparticipants(9 ×,45%)mentionedat

of them being an individual contributor or a team manager.
/commentI just have no means or mechanism to easily determine how
much work they’ve done (S25)
/commentI don’t have insight into my team’s daily productivity (S12)
The prevalence of remote work contributed strongly to this lack
ofawarenessandthusthedifficultyingaugingteamproductivity.
From the 20 developers coded, only one participant worked mostly
in the office, four (20%) experienced remote and office work during
the study period, and the other 15 (75%) worked remotely most
ofthetime.Allsurveyresponsesforwhichparticipantsreported
having ‘no awareness’ of their team stem from days on which the
participants worked remotely.
/commentIthinkit’sabithardertosee,like,theproductivitywhen,like,

/commentSince I can’t see my team, I can only guess their productivity

Engagementwithteamisoftenusedtogaugeteamproductivity.
Theimportanceofteamawarenessingaugingteamproductivity
further manifests in participants often referring to their team in-
teractionswhenexplainingtheirteam’sproductivityinthedaily
survey. More than half of the coded participants (11 ×, 55%) explic-
itlymentionedtheengagementwiththeirteamintheseanswers,
talkingaboutthemeetings(11 ×),moregeneralinteractionswith
teammates (7 ×), or working together (5 ×).
/commentI was having productive discussions with my co-workers, so I
knew my teammates are also being productive (S1)
/commentTeam seemed consistently productive - had some meetings with
them and worked with them via slack/jira tickets/email on other
items (S10)
Theengagementthemewasalsoveryprominentforparticipants
thatspenttimeintheiroffice.Threeofthefourparticipantsthat
spent time collocated with their teammates explicitly used the
interaction as an indicator for the team’s productivity, even if it
was brief and did not necessarily cover the work performed during
the day.
/commentAsIhaveseenthemworkingandwhattheysaid,itmademe
the impression they were productive (S21)
/commentTeammemberswalkingintomyroomwithquestionsandissues
[...] As far as I saw, they looked quite productive today (S23)
Availabilityofothersusedasindicatorforproductivity. Onefactor
that was mentioned several times as an indicator for the team’s
productivity is the availability and responsiveness of teammates.
The more responsive teammates were, the more productive the
team was perceived. For instance, several participants explicitly
mentionedtheresponsivenessoftheirteammatesinchatapplica-
tions or on code review discussions as an explanation for a high or
low productivity rating (4 ×, 20%).
/commentMy team was responsive when I needed them to be (S24)
/commentEveryone I worked with was fairly responsive and we accom-
plished a lot together (S24)
Afewparticipantsalsorelatedtheresponsivenessofteammatesnot
justtotheirteamproductivity,butalsototheirownproductivity
when the lack of responsiveness might block them (3 ×, 15%).
/comment[Iwas]abletocommunicatetodifferentdepartmentsinatimely

Automated metrics sparsely used. All participating teams used
issuetrackers,versioncontrolsystems,andothertoolsthatprovide
metrics on team performance. Yet only a few participants (4 ×, 20%)
referred to automatically collected metrics, such as issue tracker
activityorcodereviewprogress,fortheirteamproductivityratings.
/commentI didn’t see many tickets moving forward on the kanban board,
and didn’t get any request for peer review of code either, so it looks
like the team did not feel very productive (S1)
On the contrary, some participants referred to a ‘feeling’ of how
productivetheirteamwasratherthanconcretemetricsthatthey
used to gauge team productivity (2 ×, 10%).
/commentI was not able to have a feeling about the output of the team
today (S16)
/commentIn the morning I heard that many things were already done.
In the afternoon I did not hear that much anymore so it’s more a
stomach feeling (S23)Oneteamevenexplicitlystatedatthebeginningofthestudythat
the progress tracked in their issue tracker is not being used for
assessing their team’s productivity due to the variance in task
complexity and size.
Individual productivity as a base. To gauge the team’s productiv-
ity, participants also used the perception of their own productivity
as a basis and assumed that the team’s productivity was similar
(3×, 15%).
/commentI tend to assume my team is as productive as I am (S10)
Based on their perception of their own productivity and how they
thought their activities differ from a usual day, participants ad-
justedtheteam’sproductivity.Forinstance,whenaparticipantwas
more distracted, had more meetings than usual, or more context
switches, they rate their team’s productivity higher than their own
productivity.
/commentSinceIcan’tseemyteam,Iassumetheyarebeingproductive.
Though I objectively think I got a fair amount done today. When I
look back at the day holistically, there were moments when I felt
moredistracted,andthereforeratedmyproductivitylower[than
my team] in that moment (S10)
/commentIwashavingtocontext-switchalottoday[morethanusual],but
I think other team members probably didn’t have to context-switch
as much (S24)
Thecloserelationbetweenindividualandteamproductivityper-
ception can also be seen in Figure 4, which illustrates the averaged
productivity ratings for the team and individual over the course of
thestudy.Thesmalldifferenceinmeanteamandindividualproduc-
tivity for the 2899 bi-hourly self-reports (Mean 𝑇𝑒𝑎 𝑚= 4.61±0.78;
Mean 𝐼𝑛𝑑=4.47±0.70) as well as the 624 daily surveys (Mean 𝑇𝑒𝑎 𝑚=
4.98±0.79); Mean 𝐼𝑛𝑑=4.96±0.66) for the 25 participants further
illustrate the close relation.
Thiscloserelationisexpected,sincethemoreproductiveeach
individual developer is, the more productive the team can be. How-
ever,participantsfrequentlydelineatedthemselvesfromtheirteam,
referring to the team as ‘the others’ and excluding themselves. For
instance, participant S24, a member of the test team, stated:
/commentThe test team was blocked by the test environment being down,
butIwasnot effectedandinfact itprobablyallowedmetobemore
productive on my individual tasks (S24)
Onlyinrareinstancesdidparticipantstalkabouttheteamasa‘we’.
/commentWehavebeenabletofinishsometasksuccessfulintheendof

This differentiation between team productivity and individual pro-
ductivity can also be seen in how solving team issues might be
considereddetrimentaltotheindividualproductivityinsomecases,
even though the individual helps the team.

4.3 Gauging Individual Productivity in Teams
Howisindividualproductivityassessedinateamcontext?Wewere
curious to know whether developers are assessed in their teams in
the way they perceive they are. To explore this question, we posed
the following assessment questions:
106An Exploratory Study of Productivity Perceptions in Software Teams ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA
For individual contributors: (asked in the follow-up survey)
In a few words, what would you say are the criteria your manager
uses to assess your productivity?
Formanagers: (askedintheinterviewandthefollow-upsurvey)
What criteria do you use to assess the productivity of your team?
Expectations from individuals differ from the ones of managers.
Participating individual contributors expect managers to predomi-
nantlyassessthembytakingintoaccountamoretraditionalpro-
ductivity notion based on input and output metrics such as
/commenthow long I am spending on my tasks (S24)
/commentunits of work completed per unit of time (S7)
/commentprojects completed (S25)
Twoparticipantsfurtherexpectedthemanagertoactivelytakeinto
account feedback or reviews from their team members (S2, S9).
Participating managers, on the other hand, often referred to a
moreholisticnotionofproductivitywhenassessingdevelopers,one
which explicitly recognizes that automatic metrics such as velocity
do not show the whole picture.
/commentMetricssuchasbugfixesandflowstreamhelp,buttheyarenot
the end-all-be-all (S6)
/commentHowmuchtoilwasputin:theactualandtimeandeffort,rather
than just ticking off accomplishments (S11)
Other managers adopted an even broader notion of productivity
focusing on the commitments and impact:
/commentAchieving something close to what we committed with (S4)
/commentAccomplishing the right things which will have impact (S10)
Onepossibleexplanationforthisdiscrepancyisanunequalinter-
pretation of the question: perhaps “assessing” and “being assessed”
are not quite mirrored. The responses of individual contributors
suggest an interpretation of “how does my manager know I am
being productive?”, with answers mentioning indicators such as
peer feedback and velocity metrics. In other words, participants
listed the indicators which they believe their managers use to gain
awarenessoftheirproductivity.Themanagers,whenaskedhow
they assessthe productivityof their team,rather answered“what
doesitmeanformyteamtobeproductive?”,listingsuchfactorsas
commitments and accomplishing the right tasks.

A Model for Team Productivity
Toinvestigatetheinterplaybetweenteamandindividualproduc-
tivity, we collected data in the 624 daily surveys on team-related
factors and activities, in addition to the team and individual pro-
ductivity ratings. In particular, we were interested in team-related
activities, such as meetings, interactions, and interruptions, as well
as the focus of the task work on team or individual effort, since allTable 4: Factors Affecting Team Productivity

and they have often been mentioned in the past in context of in-
dividual productivity. We also included a variable on time spent
on unplanned work, since we hypothesized that such work mostly
stems from team issues in the collaborative setting of software
development. The answers in the daily survey on the nature of the
unplanned work further confirmed our hypothesis. For instance,
one participant reported the source of unplanned work as:
/commentAco-workerreachedouttomeaboutaproblemtheywerefacing,
and we both debugged it until we found a solution (S1)
We createdalinearmixed regressionmodelwiththe teampro-
ductivity rating as the dependent variable, the variables mentioned
above andlistedin Table 4as fixedeffects factors,and thepartici-
pants as random effects factor.3

own, or vice versa: in essence, they project their own personal pro-
ductivityontotheteam,whichwealsofoundinthequalitativedata
presentedinSection4.2.Weconjecturethatthisismorelikelyto
occur in the absence of team awareness. This correlation between
individual and team productivity is important to consider when
measuringteamproductivityforfuturestudies;itmaybewiseto
at the same time capture individual productivity. Though meetings
were often mentioned as a factor affecting productivity in the qual-
itative data (see below), we did not see a significant effect in the
model. This may be because meetings both drive progress forward
while concurrently fragmenting the workday and hindering focus.
Meetings
A majority of the participants (15 ×, 75%) stated that meetings have
a substantial impact on their individual productivity as well as
theirteam’sproductivity,andthatthisimpactcanbeeitherposi-

5 DISCUSSION
Insights from this study can help inform approaches to measure
productivity as well as how to enhance productivity.5.1 Measuring Productivity
Gauging Team Productivity
How to measure productivity for individual software developers
and software development teams remains a subject of inquiry
and debate. Within the last year, some have advocated for multi-
dimensionalapproaches toassessing individualproductivity [ 23],
whereasothersbelieve"teamproductivitycanbemeasuredatan
organizational scale with simple, holistic observations [...and...]
any serious failings in individual productivity can be discovered
by means of good organizational habits" [ 33]. Our results indicate
how tricky it is to measure, assess, or gauge team productivity,
whetherasaprojectionofindividualproductivityorthroughdirect
measurementapproaches.Thefluidityofteamsthatexistinsoft-
waredevelopmenttodaywouldneedtobeincorporatedintoany
assessment approaches. It may be that it is more important from
an organizational level to consider how software is actually being
produced,ratherthanhowtheorganizationalchartindicatesthe
softwareisbeingproduced.Thiskindofshiftisoccurringinsoft-
ware development as organizations begin focusing on the streams
of value being produced [11].
Effects of Team Factors
An avenue for future work would be to investigate how team char-
acteristics(e.g.size,workflow)orroles(manager,contributor)affect
productivity perceptions. In this work, we chose not to perform
a broad analysis of many teams, favoring instead to conduct an
in-depth longitudinal case study of a few teams to examine how
teamandindividualproductivityrelateovertime.Afuturestudy
could engage a wider sample of teams that vary systematically on
certain characteristics to investigate these questions.
5.2 Enhancing Productivity
Our results suggest possible changes to tools and processes that
may help enhance productivity in software development. These
improvements relate either to team awareness or to engagement.
Improving Team Awareness
The results of our study suggest that developers often lack aware-
ness of their team’s work and progress, corroborating previous
findings[ 53].Giventhatourstudywasconductedduringtheun-
precedented remote work situation of the COVID-19 pandemic,
this lack of awareness may have been more pronounced as team
members did not often have the chance to meet in person. Our par-
ticipants used a number of digital collaboration tools, for example,
MicrosoftTeams,Slack,andZoomforcommunication;Screenfor
para-programming; and Atlassian Jira and other digital Scrum and
Kanbanboardsforprogresstracking.Thoughthecommunication
tools help to gauge presence, and progress trackers help to provide
quantitative metrics, these tools only give a surface-level measure
of productivity, and the process of combining these data can be
tedious.Thereisaneedforimprovingawarenessbybettercommu-
nication and collaboration tool design. It is, however, impressive
that despite this lack of team awareness, coordination seems to be
effectiveenoughforcomplexprojectstosucceed.Itmaybeinter-
esting to investigate how much team awareness software teams

optimize for minimal interruptions.
Improving Engagement
Participantsinourstudyrecognizedtheneedforengagementwith
other team members. However, they struggled with how to en-
gage most effectively. Well-run and structured meetings have been
shown to supportengagement [ 40], but itremains challenging for
meetingsto successfullyengagepeoplein projectsdespite advice
andprotocolsbeingavailableonhowtobeststructureandrunsuch
meetings.Futureresearchshoulddelveintothenatureofthedif-
ferent kinds of engagement required within software development
teams.Identifyingataxonomyofengagementtypeswouldprovide
a foundation for assessing different approaches to increase engage-
ment. Engagement could be increased through adopting processes
suchas meetingprotocols, usinganappropriate technologicalso-
lution,or improvingthe structureof communication,forexample
discussionsbasedonissuesinsidetheissuetracker,comparedto
chat channels.
6 THREATS TO VALIDITY
External Validity
Asoursamplesetfeaturedonlyfiveteams,generalizabilitytoother
development companies and developers might be limited. These
companies were recruited through word-of-mouth, social media,
and other personal and professional contacts, and may therefore
exhibit a sampling bias. We tried to mitigate this bias by recruiting
teamsoffourcompanieswithdifferentproductfocuses,inNorth
America and Europe. Furthermore our sample set does not exhibit
an equal gender balance. In recruiting participants, our primary
aim was to include full teams (as many members from a team as
possible),andwethereforedidnotoptimizefordemographicrepre-
sentation. Our gender distribution was 21 self-reporting males and
4 self-reporting females (16%). This percentageof females comes
closetothe20%participationoffemalesreportedinsoftwarede-
velopmentintheUSA[ 19].Itshouldalsobenotedthatsincethe
study took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, with most (21 of
25)participantsworkingremotely,thesurveyresponsesmaynot
reflect normalcy and should be interpreted with this in mind.

Internal Validity
Thedailyquestionaboutpatternsinteamandindividualproduc-
tivity were accompanied by a graph displaying the participant’s
bi-hourly self-reports for the day, to help with reflection. However,
five participants reported issues with the graph: four saw issues in-
termittentlyandoneregularly.Thismayhaveaffectedtheaccuracy
with which participants recalled their productivity for the day.One question that arises is whether measures of perceived team
productivity have value, considering that participants have limited
awarenessoftheirteam.Inthiswork,wedidnotaimtocaptureob-
jective team productivity, but rather to understand how developers
perceive theirteam’s productivityeven inthe absenceof concrete
knowledge. At times, some participants did not answer the team
productivity question or might have also guessed. However, the
thoughtfulanswerstotheopen-endeddailyquestionsonthepro-
ductivitypatternsanddifferences(Table1),whichoftenreferredto
teammates’ activities and meetings, give us cause to believe that
thereceivedresponsesreflectthedevelopers’perceptionofteam
productivity given the information available to them.
7 CONCLUSION
This work aims to bridge the gap between individual and team
productivity in software development through a longitudinal user
studythatexploresindividualperceptionsofproductivityinateam
context.Amongotherquestions,weinvestigateddevelopers’aware-
nessoftheirteam,definitionsandmeasuresofproductivityfrom
individual and managerial perspectives, and factors predicting per-
ceived team productivity. We present a methodology for undertak-
ingalongitudinalstudyofsoftwareteams,findingsaboutdeveloper
perceptions of their team’s productivity, and a replication pack-
age with the study material and anonymized quantitative data. We
saw several themes emerge from the 624 daily survey responses
collected from 25 developers in 5 teams. The findings suggest that
developers operate in a fluid team construct with fuzzy, frequently
changingboundaries.Furthermore,developersoftenlackawareness
of their team’s productivity. Finally, the most significant predictor
of perceived team productivity was the reported individual produc-
tivity, above factors such as team interaction, unplanned work and
timespentinmeetings.Wesuggestthatfutureresearchshouldfur-
ther explore theintricacies of developmentin a broader spectrum
of collaboration (e.g., as an individual, between collaborators, in
teams, and on the organizational level) and to consider what the
fluidityanddynamismofthesecollaborativestructuresmeanfor
the success of software projects.
