Abstract —The rapid spread of COVID-19 has made man-
ual contact tracing difﬁcult. Thus, various public health au-
thorities have experimented with automatic contact tracing
using mobile applications (or “apps”). These apps, however,
have raised security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we
propose an automated security and privacy assessment tool—
COVIDG UARDIAN —which combines identiﬁcation and analysis
of Personal Identiﬁcation Information (PII), static program
analysis and data ﬂow analysis, to determine security and privacy
weaknesses. Furthermore, in light of our ﬁndings, we undertake
a user study to investigate concerns regarding contact tracing
apps. We hope that COVIDG UARDIAN , and the issues raised
through responsible disclosure to vendors, can contribute to
the safe deployment of mobile contact tracing. As part of this,
we offer concrete guidelines, and highlight gaps between user
requirements and app performance.
I. INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 is now a global pandemic affecting over 200
countries, after its ﬁrst recorded outbreak in December 2019.
To counter its spread, numerous measures have been under-
taken by public health authorities, e.g., quarantining, lock-
downs, curfews, physical distancing, and mandatory use of
face masks. Identifying those who have been in close contact
with infected individuals, followed by self-isolation (so called
contact tracing) has proven particularly effective [60]. Conse-
quently, contact tracing has emerged as a key tool to mitigate
the spread of COVID-19.
Unfortunately, manual contact tracing, using an army of
“detectives” has proven challenging for many countries [28,
34, 48]. Therefore, authorities around the world have sought to
develop contact tracing applications (or “apps”) that can auto-
mate the process. A plethora of country-centric contact tracing
apps and services are currently deployed. These include the
Health Code in China [62], the public COVID-19 website in
South Korea [19], and the mobile contact tracing apps released
in Australia [33], Germany [47], Israel [58], Singapore [24],
and United Kingdom [59]. These apps operate by attempting
to record prolonged and close proximity between individuals
by using proximity sensing methods, e.g., Bluetooth. The data
gathered is then used to notify people who may have come in
contact with an infected person.
Proponents argue that the low cost and scalable nature of
contact tracing apps make them an attractive tool for health
authorities. However, they have proven controversial due to
potential violations of privacy [49] and the security conse-
quences of the mass-scale installation of (rapidly developed)TABLE I

apps across entire populations. Despite attempts to alleviate
these concerns, it is well-known that the anonymization of
individuals’ information is a challenging problem [32]. To
mitigate these concerns, we develop a methodology for assess-
ing the security and privacy weaknesses of COVID-19 contact
tracing apps.
Speciﬁcally, this paper consists of the following key tasks:
(i) we develop a tool, COVIDG UARDIAN , which uses static
and dynamic program analysis, as well as a keyword database
utilizing natural language processing (NLP) technology, to
identify security weaknesses and personally identiﬁable infor-
mation (PII) leakage in apps; (ii) we conduct a comprehensive
security and privacy assessment across 40 state-of-the-practice
global contact tracing apps (listed in Table I); (iii) based on
the assessment results, we conduct a user study involving 373
participants, to investigate user concerns and the requirements
of contact tracing apps. Through our study, we aim to answer
the following research questions:
RQ1: What is the performance of our security and privacy
assessment methodology, COVIDG UARDIAN , compared to
state-of-the-practice mobile app assessment tools?
RQ2: What is the security and privacy status of state-of-
the-practice contact tracing apps?
RQ3: What is the robustness of state-of-the-practice contact
tracing apps against potential security and privacy threats?
RQ4: What are the user concerns and requirements of
contact tracing apps?
The main contributions of our study are as follows.

We develop COVIDG UARDIAN ,1theﬁrst automated secu-
rity and privacy assessment tool that tests contact tracing
apps for security weaknesses, malware, embedded trackers
and private information leakage. COVIDG UARDIAN out-
performs 4 state-of-the-practice industrial and open-source
tools.
We assess the security and privacy status of 40 worldwide
Android contact tracing apps. We discover more than 50% of
the apps pose potential security risks due to: ( i) employing
cryptographic algorithms that are insecure or not part of
best practice (72.5%); and ( ii) storing sensitive information
in clear text that could be potentially read by attackers
(55.0%). Over 40% of apps pose security risks through
Manifest weaknesses, e.g., allowing permissions for backup
(hence, the copying of potentially unencrypted application
data). Further, we identify that approximately 75% of the
apps contain at least one tracker, potentially causing privacy
violations, i.e., leaks that lead to exposing PII to third
parties.
By reviewing the state-of-the-art, we identify four major
privacy and security threats against contact tracing apps. Our
threat analysis ﬁnds that apps adopting decentralized archi-
tectures are not necessarily more secure than those adopting
centralized architectures (by our measures). We also conduct
a user study involving 373 participants, to investigate user
concerns and requirements. The survey results indicate that
the tracing accuracy and potential privacy risks are the two
major concerns. Compared to users’ expectations of accurate
proximity recording, users are more likely to use contact
tracing apps with better privacy by design.
We have disclosed our security and privacy assessment
reports to the related stakeholders on 23 May 2020. We
have received acknowledgements from numerous vendors,
such as MySejahtera (Malaysia), Contact Tracer (USA), and
Private Kit (USA). Our re-assessments shown in Table V
conﬁrm that their updates have addressed several of the
issues identiﬁed.
We believe our study can provide useful insights for gov-
ernment policy makers, developers, and researchers to build
secure contact tracing apps, and to contain infectious diseases
in the present and future.
II. B ACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
A. Taxonomy of Contact Tracing Apps
The country-centric contact tracing apps we study fall into
two broad categories: ( i) centralized and ( ii) decentralized.
Centralized architectures. Many apps utilize a centralized
system in which a central server is responsible for: ( i) collect-
ing the contact records from diagnosed users; and ( ii) evalu-
ating the health status of users and selecting who to notify.
For example, in China and South Korea, centralized contact
tracing systems were rapidly developed and released. These
systems helped health authorities to successfully control the
1Publicly available at https://covid-guardian.github.io/.spread of COVID-19. However, a huge amount of PII was
collected [46, 62].
For instance, TraceTogether [24] from Singapore and
COVIDSafe [33] from Australia rely on proximity tracing via
Bluetooth broadcasts from apps. That said, designs that expose
PII may not work well in countries with certain societal norms.
Thus, many western countries developed solutions with no
PII related information exchange, e.g.,PEPP-PT [70] and the
ROBERT system [69] implemented by StopCovid France .
Decentralized architectures. The second type of solution is
decentralized, where ( i) the back-end server is only responsible
for collecting the anonymous identiﬁers of diagnosed users;
and ( ii) the data is processed locally on the device to identify
who to alert. This design prevents the central server from
knowing at-risk persons or their contacts.
These decentralized apps operate in a range of ways. For
example, Hamagen [58] relies on location information. Users
download the location history of diagnosed users from a back-
end server to check if they been in contact with any infected
people. Other decentralized solutions, e.g.,DP3T [71] and
the Exposure Notiﬁcation framework by Google and Apple
(Gapple) [4], utilize Bluetooth beacons. In this design, users
periodically download the anonymous identiﬁers of infected
people and compare them against previously encountered bea-
cons to compute the risk of exposure. Note that NHS COVID-
19[59] and Corona Warn App [64] implement the Gapple
framework. This design paradigm reduces the privacy exposure
of users as only anonymous identiﬁcations are shared.
B. Related Work
A number of prior works have utilized similar methodolo-
gies to COVIDG UARDIAN . We discuss them below.
Security and privacy analysis for mobile apps. COVID-
GUARDIAN relies on static code analysis. This is performed
by examining source code for signs of security vulnerabilities
without executing the program. In contrast, dynamic analysis
executes the code. Whereas static analysis often suffers from
false positives, dynamic analysis is limited by the execution
coverage [63]. Several studies [29, 30, 52, 55, 68, 75, 78]
have used static analysis to analyze different types of software
in search of malicious behaviours and privacy leaks. Static
analysis techniques are also widely used in the practical
assessment of mobile apps. For example, Q ARK [12] is a
static code analysis tool designed to discover various mobile
security-related vulnerabilities, either in source code or APKs.
ANDRO BUGS [1] is a framework that helps developers ﬁnd
potential mobile security vulnerabilities by pattern-matching.
MOBSF [9] offers automated application penetration testing,
malware analysis, and a security and privacy assessment
framework. F LOW DROID [21] statically computes data ﬂows
in apps to understand which parts of the code that data may
be exposed to.
Notably, these off-the-shelf tools only utilize syntax-based
scanning and data-ﬂows. Therefore, they cannot verify any
identiﬁed vulnerabilities, which leads to numerous false posi-
tives that are not relevant to PII data leakage. Thus, COVID-
1086Fig. 1. (a) COVIDG UARDIAN : An overview of our security and privacy assessment methodology; (b) An example pattern of rendering a view widget.
GUARDIAN complements this with other methodologies, in-
cluding the use of third party malware detection and tech-
niques for data ﬂow analysis.
Contact tracing apps analysis. Several works [23, 36]
have focused on security and privacy analysis of the Blue-
tooth and cryptography speciﬁcations published by Apple
and Google [42, 43], arguing that signiﬁcant risks may be
present. Other work [51, 54] has conducted a review of
centralized and decentralized solutions, and proposed privacy-
preserving contact tracing using a zero-knowledge protocol.
Sun et al. [67] proposed a privacy-by-design solution, termed
VENUE TRACE , which enables contact tracing of users based
on venues they have visited. V ENUE TRACE preserves user’s
privacy by avoiding information exchanges between users
and no private data is exposed to back-end servers. He et
al.[38] inspected the broad implications of COVID-19 related
apps, identifying the presence of malware. Wang et al. [74]
also performed a statistical analysis of contact tracing app
popularity, as well as user reviews.
Our work. In contrast to recent works on analyzing contact
tracing apps [23, 31, 36, 73, 73, 76], we not only propose and
develop a holistic automated security and privacy assessment
tool, COVIDG UARDIAN , but also undertake user studies to
perceive users’ concerns and requirements to reinforce security
and privacy by design. COVIDG UARDIAN works for both
centralized and decentralized apps.
III. M ETHODOLOGY OF COVIDG UARDIAN
In this section, we propose an automated security and pri-
vacy assessment tool, COVIDG UARDIAN , to identify security
and privacy risks in contact tracing apps. Using COVID-
GUARDIAN , we conduct a security and privacy assessment of
40 contact tracing apps from Google Play Store and evaluate
their security performance against four categories: ( i) manifest
weaknesses; ( ii) general security vulnerabilities; ( iii) data leaks
(with a focus on PII); and ( iv) malware detection (see Table II).
Further, we compare COVIDG UARDIAN with several state-
of-the-practice tools to evaluate its ability and performance.
An overview of COVIDG UARDIAN is shown in Fig-
ure 1(a). We ﬁrst compile a set of PII items, then perform:
(i) code analysis to detect Manifest weaknesses and security
risks; ( ii) data ﬂow analysis to reveal the privacy leaks in
contact tracing apps; and ( iii) malware detection.PII identiﬁcation (pre-processing). Considering the large-
scale use of COVID-19 contact tracing apps and the concerns
about PII data collection, we pre-process the contact tracing
apps to construct a PII keyword database. Figure 1(a) shows
the process of PII keyword database construction and the
approach to identifying variables that contain PII (deﬁned as
PII Variables ).
To construct the keyword database, we ﬁrst focus on the
PII input by users through widgets in the user interface, e.g.,
EditText . We decompile the Android APKs and extract
all strings deﬁned in layout ﬁles and resource ﬁles, including
the widget ID name of any EditText components, the hint
text, and the text in the TextView . We manually ﬁlter the
strings and keep the ones related to PII as seed keywords,
e.g., name, phone number, postcode, and password. We then
utilize W ORD2VEC [57] to expand our keyword pool with
synonymous words. To ensure the generalization of our PII
keyword database, we train the model with the text ex-
tracted from 54,371 general apps by the project, S UPOR [40].
WORD2VEC presents each word as a vector, and the vectors
of synonymous words will have a small cosine distance. After
training, for each of the seed keywords, we identify the top
5 synonymous words, and then feed them into the keyword
database after manual validation. Other numbers of synonyms
could be applied in practice, but a larger number will increase
the workload of manual review. Using Google translate, we
check that all apps that have other languages also have contexts
(strings) in English, and that all variable names in source
code are in English. Considering other languages may increase
the efforts of manual ﬁltering, and we therefore only extract
English keywords.
After the keyword database is built, we identify which
variables in the code are related to PII. We do this by keyword
matching, which binds semantics to variables. Concretely,
we ﬁrst extract variables related to the widgets in the user
interface, e.g.,EditText for user input, and TextView for
hints or display text. We then determine a variable as a PII
Variable if it matches with any keyword in the database. For
example, in Figure 1(b) we present a typical layout XML
ﬁle for a widget and the Java code to access it. The text
attributes in the layout ﬁle can help users quickly understand
the usage of a widget, e.g., the string “Full name” for an
input text box. When the app is compiled, the widget is
1087referenced by an integer ID which is typically assigned in
the layout XML ﬁle as a string, in the idattribute, e.g.,
personal_details_name . By keyword matching ( e.g.,
“name”) we tag the variable obj as a PII Variable, as it
gets content from the EditText widget where a user will
input their full name. Although the tool is tailored to focus on
contact tracing apps, our synonym compilation and keyword
matching framework can also be adapted to other contexts.
Code analysis. We next perform static analysis on the Android
Package (APK) binary ﬁles. We ﬁrst decompile the APK of
each app to its corresponding class andxmlﬁles. As shown
in Figure 1(a), the de-compiled AndroidManifest.xml
ﬁle is ﬁrst parsed to extract essential information about the
app, such as Permission ,Components , orIntents .
Then, we assess requested permissions and examine whether
allComponents (e.g.,Service ,Receiver ,Activity ,
Provider ) are protected by at least one permission explicitly
requested in Manifest ﬁles. Other attribute conﬁgurations, such
as the allowBackup ,debuggable , and networkSecu-
rityConfig ﬂags, will also be checked.
The Extracting Method module matches methods in de-
compiled ﬁles with pre-deﬁned rules to extract potentially
vulnerable methods. For example, if a method contains the
keyword .hashCode() , it relies on the Java Hash Code (a
weak hash function). The Assessing Methods Containing PII
module utilizes the PII Variable database to identify methods
containing potential PII. However, as a weakness could be
deﬁned in a third-party API, the vulnerable method inspected
may never actually be executed during run-time. To ad-
dress this, the Determining Vulnerable Calls module assesses
whether a vulnerable method is actually called and determines
whether the PII data is accessed. COVIDG UARDIAN records
all the vulnerabilities listed in the Manifest Weaknesses and
Vulnerabilities categories in Table II.
The assessed vulnerabilities include SQL injection, IP ad-
dress disclosure, hard-coded encryption keys, improper en-
cryption, use of insufﬁciently random values (CWE 330) [6],
insecure hash functions, and remote WebView debugging
being enabled. To increase accuracy, COVIDG UARDIAN not
only relies on the detection of a vulnerable method being
called, but also employs PII data matching. For example, a
vulnerable method detection rule may use keywords “log” or
“print” to locate the method calls related to “data logging”,
e.g.,Log.v() andSystem.out.print() . We further
check whether the logged data contains PII by matching the
inputs with the PII Variables.
Finally, the trackers in apps ( e.g., Google Firebase Analyt-
ics, Facebook Analytics, and Microsoft Appcenter Analytics)
are detected by the Tracker Identiﬁcation module and recorded
in the Privacy Leaks category in Table II.
Data ﬂow analysis. We next conduct a data ﬂow analysis to
identify high risk privacy leaks. The data ﬂow analysis extracts
the paths from data sources to sinks, and the code statements
transmitting the data outside of the app. We deﬁne sources as
calls to any PII data we identify, e.g.,getViewById(int)
andgetText() . Furthermore, we also consider methodsTABLE II

Automated ﬂow analysis, Syntax-based scanning
that may obtain personal information without user input,
e.g.,getLatitude() for geographic location information
and database.Cursor.getString() for database
queries. Note that, although unauthorized users cannot
directly access sources (only sinks), PII data may still leak
during storage or transmission activities. For example, an
app may not have permission to access location data directly
(the source), but it could obtain that information from the
SMS outbox (the sink). If PII data ﬂows into a code point
where unauthorized users or apps can access it ( e.g., via local
storage, external storage or SMS), the conﬁdentiality of the
PII is broken. Here we deﬁne sinks as methods that may leak
sources through speciﬁc channels, e.g.,SharedPrefer-
ences$Editor.putString() ,Bundle.putAll() ,
andSmsManager.sendTextMessage() .
Thus, we next search the app for lifecycle and callback
methods. Using this, we generate a call graph. Starting at
the detected sources, the analysis tracks taints by traversing
the call graph. If PII data ﬂows from a source to a sink, it
indicates that there is a potential privacy leak path. To reduce
false-positives, we conduct a backward ﬂow analysis. If the
vulnerable code is reachable ( i.e., not dead code) and contains
PII Variables, we determine it is a potential valid privacy leak.
For example, if we ﬁnd there is a PII Variable that ﬂows into a
sink ( e.g., Bundle, Log output, SMS) where unauthorized users
can access, we will trace it backwards to its source and conﬁrm
whether the source is reachable. If reachable, we consider it
as a privacy leak.
Malware detection. To complement the code analysis, we
rely on malware scanners to ﬂag malicious artifacts in contact
tracing apps. COVIDG UARDIAN sends the APKs to V IRUS -
TOTAL [18], a free online service that integrates over 70
antivirus scanners. Note this has been widely adopted by the
research community [39, 41, 55]. As shown in Table II, the
results of malware detection identify viruses, worms, Trojans,
and other malicious content embedded in the apps.
1088Implementation. COVIDG UARDIAN includes two compo-
nents: static code and PII data-ﬂow analysis engines. The static
code analysis engine employs JADX [7] to decompile the dex
byte code of APK ﬁles to Java code. This allows the engine to
generate an abstract syntax tree (AST) and create call graphs.
Then, the engine scans the given source code to ﬁnd risks
listed in the OWASP [10]. Finally, the taint analysis engine
utilizes the call graphs previously generated, with the list of
sinks and sources, to locate private data leakage.
To perform the detection, we ﬁrst summarize 220 types
of (suspected) function calls, which we then use to identify
vulnerabilities in the source codes. Then 195 taint sources and
sinks are collected to analyze PII leakage through the AST.
Finally, the static code analysis engine veriﬁes whether the
app logic invokes the data leakage functions or not.
IV. E VALUATION AND RESULTS
A. Selection of apps under-Study
To evaluate COVIDG UARDIAN , and explore the risks as-
sociated with popular contact tracing apps, we curate a list of
apps to study. To achieve this, we ﬁrst search for keywords in
the Google Play Store, e.g., “contact tracing”, “Covid”, and
“tracing coronavirus”. We also search for known ofﬁcial apps
from countries, e.g., the COVIDSafe recommended by the
Australian government. After a contact tracing app is found,
we assess its functionality by reading the app description and
select those with in excess of 10,000 downloads. We also
include two beta apps. Subsequently, we include the app into
the set and look for new apps through the recommendation
links in the app store. We repeat this until there are no more
contact tracing apps found. At last, we ﬁnalized the list of
40 contact tracing apps, as shown in Table I. More detailed
information, such as the versions of apps, is provided in our
open source website.
B. RQ1: Evaluation of COVIDG UARDIAN
Comparison with the state-of-the-practice tools. To evaluate
the effectiveness and accuracy of COVIDG UARDIAN , we
compare against four industrial and open-source state-of-the-
practice security assessment tools. These tools are selected
based on the number of stars on GitHub ( e.g., MobSF 7.6K,
Qark 2.4K), their update frequency, usability, and their ability
to analyze the security of Android apps. MobSF is recom-
mended by OWASP [2]; Qark and AndroBugs are widely
used open-source security assessment tools for Android apps;
FlowDroid is a classic tool for static taint analysis. We
therefore believe they offer an effective baseline to compare
against.
We apply all four tools to the 40 contact tracing apps under-
study. The detection precision results are listed in Table III.
The number of types is the sum of the number of risks and
leaks identiﬁed by COVIDG UARDIAN . The precision rates
are obtained through manual validation ( i.e., ﬁltering out all
false positives). The worst performing tool is F LOW DROID ,
which generates a large number of false positives that fall
into “Log” related sinks. This is because F LOW DROID marksTABLE III

all log methods as sinks without considering whether the
logged data is PII or not. For instance, in TraceTogether, error
messages such as SQLiteException (from the stack trace)
are logged by the Log.e method which matches the keywords
“log” and is falsely identiﬁed as a privacy leak.
In contrast, COVIDG UARDIAN is able to identify most
log related false positives through analyzing the PII Vari-
ables (precision of 96.19%). It is also optimized to ﬁlter out
non-private data, such as Locale.getCountry . Therefore,
most false positives are removed automatically, and only eight
false positives (which are from database query results but are
not sensitive) are found.
Another type of false positive found in COVIDG UARDIAN
is related to SQL Injections. For instance, TraceTogether
encapsulates all SQL manipulation methods to limit the input
to the SQL query. Both M OBSF and A NDRO BUGS regard
them as at risk of SQL Injections, since they analyze apps
by keyword scanning. We manually analyzed all 40 apps and
found that ten false positives (of which inputs are limited to
several constants in the app but are still regarded as injected)
fall into this category in COVIDG UARDIAN .
Threats to validity. Considering that both the code analysis
and data ﬂow analysis rely on keyword matching, a potential
cause of false negatives is poorly chosen of keywords. This
could mean that some vulnerabilities are not deﬁned in the
analysis rules. Similarly, in our data ﬂow analysis, although
we update the sources and sinks extracted by SuSi with
newly deﬁned ones based on the PII data we identify, there
may exist PII leakage that does not match any sources or
sinks. We aim to improve the false negatives by updating
the rules and keywords database in the future. Currently, our
empirical assessment accentuates the identiﬁed vulnerabilities
and privacy leakage paths.
Answer to RQ1. State-of-the-practice tools are less
effective ( i.e., lower precision) compared to COVID-
GUARDIAN . Our assessment methodology can be used
to identify security weaknesses with high precision.
C.RQ2: Empirical Assessment Results
We next explore the presence of security vulnerabilities
among the 40 considered apps using COVIDG UARDIAN .
Code analysis results. Figure 2 shows the percentage of
contact tracing apps that have security weaknesses found
via our code analysis. We observe that 42.5% of apps do
not set the ﬂag allowBackup toFalse . Consequently,
users with enabled USB debugging can copy application data
from the device. Other weaknesses identiﬁed are related to
1089Fig. 2. Percentages of apps that are subject to vulnerabilities based on code
analysis.
“Clear Text Trafﬁc”, such as plaintext HTTP, FTP stacks,
DownloadManager, and MediaPlayer. These may enable a
network attacker to implement man-in-the-middle (MITM) [8]
attacks during network transmission.
Figure 2 shows that the most frequent weakness identiﬁed
by code analysis is the “Risky Cryptography Algorithm”. Over
72.5% of apps use at least one deprecated cryptographic algo-
rithm, e.g., MD5 and SHA-1. For instance, in the app MySe-
jahtera (Malaysia), the parameters in WebSocket requests are
combined and encrypted with MD5. These will be compared
with the content from requests in the class Draft_76 in order
to conﬁrm the validity of connections. Although this has been
listed in the top 10 OWASP [10] mobile risks 2016, the results
show that it is still a common security issue. Another frequent
weakness is “Clear Text Storage” ( i.e., creation of ﬁles that
may contain hard-coded sensitive information like usernames,
passwords, keys, etc.). For example, in the DataBaseSQL
class of the COVID-19 (Vietnam) app, the SQLite database
password is stored in the source code without encryption; CG
Covid-19 ePass (India) also hard-coded its encryption key in
itsSecurity class.
In total, 20 trackers have also been identiﬁed, including
Google Firebase Analytics ,Google CrashLyt-
ics, and Facebook Analytics . Approximately 75% of
the apps contain at least one tracker. In the most extreme
case, one app, Contact Tracing (USA), contains 8 trackers.
As shown in Table IV, the most frequent tracker is Google
Firebase Analytics , which is identiﬁed in more than
70% of the apps. Notably, a research study [50] argues that
TraceTogether, by using Google’s Firebase service to store
user information, maybe leaking user information.
Data ﬂow analysis results. Figure 3 presents the potential
privacy leakage between sources and sinks. This is counted
by the number of source-to-sink paths found in each app. The
top sources of PII data are methods calling from Location
anddatabase.Cursor . These may obtain PII from a
geographic location sensor or from a database query. Most
of the PII data will be transferred to sinks, such as Bundle ,
Intent , and BroadcastReceiver , which may leak PII
out of the app.
As discussed above, sending PII to the Bundle ob-
ject may reveal PII data to other activities. Notably,
we also discover that some apps transmit location in-
formation through SMS messages. Considering Hamagen
Fig. 3. Privacy leaks detected between sources and sinks. Percentages indicate
the fraction of ﬂows originating at the sources (left) and terminating at the
sinks (right).
(Israel) as an example, location information is detected
and obtained by a source method called initial-
ize(Context,Location,e) . This then ﬂows to a sink
method where Handler.sendMessage(Message) is
called. This is a potential vulnerability, as malware could
easily intercept the outbox of the Android SMS service [21].
Malware detection results. We discover only one app
with malware, Stop COVID-19 KG (Kyrgyzstan) [15]. Two
risks are identiﬁed: a variant Of Android/DataCollec-
tor.Utilcode.A and an Adware (0053e0591). This aligns
with the ﬁnding of COVID-19 apps’ threats reported else-
where [35]. Considering the limited use of Stop COVID-
19 KG (roughly 10K downloads), we conclude that the vast
majority of contact tracing apps downloaded from Google Play
Store are free of malware. That said, the rise of contact track-
ing apps has also attracted the interest of malicious developers,
e.g., a recent report [61] disclosed that new ransomware has
targeted the contact tracing app in Canada even before its
public release.
Feedback from developers. After alerting all developers of
ours ﬁndings, we re-checked the apps by regression testing.
Table V summarizes the regression testing results. We ﬁnd
that all potential sources of privacy leakage on three apps
— TraceTogether (Singapore), BlueZone (Vietnam), STOP
COVID19 CAT (Spain) — have been ﬁxed. Additionally, the
trackers in MySejahtera (Malaysia) have been removed and the
vulnerable app, Contact Tracer (USA), is no longer available.
Meanwhile, new vulnerabilities are identiﬁed in the updated
versions of several apps (see Table V). For example, COV A
Punjab (India) enables popup windows in the WebView set-
ting. STOP COVID19 CAT (Spain) allows clear text trafﬁc in
the Manifest, and some apps have more trackers identiﬁed.
This may mean that the urgency of app development has
impacted quality assurance procedures. We note that a study of
493 iOS apps [20] conﬁrms that security issues are prevalent
in iOS too. Investigating the root cause of the security issue
and their urgency is beyond the scope of our research, yet it
is an interesting future research topic.

Answer to RQ2. The most frequent weaknesses found
in contact tracing apps are risky cryptography algorithms
use (72.5%), incorrect default permissions (62.5%), clear
text storage (55.0%), insecure random values (55%), and
allowing backup (42.5%). Meanwhile, trackers and po-
tential privacy leakage also pose risks to users’ personal
information.
D. Cases and Implications
From our curated list of 40 apps, we select ﬁve typical
apps around the world to further highlight key lessons we
can learn with respect to security and privacy. The cases are
TraceTogether, Next Step (DP3T), Private Kit, COVIDSafe,
and Corona Warn App.
TraceTogether. According to the COVIDG UARDIAN anal-
ysis results, root detection [37] has been implemented in
TraceTogether. This potentially prevents SQL injection and
data breaches, thereby reducing the risk to a certain extent.
For example, in o/C3271ax.java , root detection logic is
implemented by detecting the existence of speciﬁc root ﬁles
in the system, e.g.,/system/app/Superuser.apk and
/system/xbin/su . By assessing their integrity, the app can
detect whether a device is rooted and subsequently block users
from either logging in or opening it.
However, TraceTogether also includes a third-party cus-
tomer feedback library, ZENDESK SDK, in which remote We-
bView debugging is enabled. This potentially allows attackers
to dump the content in the WebView [25]. When a user inputs
conﬁdential data, including passwords, in a debug-enabled
WebView, attackers may be able to inspect all elements in the
webpage [45]. Fortunately, as per the static analysis, the onlyWebView with debugging mode enabled is to display articles;
therefore, it does not contain conﬁdential data.
Security guideline 1: Never leave WebView with debug-
ging mode enabled in the app release.
Next Step (DP3T). Next Step’s database is not encrypted, and
data is saved in plain text. In contrast to TraceTogether, the app
does not implement any root detection capabilities. Although,
the leakage of user’s information via a rooted device may not
be remotely exploitable, local malware may be able to gain
root access. We therefore argue that root detection is necessary
due to the large-scale deployment of such apps (over 60%
of the population [34]), the long duration of their operation,
and the fact that 7.6% of Android users already have rooted
their devices [72]. Further, in a rooted device, a malicious app
could possibly access the database and manipulate COVID-19
contact records.
Security guideline 2: To protect the database from being
dumped and prevent data breaches, a solution should:
1) Implement database encryption [17]
2) Enable root detection [3] and conﬁdential data pro-
tection [16] at app startup.
Inaddition, as the database records timestamps and contact
IDs, the leakage of the database from a rooted device could
be exploited to mount linkage attacks by adversaries [11].
Therefore, if enough data in a region were collected, contact
IDs and timestamps could be used to analyze movements [65].
Private Kit. Similar to Next Step (DP3T), Private Kit does not
encrypt the database and contains plaintext data. Additionally,
the app creates temporary JSON ﬁles to store users’ location
data. Without any encryption and root detection, the temporary
JSON ﬁles could be dumped from a rooted device.
Security guideline 3: To prevent potential data breaches,
conﬁdential data must not be stored in temporary ﬁles in
plain text.
COVIDSafe. COVIDSafe 1.0.11 stores all tracing histories
(including contacted device IDs and timestamps) into an
SQLite database using plain text. Since the app does not
implement root detection logic, tracing histories may be leaked
from root devices and therefore potential linkage attacks
could be implemented [65]. However, in the latest version,
COVIDSafe ﬁxed this issue by encrypting the local database
with a public key.
Corona Warn App. We ﬁnd two security features worth
highlighting. Corona Warn App applies the SQLC IPHER [14]
framework, which enhances the SQL ITEdatabase by making
it more suitable for encrypted local data storage. It also
introduces the CONSCRYPT [5] framework, which uses Bor-
ingSSL to provide cryptographic primitives and Transport
Layer Security for Java applications on Android, during data
transmission.
1091Security guideline 4: To protect local databases, intro-
ducing professional security frameworks is useful, e.g.
CONSCRYPT and SQLC IPHER are open-source, well-
documented, frequently-updated, widely-used, and their
code is frequently reviewed.
V. RQ3: R EVIEWING AND ASSESSING SECURITY AND
PRIVACY THREATS
In this section, we review the major security and privacy
threats facing contact tracing apps, based on our prior analysis.
A. User Privacy Exposure
We envisage three groups of contact tracing app users, based
on their health status:
Generic user. A typical user of the contact tracing system,
who is healthy or has not been diagnosed yet.
At-risk user. A user who has recently been in contact with
an infected user. Ideally, an at-risk user will receive an at-
risk alarm from the app.
Diagnosed user. A diagnosed patient who will be asked to
reveal their information as well as the information of at-risk
users to the health authorities, e.g., the diagnosis of their
infection, their movement history, the persons they have
been in contact with.
Based on our prior analysis, we further deﬁne ﬁve broad
categories of apps:
Level I : “No data is shared with a server or users”, the
most secure level.
Level II : “Tokens are shared with proximity users”, a
medium exposure level with only tokens containing no PII
being exchanged between users.
Level III : “Tokens are shared with the server”, a
medium exposure level with tokens exposed to the server.
Level IV : “PII is shared with a server”, a high risk
exposure level.
Level V : “PII is released to public”, the highest risk
exposure level.
Based on the in-app instructions, documents provided in
apps’ ofﬁcial websites, and the privacy policies, we assess
user privacy exposure and threats posed by the 40 apps listed
in Table I. We translated to English the materials not written
in English with Google Translate. For 13 out of the 40 apps,
we were not able to collect adequate information to conduct
the privacy assessment. Signiﬁcantly, 13 out of the 40 apps
lacking transparent documentation were also identiﬁed as the
ones with higher than the average number of security and
privacy risks using COVID GUARDIAN . Considering the lack
of transparency of such apps with more than two million
downloads, our ﬁndings demonstrate the pressing need for a
holistic security and privacy assessment tool.
As summarized in Table VI, all 27 assessed apps have user
privacy exposure to some extent. We determine user exposure
level as IV in some centralized apps, such as COVIDSafe,
TraceTogether, and apps from #18 to #27. This is primarily
because the central servers request users’ PII ( e.g., name,TABLE VI

phone number, postcode, or even location information) during
registration or execution. This could be ﬁxed by better privacy
by design, exempliﬁed by #4 StopCovid France, which does
not collect such PII. Meanwhile, most decentralized Bluetooth-
based apps are categorized as a lower-level exposure. This is
because they utilize non-identiﬁable tokens, instead of directly
using PII in contact tracing. However, we determine the pri-
vacy exposure level of diagnosed users in Hamagen as Level V ,
as their location information could be accessed by third-
party users, allowing the diagnosed users to be potentially
re-identiﬁed.
B. Security and Privacy Threats
To further examine security and privacy threats against
contact tracing apps, we systematically search and review
the state-of-the-art [23, 27, 36, 73]. We use Google Search,
Google Scholar, and Twitter to discover research papers and
Twitter comments or media outlets referring to published or
arXiv papers. To achieve this, we use a set of associated
search keywords ( e.g., security and privacy attacks, COVID-
19 contact tracing apps, vulnerabilities, effectiveness, safety).
To expand this set, we further examine papers in the bibli-
ographies of each keyword-ﬁltered paper. We then manually
exclude irrelevant topics and synthesize four dominant security
and privacy threats: ( i) server link attacks; ( ii) user link attacks;
(iii) false positive claims; and ( iv) relay attacks. We summarize
the nature of these threats in Figure 4 and discuss them in turn
below.
Linkage attacks by servers. In centralized systems, the
major privacy concern is metadata leakage by the server.
Consequently, Grace will be able to collect a large amount of
PII, such as names, phone numbers, contact lists, post code,
home addresses, location trails. Therefore Grace is able to
1092Fig. 4. Four types of potential security and privacy threats: (a) linkage attacks by a server: in centralized systems, a key privacy concern is metadata leakage
by the server; (b) linkage attacks by users: in systems based on information exchange between users, attackers could re-identify users using data published
or received from users; (c) false positive claim: attackers can incorrectly register as infected, which will generate false at-risk alerts; (d) relay attacks: in
Bluetooth based apps, a malicious attacker can potentially redirect/replicate Bluetooth broadcasts from one place to another, thereby generating false at-risk
alerts.
deduce the social connections of Alice. However, in some
decentralized systems ( e.g., Hamagen), the server also learns
users’ PII, which can compromise such such decentralized
systems too (as marked in Table VI).
Privacy guideline 1: To protect users’ privacy against
linkage attacks by a server, a contact tracing app should:
1) Avoid sharing PII with central points or
2) Implement a decentralized design.
Linkage attacks by users. Linkage attacks performed by
users (Mallory), try to re-identify Alice or Bob. In contact
tracing systems that directly publish users’ PII, Bob is ob-
viously at risk of privacy leakage. For other apps listed in
Table VI that rely on information exchange between users
(e.g., DP3T, which implements an ephemeral ID design),
Mallory is still able to identify Bob using more advanced
attacks. For example, if Mallory places a Bluetooth receiver
near Bob’s home or working place and ensures that the
device will only receive Bluetooth broadcasts from Bob. Once
Bob is diagnosed, Mallory will receive an at-risk alarm and
immediately acknowledge that the infected patient is Bob. In
addition, Mallory can log the timestamp and the received
ephemeral ID when in contact with Bob, which could be
done by modifying the app or developing a customised app
using the open-sourced contact tracing framework. Once Bob
is diagnosed, Mallory will be able to trace back the source of
recording and re-identify Bob and potentially infected users.
Similar attacks were described as Paparazzi Attacks andNerd
Attacks in [73]. Even worse, if Mallory distributes multiple
broadcast receivers in a large area they could potentially trace
the movement of Bob by tracing the records on each device.
Privacy guideline 2: To protect users’ privacy against
linkage attacks by an adversary, a solution should:
1) Avoid data sharing between users or
2) Ensure privacy protections exist for any published
data.
False positive claims. In some systems, Bob can register as
infected via the app. If Mallory exploits such a mechanism
and registers as a (fake) infected user, Alice will receive a
false-positive at-risk alarm, which may cause social panic or
negatively impact evidence-driven public health policies. Mostsolutions mitigate this issue by implementing an authorization
process, i.e., a one-time-use permission code.
Privacy guideline 3: To protect a system against false-
positive-claim attacks, a solution should establish an
authorization process.
Relay attacks. To apply a relay attack, Mallory could collect
existing broadcast messages exchanged between users, then
replay them at another time, or forward them through proxy
devices to a remote location. Due to the lack of message
validation in solutions that utilize information broadcasts, a
user will not be able to determine whether a received broadcast
is from a valid source or from a malicious device. Thus,
any received broadcast will be recorded as a contact event.
A malicious attacker can potentially redirect all the trafﬁc
from one place to another, resulting in a targeted area being
incorrectly locked-down.
Privacy guideline 4: To protect a system against relay
attacks, a solution should:
1) Either avoid utilizing information broadcast or
2) Implement a validation approach.
Summary .The linkage attacks by a server are the overarching
threats to centralized systems, as third-party attackers (or the
server itself) are able to re-identify users (if PII is exposed
to the central server). Although StopCovid France is robust
to such a threat, it is still susceptible to re-identiﬁcation
risks since the information from the server enables linkage
between anonymous IDs and the corresponding permanent
app identiﬁer. This permits the tracing of users based on IDs
observed in the past, as well as future movements.
Additionally, apps that use Bluetooth broadcasts are exposed
to linkage attacks by users. We note that, although the false
positive claims could be mitigated by authorization to allow
only positive users to upload diagnosed data to the server, there
are still some apps failing to implement essential authorization.
Furthermore, the relay attack is another threat causing false
positives in Bluetooth-based apps. Notably, although TraceCO-
RONA is rated as at-risk against relay attacks, its speciﬁc
design provides protection against one-way-relaying unlike
other apps.
1093Answer to RQ3. We manually rate the level of user
privacy exposure for each contact tracing app. We further
categorize the robustness of apps against security and
privacy threats. We ascertain that the apps in question
are vulnerable to at least one of the four threats. Not
all decentralized architectures are necessarily more se-
cure than those adopting centralized architectures, e.g.,
Hamagen, a decentralized location-based system.
VI. RQ4: U SERSTUDY
In this section, we present a survey, exploring the user
perceptions of contact tracing apps. Our objective is to query
thelikelihood and concerns associated with using the apps.
Through the study we aim to ascertain user concerns and
requirements of contact tracing apps ( RQ4).
A. Participant Recruitment
The proportion of youth aged 15-24 years with COVID-
19 has increased six-fold from 24 February through 12 July
2020 [77]. It was reported by Reuters [22] that young people
who are visiting nightclubs and beaches are causing a rise in
fresh cases with potential consequences for more vulnerable
age groups. Therefore, we focus our user study on 18-29
year olds. We have recruited 373 volunteers and asked them
standard demographic questions, i.e., age range, education,
gender, and nationality. All participants reside in Australia
but have various cultural backgrounds (58% from Oceania,
20% from Asia, and 14% from other geographic regions;
30 participants did not indicate their nationalities). 39% of
participants are male (59% female). One participant identiﬁed
themselves as other gender and six participants refrained. 67%
of participants are university graduates and 30% are high
school graduates.
B. Survey Protocol
To calibrate the scope of our survey without introducing
bias, we provide vignettes describing user privacy exposure
levels using the security and privacy threats reviewed in
Section V.
All questions, excluding demographics, are ﬁve-point Likert
scale [53] questions. The Likert scale is a quantitative, ﬁne-
grained, and user-friendly method of collecting data from
users. The scales ask participants to indicate how much they
are likely (1) or unlikely (5), to be unconcerned (1) or
concerned (5) about using contact tracing apps. The survey
adopts a bespoke model and integrates questions from related
survey instruments used by Simko et al. [66] and Kaptchuk et
al.[44]. We provide the survey design and questionnaire in our
open source website and summarize the two item categories
below.
(a) Likelihood of using contact tracing apps. To investigate
the usability requirements of contact tracing apps, we asked
participants their likelihood of using contact tracing apps
under different scenarios: ( i) functionality scenarios, i.e., if
the accuracy of proximity contact detection and at-risk alarm
generation is not perfect (false positives or false negativesexist); and ( ii) privacy scenarios, i.e., if personal data (location,
phone number, postcode, or anonymous identiﬁer) will be
shared with other entities (other users or governments), or
if the authorities require them to provide data (location,
proximity data, or anonymous tokens) after being diagnosed.
Notably, to ensure the survey is designed for both users
and non-users, we did not explicitly mention any speciﬁc
contact tracing app , but still covered all contextual privacy
concepts of state-of-the-practice contact tracing apps discussed
in Section II. For example, COVIDSafe is covered by scenarios
in which a “phone number and postcode are shared with
governments or health authorities” and if the app will “upload
proximity data if tested positive”. Similarly, the Corona Warn
App or others that implement the Google and Apple (Gapple)
framework are covered by scenarios where “anonymous iden-
tiﬁers are shared with other users” and the app will “upload
anonymous tokens if being tested positive”.
(b) Concerns about use of contact tracing apps. We also
asked the participants about their concerns regarding contact
tracing apps. We focused mainly on three aspects: ( i) the
usability of contact tracing apps, including battery drain,
storage drain, and ease-of-use; ( ii) the effectiveness of contact
tracing apps, i.e., to what extent users are concerned about
the accuracy of contact tracing; and ( iii) the concerns about
privacy. We conducted the survey through both pencil-and-
paper and SoGoSurvey [13]. 3.4% (15) of participants used
the paper version of the survey and there is no signiﬁcant
impact on the study results. During the paper survey, we did
not receive any queries from participants.
C. Data Analysis and Results
Our variables are ordinal and the responses to each question
are not expected to be normally distributed. Therefore, we
use a Mann-Whitney U-test [56] for statistical signiﬁcance
testing to ascertain the key factors that impact user concerns
and requirements (or expectations). Concretely, we aggregate
item responses to assess the participants’ likelihood of using
contact tracing apps across four different privacy-preserving
and data sharing scenarios (as described in the Section V-B).
We calculate the U-value and p-value of each pair of
contact tracing solutions among centralized solutions with
PII collected (Type A), centralized solutions with non-PII
collected (Type B), decentralized solutions with PII collected
(Type C), and decentralized solutions with non-PII collected
(Type D). If the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null
hypothesis that users are equally likely to use any of the two
contact tracing apps. We use S CIPY.STATS for our analysis.
(a) The accuracy of contact tracing impacts the likelihood
of app use. Users are sensitive to sharing PII in a
decentralized system. As shown in Figure 5(a), if a contact
tracing app can accurately detect proximity and notify users
who may be at-risk, more than 60% of participants are likely to
use it. However, in reality, it is hard to eliminate false-positives
and false-negatives. When the tracing accuracy concern is
considered, the proportion of users likely to use contact tracing
apps drops to 31% and 26%, respectively. Our results align

accuracy of proximity detection; (b) Participants’ likelihood of using apps
across different privacy-preserving and data sharing scenarios. : 5 =

well with a survey of COVID-19 app usage taken in the
USA [44].
Figure 5(b), shows how likely users are to use a contact
tracing app in different scenarios. Here, 50% of participants
listed positive responses to decentralized apps with non-PII
identiﬁcation collected and shared (Type D). This resonates
with the fact that Bluetooth-based decentralized systems pre-
serve user privacy more than centralized systems. However,
decentralized apps with PII collected (Type C) are not as
popular with users. More than 64% of participants said that
they are unlikely to use such an app. It can be seen that even
this young cohort of users is sensitive to sharing PII.
Table VII presents the Mann-Whitney U-tests comparing
pairs of contact tracing apps. Our results indicate that the
differences between the likelihood of using decentralized apps
with PII collected (Type C) and other apps is statistically
signiﬁcant. This is perhaps due to the privacy design in a
decentralized PII-collected system. That is, diagnosed users’
information ( e.g., location information) will be collected and
shared with other users, while the other types of apps do
not share such information between users. When compared
with the other three types, we had p-values greater than 0.05.
Hence, despite the different levels of privacy protection, there
is no statistically signiﬁcant difference in the likelihood of
users using these apps. However, from Figure 5(b), we can
infer that it is more likely for users to accept and use the
decentralized apps without PII collection (Type D).
Additionally, as evidenced in Figure 5, we ﬁnd that more
than 78% of participants are likely to use perfectly private
contact tracing apps. This indicates a much higher likeli-
hood than those who prefer a perfectly accurate contact
tracing app (60%). The difference is statistically signiﬁcant
(p-value <0:0001 ), indicating that users are more likely
to accept and use contact tracing apps that satisfy privacy
protection requirements.
(b) User concerns focus on privacy and tracing accuracy.
As shown in Figure 6, more than 55% of participants are
extremely concerned about the tracing accuracy of apps, and
more than 49% of participants are extremely concerned about
privacy issues.
D. Threats to Validity of Our User Study
External validity. The participants of the survey were all from
one country, and the duration of the survey was three weeks.
Further, our survey may be subject to volunteer bias andnon-response bias [26] ( i.e., participants and their responses
may have different characteristics from the general population
of interest). To mitigate the volunteer bias, we designed the
survey questionnaire to be completed in 10-15 minutes and
anonymized the responses.
Internal validity. Considering the nature of the user study,
participants may ﬁnd that some questions are confusing or
unclear. This will lead to incorrect or inconsistent responses.
To mitigate this threat, we conducted a pilot survey with 45
computer science students and updated the questions based on
feedback. In addition, as the responses are anonymous, there
could be participants who took the survey multiple times.
Answer to RQ4. Privacy design and tracing accuracy
impact the likelihood of app use. Furthermore, compared
to users’ expectations of tracing accuracy, users are more
likely to accept and use apps with better privacy by
design. Interestingly, if PII data is collected, users prefer a
centralized solution in contrast to a decentralized solution
that collects PII data.
VII. C ONCLUSION
This study has developed a security and privacy assessment
tool, COVIDG UARDIAN . This tool can evaluate the secu-
rity weaknesses, vulnerabilities, potential privacy leaks, and
malware in contact tracing apps. Using COVIDG UARDIAN ,
we have conducted a comprehensive empirical security and
privacy assessment of 40 contact tracing apps. Our results
have identiﬁed multiple security and privacy risks, as well
as threats. Naturally, our analysis has conﬁrmed that no apps
can protect users’ security and privacy against allpotential
threats. To understand the perception of users, we have also
performed a survey involving 373 participants. This has further
consolidated our observations of user concerns. In the future,
we plan to extend our study to obtain user feedback from a
wider geographic and demographic range. Examining network
trafﬁc originating from contact tracing apps is also worth
further exploration.
