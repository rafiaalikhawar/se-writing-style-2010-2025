https://doi.org/10.1145/3540250.3558932To cope with the complexity of modern CPS, researchers and
practitionershaveadoptedamodel-baseddevelopment(MBD)as-
sociatedwithalightverificationparadigmbasedonsimulationand
testing. The eco-system centered around MathWorks Simulink®
istodaythe de-factostandardforMBDofCPS.Inthelastdecade,
the formal methods and control theory communities have devel-
oped more principledapproaches to simulation-basedverification,
such as falsification testing [ 11] (this thread of research resulted
in many publications, we specifically mention papers on this topic
that appearedin the recent past [ 1,2,18,19]).
While methodslike falsification testinghave proved successful
and effective in finding bugs in CPS designs, we observe that these
methods are often evaluatedon a smallnumber ofexamples andin
anad-hocfashion. The typical approach to systematically evaluate
atestingstrategyistoanalyzeitseffectivenessindetectingbadsys-
tembehaviorsinthepresenceoffaults[ 4].Thisisachievedviafault
injection[ 3]andmutationtesting[ 8],activitiesrecommendedbyin-
dustrial safety standards, especially in safety-critical domains [ 13].
The main prerequisite for large-scale mutation testing evaluations
isamechanismforinjectingfaultsofdifferenttypesintothesys-
tem model in an automated and programmatic fashion, without
humaninterventionduringtheinjectionprocess.Tothebestofour
knowledge, there is no fault injection solution for Simulink that
satisfies all the identified requirements, which explains the lack of
systematic experiments ofCPStestingapproaches.
We remedy this situation by introducing FIM ( FaultInjection
andMutation engine), an open-source tool for injecting faults into
Simulinkmodelsthatsatisfiestheaboverequirements.FIMprovides
thefollowingfeatures,whichcanallbeconfiguredprogrammati-
cally:
•A rich fault model, including sensor, hardware and network
faults,as wellas alibrary ofmutation operators;
•Systematic injection ofafault in different parts ofamodel:

•Restriction offault injection tospecific parts ofthe model;
•Dynamic activation anddeactivation offaults.

models [5,12,14,16], but each has some caveats and limitations.
MODIFI [ 16] and ErrorSim [ 14] have a very limited choice of fault
types and are not publicly accessible. SIMULTATE [ 12] offers an
interactive user interface using Python and MATLAB®. Although
practicalforbeginners,aninteractiveinterfacecanbeablocking
factor for scalable fault injection experiments that may require
injecting hundredsor thousandsof faults.Another related model-
basedfaultinjectionmethod[ 5]supportstheinjectionoftypical
faults, but lacks an automated support for fault block placement in
the SUT.
Compared to existing tools, FIM (i) integrates a richer variety
of faults/mutations (see Section 2), (ii) supports automated fault
injection via a transparent user interface that works directly in
the MATLAB®environment without any additional setup, and (iii)
providesscalablefaultinjection,allowingthedesignofexperiments
via configuration files that can be processed, generating a large
number ofmutants inseconds.
Paper organization. In Section 2, we provide insights into the
architecture,keyfunctionalitiesandtheworkflowofFIM.Section 3
summarizes the usage of the tool. In Section 4, we evaluate the
performance of the tool on an example from the aerospace domain
withsomeexperimental results, andwe conclude inSection 5.
2 FIM: DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
We first pinpoint several conceptual problems encountered during
thedesignandimplementationofFIM,necessarytomotivateand
understandits features:
•Specificities of Simulink : Prior to designing the tool, we iden-
tified the complexities in handling Simulink models and
thoroughlyunderstoodtheprogrammaticeditingofmodel
components, from lines to blocks. We also comprehended
the fundamentals of masking in Simulink prior to designing
arichfaultinjection library withparameterizedblocks.
•We tried several injection strategies, before implementing
theinjectionmechanismastheadditionofnewblocks,since
itguaranteesthehighestlevelofcontrolwithnoissuesin
its capability to observe andaltervariable values.
•We focused on the possibility to do large scale experiments,
carefullydesigninganinterfacethatdoesnotrequireinter-
actions duringexperiments.
•We considered several strategies to deal with a large set
of injected faults, finally supporting two complementary
strategies: generating many models with one fault each and
generatingone modelwithallthe faultsincluded.

2.1 FaultLibrary
TheFault Library is a custom Simulink library browserconsisting
ofdifferentparameterizedblocksfordifferenttypesoffaultsand
mutation operators (listed in Table 1). FIM allows the user to ex-
tend the library browser with other faults/mutation operators. The
insertion or replacement of blocks depends on the type of fault

2.2 FaultInjection
TheFaultInjectionModule isresponsibletoinjectfaultsbasedonthe
desired mutations ( fault_list). For SINGLE-MODEL case ( i.e., muta-
tions withSingle model),FIM firstcreates acopy of theSUT such
that all the desired faults are injected in the copied file. Conversely,
forMULTI-MODELcase( i.e.,mutationswithMultiplemodels),FIM
createsacopyandinjectsasinglefaultinthecopiedfile.Then,this
processcontinuesuntilallthedesiredfaultsareinjected s.t.there
are multiple copies ofthe SUT,one faultinjectedper copy.
TheadvantageofSINGLE-MODELoverMULTI-MODELmode
istwofold: (a)asingle modelisgeneratedandcompiled,and(b)a
mutatedSUTwithallmutantsinasinglemodelpermitstheuserto
investigatethesimultaneouseffectofmultiplefaults.Theadvantage
ofMULTI-MODELoverSINGLE-MODEListhesimplicityandsmall
size ofthe individualmodels generated.
TheFaultInjectionModule exploitsthebasics ofprogrammatic
editingofSimulinkmodelstoinjectfaultsinthemutatedSUT.In
essence, it stores the information of line handles, block handles,
source-destination blocks (and theirrespectiveports) ina persis-
tent cache. This information is then used to inject the faults in
the copied file. While injecting faults, the Fault Injection Module
automatically retainsthelogginginformationof thesignal(s)and
improves the model layout to abide by modeling guidelines and
enhance readability ofmodels.
Onceallthedesiredfaultsareinjected,the FaultInjectionModule
generates a fault table (.xlsx file) to provide detailed informa-
tionoftheinjectedfaultblocks.Moreprecisely,the fault table
provides the following details: (i) name of the mutated SUT, (ii) the
uniquenameofthefaultblockaddedintheSUT,(iii)thesubsystem
within which the fault is injected, (iv) the type of the fault or block
mutation operator,(v) full namesofthesource-destination blockscorresponding to the line in which the fault is injected, and (vi) the
respective port numbers of the source-destination. Such a detailed
description of the injected faults will assist the user to identify the
exactlocationofthefaultblockinthemutatedSUT.Notethateach
injected fault block has a unique name, which is later utilized by
theFault Configuration componentto controlits activation.
2.3 FaultConfiguration
Based on the generated fault table , the user can now configure
the faults that must be used in an experiment. FIM allows the user
toinputanotherconfigurationfile: fault_enable_list whichisatable
(.csv or .xlsx file) with fieldsto specify the block(s) to be activated
along with the relevant fault parameters. In accordance with the
fault_enable_list ,theFaultConfiguration componentturns onthe
respective fault blocks in the mutated SUT and configures them
for the specified fault parameters. The fault block (to be activated)
is specified by its unique identifier (fault number) in the fault
table.

troller, Plant, Sensors, etc. The model takes the ‘Pilot Command’

ferent types of signals including real-valued, Boolean and enumer-
atedÐstate machineÐvariables. A mutation in any of these signals

Toassesstheperformanceofourtool,weconductedexperiments

(i)ndepends on the structure of the target location, and (ii) the
faultgenerationtimedependsonthefaulttypeaswellasthetarget

SINGLE-MODELisfastandcomputationallylessexpensivecom-
paredtoMULTI-MODEL.FIMtakes{0.92,2.87}seconds,onaverage,
to injectasinglefaultinthe {SINGLE-,MULTI-} MODELmodes.
Basedonourfaultinjectionexperiments,wereportthefollow-
ingresults:(1)SinceMULTI-MODELismoreexpensive,SINGLE-
MODEL might be the best option when efficiency is important.(2) Nevertheless, SINGLE-MODEL is large and messy, and might
be more difficult to visualize, debug and analyze. Thus, MULTI-
MODELmayfacilitate the analysisof the results of faultinjection
experiments.(3)ContrarytotheMULTI-MODELscenario,SINGLE-
MODELisusefultostudyinterferenceamongmultiplefaults,poten-
tially activate at different times. (4) For synergistic benefits of both
modes, the user could start with the SINGLE-MODEL and then
switch to the MULTI-MODEL mode to analyze the fault effects,
makingthe analysismore comprehensible andinterpretive.
5 CONCLUSIONS
We presented FIM, a toolkit for the automated injection of faults
and generationof mutants whendealing with Simulinkmodels. A
tester can control the activation of the fault blocks based on the
task at hand. Further, a tester is free to adjust the fault parameters
for rigorous testing of the SUT against failures to check its fault
tolerance. We speculate that FIM can be an important step towards
refiningtheoverallprocessofverificationofsafety-criticalsystems.
Verification experts and testers can reuse and repackage our ex-
isting open-source toolkit according to their safety evaluation and
testingneeds.Theuserscanupdatethetoolby(i)makingappro-
priatemodificationsintheautomatedscriptsforfaultinjectionand
configuration, and (ii) enriching the fault library with additional
faultsoperators as well as conditional andcascadedfaults.
Atpresent ,FIMcanautomaticallyandefficientlygeneratealarge
numberofmodelswithfaultsinjected,enablingscalablefaultin-
jection experiments. We are currently working on enriching the
toolwithfeaturesthatcanbeusedtosupportspecificapplication
scenarios, such as fine-grained testing options. Our future work
includesanempiricalstudytoinvestigatethecostandbenefitof

extension of the tool to fault localization and failure explanation in
