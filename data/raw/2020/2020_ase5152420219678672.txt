Abstract —Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly de-
ployed as integral parts of software systems. However, due to
the complex interconnections among hidden layers and massivehyperparameters, DNNs must be trained using a large numberof labeled inputs, which calls for extensive human effort forcollecting and labeling data. Spontaneously, to alleviate thisgrowing demand, multiple state-of-the-art studies have developeddifferent metrics to select a small yet informative dataset forthe model training. These research works have demonstratedthat DNN models can achieve competitive performance using acarefully selected small set of data. However, the literature lacksproper investigation of the limitations of data selection metrics,which is crucial to apply them in practice. In this paper, weﬁll this gap and conduct an extensive empirical study to explorethe limits of data selection metrics. Our study involves 15 dataselection metrics evaluated over 5 datasets (2 image classiﬁcationtasks and 3 text classiﬁcation tasks), 10 DNN architectures, and20 labeling budgets (ratio of training data being labeled). Ourﬁndings reveal that, while data selection metrics are usuallyeffective in producing accurate models, they may induce a loss ofmodel robustness (against adversarial examples) and resilience tocompression. Overall, we demonstrate the existence of a trade-offbetween labeling effort and different model qualities. This pavesthe way for future research in devising data selection metricsconsidering multiple quality criteria.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Deep learning (DL) has achieved tremendous success in
various cutting-edge application domains, such as image pro-
cessing [1], machine translation [2], autonomous vehicles [3],and robotics [4]. Two key elements to achieve high-performingpredictions are well-designed deep neural networks (DNNs)(with appropriate architecture and parameters) and a carefullychosen set of labeled training data. However, data labelingis expensive and time-consuming because it requires a largeamount of human effort. For example, that it took more than 3years to prepare the ﬁrst version of the ImageNet [5] dataset.Thus, acquiring labeled data is seen as a major obstacle to thewidespread adoption of DL [6].
One established solution to reduce data labeling cost is
active learning [7], i.e., incremental methods to select infor-mative subsets of training data to undergo labeling in a waythat the produced model is as accurate as if it was trained onall data. With active learning, engineers can thus compromiselabeling effort with model performance (e.g., classiﬁcationaccuracy). There has been much research on devising active
∗corresponding author.learning methods, each relying on different data selectionmetrics. These metrics [8]–[11] typically exploit informationof the DNN under training (e.g., its gradient or uncertainty)to select the most informative data to label next.
On the other hand, recent work on DL testing and debugging
[12]–[19] have proposed different metrics for test generation
and test selection, i.e., the problem of selecting test data that
are more likely to be misclassiﬁed by the model [20]. As inactive learning scenarios, these test data can then be used toimprove the model (by retraining).
The proliferation of data selection metrics (coming from
active learning and testing) makes it challenging for engineersto decide which one they should use. Indeed, the differentmetrics have been evaluated on a restricted set of problems(mostly image classiﬁcation datasets) under incomparable ex-perimental settings (different models and labeling budget) [18],[19]. There is, therefore, a need for a comprehensive study ofall these data selection metrics on a common ground involvingdifferent classiﬁcation tasks.
Another gap in the current body of knowledge is that most
experimental studies evaluate the metric wrt. the test accuracyof the trained models.
1Other key quality indicators have
been ignored, such as the model robustness to adversarialattacks and the model performance after compression. Thelack of consideration for these indicators raises practical issueswhen deploying DL models trained using active learning(consider, e.g., biomedical image segmentation [22] or mobileDL applications [23]). Hence, one should make sure that activelearning can produce models whose quality is not limited toclassiﬁcation accuracy but extends to allquality indicators
relevant for the use case.
To ﬁll these gaps, in this paper, we conduct a compar-
ative empirical study to explore the potential limitations ofactive learning. Our study involves 15 data selection metricsevaluated over 5 datasets (2 image classiﬁcation tasks and3 text classiﬁcation tasks), 10 DNN architectures, and 20labeling budgets (ratio of training data that can be labeled).Speciﬁcally, our study aims to answer the following fourresearch questions:
•RQ1: How effective are the different data selection
metrics for producing accurate models? We answer this
question by measuring how fast (i.e., how many training dataare required) the accuracy of the trained model converges to
1Rarely, some studies [21] measure empirically the robustness of the model
to adversarial attacks.

the accuracy of the fully trained model (i.e., trained with the
full training set). Besides, we employ random selection asa baseline to compare the effectiveness of each metric. Ourresults indicate signiﬁcant differences between metrics (up to45.9% of test accuracy), especially when less than 50% of thetraining data is used.
•RQ2: How robust are models trained with active learn-
ing? We answer this question by measuring the theoretical
robustness of the trained models (using the CLEVER score[24]) as well as their empirical robustness against multipleadversarial attacks. For the image classiﬁcation task, ourresults reveal a gap between the fully trained models and thosetrained with active learning (up to 1.49 CLEVER score and23.39% of success rate), whereas there are no such differencesin the text classiﬁcation task.
•RQ3: Do models trained using active learning maintain
accuracy after compression? Model compression, a well-
known technique to embed DL models in resource-constraineddevices, has the downside effect of reducing the accuracydue to precision loss in the computed model weights. Weinvestigate whether models trained with active learning aremore sensitive to this phenomenon than fully trained models.Our results reveal that, for the image classiﬁcation task,training on 50% of data entails a loss in test accuracy upto 7.47% higher compared to training with the full dataset.
•RQ4: What is the relationship between the amount of
training data, and model robustness and accuracy aftercompression? We conduct additional experiments where we
increase the data budget of data selection metrics. Our resultsindicate that with the growth of training data, the robustnessof the model will also increase. The model can achieve similarrobustness with the fully trained model only using 35% data,and even outperform it when more data are used. This indicatesthat the training process promoted by active learning can beused as an effective way to increase robustness. As for modelcompression, there appears to be no relationship betweenaccuracy decay induced by compression and data budget.
With our extensive empirical study, we provide practical
guidance to engineers in balancing the beneﬁts of data selec-tion metrics with their potential side effects. That is, we showand quantify the existence of a trade-off between the efﬁciencyof model training (in particular, the data labeling effort) andmodel properties of interest (viz. robustness and accuracy afterquantization). Doing so, we also open research directions toexplore this trade-off and new data selection metrics aimedtowards the different quality criteria.
In summary, the main contributions of this paper are:
•We conduct the largest empirical study that investigatesthe effectiveness of training data selection metrics ondifferent classiﬁcation tasks (image and text).
•Beyond (test) accuracy, we explore the effects of reducingthe number of training data on the adversarial robustnessof the models and their accuracy after compression. We,therefore, reveal the potential effects that active learningcan have on these quality indicators.•Thereby, we reveal a potential trade-off between labelingcost and the aforementioned quality indicators. This pavesthe way for future research in designing multi-objectivedata selection metrics aiming at optimizing this trade-offunder a constrained labeling budget.

ACKGROUND
We brieﬂy introduce the background related to our work,
including DNNs, test selection and active learning, adversarialattacks on DNNs, and model compression.
Throughout the paper, Xrefers to the training set for a
N-class classiﬁcation DNN. x∈X⊆R
dis an input and
x/primeis its adversarial example. yandyxindicate the true and
predicted labels, respectively. pi(x),0≤i≤N, represents
the predicted probability of xbelonging to the ith class, and
correspondingly, y=a r gm a x
i=1:N(pi(x)).
A. Deep Neural Networks
In general, a DNN consists of multiple layers, i.e., an input
layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer. As shownin Figure 1, each layer comprises a number of neurons (colorcircles). The neuron with the parameters, also called a unitor a node, is the basic entity of computation of a DNN. Itreceives information from the input data or the other neuronsand computes an output by an activation function. The trainingprocess of a DNN is mainly about tuning the parameters toreach a minimum prediction error concerning true labels. Inthis paper, we focus on the classiﬁcation task where the outputof a DNN classiﬁer is the probability of belonging to eachcategory given an input. For instance, the input data in Figure1 is predicted to be in class Dog with a probability of 0.90.
Generally, there are two typical types of DNNs, i.e., Feed-
Forward Neural Networks (FNNs) and Recurrent Neural Net-works (RNNs). In an FNN, the information only moves in theforward direction from the input layer to the output layer. Thistype of DNNs is widely used in image processing applications.On the other hand, an RNN utilizes different inter-units (i.e.,memory cells, control units) to propagate the input informationin a backward way within an RNN layer, allowing the networkto retain knowledge. RNNs usually deal with sequential dataprocessing due to their ability to capture temporal informationof the data. In this work, we study both FNNs and RNNs.
B. Active Learning
Active learning, a well-known concept in both the software
engineering (SE) community and machine learning (ML)
community, trains a model incrementally with several steps.In a typical active learning procedure, in the beginning, amodel is randomly initialized. In each step of the training,it selects a few data from the unlabeled dataset to label and

then retrains the model for better performance. In other words,
the goal for each step is to reduce the cost of labeling asmuch as possible by selecting the most informative data toannotate while improving the accuracy of a pre-trained model.Therefore, active learning can help in model evolution. Forinstance, in reality, a model needs to be updated over timedue to the rapid growth of new unlabeled data.
C. Test Selection
In the traditional ﬁeld of SE, test selection has attracted
extensive research attention for a long time. For instance, test
selection is widely applied in regression testing [25] whichaims at reducing the size of test suites since executing theentire set is remarkably costly. Depending on the purpose,the selected test suites can help to eliminate redundant testcases (test suite minimization), test relevant changed partsof the software (test case selection), and locate faults early(test case prioritization). A similar concept to test selection isfeature selection [26]–[28] that is thoroughly studied as well.The difference is that feature selection focuses on seeking theoptimal features in a data set to allow efﬁcient execution, whiletest selection tries to reduce the size of data.
In practice, for DL-based software systems, collecting unla-
belled data is easy and cheap but labeling all of them requiresheavy work and speciﬁc domain knowledge. Following thesame spirit of test selection in traditional SE, recent researchproposed some test selection metrics for DL systems, likethe neuron coverage-based test selection. These metrics selectthe most useful subset of unlabeled test data for both testingDNNs and improving the performance of pre-trained DNNsvia retraining. We consider that these test selection metrics arepromising to apply in active learning for two main reasons.First, the procedure of test selection and then retraining,generally speaking, can be regarded as one-step active learning– active learning being by nature an incremental process.Second, the test selection metrics share the same goal ofdetermining the most useful data given a DNN. For instance,an active learning process could measure this utility as thenumber of new neurons that these data activate.
D. Adversarial Attacks on DNNs
DNNs have been proven to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples, which causes considerable security concerns [29].
Therefore, evaluating the ability (robustness) of a DNN to dealwith adversarial examples is a crucial part of DNN testing. Anadversarial example is a variant of input data by introducing asmall perturbation that is hardly recognized by human beingsbut can easily fool DNNs. The perturbation is not just randomnoise but carefully calculated by some adversarial attacks. Inthis study, we employ three powerful attacks (FGSM, JSMA,C&W) for image classiﬁcation, and two (PWWS and DWB)for text classiﬁcation.
•FGSM. Goodfellow et al. [30] proposed the fast gradient
sign method (FGSM) to generate adversarial examples, whichis the ﬁrst gradient-based and one of the most used attacks.FGSM crafts x
/primebyx/prime=x+/epsilon1·sign (/triangleinv xJ(x,y))where/epsilon1
controls the perturbation size. sign (·)is the sign function.
The sign of a real number is -1 for a negative value, 1 fora positive value, and 0 for value 0. /triangleinv
xJ(x,y)computes the
gradient of the training loss Jgivenxand its true class y.
•JSMA. The Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA)
[31] ﬁrst computes a saliency map by the Jacobian matrix. Themap presents how inﬂuential each feature (e.g., each pixel) ofthe input is to predict a particular class. Through exploitingthis map with targeting a class that does not match the trueclass of a given test sample x, JSMA modiﬁes xat where
the pixels have high-saliency values to generate an adversarialexample that might be classiﬁed within a predeﬁned thresholdγ(maximum fraction of features being perturbed).
•C&W. Proposed by Carlini and Wagner [32], C&W is
known as one of the strongest adversarial attacks. It usesa designed loss function fto replace the training loss,
then generates the adversarial example x
/primewhich minimizes
dis(x,x/prime)+c·f(x/prime)wheredisis a distance metric and cis
a constant that controls the distance and the conﬁdence of x/prime.
•PWWS. The probability weighted word saliency (PWWS)
[33], a word-level attack, generates text adversarial examplesby replacing original words with synonyms searched from alexical database (e.g., WordNet [34]). Given a word, PWWSselects a substitution concerning two factors. 1) How does theclassiﬁcation change if replacing this word with a substitution?2) How does the classiﬁcation change if ignoring this word?
•DWB . The DeepWordBug (DWB) [35] is a black-box char-
level adversarial attack, which follows two steps to generateadversarial examples. First, DWB determines the words tomodify by the change of predictions before and after replacingthe words with Unknown tokens. Second, it modiﬁes the
selected words slightly by changing at most two letters perword through a predeﬁned manner, e.g., alter world towor1d.
E. Model Compression
Model compression is important for efﬁcient model deploy-
ment in software systems, especially when using large models,e.g., big DNNs. The goal of model compression is to reducethe model size while maximally maintaining the performancein terms of accuracy before practical deployment. Next, weintroduce the two compression techniques considered in ourwork.
•Model pruning. Model pruning lightens the model by
removing redundant and unimportant connections that havelittle impact on the performance. In this study, we apply two
919basic pruning strategies, the weight-level pruning [36] and the
neuron-level pruning [37]. The weight-level method sets theweights that are smaller than a threshold to zero. The neuron-level pruning removes the neurons that have a high chanceof being inactivated. Correspondingly, the related connections(weights) are also eliminated.
•Model quantization. In DNN, weights are stored in the
32-bit ﬂoating-point format. To compress the model, thequantization technique converts the weights from 32-bit intolow-bit (e.g., 8-bit integer).
III. O
VERVIEW
We ﬁrst introduce the three-phase design of our empirical
study, then present data selection metrics, datasets and models,and evaluation measures that are studied in our work.
The secure life cycle of deep learning is composed of
some key stages [38] from the requirement analysis and data-label pair collection to the maintenance and evolution of thedeep learning model. This paper studies the effect of the datacollection (i.e., active learning) on the model developmentand deployment (i.e., the model quality). Figure 2 gives anoverview of our study, which consists of three phases, effec-tiveness analysis of model training with different data selectionmetrics, adversarial robustness analysis of the trained model,and performance analysis after model deployment. Overall,we compare the models trained using the entire dataset and asubset of data selected by a speciﬁc data selection metric.
A. Study Design
More speciﬁcally, in the ﬁrst phase (data collection), we
compare the effectiveness of each data selection metric for
training a model. Using different metrics (e.g., Entropy, Mar-gin), we iteratively select a subset of training data and train themodel, then observe the convergence trend of the test accuracy.For comparison, we also train two baseline models using entiretraining data and randomly selected data, respectively.
In the second phase (model development), we evaluate
the robustness of the trained model. In our study, we applymultiple metrics (e.g., empirical robustness, CLEVER score)to compare the robustness of models trained with the selectedand the model trained by the entire training data.
In the third phase, we focus on the model performance (test
accuracy) in the model deployment phase. In general, a DNNmodel usually consists of a huge number of parameters, e.g.,a VGG16 model requires about 258MB of hard disk memory.Before deploying such a large DNN model into the hardware(e.g., mobile devices), one has to consider the performanceincluding the required memory and inference speed. We adopttwo well-known techniques (model quantization and modelpruning) to optimize a trained model. Then we evaluate theaccuracy of the optimized models. Besides, we study theimpact of training data size on the robustness of models andthe accuracy of optimized models.
Finally, based on the results of our empirical study, we
provide some practical guidelines for the usage of activelearning on different tasks and summarize some potentialresearch directions.B. Datasets and DNN Models
We conduct experiments with two popular image datasets
(MNIST [39] and CIFAR-10 [40]) and three widely used textdatasets (IMDb [41], TagMyNews [42], and Yahoo! Answers[43]). MNIST includes 10-class grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset includes 60000 and 10000 trainingand test data, respectively. CIFAR-10 is a collection of 10-class color images (e.g., airplane, bird). The dataset consistsof 50000 and 10000 training and test data, respectively. IMDbis a dataset including movie reviews widely used for textsentiment analysis (binary classiﬁcation). Both the trainingand test sets include 25000 text reviews. TagMyNews providesnews headlines (text) in 7 categories (e.g., Sport, Business).We randomly collect 20000 data for training and 2000 datafor testing. Yahoo! Answers consists of text data of 10 topiccategories (e.g., Society & Culture, and Science & Mathemat-ics). We obtain this data from [33] directly with 3560 trainingdata and 889 test data.
For each dataset, we employ two DNN architectures to
reduce the model-dependent inﬂuence on the results. ForMNIST, we use two well-known convolutional neural net-works LeNet-1 and LeNet-5 [44], and for CIFAR-10, we selecttwo models NiN [45] and VGG16 [46], both of which achievehigh accuracy. For IMDb, TagMyNews, and Yahoo! Answers,we use two types of RNNs, LSTM, and GRU, derived from abase model [47]. Our companion website presents all detailsabout the models and training parameters [48].
C. Data Selection Metrics
Various data selection metrics have been proposed and
veriﬁed to reduce the labeling effort. Note that the data
selection metric is also known as the acquisition function inthe ML community. We include 14 data selection metrics fromboth the ML community (8 metrics) and the SE community (6metrics). We ﬁrst introduce the ones from the ML community.
•Entropy [8] considers the uncertainty of data using the
prediction output. This metric is based on the Shannon entropyof the prediction probability:
arg max
x∈X/parenleftBiggN/summationdisplay
i=1pi(x)l o gpi(x)/parenrightBigg
(1)
•Margin [8] computes a score for each data by the difference
between its top-2 prediction probabilities:
Margin (x)=p k(x)−pj(x) (2)
wherek=a r g m a x
i=1:N(pi(x))andj=a r g m a x
i={1:N }/k(pi(x)). The
training data with low scores will be selected for training.
•K-center [10] ﬁrstly divides data into Kgroups via some
unsupervised machine learning methods (e.g., K-means clus-tering), then selects the center of each group (if not enough,consider the data that are close to the center). These selecteddata are regarded as the representative of the entire group.
•Expected Gradient Length (EGL) [49] assumes that the
model has no knowledge of the true label of data in advance.

Fig. 2. Overview of experiment design
For each data, it computes the expectation of the gradients
by assigning all the labels to x. The data that have great
expectations are selected. EGL can be presented as follows:

i=1pi(x)||/triangleinvxJ(x,i)|| (3)
where||.||is the Euclidean norm. /triangleinvxJ(x,i)is the gradient of
the lossJgivenxand label i.

•Entropy-dropout and Margin-dropout [9] apply dropout
and calculate the average score of Entropy and Margin overall dropout models, e.g., Entropy-dropout is deﬁned as
arg max
x∈XT/summationtext
i=1Entropy/parenleftbig
xi/parenrightbig
T(5)
whereEntropy/parenleftbig
xi/parenrightbig
is the entropy of xat thei-th time.
•Adversarial active learning (Adversarial al)[11] lever-
ages an adversarial attack, DeepFool, to facilitate selectingdata. Concretely, the model predicts labels for each data, thenDeepFool introduces perturbations to each data until reachesan adversarial example. Finally, the data requiring smallerperturbations will be selected. Intuitively, such data are closeto the decision boundary of the model.
Next, we introduce the metrics from the SE community.
•Neuron Coverage (NC) [16] selects data that have the
largest neuron coverage:
arg max
x∈X|{neu|neu∈Neurons ∧activate (neu,x )}|
|Neurons |(6)whereactivate (neu,x )indicates that the neuron neu is
activated by x, namely, the output of neu is greater than a
predeﬁned threshold. We highlight that this is a variant of theoriginal metric to ﬁt active learning. The original NC aims atselecting data to cover all the neurons, however, in practice,just a few data are enough to reach 100% coverage [51].Namely, after a few selection steps, all the neurons have beenactivated at least once and the marginal increase of coveragewill be 0. Thus, we apply this variant to ﬁt active learning.
•K-Multisection Neuron Coverage (KMNC) [15] improves
NC by splits the lower and upper bounds of a neuron’s outputintoksections. Instead of using the coverage of neurons, it
considers the coverage of sections. Similar to NC, the datawith high coverage will be selected.
•Multiple-Boundary Clustering and Prioritization (MCP)
[18] is an extension of Margin. First, it divides data intovarious “boundary areas” based on the top-2 predicted classes,e.g., for data with 10 classes, there are P(10,2) = 90
permutations of pairwise classes. Next, MCP selects data fromeach area based on Margin.
•DeepGini [19] selects the most uncertainty data by:
arg max
x∈X/parenleftBigg
1−N/summationdisplay
i=1(pi(x))2/parenrightBigg
(7)
•Likelihood-based Surprise Adequacy (LSA) and Distance-
based Surprise Adequacy (DSA) [17] measure the surprise
adequacy by the dissimilarity between a test data and thetraining set. The difference between LSA and DSA is thatLSA uses kernel density estimation to estimate the surpriseadequacy, while DSA uses Euclidean distance. Both select datawith the largest surprise adequacy.
We remark that although the initial purpose of these SE
metrics is not for active learning, their underlying selectioncriteria share similarities with the criteria that active learningmetrics rely on. For example, both Entropy (active learningmetric) and DeepGini (SE metric) metrics select the uncertaindata based on the output probabilities. Therefore, we believe
921that it is necessary to consider them in our study. Besides, no
existing research has revealed that whether these SE metricsﬁt in active learning or how they perform.
D. Evaluation Metrics
Effectiveness. To evaluate the effectiveness of a selection
metric, we use random selection as the baseline and calculatethe difference of accuracy between the models trained usingrandom selection and this metric. The difference is deﬁned by:
diff =
steps/summationdisplay
i=1/parenleftbig
Acci
TS−AcciTR/parenrightbig
(8)
wheresteps is the total number of training steps. Acci
TSis
the test accuracy of the model trained by a selection metric,
andAcci
TRis by random selection. diff shows the degree of
a metric outperforming random selection.
Adversarial robustness. The robustness of DNNs refers to
the ability to cope with adversarial examples. The robustness
of DNNs can be evaluated in multiple ways. We introducetwo popular methods of robustness estimation, Empirical Ro-bustness [52] and CLEVER score [24]. 1) Empirical Robust-
ness This method quantiﬁes the robustness of a DNN model
through the success rate of crafting adversarial examples byan attack. In practice, given a DNN and a test set S,a n
attack attempts to craft an adversarial example based on eachtest data. The attack success rate is the ratio of adversarialexamples successfully generated:
ASR =|{x|x∈S∧y
x/prime/negationslash=y}|
|S|(9)
Recall that yx/primeandyare the predicted label of x/primeand true
label of x, respectively. A small ASR indicates a robust
DNN. 2) CLEVER Score The Cross-Lipschitz Extreme Value
fornEtwork Robustness (CLEVER) score calculates the lowerbound for crafting an adversarial example given an input,which is the least amount of perturbation required to fool aDNN model. A great CLEVER score indicates a robust DNN.

an unlabeled pool with all the unlabeled data. Besides, weinitialize the with random weights. Next, in each trainingstep, a ﬁxed number (step size) of data are selected from theunlabeled pool by a speciﬁc metric. Then the selected dataare merged into to labeled pool after annotation. The DNN isupdated by retraining using all the data in the labeled pool. TheTABLE I

procedure terminates when the size of the labeled pool reachesa threshold (stop point). Table I lists the detailed settings. Notethat previous works have different parameter settings [8], [9],[20], [55], we balance these settings to set up our experiments.We implement data selection metrics based on [20].
Robustness. We use two public libraries, Foolbox [56] for
empirical robustness evaluation and ART [57] for CLEVERscore calculation. In empirical robustness, we apply threeattack methods, i.e., FGSM, JSMA, and C&W, for the imageclassiﬁcation task, and conduct three groups of experimentswith different parameters as in [58]. For the text classiﬁcationtask, we use PWWS and DWB with the default setting in[33], [35] to attack the text-related models. By default, onlythe correctly classiﬁed data undertake the attacks. In CLEVERscore, the setting of canddisfollows the conﬁguration in [58].
One difference is that we use 500 test data to calculate theCLEVER score, while [58] used 50. The detailed informationis shown in Table II. Note that the setting of CLEVER worksboth for the image and text classiﬁcation tasks.
Model compression In model quantization, we apply two
lightweight frameworks, CoreML [59] and TensorFlowLite[60], to transform DNNs into different bit-level versions. ForCoreML, we use three levels, 2-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit. ForTensorﬂowLite, we apply 8-bit and 16-bit level quantizationsin our models since it only supports these two levels. In modelpruning, for both the weight- and neuron-level, we prune aDNN into six compress versions with different degrees, from10% to 60% at 10% intervals, using the implementations by[36], [37]. As a reminder, model pruning is conducted afterthe model is well-trained.
Last but not least, to reduce the inﬂuence of randomness, we
repeat each experiment three times and compute the averageresults. In total, we trained and evaluated more than 2000models in this study. The source code can be found on

training using the entire dataset, the subset selected by data
selection metrics, and randomly selected data, respectively.Note that due to the page limitation, we only illustrate a part ofthe results in this paper, and the complete results are providedas supplementary material [48]. The conclusions we drawbelow generalize to all studied datasets/subjects and DNNs.
A. RQ1: Effectiveness of Data Selection Metrics
First, we show, in Figure 3, the performance of using dif-
ferent data selection metrics to train a DNN that achieves the
same test accuracy as the fully trained model. For comparison,a horizontal dashed line in each sub-ﬁgure represents theaccuracy of the fully trained model. Overall, most metricsmanage to produce models with the same accuracy as the fullytrained model by using only 7% to 50% of training data.
Next, Table III offers a more detailed comparison of these
metrics, showing their effectiveness taking random selectionas a baseline (measured using Equation 8). Surprisingly, onlythree metrics (Margin, Margin-dropout, MCP) signiﬁcantlyoutperform the baseline in all cases. On the contrary, in mostcases (9 out of 10), EGL is worse than random selection. Thereare some metrics like LSA and DSA, which outperform thebaseline on the image classiﬁcation task but underperform thebaseline on the text classiﬁcation task, e.g., on Yahoo-LSTMand Yahoo-GRU, and the difference reaches up to 392.39. Weconjecture that LSA and DSA tend to select data based onsimilarity or distance. However, different from image data,the two texts data (sentence or document) might have a bigdifference in the hidden space even if they are in the samecategory. In this case, the inter-output of the model againstthese two data can be completely different which makes LSAand DSA select the wrong data.
Speciﬁcally, considering the image classiﬁcation task, we
observe that in addition to Margin, Margin-dropout, and MCP,two other metrics, LSA and DSA, can always outperformthe baseline. What’s more, on LeNet-1 and LeNet-5, halfof the metrics are worse than the random baseline. Espe-cially, Entropy, Entropy-dropout, NC, and DeepGini get highnegative differences, e.g., -131.88 for Entropy on LeNet-1,which means these four metrics are much worse than randomselection. Turn to sub-ﬁgures 3(a) and 3(b), in the ﬁrst fewtraining steps (where the big difference comes from), thesefour metrics achieve much less test accuracy than the others(also random selection). One explanation is that Entropy,Entropy-dropout, and DeepGini try to ﬁnd the most uncertaindata. However, such uncertain data are hard to be learned bymodels that are not well-trained.
On the other hand, for the text classiﬁcation task, the output
probability-based metrics (e.g., Margin and BALD) performbetter than the coverage and surprise adequacy-based metrics.Extremely, LSA performs worse than the baseline on 5 (out of6) models. Besides, on model Yahoo
LSTM, the most efﬁcient
metric (Margin) is much better than the worst one (KMNC)with a 418.49% test accuracy gap. These results reﬂect thatboth coverage and surprise adequacy based-metrics are notsuitable for the text classiﬁcation task.
Answer to RQ1: The nature of the classiﬁcation task
signiﬁcantly affects the effectiveness of multiple data selectionmetrics (e.g., LSA and DSA). Therefore, the limitation ofactive learning experiments to a single target task – evenwith multiple datasets – constitutes a critical threat to externalvalidity. Some metrics, like Margin, Margin-dropout, andMCP, consistently perform well across all labeling budgets,models, and tasks.
B. RQ2: Adversarial Robustness
We then study the robustness of models trained by different
data selection metrics against adversarial attacks. Figure 4
illustrates the empirical robustness of the models againstvarious attacks. Once again, we have to distinguish the twotypes of tasks since the results of different metrics are greatlybiased on the tasks. For the image classiﬁcation task, the TEmodels are usually more robust than the TS models. However,for the text classiﬁcation task, the TS models are in somecases more robust than the TE models (ad vice-versa). Weconjecture that two factors may affect the robustness of themodels: (i) the number of data used for training and (ii) thetraining process. In active learning, the early selected data aretrained more times during incremental learning. Thus, the mostinformative data (according to the data selection metrics) havea larger inﬂuence on the model weights and, in turn, impact itsrobustness. On the other hand, since the selected data can berepresentative of the entire dataset to some extent, the differ-ence between the TS and TE models is small. Taking VGG16as an example, the difference varies from 1.67% to 17.21%in FGSM, from 1.42% to 3.21% in C&W, and from 0.32%to 10.54% in JSMA. Another observation that reinforces ourhypothesis regarding the importance of the training processis that none of the metrics performs consistently better thanrandom selection. We investigate this hypothesis in the RQ4experiments, where we consider different labeling budgets.
Table IV lists the CLEVER score of different models. As
for the text classiﬁcation task, models trained with activelearning either yield a small improvement (less than 0.58CLEVER score) or offer inconsistent beneﬁt (either increasingor decreasing the CLEVER score, depending on the consideredmetric and norm distance). Besides, none of the data selectionmetrics improves over the random selection, even the threemetrics which performed better in terms of effectiveness (viz.

corroborate our previous ﬁndings. That is, for the imageclassiﬁcation task, active learning yields less robust models.

trained with active learning can have lower robustness thanmodels trained with the entire dataset, and the difference canbe up to 1.49 CLEVER score and 23.39% attack successrate. Therefore, experimental studies should involve evaluationmetrics beyond clean accuracy. For the text classiﬁcationtask, the results are inconsistent across attacks (empiricalrobustness) and distance norm (CLEVER score), indicatingthat other factors are at play when it comes to robustness,e.g., the training process.
C. RQ3: Test Accuracy After Model Compression
We compare the test accuracy of a model produced by
different data selection metrics before and after compression.
Table V shows the results of VGG16 (image classiﬁcation)and TagMyNews-LSTM (text classiﬁcation) by quantization.
On VGG16, the accuracy of the 2-bit compressed models
drops signiﬁcantly by at least 76.32%, no matter it was fullytrained or with active learning. By contrast, on TagMyNews-LSTM, the accuracy decay using 2-bit is relatively small (lessthan 9.42%). The reason could be that, 1)the quantization
924process has less impact on the LSTM layer, or 2)the text
data is less sensitive to the precision of weights. In both
cases, the compressed models achieve the same accuracy asthe original models with 16-bit (expect Margin and Entropy-dropout On TagMyNews-LSTM). Speciﬁcally, compared withrandom selection, on both VGG16 and TagMyNews-LSTM,no metric always outperforms the baseline. Comparing withthe TE model, we found that for the image classiﬁcation task,the compressed TE model always maintains higher (with a gapup to 7.47%) test accuracy. However, for the text classiﬁcationtask, the TS model sometimes loses more test accuracy thanthe TS models after quantization. Surprisingly, with 2-bitquantization, the TE model gets the largest accuracy decay(-9.42%).

Figure 5 depicts the result by weight- and neuron-level prun-
ing. In general, with pruning more weights and neurons, thetest accuracy decreases gradually up to 36.20% and 81.46%on VGG16, respectively. However, on TagMyNews-LSTM, theaccuracy changes negligibly by increasing or decreasing up to0.4%. The reason might be that these two pruning methods canonly affect the Convolutional layer and the Dense layer, whileour LSTM models only contain one Dense layer to output theﬁnal prediction probability. Looking into VGG16, the neuron-level pruning affects the accuracy more than the weight-levelfor all the data selection metrics, which suggests that inpractical applications, the engineers should consider more theweight-level pruning than the neuron-level to minimize theaccuracy loss. Among these data selection metrics, DeepGiniand NC are always better than random selection. Besides,for the image classiﬁcation task, the TE model outperformsall TS models with a gap up to 33.4%. However, for thetext classiﬁcation task, the TE model has no advantage ofmaintaining test accuracy over TS models after pruning.
Answer to RQ3: Model compression inconsistently affects
the performance of the models trained with active learning andno data selection metric provides satisfactory results acrossall tasks. For the image classiﬁcation task, after compression,the fully trained models hold higher test accuracy than themodels trained with active learning, and the gap can be up to0 10 20 30 40 50 60

7.47% (quantization) and 33.4% (pruning). On the contrary,for the text classiﬁcation task, the fully trained models haveno advantage of test accuracy over the models trained withactive learning after model compression.
D. RQ4: Impact of Training Data Size
From Sections V-B and V-C, we found that the data selec-
tion metrics tend to produce less robust models and introduce
greater changes of accuracy after model compression. Wefurther extend our experiments to investigate the impact of thedata size on the quality (e.g., adversarial robustness and testaccuracy after compression) of models. Figure 6 shows theresults on VGG16 and TagMyNews-LSTM. For adversarialattacks, we use JSMA-0.01 for VGG16 and PWWS forTagMyNews-LSTM, respectively. For model compression, weemploy the 4-bit quantization by CoreML. On both models, weshow the results by two data selection metrics: the predictionprobability-based Entropy and neuron coverage (NC).
Figure 6(a) and Figure 6(b) show that TS models become
more robust with more training data added, especially, themodels could be more robust than the fully trained modelsin the end. According to the results, we can see that toachieve similar robustness with fully trained models, more than60% of training data are required for the image classiﬁcationtask, while only 35% of training data is enough for the textclassiﬁcation task. This corroborates our hypothesis (see RQ2)that the training process used by active learning (which makesdata selected earlier go through more training iterations thandata selected later) can yield more robust models comparedto a traditional training process involving all data from thebeginning. This ﬁnding also opens the perspective of usingsuch an active learning process in conjunction with commonmethods to improve robustness, such as adversarial training.
Figure 6(c) and Figure 6(d) show the test accuracy decay
after model compression. For the text classiﬁcation task, thedifference is negligible throughout the increase in data size.

For the image classiﬁcation task, the decay of accuracy keeps
stably lower than 10% until the data size reaches 37500, wherethe accuracy decreases signiﬁcantly by up to 60.73%. Theseresults reveal that the data size is not a key factor in the testaccuracy decay on model compression.
Answer to RQ4: Increasing the labeling budget of active
learning mitigates the loss in robustness compared to a fullytrained model. For example, using at least 60% training datafor the image classiﬁcation task (respectively, 35% for the textclassiﬁcation task) yields models with the same robustness asthe fully trained model. However, training with more data doesnot change our previous conclusions regarding the inconsistenteffect of model compression.
E. Discussion
We highlight our novel ﬁndings ﬁrst, then discuss some
practical guidance and research directions accordingly.
Novel ﬁndings and user guidance. 1) Finding: previous
studies were limited to test accuracy, the image classiﬁcation
task, and did not compare metrics from both the ML and SEcommunities. We reveal that the beneﬁts of active learning arehighly task-dependent. Some data selection metrics (LSA andDSA) are highly affected by the nature of classiﬁcation tasks,while some (Margin, Margin-dropout, and MCP) can achieveconsistently high performance. Guidance: engineers need tochoose data selection metrics according to speciﬁc tasks. 2)
Finding: the limitation of active learning also exists in theadversarial robustness and model compression, however, theevaluation was missing in the literature. We found that theactive learning process has some potential but notable impacton these indicators, e.g., for the image classiﬁcation task, thefully trained model is more robust than the model trainedby active learning. Guidance: engineers are recommended toconsider all these indicators when using active learning.
Research directions. 1) Since no existing data selection
metric can perform well on all the considered objectives,an interesting research direction is to design data selectionmetrics that can optimize multiple qualities such as accu-racy, robustness, and accuracy after compression. Regardingrobustness, an adequate metric should also effectively integratewith an adversarial training process, minimizing the amountof data to form which adversarial examples are generated toincrease the model robustness. 2)Our study focuses on two
types of classiﬁcation tasks (image and text). Recently, DLsystems have been applied in some SE-related tasks, such assource code function prediction and automatic program repair.Exploring how existing data selection metrics perform on thesetasks is a potential research direction. Besides, proposing asource code-oriented data selection metric for this kind ofsystem could be another contribution.
F . Threats to V alidity
First, threats to validity may lie in the selected datasets and
DNN models. Regarding the datasets, we employ ﬁve popular
datasets across both image and text classiﬁcation tasks in ourstudy. As for the DNNs, we consider, in total, ten architectures(two for each dataset) to alleviate the model-dependent issue.Though the models we use perform well on the chosen tasks,an interesting direction of future work is to repeat the study onmore complex model architectures, such as transformer-basedmodels for text classiﬁcation [61], and observe whether thetrends remain.
Second, the parameter conﬁguration may induce a threat to
validity. Regarding the parameters in active learning, there isno universal rule for choosing the best settings. For instance,previous studies [8], [9], [20], [55] utilize different settings oflabeling budget and stop strategy. We mitigate this threat tovalidity in two ways: (1) we took the best and most commonpractices from the literature to design our active learningprocess and settings, and (2) our research questions concernthe speciﬁc impact of some parameters (e.g. RQ4 studies theimpact of the stop criteria). For robustness evaluation, wefollow a recent study [58] to set a range of perturbation sizesfor different adversarial attacks. As for model compression,our study involves multiple settings to reduce the potentialbias of the results.
Third, due to the space limitation, we only report the results
of two datasets covering the image and text classiﬁcationtasks. Nonetheless, we remark that the reported conclusionis generalized to all the datasets and DNNs. For example,for RQ2, in total, 31 out of 36 settings, the fully trainedimage-related models are more robust than the actively trainedmodels, which is consistent with our ﬁnding. Besides, wereport all our complete results on our project site [48].
VI. RELATED WORK
We review related works in three aspects: data selection in
DL systems, empirical study on active learning, and empiricalstudy for DL systems.
Data selection in DL systems. We have already witnessed
the success of data selection in SE problems, such as system-atic literature review [62], defect prediction based on static
926code attributes [28], software cost modeling [63], and software
fault prediction [64]. Meanwhile, in the ML community, manydata selection metrics have been proposed mainly for activelearning. Recently, Ren et al. [65] surveyed the active learning
metrics and categorized them into uncertainty-based [8], [66],deep Bayesian active learning [9], density-based [10], [67],and other methods [11], [68], [69]. On the other hand, the SEcommunity has proposed some DL testing criteria as well asdata selection metrics. Inspired by the program coverage, Peiet al. [16] proposed the basic neuron coverage criterion, which
can be used as a data selection metric. Then, DeepGauge[15] introduced other DL test criteria, e.g., KMNC, NeuronBoundary Coverage. Kim et al. [17] proposed surprise guided
testing metrics based on the similarity between the trainingdata and test data. Moreover, some prediction probabilitybased data selection metrics [18], [19], [70] are also proposed.Most recently, Wang et al. [71] proposed a robustness-oriented
data selection metric, however, their metric can only selectdata that are generated by adversarial attacks, it is out ofour consideration. In our work, we comprehensively studiedalmost all these metrics not only on their effectiveness but alsothe potential limitations.
Empirical study on active learning. Active learning has
been widely studied over recent years, and some empiricalstudies of active learning have also been conducted fromdifferent domains. Ramirez-Loaiza et al. [72] utilized several
performance measures, e.g., accuracy, F1 score, and AUC, toevaluate active learning baselines. However, all these measuresare based on the correctness of classiﬁcation, while our studyincludes more evaluation methods, such as the adversarialrobustness and the performance change by model compression.Pereira-Santos et al. [73] conducted a large-scale empirical
study of active learning for three machine learning algorithms,C4.5, SVM, and 5NN. Similarly, the evaluation is limitedto the classiﬁcation correctness quantiﬁed by the Area underthe Learning Curve (ALC). In addition, some works targetspeciﬁc tasks by active learning. Settles et al. [49] analyzed
active learning for sequence labeling tasks such as informationextraction and document segmentation. For these speciﬁcproblems, the evaluation mainly lies in the learning curveand runtime. Yu et al. [62] empirically studied existing active
learning techniques for literature reviews, then proposed anovel one that outperforms the existing metrics concerning therecall vs. studies reviewed curve. Chen et al. [74] studied the
behavior of active learning for the word sense disambiguationtask. However, they only considered two basic data selectionmetrics, entropy and margin, and the evaluation only involvesaccuracy. Heilbron1 et al. [75] explored active learning for
the action localization task, which also only considered a verylimited number of (3) data selection metrics and comparedthe performance by ALC based on the correctness. Manabu[76] studied active learning with support vector machines(SVMs) for natural language processing. In their study, theyonly compared their proposed metrics with random selectionbased on accuracy. Besides, the ﬁnding is mainly that SVMactive learning is suitable for Japanese word segmentation.To sum up, compared with previous empirical studies, our
study focuses on the application of active learning in deeplearning systems and is the ﬁrst one that studied both imageclassiﬁcation and text classiﬁcation tasks. More importantly,our work is the only one that analyzes the impacts of ac-tive learning on two important testing aspects during DNNdeployment, the adversarial robustness and the performanceof DNNs after model compression. Moreover, to the best ofour knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst that evaluates the dataselection metrics proposed by the SE community for activelearning.
Empirical study for DL systems. Recently, multiple em-
pirical research studies focus on exploring the DL issues thatare hard to be solved in theory. Guo et al. [77] studied the
performance difference between different DL frameworks aswell as the model changes after model migration. Zhang et
al.[78] and Chen et al. [79] studied the challenges in the
deployment phase of DL systems. Both of them revealed thatdeveloping a DL system is harder than developing softwaresystems. Ma et al. [20] performed a comparison study on
different data selection metrics. They investigated the abilityof each metric to identify misclassiﬁed input and improve thetest accuracy by retraining. What’s more, Zhang et al. [80]
conducted a comparative study about the capability of differentuncertainty metrics in distinguishing adversarial examples andbenign examples. Different from these works, our empiricalstudy focuses on exploring the limitations of active learning,especially the potential limitations of the model trained byactive learning, compared to the fully trained model.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive empirical
study to explore the limitations of active learning. In total,more than 2000 models for image classiﬁcation and textclassiﬁcation tasks have been trained and systematically eval-uated. The results reveal that, when using active learning totrain a model, different data selection metrics yield modelsof signiﬁcantly different quality (in accuracy and robustness).For the image classiﬁcation task, a model trained with activelearning can achieve competitive test accuracy but suffers fromrobustness loss and are less to compression. However, thesedownsides rarely occur in text classiﬁcation models. Also, wefurther studied the relationship between the data budget andthe quality of a trained model. We found that the robustnessof the model increases with the amount of training data, andultimately reaches the robustness of the fully trained model.Based on these ﬁndings, we provided some practical guidanceas well as research directions. We believe that our work couldgive engineers and researchers some valuable insights into thewhole secure life cycle of deep learning, especially in the datacollection and model evolution steps.
