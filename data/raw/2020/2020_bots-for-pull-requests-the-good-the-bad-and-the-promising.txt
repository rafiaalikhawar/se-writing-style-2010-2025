ABSTRACT
Software bots automate taskswithin Open Source Software (OSS)
projects’ pull requests and save reviewing time and effort (“the
good”). However, their interactions can be disruptive and noisyand lead to information overload (“the bad”). To identify strate-gies to overcome such problems, we applied Design Fiction as a
participatorymethodwith32practitioners.Weelicited22design
strategiesforabotmediatororthepullrequestuserinterface(“the
promising”). Participants envisioned a separate place in the pull
requestinterfaceforbotinteractionsandabotmediatorthatcan
summarize and customize other bots’ actions to mitigate noise. We
also collected participants’ perceptions about a prototype imple-
menting the envisioned strategies. Our design strategies can guide
the development of future bots and social coding platforms.

Softwaredevelopmentbotsplayaprominentroleinthepullrequest
reviewprocess[ 66]byservingasaninterfacebetweenusersand
other tools [ 60] and reducing the workload of maintainers and
contributors. Accomplishing tasks previously solely performed by
human developers, and interacting in the same communication
channelsastheirhumancounterparts,botshavebecomenewvoices
in the pull request review conversation [ 42]. Bots even perform
more activities than humans in some projects [19].
Nevertheless, the introduction of bots can interfere with the
community dynamics. According to Brown and Parnin [7], the bot
interactions on pull requests can be inconvenient, leading develop-
ers to leave negative feedback or even abandon their contributions.
Indeed, the literature has shown that bots change the dynamics
of collaboration [ 67] and thatOSS developers often perceive their
intervention as disruptive and noisy [ 68]. On an issue, a developer
complainedaboutthefrequencyofabot’sactions:“[..]Igetabout
20 notifications per day just from those bot actions and there does not
seem to be a way to ignore them.”1Therefore, bots may overburden
developers who already suffer from information overload when
communicatingonline[48].
Tomakebotsmoreeffectiveatcommunicatingtodevelopers,de-
signproblemsneedtobesolvedtoavoidrepetitivenotifications,pro-
videconsistencyinthetasksbeingdone,andmakebotsadaptive[ 37,
58]. Designers should envision software bots as socio-technical
rather than purely technical applications, considering human in-
teraction, developers’ collaboration, and ethical concerns [ 60]. The
adoption of bots in OSS projects is a recent trend and the literature
lacks design strategies that include the end-users’ perspective to
enhancethe bots interaction on social coding platforms.
In other domains, as it is hard to change third-party bots, re-
searchershaveproposedmeta-botstointegrateandmoderatethe
interactions of multiple bots [ 9,17,53]. We envision a meta-bot as
a promising approach to mitigate the information overload from
existing GitHub bots. Considering this context, the main goal of
this study is to elicit design strategies to overcome the information

Specifically,ourworkinvestigatesthefollowingresearchquestions:
Research Question 1
What design strategies can potentially reduce the noise cre-
ated by bots on pull requests?
Research Question 2
How doparticipantsperceive the design strategies to reduce
the noisecreated by bots on pull requests?
To answer RQ1, we applied Design Fiction [ 5] as a participatory
design method. This technique is used to probe, explore, and cri-
tique future technologies [ 5]. We recruited practitioners, including
open-source maintainers, contributors, bot developers, and bot re-
searchers,toact as designers inthe early stagesof the envisioned
meta-bot conception. We presented to participants afi ctional story
of a meta-bot capable of better supporting developers’ interactions
on pull requests, and operating as a mediator between developers
and the existing bots. Participants answered questions to complete
theendofthefictionalstory,raisingconcernsabouttheuseofbots
and discussingthedesignstrategiesfor the meta-bot.
For the RQ2, we used the emerged design strategies to proto-
type a meta-bot and collect feedback from the practitioners, which
resultedinasetofimprov ementstothestrategies.Overall,ourpar-

totheauthor’scontext—whethertheauthorisanewcontributor
or an experienced maintainer. Participants also envision a separate
placein the pull request interface for bot interactions.
Our work contributes to the state-of-the-art by empirically iden-
tifying a set of design strategies to enhance how bots present in-
formationonpullrequestsandavoidnoise.Researchersandtool
designersmayleverage our results, obtainedfrom the perspective
of expert practitioners, to enhance bots’ communication design,
thereby supporting human-bot interaction on social coding plat-forms. In particular, the design strategies can benefit the larger
software engineering research community as aspects related to the
design of bots for social coding platforms are still under-explored.

2 RELATED WORK
Softwarebotsfrequentlyresideonplatformswhereusersworkand
interactwithotherusers[ 34],suchasTwitter,Telegram,andStack-
Overflow. In the software engineering domain, bots support social
and technical activities, including communication and decision-
making[60].Open-sourcecommunitieshavebeenadoptingbotsto
automate a variety of repetitive tasks, including repairing bugs [ 42,
64],refactoringsourcecode[ 69],fixingstaticanalysisviolations[ 11,
54],suggestingcodeimprovements[ 52],andpredictingdefects[ 29].
On the GitHub platform, bots have user profiles to interact with
the developers, executing well-defined tasks [66].
Despitethewidespreadadoptionofbotsonsocialcodingplat-
forms,theinteractionbetweenbotsandhumansisstillchalleng-
ing[66,68].Analyzingthe tool-recommender-bot,BrownandParnin[7]reportthatbotsstillneedtoovercomeproblemssuchasnotifica-

fications and only a third of the bots’ pull requests were merged
intothecodebase.PengandMa [51]studiedhowdevelopersper-
ceive and work with mention bot and concluded that it does not
meet the diverse needs of users. For example, while project owners
requiresimplicityandstability,contributorsrequiretransparency,
andreviewersrequireselectivity.Resultsalsoshowthatdevelopers

heavyworkload.Theseresultsareinlinewiththestudyconducted
byWesseletal .[68],whichindicatesthatnoiseisacentralproblem.
Noise affects both human communication and the development
workflow by overwhelming and distracting developers. Comple-
menting the previous literature, we provide afi rst step towards
enhancing bots communication design, thereby overcoming noise.
Inothercontexts,researchershaveproposedtheuseofameta-
bot to integrate and moderate the interactions of multiple bots.Sadeddin et al
. [53]showed that a meta-bot could obtain prod-
uct information from several shopping bots and summarize theinformation before presenting it to users. Previous research also
investigated the user experience of single- vs. multi-botconversa-
tionalsystems.InaWizard-of-Ozstudy,ChavesandGerosa [12]
foundthatparticipantsreportmoreconfusioninamulti-botsce-nario than when using a meta-bot. The concept of the meta-bot
also appears in the literature on software agents. Generalist agents
areusuallyreferredtoasSuperBotsormeta-bots[ 17]sincethey
oftencombinemultipletasksandfunctionalitiesofspecialistagents
into a single agent. Given this preliminary evidence obtained in
other domains, we hypothesize that a meta-bot can mitigate the
informationoverloadcreatedbyotherbotsaroundpullrequests. As
designing a meta-bot in this complex socio-technical environment

feedback from practitioners. In the following subsections, we focus
onthepresentationoftheparticipatorydesignfictionmethodology
(Phase I). We describe the method and results from Phase II in
Section 5.
3.1 Phase I: Research Approach
We applied Design Fiction method [ 5,57], which has been broadly
used in the Human-Computer Interactionfi eld [ 6,20,43]. The
Design Fiction method wasfi rst defined by Sterling [57]as “the
deliberateuseofdiegeticprototypestosuspenddisbeliefaboutchange.”
Designfi ction can be described as making use of practices such as
prototypingandnarrativeelementstoenvisionandexplainplau-
sible futures, while reflecting upon the present world [ 5,20,26,
35,36,38,43]. Researchers have been employed this method in an

empirical way to elicit information from participants [ 8,49] and
communicate their insights [ 23,31]. The speculative nature of this
technique amplifies critical views of current social and technolog-
ical developments, creating afi ctional context narrated through
designed artifacts [ 16]. This approach facilitates exploring bound-
less thoughts and open discussions on a particular subject[ 6]. For
instance,manyresearchersusedesignfictiontoanticipateissues[ 6],
whileothersfocusonvaluesrelatedtonewtechnologies[ 15,44]
and anticipateusers’needs [14, 20, 49].
Past studies applied Design Fiction as a participatory method to
unveildesignstrategiesfordevelopmenttechnologiesinanarrative
format [8,22,46]. According to Muller [45], narratives in partici-
patoryworkmaybetoldbyusersaspartoftheircontributionto
specifying what products or services should do. Candello et al .[8],
for example, applied Design Fiction to explore the expectations of
sciencemuseum guideswhenteachingrobots howtoanswermu-
seum visitors questions. Candello et al . [8]crafted afi ctional story
describing the dilemma of buying such robots to work as guides
andparticipantsansweredquestionsabouttheirexpectationsabout
thesefuturisticrobots.FollowingCandelloetal .[8]’sapproach,we
used narratives and follow-up questions to speculate on the design
of the meta-bot for social coding platforms.
DesignFictiondistinguishesitselfintheway thedesignedarti-
facts bring context-specific meaning and social relevance [ 4] to the
envisioned technology [ 30]. In this work, the use of Design Fiction
enables the practitioners to envision a bot mediator and its envi-
ronment, rather than focusing on the current technical limitations.
3.2 Phase I: Method
Inthefollowing,wedescribethefictionalstoryweusedandhow
we conducted sandboxing, recruiting, and analysis for Phase I.
3.2.1 The Fictional Story. The story description follows the key
idea raised by the noise theory of Wessel et al . [68]: information
overload generated by the bots’ interaction on pull requests dis-
ruptsbothhumancommunicationanddevelopmentworkflow.The
storydescribes theexperience ofan open-sourcemaintainer who
adoptedbotstoreduceherworkloadonpullrequestactivities.Afteradoptingafewbots,theinformationoverloadgeneratedbythebots’
noise became evident to other team members. At that point, her
team brainstormed and decided to apply some countermeasures to
overcome the noise. Their idea was to implement a meta-bot to act
asamediatorbetweentheexistingbotsandhumandevelopers.Wetold participants that thefi ctional story takes place approximately
ten years in the future to let them be less constrained by current
technological limitations.

3.2.2 Sandbox Sessions. We conducted sandbox sessions with a
small sample of participants to adjust thefi ctional story and thesession instrument. We invited three participants who had expe-rience contributing to and maintaining open source projects onGitHub. We asked for feedback on the 3-minute video, verifying
whethertheparticipantscouldcapturetheintendedmessageofthe
fictionalstory.Inaddition,wevalidatedthescriptandconfirmed
whether the session wouldfi t in a 1-hour time slot. The sandbox
participantswatchedthevideo,answeredallthequestions,andpro-
videduswithfeedbackabouttheflowofthescript.Theparticipants
suggested a few minor adjustments, which were incorporated to
the instruments. We also analyzed the answers to ensure that they
provided data to answer our research question. The data collected
duringthese sandbox sessions were discarded.

We started the sessions with a short explanation about the re-

meta-bot.Next, we present the investigated scenarios:
Scenario One (S1) – Newcomers. This scenario describe a situa-
tionthatoccurswhenadevelopersubmits theirfirstcontribution
to an open-source project. As soon as the newcomer submits a pull
request, bots start posting their respective comments. Newcomers

the emergent codes and reached a negotiated agreement [ 24]i n
weekly hands-on meetings. During these meetings, the researchers
refined the code set by checking the code names, merging codestogether, or identifying a different granularity level for a code.
These discussions aimed to increase the reliability of the results
and mitigate bias [
50,62]. Then, the analysis was presented and
discussed with the other authors. During the data analysis pro-cess, we employed a constant comparison method [

We do not share the session transcripts due to confidentiality
reasons. However, we made our complete code book publicly avail-

4 PHASE I: DESIGN FICTION FINDINGS
In this section, we present the strategies to mitigate bots’ noise de-
rived from the analysis of the participatory designfi ction sessions
(see Section 3). The participants discussed several design strategies
to mitigate noise created by bots, as presented in Table 2. We or-
ganizedthosestrategiesintermsofthepotentialfeaturesforthe

In summary, we found 22 design strategies, organized intofi ve
categories: informationmanagement (IMi),newcomers’assistance
(NAi),notificationmanagement (NMi),spamandfailuresmanage-
ment(SMi),and platformsupport (PSi).Inthefollowing,wepresent

Informationmanagement. Thestrategy summarizationof
bot comments (11) was frequently mentioned by the participants
asawaytomitigateinformationoverload.Summariesshouldbe
conciseandreportanoverviewofthepullrequeststatus:“Givemea
contextreportorsummary.Iexpectthemeta-bottobejustonepartic-ularcommentwithsomepoints.Justonecommentwitheverythingasaconsciousreport ”[P26].Howeve r,thisstrategyalsoimposessome
technical challenges when it comes to implementation. According
to P31, “it is difficult to summarize [other bot comments], because,
although the message is created by a bot, it’s supposedly based on
a template.” In terms of its implementation, the easiest strategy
to reduce noise would be aggregatingbot comments (9). In this
specific case, the meta-bot would merge bots outputs into a single
commentonapullrequest.Thisstrategyisusuallymentionedin
conjunctionwith summarizingthebots outputs: “ it could possibly
summarize[botcomments]andputtheminasinglemessage ”[P6].
Inbothcases,themeta-botcreatesasingleoutputforallbots,how-
ever, it does not imply implementing the merging strategy always
based on the summarized version of each bot output.Another strategy concerned the order that the information is
presented to the developers. Participants suggest a prioritization
of bot outputs within the summary the meta-bot provides, suchthat the meta-bot has the capacity to treat some bot comments
asmoreimportantthanothers.Basically,participantsmentioned
twodifferenttypesofprioritization: basedontasks (9)andbased
on issues (7). For the prioritization based on tasks, the meta-bot
would sort the most important bot comments based on the task
implemented in the pull request: “it would also be able to sort of
filteroutwhatisusefulandwhatisnotusefulbasedonthetaskthe
developer is actually working on ” [P10]. The prioritization might
alsotakeintoaccountthepullrequestproblemsraisedbybots,sort-
ingbythelevelofcriticalityofbotnotifications,asmentionedby
P21: “if any critical problem happens, then I would like to be notified
withaspecificbotreport,Iwouldreceiveacriticalnotification.”T o
complement prioritization,fi ve participants also suggested the cat-
egorizationofbotcomments (5).TheMeta-botwouldgroupthe
botoutputsbasedontheirtypes(e.g.,testing,security,information)
beforereportinginthepullrequest.Withacategorizationofbotcomments, developers “know if [they] need[] to look at [a specific
bot comment] or not ” [P27].
To avoid inflating the pull requests with several comments from
themeta-bot,onesuggestedstrategyisto keep the mostrecent
information (7). Participants suggested that the meta-bot creates
a single comment and keeps updating it with new information
fromotherbots:“themeta-botjustcreatesonecommentandkeeps
updating it ” [P16]. It should also keep the comment up-to-date: “if
[thedeveloper] commit[s] again, the meta-bot updates the comment.
If [the developer]fi xes Lint’s errors, for example, the meta-bot will
remove the warning from the comment.” [P23]
Participantsalsomentionedotheradditionalaspectsofthemeta-
botcommunicationunrelatedtomitigatingnoise.Forexample,par-
ticipantsenvision the meta-bot interactingwith users through
naturallanguage (4)byprovidinganinterfaceforcommunicat-
ing with developers to understand their requests and answer their
questions. To promote diversity and inclusion, the meta-bot can
provideInternationalization (2) and support different languages
(e.g. German).
Newcomers’assistance. Thenewcomers’scenariowepresented
to participants led them to think about how the information pre-sented by the current bots might affect newcomers’ perceptions
andsuccess. As a result, we found four main strategies that might
assist newcomers, of which explaining rules, instructions, and
requirements (8) was one of the most frequent. According to par-
ticipants,themeta-botcouldguidethenewcomersandinformthem
about the project’s rules and the requirements to approve the pull
request. For example, P13 explains the importance of providing
such explanations: “[the newcomers] do not understand the rules yet
and...don’tunderstandwhichrulesareimportant. ”Thus,“themeta-
botwoulddoanexcellentjobforanewcomerbyexplainingwhythese
rules exist ” [P13]. The meta-bot could also refer to the contribu-
tion guidelines to assist a newcomer developers’fi rst contribution,
as well as include a welcoming message in the meta-bot’s com-
mentonnewcomers’pullrequest(8).Themeta-botmightpostacomment, for example, “ ‘Hi, welcome! I just saw this is yourfirst
contribution. Are you aware of the rules of this repository?’ or ‘the

let [newcomers] know that they are welcome into the community ”
[P10]; however, it is also important to keep the message concise
and direct: “the message should be short. If newcomers see the botseveral times in different projects, it will annoy them, and they are
goingto discard the whole information the bot provides.”
Concerningthestrategiestodisplaybotinformationtonewcom-
ers, participants envision the meta-bot providing information
interactively (5).AsmentionedbyP5,themeta-botmightguide
thenewcontributorbyshowingtheinformationfromotherbots
“stepbystep.”Intervieweesdeemedthisstrategyapotentialsolution
to reduce the impact of receiving several different bot notifica-
tionsatonce.P20offeredanexemplarycaseofhowthisstrategy
would apply to a real scenario: “If the newcomer has not updated
the README or the documentation, it shows ‘You need to update the
documentation’ and waits for the newcomer to take action. Whenthe newcomerfi xes the documentation by creating a new commit,
thebotinformsthedocumentationisnowokayandthenshowsthe
next message.” Another strategy regards notifying maintainers
about new pull requests from newcomers (3). Since newcom-
ersmightpreferotherhumanstointeract,afewparticipantsalso
see the meta-bot as an approach to “ping a developer to look at it
[newcomers’pullrequest]” [P1]aimingat“encouragingmorehuman
activityfrom the maintainer ” [P6].
Notificationmanagement. Participantsalsoreporteddesign
strategies to allow the meta-bot to control different aspects ofbots’ notification. First, the meta-bot should
notify developers
throughapre-specifiedchannel (8),whichmeansitwouldsend
thenotificationswhereverthedeveloperwantstoreceivetheno-
tification (e.g., email, GitHub notifications). As mentioned by P1,
thisstrategywouldhelpthemeta-bottosendthenotificationsto
“a channel that the developers do not ignore.”
Participants also proposed strategies related to the frequency
and timing of notifications. One approach would be to schedule
botnotifications (7),inwhichthemeta-botwouldavoidnotifying
developersaccordingto(customizable)timeframesindicatingwhen
they do not want interruptions. This may be implemented, forexample, using a “do not disturb” [P8] mode. Another approach
wouldbe notifydevelopersintheiridletimes (7).Themeta-bot
would not interrupt the developers during critical tasks: “Do not
notify the developer if [the meta-bot] is aware that [the developer] is
currentlyworking.Thatisalsowhatotherhumanswouldnotdo ”[P1].
Inthisapproachthemeta-botwouldlearnthedevelopers’schedule
and adapt to them. Another option is notto notify maintainers
untiltheconditionissatisfied (2).Therefore,themeta-botwould
notifythedevelopersonlywhen thepredefinedconditionsaremet,asstatedbyP16:“Iwanttobenotifiedaboutnewpullrequestsafterallmytestshavepassed.Andafterthebotscommented,andifeverything
is green, then I want to be notified.
To avoid overload with unrelated notifications, we found that it
is also important to notify only interested developers (5). The
meta-bot should notify only developers who are interested in mon-
itoring activities related to a particular repository, issue, or pull
request.AccordingtoP25,forexample,maintainersandcontribu-
torshavedifferentneedswhenitcomestobeingnotifiedbybots:“ifI’macontributor,Iwanttoknowthatnotificationaboutmycon-
tribution. But as a maintainer, I don’t need to be reminded about
every contribution that happened when I release a new version of my
project."[P25].
Spamandfailuresmanagement. We also identified three de-
signstrategiestoprovidecontroloverunforeseenproblemscreated
bybotinteractions.To prevent repetitive bot activities (8),the
meta-botbotwoulddetectbotsthataregeneratingrepetitiveout-
comesandpreventthemfromactingonpullrequests;thiscanavoid
duplicate messages and spam: “it has the ability to control whichbots comment often, then it would be easy to say ‘no, you alreadyhavethiscommentandIseethatyournextcommentisexactlythe
same’”[P1].Therewouldbealsoamechanismfor spammessages
notification (5), wherein the meta-bot would notify developers
about repetitive bot messages that might be considered spam. And,
ifthereisabugwithaspecificbot,themeta-botcan“contactthe
bot maintainers ” [P10] to provide a bug report (3).
Platform support. Participants envision a few modifications
in the platform interface to improve its integration with bots. One
potential modification is to separate bot comments (11) by rel-
egating them to a space reserved for bot interactions. As statedby P32 “developers do not like bots to come in the middle of their
conversations.So,botshavingtheirownspaceortheirownchannel
would be the best [option].” This dedicated space for bots wouldpresent the bot messages that are “dead-ended ” [P2]: that is, the
ones that do not require any response from the developer. Addi-tionally, they suggest implementing mechanisms to collapse the
bot outputs: “then, you can collapse all messages. If you want to read
a message, you have to expand it ” [P2].
Theparticipantsalsoproposedtheimplementationofa botcon-
figurationdashboard (4),inwhichdeveloperscancustomizetheir
preferencesforviewingbotinteractions.Thisdashboardwouldhelp
developers who work on several repositories to have a common
interfacetomonitorbots’actions,asillustratedbyP3“when[thedeveloper]end[s]upwithtonsofrepositories,andbotsareworking
on it, [the developer] need some overview picture of it.”
Research Question 1
What design strategies can potentially reduce the noise cre-
ated by bots on pull requests?
As a result of the designfi ction methodology, we identified a
series of design strategies regarding the meta-bot and its in-tegration with the social coding platform. More specifically,participants envision strategies for information management,
newcomers’ assistance, notification management, spam/failure
managements,andplatformsupport.
5 PHASE II: SUITABILITY STUDY
In this phase, we aim at validating our interpretation of the strate-
gies proposed by the designfi ction participants and evaluating the
proposed implementation. To further refine the strategies elicited
via the designfiction method, we developed a prototype and col-
lectedparticipants’perceptionsofit.Understandingtheperceptions
of the subject-matter experts—practitioners who face the problems

in the daily life and have large experience with software bots—
supportsevaluation of the suitability of the proposed solutions.
5.1 Phase II: Method
5.1.1 Prototyping. Wedevelopedaprototypetoreceivefeedback
about the most cited strategies. We applied the prototype to a
scenario created from the Reakit5project. This project uses four
bots to support the pull request review process and all bots report
their outputs using comments on the pull request. Each of them is
responsible for a different task:
•CodesandBox –providesanisolatedtestenvironmentfor
the validationof the code modified by the pull request.
•Compressed-size-action – reports data referring to the
difference in size offiles modified in the pull request.
•Codecov bot – provides code coverage metrics, offering
tools for comparing reports between pull requests.
•Reakit bot –aproject-specificbotimplementedtoreport
deploy information.
5.1.2 Implemented Prototype. To offer different views for main-
tainersandnewcomers,wesplittheprototypeintotwodifferent
versions:theexperts’pullrequestinterface(seeFigure2),designed
to support maintainers and experienced contributors; and the new-
comers’pullrequestinterface (seeFigure3).InFigure 2,weshow
howwemappedthestrategiesontotheexperts’designedinterface.
First,weusedthestrategyof separatingbotcomments (PS1)tode-
sign a specific place for bots in the pull request. We created a new
tabinthepullrequestinterface(seeFigure2-A)called“BotsCon-
versation”. This tab contains all information and events regarding
botsinthepullrequest,includingatimelineofbotevents.Asfor
botoutputs,wealsodisambiguatethebotparticipantsfromhuman
participants,as shown in Figure 2-D.

Inrelationtothemeta-botcomments,weimplementedthestrate-
gies ofaggregating (IM2),summarizing (IM1),prioritizing (IM4),
andcategorizing (IM6)botcomments aswedepictedinFigure2-C.
5https://github.com/reakit/reakitFirst,themeta-bot aggregates allbotsoutputsinoneplace,andalso
createsasummary withthemostimportantinformationabouteach
one. It then groups them into categories, taking into consideration
thepriority.T okeepthe mostrecentinformation (IM5),we include
in the summary the latest comment from each bot (Figure2-B). The
Reakit bot, for example, posted three comments in the timeline of
bot events; however, only one entry appears in the summarizedtable for that bot. In addition, in the timeline of bot events, it is
possible to expand all bot comments.
We also mapped the aforementioned strategies into the new-
comers’ pullrequest interface. The differences between those two
versionsarerelatedtothemeta-botmessage.Figure3highlights
the designed interface for newcomers. In addition to the table sum-
marizing the outputs, we added a text-based message to fulfill the
requirement of welcoming newcomers (NA2), as shown in Figure 3-
A. Beyond presenting a welcoming message, designfi ction partici-
pantsemphasizedtheimportanceof explainingrules,instructions,
and requirements (NA1) for contributors who are new to a project.
Thus, we included a link to Reakit’s contributing guidelines (see
Figure 3-B).

Figure 3: Newcomers’ pull request interface
Another important distinction is the way the meta-bot displays
theinformationfornewcomersversusexperts.InFigure3-C,we
present the interactive process of displaying bots’ information.
Insteadofpresentingthecompletesummary,themeta-botpresents
the information one at a time (NA3) for newcomers. This approach
aimsatguidingthenewcomersthroughtherequirementsforthe

themeta-bot outputs at once.
5.1.3 Interviews. We reached out to our 32 participants via email,
inviting them to provide feedback through an online meeting. This
processisanopportunityforparticipantstoprovidetheirfeedback

P16, P19, P20, P23, P27, P28, P30, and P31. Each meeting lastedabout 30 minutes. During the meeting, we walked them through
theprototype,describinghowwemappedtheenvisionedstrategies
ontothedesigned interface, and asked for their feedback.

5.1.4 TechnologyAcceptanceModel. Toassesstheparticipantsper-
ceptionaboutthedesignedinterface,wealsoappliedtheTechnol-
ogy AcceptanceModel (TAM) [ 18] byconducting a questionnaire
immediately after concluding each interview. TAM is a model toassess the user’s perception about a technology’s usefulness andease of use, thus determining a user’s technology acceptance be-
havior. This instrument is frequently used in software engineering
literature (e.g., [13, 56]).

Thequestionsare organized to measureeach of the three main
constructs of TAM: perceived usefulness (Ui);ease of use (Ei), and
self-predictedfutureuse (Si).Table3showsourassessmentmodel
which was adapted from previous literature [ 2,18]. We used a 5-
point Likert scale to measure participants’ agreement with each
statement, ranging from “Strongly disagree” to “Strongly agree”
and includinga neutral value.
5.2 Phase II: Results
In the following subsections, we describe the results from Phase II.
5.2.1 Developers’ perceptions of the design strategies. The partici-
pantswhogavefeedbackwere,overall,positiveabouttheprototype.Forinstance,P11,anexperiencedopen-sourcemaintainer,reported:
“I’m very resistant to bots; however, I liked it a lot for a couple of
reasons.”Heexplainedthatheappreciatedthecreationofaspecific
place for bots in the pull request, and the “compressed information ”
[P11] displayed by the meta-bot, since he does not “need to open a
CIpagetoknowwhathappened ”[P11].AccordingtoP30,whenbotcommentsappearin between humancomments,itiseasyto miss

behind those suggestions.
Includetimelinereferences forbots. According to the partic-
ipants,oneproblemwithhavingaseparatetabforbotcomments
is theloss of context. Since we moved all information related to
bots to the new tab, developers might lose track of which eventtriggered the bot action. As stated by P9, the timeline references
mightbeimplementedbyincludingashortlineinthetimelineof
themainconversationwithalinktotherespectivebotcomment:
“a notification like ‘a bot comment has occurred here’ so the user can
click to switch tabs .” To avoid noise, P9 also mentioned the creation
ofgroupedbotreferences inthetimelinetodealwithcasesofpull
requests with more than one bot comment in a sequence: “GitHub
interface could simply merge them into one: ’there were lots of bot
commentshere,’ since one of the goals is also to remove the noise.”
Quoting bot comments on the main conversation. Also re-
lated to the loss of context due to the creation of the bot tab, four
interviewees suggested the possibility of quoting bot comments on
humanconversation.Participantsmentionedthatinsomecasesa
botcommentmighttriggeradiscussioninthehumanconversation
tab. Therefore, it is important to refer to the bot comment, and en-
able the possibility of including a bot quotation within the human
comment.
Enhancenewcomersbotmessage. Participantsalsosuggested
afewadjustmentsinthemessagethemeta-botshowstonewcomers.
As cited by P9 and P27, the interactivity we implemented in the
commentsusinga link is not explicit. P9 suggested that replacing
thelinkwithabuttonwouldbeabetteroption.ForP27,aneven
better option would be showing all steps hidden by default andproviding an easy way to expand and collapse them to removethe need to click on links or buttons. In addition, they suggested
includingmorevisualcluesinthetableandinthetexttocallthe
user’sattentiontoimportantpoints.Forexample,itispossibleto
281“reuse the icons of the bots a little bit and kind of show visually from
whichbot is the warning coming from ” [P16].
Interactive comments as opt-out feature. According to the
interviewees,choosingbetweentheinteractiveorstaticversions
of the meta-bot message might depend on personal preferences.
Therefore, they recommended including an interactive version of
meta-bot summary as an opt-out feature, as highlighted by P30:
“evenifthepersonisnewtotherepository,maybe[she]isacontributor
whoisveryusedtocontributingtootherrepositories.Sothenit’sgood
thatyou can opt-out.”
Move summaryto themain conversation. Another problem
that might occur when separating bot comments is that contrib-
utors, especially newcomers, might be unaware of the presence
ofbotsonapullrequest.Toovercomethisproblem,interviewees
proposed movingthesummaryprovidedbythemeta-bottothemain
conversation. P27 suggested that the meta-bot should appear in
thehumanconversation“likeasidepanel.Then,thesummarycan
alwaysbevisible.Andallthedetailedinformationcouldbeinthebot
conversation.”
Replace bots tab name. Although less recurrent, two partici-
pantsrecommended replacingthenameofthebots’tab.Asexplained
by P11, the term “bots conversation” implies a dialog between bots,
which is not the case of these bots. For P27, the designed bots’ tab
“ismorelikehistory.”Theysuggestedtermssuchas“botshistory”,
“bots reports”, or any other name that includes ”automated.”
Filteringbotinteractions. Stillrelatedtothebotstab,P16sug-
gestedofferinganoptiontofilterouttheinteractionsinthebots’
timeline. First, they would like to have access to interface elements
that allow them to selectively show interactions of a single bot, for
example.Itmightbe helpfulifabotpostedmultiplecommentsin
the bots’ timeline, reducing the workload of searching for them.
P16 mentioned that “if there are multiple comments from Reakit bot,
for example, then I would like to see a thread only with chronological
comments. Then, I can follow only this bot, and I don’t need to go
throughit manually.”
5.2.2 Perceived usefulness, ease of use, and potential future use. In
the following, we present the results for the TAM questionnaire
intermsofthedesignedinterface’sperceivedusefulness,easeof
use, and prediction of future use. As a measure of consistency,
we checked the questionnaire items’ reliability. A precise, reliable,
and valid instrument ensures collection of accurate information.
Therefore, we conducted the reliability analysis to ensure the in-
ternal validity and consistency of the items used for each factor,
using Cronbach’s Alpha [ 3]. Carmines and Zeller [10]suggest that
aCronbach’sAlphareliabilitylevelthatexceedsaminimumof0.70
indicates a reliable measure. According to the results, the Alpha
values exceeded the threshold, with 0.84 and 0.72 for usefulness
and easeof use items, respectively.

6 DISCUSSION
Identifying design strategies to reduce the noise created by bots
on pull requests is relevant since developers often complain about
the information overload caused by repetitive bot behavior on pull
requests[ 7,21,41,51,68].EmployingDesignFictionasamethodto
prototypeatechnology[ 32],wegainedinsightstorefinethedesign
ofameta-botandtheunderliningplatform,takingintoaccounttheperceptionsofpractitionersexperiencedwithbotsonsocialcoding
platforms.
According to our participants, the meta-bot should act as a gate-
keeper:a layerbetween otherbotsand theusers.As agatekeeper,
the meta-bot helps to mitigate information overload by curating
andpresentinginastructuredwaytheotherbots’outputs.Byre-
ducingthecognitiveefforttoprocessincominginformation[ 40],
conciseandwell-organizedinformationmight helpdevelopersto
leverage bots outputs.
In line with Erlenhov et al . [21]’s results, our study indicates
thatacombinationofthreedifferentcharacteristicsappearstobe
relevant for the meta-bot: intelligence, adaptability, and autonomy.
However,intelligence and adaptabilityare not yet widelypresent
on bots that work on GitHub [ 66]. Our participants mentioned
severalstrategiesforthemeta-botthatrelyonlearningfrompast
experiencesandadaptingitsbehavior.Oneexampleistheability
tonotifydevelopersonlyontheiridletimes.Todoso,themeta-bot
mustbesmartenoughtolearndevelopers’preferencesandadapt
accordingly.Makingsmarterdecisions(e.g.,notifyingdevelopers
ontheiridletimes)wouldrequirebotstobeenrichedwithlearn-
ing models for the target context. This topic was also exploredin other domains. For example, some bots in the educationfieldlearn from previous interactions and estimate students’ interest
level [47] or learning styles [ 33], adapting their interactions to im-
prove collaboration.Similar modelscould beused inopen-source
development.
In the following, we discuss how our results lead to practical
implicationsforpractitionersandinsightsandsuggestionsforre-
searchers.
Implications for Bot Developers: Our study results provide
insights for bot developers who want to mitigate noise, laying afoundation for designing better bots. For example, ourfindings
indicate the OSS developers would like to customize aspects of the
botinteraction(e.g.,notificationsfrequencyandtiming).Therefore,itisimportantforbotdeveloperstodesignahighlycustomizedbot,providing project maintainers control over bot actions. In addition,
ourresearchcanalsohelpbotdesignersbyprovidingguidelinesandinsightstosupportthedesignofbotmessages.Insteadofproviding
the information aggregated, bot developers should consider other
possibilities, such as customizing the message or providing the
informationinteractively.Applyingoneofthosestrategiesmight
help developers deal with and interpret the information from bots.
Implications for Researchers: Our results can serve as a ref-
erence to guide further research. For example, we found several
strategiestopresentthebotinformationtodevelopers(e.g.,sum-marization,categorization,prioritizing,interactively).Additional
effort is still necessary to investigate how these strategies might
influence the way developers interpret the bot comments’ con-
tent.Howdevelopersthink,perceive,andrememberinformation
(i.e. their cognitive style) is likely to affect how they handle bot
messages and learn from them [ 65]. Future research can further
investigate these differences and inform a set of guidelines on how
todesigneffectivemessagesfordifferentdeveloperprofiles.Further,
our work can inspire researchers to use designfi ction, a method
stillrarely usedin software engineeringstudies but that hasbeen
shown to be effective in other domains.
Implications for Social Coding Platforms: The preliminary
implementationofthemeta-botrevealedsomelimitationsimposed
by the GitHub platform that restrict the design of bots. Wessel
et al. [68]already mentioned some examples of those technical
challengesintheirhierarchicalcategorizationofbotproblems.In
short,theplatformrestrictionsmightlimitboththeextentofbot
actionsandthewaybotsareallowedtocommunicate.Itisessential
to provide a morefl exible way for bots to interact on the platform.
In addition, to reduce information overload, participants suggested
removingbotinteractionsfromthemainconversationinterfaceand
creating a dedicated place for them. We prototyped this strategy of
separating bot events by designing a new tab in the pull requestinterface; this idea can be leveraged to reshape the interface and
better accommodate bot interactions.
7 LIMITATIONS
In this section, we discuss the potential threats to the validity of
ourfi ndingsandhow we addressed or mitigated them.
Generalizabilityoftheresults .Since we recruited practition-
ers experienced with bots on the GitHub platform, ourfindings
maynotnecessarilyapplytoothersocialcodingplatforms,suchasGitLabandBitbucket.Althoughwedonotanticipatebigdifferences
intheseplatforms,additionalresearchisnecessarytoinvestigate
thetransferabilityof the results.
Data representativeness .Althoughweconductedthepartici-
patory designfi ction with a substantial number of practitioners,
we likely did not discover all possible strategies or provide full
explanationsofthestrategies.Weareawarethateachbotaswellaseach project has its singularities and that the open-source universe
is expansive. Our strategies to keep collecting data until reach-ing information saturation and to consider different practitioner
profilesandidentifyrecurrentmentionsofdesignstrategiesfrom
multiple perspectives aimed to alleviate this issue. Anyway, our
283BotsforPull Requests: The Good, the Bad, and the Promising ICSE’22,May 21–29,2022,Pittsburgh,PA, USA
findingsreflecttheperspectiveofpractitionersexperiencedwith
bots. Therefore, we acknowledge that additional research is nec-
essary to consider the perspective of those who do not have any
experience with bots on social coding platforms.
Applicability of the results .The strategies presented in this
papercamefromparticipats’insights,hence,additionalresearch
is necessary to test the strategies in practice. Moreover, conducted
bothphaseIandIIwiththesameparticipants.However,thepartici-pantswereexposedtostrategiesproposedbytheotherparticipants,
providing an opportunity for them to provide feedback expressing
theirpreferencesabouttheelementsofthedesignedprototypeand
forall strategies.
Informationsaturation .Wecontinuedrecruitingparticipants
and conducting interviews until we came to an agreement that no
new significant information was found. As posed by Strauss and
Corbin [61], sampling may be discontinued once the collected data
isconsideredsufficientlydenseanddatacollectionnolongergener-atesnewinformation.Aspreviouslymentioned,wealsomadesure
to interview different groups with different perspectives on bots
beforedecidingwhethersaturationhadbeenreached.Inparticular,
we interviewed researchers, bot developers, and developers who
are contributors and/or maintainers of open-source projects.
Reliabilityofresults .Toimprovethereliabilityofourfindings,
weemployedaconstantcomparisonmethod[ 25].Inthismethod,
each interpretationis constantlycompared withexistingfindings
as it emerges from the qualitative analysis. In addition, we also
developedaprototypeandcollectedfeedbackfromtheparticipants.
To check the reliability of the TAM instrument, we performed a
reliability check on the questionnaire items. Additionally, to direct
data collected, we carefully designed a 3-minute animated video
and guided participants through four scenarios as a starting point
for thinking about the future, constantly reminding them that they
were not constrained by current technological limitations.
8 CONCLUSION
Inthispaper,wetookthefirststepstowardovercominginformation
overload created by bots. By capturing the expectations of main-
tainers, contributors, bot developers, and experienced researchers,
we elicited design strategies for the creation of a meta-bot. We
presented participants with afi ctional story of a meta-bot capable
