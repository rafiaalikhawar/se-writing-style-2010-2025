ABSTRACT
A microservice system in industry is usually a large-scale dis-
tributed system consisting of dozens to thousands of services run-
ning in different machines. An anomaly of the system often can be
reflected in traces and logs, which record inter-service interactions
and intra-service behaviors respectively. Existing trace anomaly
detection approachestreat a trace asa sequence of serviceinvoca-
tions. Theyignore the complex structureof a tracebrought by its
invocationhierarchyandparallel/asynchronousinvocations.On
the otherhand,existing loganomaly detectionapproaches treata
log as a sequence of events and cannot handle microservice logs
that are distributed in a large number of services with complex
interactions.Inthispaper,weproposeDeepTraLog,adeeplearning
based microservice anomaly detection approach. DeepTraLog uses
a unified graph representation to describe the complex structure of
a trace together with log events embedded in the structure. Based
on the graph representation, DeepTraLog trains a GGNNs based
deepSVDDmodelbycombingtracesandlogsanddetectsanom-
alies in new traces and the corresponding logs. Evaluation on a
microservicebenchmarkshowsthatDeepTraLogachievesahigh
precision (0.93) and recall (0.97), outperforming state-of-the-art
trace/log anomaly detection approaches with an average increase
of0.37inF1-score.ItalsovalidatestheefficiencyofDeepTraLog,

1 INTRODUCTION
Microservice architecture is an approach to developing a single
application as a suite of small services, each running in its own
process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms [ 15]. A
microservice system in industry is usually a large-scale distributed
systemhavingdozenstothousandsofservicesrunningindifferent
machines. Running in a highly uncertain and dynamic environ-
ment,amicroservicesystemoftenfailsduetovariousinfrastructure
problems or application faults such as hardware failures, improper
configurations,implementationfaults,andincorrectcoordination

potentialfailures,itisdesirablethattheanomaliesofamicroservice
system can be automatically detected at runtime.
Powered by specifications like OpenTracing [ 27] and related in-
frastructureslikeSkyWalking[ 33],distributedtracing[ 32]hasbeen
widely adopted in industrial microservice systems. Each produced
trace describes the execution process (i.e., invocation chain) of a
request through service instances and each operation (i.e., service
invocation)initiscalledaspan.Atthesametime,logginghasalsobeenwidelyusedbythedeveloperstorecordthebehaviorsofeachservice.Alogrecordssignificantmessagesatvariouscriticalpoints

Recentresearches[ 20,26]usedeeplearningbasedtraceanaly-
sismethodstodetectruntimeanomaliesofmicroservicesystems.
These approaches treat a trace as a sequence of service invoca-
tions. However, a trace can have a complex structure formed by
the hierarchy of service invocations and parallel/asynchronous in-
vocations. Existing trace anomaly detection approaches ignore the
complexstructuresoftraces.Moreover,theydonotconsiderthelog messages which describe the behaviors of individual service
instancesinvolvedinatrace.Therefore,theseapproachescannot
well capture microservice anomalies.
Ontheotherhand,logshavebeenwidelyusedinanomalyde-
tection for distributed systems. Existing log anomaly detectionapproaches [
7,24,40] learn log patterns from normal execution
anddetectanomalieswhenlogpatternsdeviatefromthetrained
model. These approaches treat a log as a sequence of log events,
whicharetheabstractionofagroupofsimilarlogmessages[ 12].
For a distributed system, a log is produced for each request by
sortinglogmessagesfromdifferentnodesinvolvedintherequest
bytimestamp.Foramicroservicesystem,however,arequestcor-
responds to an invocation chain that may involve many service
instancesandcomplexinvocationsamongthem.Ifweproducea

structure of its invocation chain.
Inthispaper,weproposeDeepTraLog,adeeplearningbasedmi-
croservice anomaly detection approach. DeepTraLog uses a unified
graphrepresentation,whichiscalledtraceeventgraph(TEG),to
describe the complex structure of a trace together with log events
embedded in the structure. It takes traces and logs as input andtrains a graph-based deep learning model for trace anomaly de-
tection. First,it parsesthe inputtraces and logsand extractsspan
relationshipsandlogeventsfromthemrespectively.Second,itgen-
erates vector representations for span events and log events and
at the same time constructs a TEG for each trace. Third, it trains a
gated graph neural networks (GGNNs) based deep SVDD (Support
VectorDataDescription)model,whichlearnsalatentrepresenta-
tion for each TEG and a minimized data-enclosing hypersphere.
When used for anomaly detection, DeepTraLog analyzes a trace
and the related logs in a similar way and uses the trained model to
generate a latent representation for the trace. It then determines
whetherthetraceisanomalousbasedonitsanomalyscore,i.e.,the
shortest distance from the latent representation of the trace to the
hypersphere.NotethatDeepTraLogdoesnotrelyontracelabelling
and just requires that the majority of traces in the training set are
produced in normal execution of the system. Moreover, it is able to
capture different types of anomalies.
ToevaluatetheeffectivenessandefficiencyofDeepTraLogwe
conduct a series of experimental studies on a microservice bench-
marksystem.TheresultsshowthatDeepTraLogoutperformsexist-
ing trace- and log-based anomaly detection approaches by 64.94%

2 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
In this section, we first introduce the background about traces and
logs, then motivate our work with an example.
2.1 Background
As a kindof large-scale distributedsystems, microservice systems
widely use distributed tracing [ 27,32] to profile and monitor their

arequestasitmovesthroughadistributedsystem[ 27].Forami-
croservice system, a trace describes the execution process of a
requestthroughserviceinstances,i.e.,aserviceinvocationchain.
The service invocations in a trace are initially recorded by indi-
vidual service instances and then collected and restored to a trace.
As shown in Figure 1, a trace consists of a set of spans in a tree
structure and each spancorresponds to a service invocation. Each
trace has a unique trace ID and each span has a unique span ID. A
span records the invoker and the invoked service instance and has
anoperationnameindicatingtheoperationtobeperformed.For
example, the operationname of a spanof REST invocation canbe
POST /api/v1/foodservice/orders. Each span (except the root span)
has a parent span which initiates the current span. For example, in
Figure 1 Span A is a synchronous invocation and during its exe-
cutionitinitiatestwosynchronousinvocationscorrespondingto
Span B and Span D respectively. Therefore, Span A is the parent of
Span B and Span D. Distributed tracing has been an important part
of microservice infrastructures and supported by open-source solu-tions(e.g.,Zipkin[
35],Jeager[ 13],andSkyWalking[ 33])andcloud
service providers (e.g., Amazon’s X-Ray [ 3] and Alibaba Cloud’s
ARMS [1]).
Asynchronousinvocationsandparallelinvocationsarewidely
used in microservice systems for better performance and availabil-
ity.Atracecanincludeseveraltohundredsofspans(i.e.,serviceinvocations). Therefore, synchronous invocations are often con-
sideredharmfulduetothemultiplicativeeffectofdowntime[ 15].
Asynchronousinvocationsareusuallyimplementedbymessage-
based communication and are thought to be a way for achieving
high-availability systems as the invoker does not block while wait-
ing. Parallel invocations mean to invoke multiple services at thesame time to reduce the overall response time. They are usually
implemented by making service invocations in multiple threads.
As shown in Figure 1, log messages are produced during each
serviceinvocation.Theselogmessagesareproducedbythelogging
statements written by service developers. They record the internal
statesandbehaviorsoftheinvokedserviceinstance.Alogmessage
is an unstructured sentence which contains a constant part (log
event)andseveralvariableparts(logparameters).Forexample,a
log message “[assignSeat] Requested seat type is T1 and number is
2”containsalogevent“[assignSeat]Requestedseattypeis<*>and
number is <*>” and two log parameters SeatType andSeatNumber.
Log event extraction has been a standard step in log parsing. After
log parsing, a log is converted into a sequence of log events.
Traces and logs can be combined for analyzing the runtime
behaviors of microservice systems. A trace describes the service
interactions for a request, while the logs record the internal states
and behaviors in individual service instances. As a service instance
mayserveformultiplerequestsatthesametime,itslogfileinter-
leaveslogmessagesfordifferentrequests.Tosupportthecombined
analysis,somedistributedtracingsystems(e.g.,SkyWalking[ 33],
Alibaba ARMS [ 1]) inject trace IDs and span IDs into log messages
andthusthelogmessagesofaserviceinstancecanbeassociated
with different requests. For example, SkyWalking uses the Mapped
DiagnosticContextmechanismofJavaloggingframeworks(e.g.,
Log4j [2], Logback [ 21]) to inject trace IDs and span IDs to log
messages.2.2 Motivation

Existingtraceanomalydetectionapproaches[ 20,26]treatatrace
asasequenceofserviceinvocations,whileexistingloganomalyde-tectionapproaches[
7,24,40]treatalogasasequenceoflogevents.
These approaches cannot well support the anomaly detection of
microservice systems due to the following two reasons.
First, the logs of different service instances need to be combined
foranomalydetection.Existingtraceanomalydetectionapproaches
do not consider logs, thus can only detect anomalies that are re-
flected intrace structures.Figure1 showsan example oflog-level
anomalies.ThelogmessagesinSpanD showthatthetrainticket
order does not need food, but those in Span F show that a food
orderiscreatedforthistrainticketorder.Thisanomalycanonly
be detected by combing the log messages of Span D and F.
Second, a trace may have a complex structure involving invo-
cation hierarchy and parallel/asynchronous invocations. A trace
hasatreestructure.Ifallthespansaresynchronousinvocations,
thetracecanberepresentedbyasequenceofserviceinvocations
orderedbytheirstarttime.Evenso,sequence-basedrepresentationcannotreflectthecausalrelationshipsbetweenparentandchildren
spansandtemporalrelationshipsbetweenlogeventsofthesame
spans.Forexample,twoadjacentlogeventsinSpanAmaybefarin
the sequence-based representation, as the log events of the descen-
dantspansofSpanAareinsertedintothem.Moreover,atracemay
include parallel or asynchronous invocations. The trace shown in
Figure1andFigure2includestwoparallelinvocations(SpanBand
SpanD)and anasynchronousinvocation(SpanF). Therefore,the
log events in Span B and Span D (and their descendant spans) can
interleave in any order; Similarly, the log events in Span F and a
partlogeventsinSpanDcaninterleaveinanyorder.Ifwecombinethelogeventsofdifferentspansintoasequence(e.g.,bystarttime),
the characteristics of parallel or asynchronous invocations will be
lost.
Basedontheanalysis,wecanseethatthelogeventsofdifferent
spans of a trace need to be combined in a way that the structureof the trace can be kept. Therefore, we propose a unified graphrepresentationthatcandescribethestructureofatracetogether
withthelogeventsembeddedinthestructuretofacilitateanomaly

tiondetermineswhetheratraceisanomalousbasedonitsanomaly
score(i.e.,theshortestdistancefromthelatentrepresentationof
its TEG to the hypersphere).
3.1 Log Parsing
Following existing researches on log anomaly detection [ 24,40],
we adopt a state-of-the-art log parsing approach Drain [ 11]. It can
parse logs in a streaming and timely manner with high parsing
accuracy and efficiency. To support the combined analysis with
traces, weextract and recordthe trace IDand spanID of eachlog
messagebeforelogparsing.Afterlogparsing,atraceIDandaspan
ID are attached with each of the extracted log events for further
analysis.
3.2 Trace Parsing
Thelogeventsofaserviceinstanceconstituteaneventsequence.To
combine traces and logs for anomaly detection, we need to convert
the spans of a trace into span events. Span events are a special
kindofeventsthatrepresenttherequestandresponseofservice
invocations. When analyzed together with log events, span events
can indicate the starts and ends of service invocations.
For each span of a trace, we convert it into multiple span events
ofrelatedspansaccordingtoitstype(Client/Server orProducer/Con-
sumer). AClient/Server span represents a synchronous invocation,
while aProducer/Consumer span represents an asynchronous invo-
cation. For a Client/Server span we generate a request event and
aresponseeventforthecurrentspan(server)anditsparentspan
(client)respectively.Therequesteventandtheresponseeventof
the client (server) represents the sending (receiving) of the service
invocationandthereceiving(sending)oftheinvocationresponse
respectively.Fora Producer/Consumer spanwegenerateaconsumer
event for the current span (consumer) and a producer event for the
parent span of the current span (producer). The producer eventand the consumer event represent the sending and receiving of the
message respectively.
Thecontentofaspaneventincludestwoparts,aneventtypeand
anoperationname.Forexample,fora Client/Server spanwiththe
operationname POST/api/v1/foodservice/orders,wegeneratetwo
span events “Server Request POST /api/v1/foodservice/orders” and
“Server Response POST /api/v1/foodservice/orders” for the current
spanandtwospanevents“ClientRequestPOST/api/v1/foodservice/orders” and “Client Response POST /api/v1/foodservice/orders” for
the parent span of the current span; for a Producer/Consumer span
withtheoperationname RabbitMQ/Topic/Queue/email/sendEmail,
we generate a span event “Consumer RabbitMQ/Topic/Queue/e-
mail/sendEmail”forthecurrentspanandaspanevent“Producer
RabbitMQ/Topic/Queue/email/sendEmail”fortheparentspanof
thecurrentspan.Eachspaneventhasatimestampobtainedfrom
the span record. For example, the timestamp of a client request
event is the time when the client service instance sends the service
invocation.
3.3 Event Embedding
Logeventembeddingiswidelyusedinloganomalydetection.Itgenerates a vector representation for each log event. The vector
representationcanidentifysemanticallysimilarlogeventsandalsodistinguishdifferentlogevents[
40].InDeepTraLog,spaneventsare
analyzedtogetherwithlogeventsforanomalydetection.Therefore,
our event embedding generates vector representations for both log
events and span events. Each log event or span event is a sequence
of English words, thus can be treated as a sentence. Following the
commonpracticeoflogeventembedding,DeepTraLogimplements
event embedding in three steps.
Step 1. Preprocessing. Log events and span events contain
non-character tokens (e.g., separators such as “/” and “,”, IP ad-dresses), stop words (e.g., “a”, “the”, “is”), and compound words
(e.g., “verifycode”, “tripid”). Following previous works [ 24,40], we
preprocess log events and span events by removing non-verbalsymbols and stop words, and splitting compound words into in-dividual words. For example, a span event “Client Request POST
/api/v1/foodservice/orders”ispreprocessedinto“clientrequestpost
api v1 food service orders”.
Step 2. Word Embedding. We use the widely used pre-trained
GloVemodel[ 29]togenerateavectorrepresentationforeachword

inlogeventsandspanevents.Particularly,weusetheGloVe300-
dimensional word vectors trained on Wikipedia and Gigaword 5
data[9].Thusforeachwordwecanobtaina300-dimensionalvector
as its representation.
Step3. SentenceEmbedding.Sentence embeddinggenerates
a vector representation for each log event and span event based
on word embedding. The words in these events are not equally
important.Somewords(e.g.,“api”,“get”)aremorecommon,thus
arelessimportantthanothers(e.g.,“food”,“submit”)insentence
embedding. Therefore, we follow previous works [40] and use TF-
IDF[31]tomeasuretheweightofeachwordinsentenceembedding.
TF (Term Frequency) of a word 𝑤in an event 𝑒, which measures
its importance in 𝑒, is calculated by 𝑇𝐹𝑤,𝑒=𝐿𝑤,𝑒
𝐿𝑒, where 𝐿𝑤,𝑒is
theoccurrencesof 𝑤in𝑒and𝐿𝑒isthenumberofwordsin 𝑒.IDF
(Inverse Document Frequency) of a word 𝑤, which measures its
frequency in all events, is calculated by 𝐼𝐷𝐹𝑤=log𝐿
𝐿𝑤, where
𝐿is the total number of events and 𝐿𝑤is the number of events
containing 𝑤. Then the weight of a word 𝑤in an event 𝑒can be
measuredbyitsTF-IDFscoreas 𝑊𝑤,𝑒=𝑇𝐹𝑤,𝑒×𝐼𝐷𝐹𝑤.Thus,the
vectorrepresentationofanevent 𝑒canbecalculatedastheweighted
sum of the vector representations of all its words as following,
where𝑁𝑒isthenumberofdifferentwordsin 𝑒and𝑉𝑤isthevector
representation of a word 𝑤.
𝑉𝑒=1
𝑁𝑒𝑁𝑒/summationdisplay.1
𝑤=1𝑊𝑤,𝑒·𝑉𝑤 (1)
Notethatlogeventsandspaneventshavequitedifferentchar-
acteristics, so we calculate the TF-IDF scores and word weights for
log events and span events separately.
3.4 Graph Construction
Atraceeventgraph(TEG)consistsofthelogeventsandspanevents
ofatraceandtheirrelationships.ArelationshipinaTEGcanbe
one of the following four types.
•Sequence: A sequence relationship represents the predeces-
sor/successor relationship between two sequential span/log
events of the same span.•SynchronousRequest:Asynchronousrequestrelationship
representsasynchronousrequestfromaparentspantoits
child span.
•SynchronousResponse:Asynchronousresponserelation-
ship represents the response of a synchronous request from
a span to its parent span.
•Asynchronous Request: An asynchronous request rela-
tionship represents an asynchronous request from a parent
span to its child span.
Given a trace, we construct a TEG in three steps.
Step 1: Connection of Log Events. For each span of the trace,
obtainallthelogeventsthatbelongtothespan.Thenorderthelog
eventsbytheirtimestampsandaddasequencerelationshipfrom
each log event to the one next to it.
Step2:InsertionofSpanEvents.Foreachspanofthetrace,
obtain all the span events that belong to the span. Then for eachobtained span event, insert it into the log event sequence of the
currentspanbasedonitstimestampandaddasequencerelationship
between it and its predecessor/successor event.
Step3:ConnectionofSpans.Foreachspanconnectitwithits
parentspaninthefollowingway.Ifthespanisa Client/Server span,
add a synchronous request relationship from the corresponding
client request event of its parent span to the corresponding server
request event of the current span, and a synchronous response

currentspantothecorrespondingclientresponseeventofitsparentspan.Ifthespanisa Producer/Consumer )span,addanasynchronous
requestrelationshipfromthecorrespondingproducereventofits
parent span to the corresponding consumer event of the current
span.
Figure 4 shows an example of TEG, which corresponds to the
trace shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. In the graph, colored rect-angles and uncolored rectangles represent span events and log
events respectively. Span events of different colors are of different
types,includingclient/serverrequest,client/serverresponse,and
producer/consumer.Notethatthedottedroundedrectangleswhich
represent spans in Figure 4 are not the nodes of the TEG but arejust used for illustration. The spans are implicitly represented in
theTEGbytheeventsequencesstartingfromserverrequestevents.

The graphcan well describe thestructure of thetrace and various
relationships in it. The log events and span events in the same

relationshipsbetween inter-serviceinteractions (spanevents) and
intra-servicebehaviors(logevents)canbedescribedandconsidered
inanomalydetection.Theeventsofdifferentspansareseparated
and only connected via request/response relationships between
span events. The structure of the trace is embodied in these re-
quest/response relationships: a synchronous invocation is reflected
byapairofrequestandresponserelationships;anasynchronous
invocation is reflected by a request relationship without the corre-
sponding response relationship. For example, it can be seen that

nousinvocationinitiatedbySpanDasthereisnoresponsefrom
Span F to Span D.
3.5 Model Training
We frame the task of trace-log combined microservice anomaly
detection asan one-classclassificationproblem. One-classclassifi-
cation problem aims to learn a model that can accurately describe
the train data which is considered belong to the same class. Foranomalydetectiontask,mostofthetrainingsamplesarenormal
oneswhichcanberegardedasthesameclassandtheotherscan
identified as outliers (e.g., anomalous traces in our work).
DeepTraLog uses deep SVDD [ 30] to train a one-class classifi-
cation model for detecting anomalous traces. Deep SVDD learnsuseful feature representations of the training data together with
aminimizedhyperspherethatenclosesthelatentrepresentations
of the data. Thus the data that is distant from the center of the
hypersphere can be considered anomalous. Existing deep learning
basedanomalydetectionapproaches[ 20,26]usuallyusedeepau-
toencoder to detect anomalies based on the reconstruction errorof the data. Thus the anomaly detection relies on an empiricallydetermined threshold of the reconstruction error, which is often
challenging.Incontrast,deepSVDDjointlylearnsthelatentrep-
resentations of the data and a classification boundary without a
threshold. Standard deep SVDD uses multi-layer perception (MLP)or convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learns the latent repre-
sentations of the data. However, in our work a trace is represented
byagraph(TEG)whichcannotbewellhandledbyMLPorCNN.
Therefore,weusegatedgraphneuralnetworks(GGNNs)tolearn
thetracerepresentationsandjointlytraintheGGNNswithdeep
SVDD.GGNNsisimplementedbasedontheneuralmessagepass-
ingmechanismandcanworkwellwithavarietytypesofgraphs,
such as directed graph, bipartite graph, and undirected graph.
In DeepTraLog, a trace is represented by a TEG, which is a
directedattributedgraph 𝑔={𝑉,𝐴,𝑋}where: 𝑉isasetofnodes
(i.e., events); 𝐴is adjacency matrix of the graph; and 𝑋∈R|𝑉|×𝑑is
thenode attributematrix, whereeachrow 𝑥𝑣of𝑋isthe attribute
(i.e., event vector) of a node 𝑣∈𝑉,𝑑is the dimension of the event
vector. GGNNs represents the nodes in a graph as units of a neural
network and the units are linked to each other according to the

3.6 Anomaly Detection
DeepTraLog trains a GGNNs based deep SVDD model for anom-
aly detection. Given a new trace and the corresponding log foranomaly detection, DeepTraLog follows the same process as thetraining phase (i.e., log parsing, trace parsing, event embedding,
andgraphconstruction)toproduceaTEGtogetherwithitsevent
embedding for the trace. Then DeepTraLog feeds the TEG into the
trainedmodeltogeneratealatentrepresentationoftheTEGand
usesthelatentrepresentationtocalculateananomalyscore.The
anomaly score is defined as the shortest distance from the latentrepresentation of the TEG to the learned hypersphere, which is
calculated by the following equation:
𝑎𝑛𝑠(ℎ𝑔)=||ℎ𝑔−𝑐||2−ˆ𝑅2(7)
whereℎ𝑔is the vector representation of a TEG 𝑔;𝑐is the center
of the learned hypersphere; ˆ𝑅is the final radius of the learned
hypersphere.
ForaTEG 𝑔ofatrace,ifitsanomalyscore(i.e., 𝑎𝑛𝑠(ℎ𝑔))isgreater

Tohelptheuserstounderstandtheresultsofanomalydetection,
DeepTraLog provides a visualization of the TEGs of anomaloustraces. Figure 5 presents an example of the visualization of an

4.1 Experimental Design
4.1.1 BenchmarkSystemandDataset. Ourstudiesareconducted
on the latest release V0.2.0 of TrainTicket1[42,44]. It is a medium-
scale open-source microservice system for train ticket bookingand has been widely used in researches on microservice archi-tecture, infrastructure, and AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT
Operation)[ 20,41,43].Ithas45serviceswrittenbydifferentlan-
guages (e.g., Java, JavaScript, Python) and communicating with
synchronous REST invocations and asynchronous messaging.
TrainTicketreplicates avarietyofdifferent typesoffaultcases
fromindustrialmicroservicesystemsandprovidesthefaultcasesin
different fault branches. The latest release of TrainTicket provides
14 compatible fault cases of different types as shown in Table 1.
Each fault case may include multiple fault instances in different
services. The fault types include [43]:
•AsynchronousInteraction -faultscausedbymissingor
improper coordination of asynchronous service invocations;
•Multi-Instance - faults related to the existence of multiple
instances of the same service at runtime;
•Configuration - faultscaused byimproper orinconsistent
configurations of services and/or environments (e.g., con-
tainers and virtual machines);
•Monolithic - faults caused by internal implementations of
individual services, which can cause failures even when the
application is deployed in a monolithic mode.
Thus we can have a normal version of TrainTicket and 14 faulty
versionseachcorrespondingtothebranchofafaultcase.Wedeploy
different versions of TrainTicket on a Kubernetes cluster with 8

cases.WeuseApacheSkyWalking[ 33]asthedistributedtracing

store the collected traces and logs.
The resulted dataset includes 132,485 traces and 7,705,050 log
messages. Among the traces 23,334 (17.6%) are anomalous ones
causedby73faultsofthe14faultcaseswhicharelocatedindifferent

studies. It is available in our replication package [5].
4.1.2 Baselines. We use the following four state-of-the-art log-
basedortrace-basedanomalydetectionapproachesasthebaselines.
•TraceAnomaly [20] is a trace anomaly detection approach
that only considers service-level traces (operations not con-
sidered). It adopts posterior flow based variational auto-
encoders (VAE) to detect anomalous traces.
•MultimodalTrace [26] is a trace anomaly detection ap-
proach that treats a trace as a span sequence and a response
timesequence.Itadoptsamulti-modalLSTM(LongShort-
Term Memory) model to learn the sequential patterns of
normal traces.
•DeepLog [7]isaloganomalydetectionapproachthattreats
a log as an event sequence. It adopts an LSTM model to pre-
dict the next log event in the sequence and identify possible
anomalies.
•LogAnomaly [24]isaloganomalydetectionapproachthat
treatsalogasaneventsequenceandconsidersthecounts
ofdifferent logeventsasan additionalfeature.It adoptsan
LSTMmodeltolearnsequentialandquantitativepatterns.
SimilartoDeepLog,itdetectsanomaliesbypredictingthe
next log event.
As TraceAnomaly and MultimodalTrace only consider traces,
we feed them with only the traces when using them. LogAnomaly
andDeepLogonlyconsiderlogsandtreatthemaseventsequences.
Therefore, we combine all the events (including span events and
logevents)ofdifferentspansofatraceintoasingleeventsequence
orderedbytimestampandprovidetheeventsequencesofallthetraces as the input for these two approaches. TraceAnomaly and
DeepLogprovideopen-sourceimplementations[ 22,34]andweuse
themdirectly.Theothertwoapproacheshavenopubliclyavailable
implementations,sowedevelopourownimplementationsbased
on their papers.
To evaluate the contribution of the unified graph representation
of traces and logs (i.e., TEG), we derive a variant of DeepTraLog
calledGRU-based Deep SVDD which represents all the events of
atrace asan eventsequenceordered bytimestamp andusesGRU
instead of GGNNs.
For all these baseline approaches we experimentally choose the
best parameters and use their optimal results for comparison.
4.1.3 Metrics. Weusetheprecision,recall,andF1-scoretomeasure
the effectiveness of anomaly detection based on 𝑇𝑃(True Positive),
𝐹𝑃(False Positive), and 𝐹𝑁(False Negative).

4.1.4 Settings. AlltheexperimentsareconductedonaLinuxserver
withIntelCorei9-10900X3.70GHzCPU,128GBRAM,RTX3090
with 24GB GPU memory and running Ubuntu 18.04.5. The setting
of DeepTraLog are the following: the embedding size of each event
set to 300, the hidden layer of GGNNs set to 3, the hidden sizeof each hidden layer set to 300, the
𝜆and𝜇in Equation 6 set to
0.001 and 0.05 respectively, and the batch size set to 32. Following
thepracticein[ 30],weemployasimpletwo-phaselearningrate
schedulewithaninitiallearningrate0.0001inthefirst60epochs
and subsequently 0.00001 in the last 40 epochs. For each approach
we leverage 60% of the normal traces as the training set, 10% of
the normal traces as the validation set, and the rest of the traces
(include the rest 30% of the normal traces and all the anomalous
traces) as the test set.

The two trace-based approaches (i.e., TraceAnomaly and Mul-
timodalTrace) achieve low precision and recall. These two ap-proaches do not consider logs, thus cannot detect anomalies inlog events. As they use sequence-based trace representation and

The two log-based approaches (i.e.,DeepLog and LogAnomaly)
achievehighrecallandlowprecision.Thesetwoapproachescon-
sider events within spans (we provide both span events and log
events for them), thus can detect anomalies in span sequences and
log event sequences. However, they rely on the prediction of the
next event in a sliding window of the event sequence, thus haveno global view of the trace and its structure. Therefore, they arelikely to falsely report unseen event subsequences as anomalies.
Actually, this kind of log anomaly detection approaches usually
work on a single log event sequence such as the HDFS dataset [ 38].
Thus,theycannotwellworkformicroserviceanomalydetection
whichinvolvesmanyserviceinstancesanddistributedlogevents
in parallel and asynchronous service invocations.
GRU-basedDeepSVDDachievesbetterprecisionandrecallthan
thefourbaselineapproaches.Itconsidersallthespaneventsand
log events of a trace, thus performs better than log anomaly detec-
tion approacheswhich relyon slidingwindow based loganalysis.
However, its sequence-based representation of span events andlog events ignores the complex structures of traces brought by
theirinvocationhierarchiesandparallel/asynchronousinvocations.
Therefore, it does not perform as well as DeepTraLog.
Figure 6 shows the comparison of the results produced by Deep-
TraLog and GRU-based deep SVDD. We use t-SNE [ 36] to visualize
the latent representations of the traces in the test set by project-
ingthemto2Dspace.ItcanbeseenthatDeepTraLogcanlearna

anomaloustracesfromnormalones.Webelievethattheimprove-
ment is broughtby the unified graph representationof traces and
logs.
In conclusion, DeepTraLog is effective in microservice anomaly
detectionandoutperformsexistingtrace-andlog-basedanomaly

4.3 RQ2: Efficiency
Usingeachoftheapproaches,wetrainananomalydetectionmodel
with the training set (including 65,490 traces) and test the model
withthetestset(including56,080traces).Table3showsthetraining
time and testing time of each approach. These approaches take 30-
816 minutes to train the models and 77-3,136 seconds to finishthe test. In general, all the approaches except LogAnomaly are
efficient,forexampletrainingamodelinabout30-138minutesandfinishingthetest(thewholetestset)in77-278seconds.DeepTraLog
is slower than the two trace-based approaches (i.e., TraceAnomaly
and MultimodalTrace) but much faster than the others in model
training. It is much faster than all the other approaches in testing.
Thetwotrace-basedapproaches (i.e., TraceAnomalyandMulti-
modalTrace) are much faster than DeepTraLog in training, as they
onlyconsidertraces.DeepTraLogconsidersbothtracesandlogs,
thus uses more time in training. However, DeepTraLog is much
faster than them in testing. The reason is that the network param-
eters𝜃completelycharacterizetheanomalydetectionmodeland
no data has to be stored for anomaly detection [30].
Thetwo log-based approaches (i.e.,DeepLog and LogAnomaly)
useslidingwindowstosegmenteventsequences,thusproducea
largenumberofsubsequencesfortrainingandtesting.Moreover,
LogAnomaly uses an additional count vector sequence for each
subsequence and the dimension of the count vectors is determined
by the number of log events. Public log datasets usually have a
smallnumberoflogevents.Forexample,theHDFSlogdataset[ 38]
contains only about 40 log events. In contrast, our dataset has
morethan800log/spanevents,causingthecurseofdimensionality
forLogAnomaly.Thelargenumberoflog/spaneventsispopular
in microservice systems, thus traditional log anomaly detection
approaches cannot work well for microservice systems.

tationfortracesandlogs,butisslowerthanDeepTraLoginboth

sequence.
Theresponsetimeofonlinepredictionisimportantforachieving

i.e., the number of span/log events in it. To evaluate the scalability
ofDeepTraLogwithtracesize,weconductanexperimentonthe

TraLog and GRU-based Deep SVDD for traces of different sizes.
Figure 7 shows the results. It can be seen that the response time of
both approaches increases linearly with the size of the trace and
DeepTraLog is always faster than GRU-based Deep SVDD.
Inconclusion,DeepTraLogisslowerthantrace-basedapproaches

4.4 RQ3: Impact of Configurations

the hidden layer number of GGNNs are two important parameters
of the GGNNs based deep SVDD model. As stated in Section 3.5,

violations of the boundary. The hidden layer number of GGNNs
determines the iterations of message passing between the nodes
in a TEG, thus has great impact on the latent representation the
TEG. The regularization parameter 𝜆in Equation 6 usually can
be empirically set (e.g., 0.001 in our implementation) as previous
work [30].
Figure 8(a) shows the impact of 𝜇on the precision, recall, and
F1-score of DeepTraLog. In deep SVDD, 𝜇usually can take a value
between0.01and0.1[ 30].Bigger 𝜇usuallyleadstolowerprecisionand higher recall as it makes a smaller hypersphere enclosing less
normal traces andanomalous traces. According to theresults, 𝜇=
0.07achievesthebesttrade-offin termsofF1-score.Notethatthe
bestconfigurationof 𝜇highlydependsonthecharacteristicsofthe
dataset. It usually can be determined based on the preference on
precision and recall.
Figure 8(b) shows the impact of the hidden layer number of
GGNNs.Itisusuallysettotwotofour.Itcanbeseenthatbothrecall
and F1-score decrease with the increase of hidden layer number. It
is usuallybecause thatmore hiddenlayers are morelikely tolead

The threats to the external validity mainly lie in the bench-

TrainTicket and its fault cases. It is unclear whether it can be effec-
tively used formore complex industrial microservicesystems and
fault cases. These threats are alleviated from two aspects. First, the
