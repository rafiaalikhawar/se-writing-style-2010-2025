ABSTRACT
Increasinglylargernumberofsoftwaresystemstodayareincluding
datasciencecomponentsfordescriptive,predictive,andprescriptive
analytics. The collection of data science stages from acquisition, to
cleaning/curation, to modeling, and so on are referred to as data
science pipelines. To facilitate research and practice on data science
pipelines, it is essential to understand their nature. What are the
typical stages of a data science pipeline? How are they connected?

three-pronged comprehensive study to answer this for the state-

These data science stages generally perform different tasks such
asdataacquisition,data preparation,storage,featureengineering,
modeling,training, evaluationof themachinelearning model,etc.
In order to design and build software systems with data science
stages effectively, we must understand the structure of the data
sciencepipelines.Previousworkhasshownthatunderstandingthe
structureandpatternsusedinexistingsystemsandliteraturecan
help build better systems [ 23,78]. In this work, we have taken the
first stepto understand the structure and patterns of DS pipelines.
Fortunately, we have a number of instances in both the state-of-
the-artandpracticetodrawobservations.Intheliterature,there
havebeenanumberofproposalstoorganizedatasciencepipelines.
We call such proposals DS Pipelines in theory. Another source of
information is Kaggle, a widely known platform for data scientists
tohostandparticipateinDScompetitions,sharedatasets,machine
learning models, and code. Kaggle contains a large number of data
sciencepipelines,butthesepipelinesaretypicallydevelopedbya
single data scientist as small standalone programs. We call such
instances DSPipelinesin-the-small.ThethirdsourceofDSpipelines
are mature data science projects on GitHub developed by teams,
suitablefor reuse. We call such instances DS Pipelines in-the-large.
This work presents a study of DS pipelines in theory, in-the-
small, and in-the-large. We studied 71 different proposals for DS
pipelines and related concepts from the literature. We also studied
105instancesofDSpipelinesfromKaggle.Finally,westudied21
matured open-source data science projects from GitHub. For both
KaggleandGitHub,weselectedprojectsthatmakeuseofPythontoeasecomparativeanalysis.Ineachsetting,weanswerthefollowing
overarching questions.
(1)Representative pipeline: What are the stages in DS pipeline
and how frequently they appear?
(2)Organization: How are the pipeline stages organized?
(3)Characteristics: What are the characteristics of the pipelines
in a setting and how does that compare with the others?
Thisworkattemptstoinformtheterminologyandpracticefor
designing DS pipeline. We found that DS pipelines differ signifi-
cantlyintermsofdetailedstructuresandpatternsamongtheory,
in-the-small,andin-the-large.Specifically,anumberofstagesare
absent in-the-small, and the pipelines have a more linear structure
with an emphasis on data exploration. Out of the eleven stages
seen in theory, only six stages are present in pipeline in-the-small,
namelydata collection, data preparation, modeling, training,eval-
uation, and prediction. In addition, pipelines in-the-small do not
haveclearseparationbetweenstageswhichmakesthemaintenance
harder. On the other hand, the DS pipelines in-the-large have a

We identified different pipeline patterns followed in specific phase
(development/post-development) of the large DS projects. The ab-
stractionofstagesarestricterin-the-largehavingbothloosely-and

Our investigation also suggest that DS pipeline is a well used
software architecture but often built in ad hoc manner. We demon-

2 DS PIPELINE IN THEORY
DataScience .DataScience(DS)isabroadareathatbringstogether
computational understanding, inferential thinking, and the knowl-
edge of the application area. Wing [ 91] argues that DS studies how
to extract value out of data. However, the value of data and extrac-
tion process depends on the application and context. DS includes a
broadsetoftraditionaldisciplinessuchasdatamanagement,data
infrastructurebuilding,data-intensivealgorithmdevelopment,AI
(machine learning and deep learning), etc., that covers both the
fundamental and practical perspectives from computer science,
mathematics, statistics, and domain-specific knowledge [ 9,81]. DS
also incorporates the business, organization, policy and privacy
issues of data and data-related processes. Any DS project involves
three main stages: data collection and preparation, analysis and
modeling, and finally deployment [ 90]. DS is also more than statis-
tics or data mining since it incorporates understanding of data and
itspattern,developingimportantquestionsandansweringthem,
and communicatingresults [81].
Data Science Pipeline . The term pipelinewas introduced by
Garlanwith box-and-line diagramsandexplanatoryprosethatassist
softwaredeveloperstodesignanddescribecomplexsystemssothat
the software becomes intelligible [ 26]. Shaw and Garlan have pro-
videdthe pipes-and-filter designpatternthatinvolvesstageswith
processingunits(filters)andorderedconnections(pipes)[ 78].They
also argued that pipeline gives proper semantics and vocabulary

tweenthesub-systems,andoverallcomputationalparadigm[ 26,78].
Bydatasciencepipeline (DSpipeline),wearereferringtoaseriesof

agement,analysis,andreasoning[ 54,56].ThesequentialDSstages
from acquisition, to cleaning/curation, to modeling, and so on arereferredtoas datasciencepipeline .ADSpipelinemayconsistofsev-
eral stages and connections between them. The stages are defined
to perform particular tasks and connected to other stage(s) with
input-outputrelations[ 4].However,thedefinitionsofthestages
are not consistent across studies in the literature. The terminology
vary depending on the application context and focus.
Different study in the literature presented DS pipeline based
on their context and desiderata. No study has been conducted to
unify the notions DS pipeline and collect the concepts [ 76]. While
designinganew DSpipeline [ 92], dividingroles inDS teams[ 46],
definingsoftwareprocessindata-intensivesetting[ 86],identifying
best practices in AI and modularizing DS components [ 4], it is
important to understand the current state of the DS pipeline, its
variations and different stages. To understand the DS pipelines
and compare them, we collected the available pipelines from the
literatureandconductedanempiricalstudytounifythestageswith
theirsubtasks.Then we created a representative DS pipeline with
thedefinitionsofthestages.Next,wepresentthemethodologyand
results of our analysis of DS pipelines in theory.
2.1 Methodology
2.1.1 Collecting Data Science Pipelines. We searched for the stud-
iespublished intheliteratureand popularpressthat describesDS
pipelines.Weconsideredthestudiesthatdescribedbothend-to-end
DS pipeline or a partial DS pipeline specific to a context. First, we
searched for peer-reviewed papers published in the last decade i.e.,
from 2010 to 2020. We searched the terms “ data science pipeline ”,
“machinelearningpipeline ”, “bigdatalifecycle ”, “deeplearningwork-
flow”,andthepermutationofthesekeywordsinIEEEXplore,ACM
Digital Library and Google Scholar. From a large pool, we selected
1,566 papers that fall broadly in the area of computer science, soft-
ware engineering and data science. Then we analyzed each article
inthispooltoselecttheonesthatproposeordescribeaDSpipeline.
We found many papers in this collection use the terms (e.g., ML
lifecycle),butdonotcontainaDSpipeline.Weselectedtheones
thatcontainDSpipelineandextractedthepipelines(screenshot/de-
scription) as evidence from the article. The extracted raw pipelines
are available in the artifact accompanied by this paper [ 5]. Thus,
we found 46 DS pipelines that were published in the last decade.
Besides peer-reviewed papers, by searching the keywords on
web, we collectedthe DS pipelines from USpatent, industry blogs
(e.g.,Microsoft,GoogleCloud,IBMblogs),andpopularpresspub-
lished between 2010 and 2020. After manual inspection, we found
25 DS pipelines from this grey literature. Thus, we collected 71
subjects (46 from peer reviewed articles and 25 from grey litera-
ture) that contain DS pipeline. We used an open-coding method to
analyzethese DS pipelines in theory [5] .
2.1.2 Labeling Data Science Pipelines. Inthecollectedreferences,
DS pipeline is defined with a set of stages ( data acquisition ,data
preparation ,modeling, etc.) and connections among them. Each
stageinthepipelineisdefinedforperformingaspecifictaskand
connectedtootherstages.However,notallthestudiesdepictDS
pipelines with the same set of stages and connections. The studies
usedifferentterminologiesfordefiningthestagesdependingonthe
context. To be able to compare the pipelines, we had to understand
the definitions and transform them into a canonical form. For a

given DS pipeline, identifying their stages and mapping them to a
canonical form is often challenging. The sub-tasks, overall goal of
the project, utilities affect the understanding of the pipeline stages.
To counter these challenges, we used an open-coding method to
label the stages of the pipelines.
Two authors labeled the collected DS pipelines into different
criteria. Each author read the article, understood the pipeline, iden-
tified the stages, and labeled them. In each iteration, the raters
labeled 10% of the subjects (7-8 pipelines). The first 8 subjects were
usedfortrainingandformingtheinitiallabels.Aftereachiteration,

fied the stages and connections between them, and finally labeled
whether the DS pipeline involves processes related to cyber, physi-
calorhumancomponentinit.Inindependentlabeling,wefound
almost perfect agreement ( κ= 0.83) on average. Even after high
agreement, there were very few disagreements in the labels, which
were reconciled after each iteration.
Reconciling. Reconciliation happened for each label for the sub-
ject studies in the training session, and the disagreed labels for the
studies in independent labeling session. In training session, the
reconciliationwasdoneindiscussionmeetingsamongtheraters
and the moderator, whereas for the independent labels, reconcilia-
tionwasdonebythemoderatorafterseparatemeetingswiththe
two raters. For reconciliation, the raters described their arguments
for the mislabeled stages. Fora few cases, we had straightforward
solution to go for one label. For others, both the raters had good
arguments for their labels, and we had to decide on that label by
updating the stages in the definition of the pipeline. All the labeled
pipelinesfrom the subjects are shared in our paper artifact [5].
Furthermore, after finishing labeling the pipelines stages, we
also classified the subject references into four classes based on the
overall purpose of the article. First, after a few discussions, the
raters and moderator came up with the classes. Then, the raters
classifiedeachpipelineintooneclass.Wefounddisagreementsin6
out of 71 references, which the moderator reconciled with separate
meetings with the two raters. Based on our labeling, the literature
that we collected are divided into four classes: describe or propose
DS pipeline, survey or review, DS optimization, and introduce new
methodorapplication.Next,wearegoingtodiscusstheresultof
analyzingthe DS pipelines in theory.
2.2 Representative Pipeline in Theory
The labeled pipelines1with their stages are visually illustrated
in the artifact [ 5]. We found that pipelines in theory can be both
software architecture and team processes unlike pipelines in-the-
small and in-the-large. Through the labeling process, we separated
those team processes (25 out of 71), which are discussed in §2.4.
RQ1a: What is a representative definition of the DS pipe-
line in theory? Fromtheempiricalstudy,wecreatedarepresen-
tative rendition of DS pipeline with 3 layers, 11 stages and possible
connections between stages as shown in Figure 3. Each shaded box
represents a DS stage that performs certain sub-tasks (listed under
the box). In the preprocessing layer, the stages are data acquisition ,
preparation , andstorage. The preprocessing stage study design only

Stagesof Data Science Pipeline
Data Acquisition (ACQ): In the beginning of DS pipeline, data are collected
fromappropriatesources.Datacanbeacquiredmanuallyorautomatically.Data
acquisition also involves understanding the nature of the data, collecting relevant
data,andintegratingavailabledatasets.
DataPreparation(PRP): Data are generally acquired in a raw format that needs
certainpreprocessingsteps.Thisinvolvesexplorationandfiltering,whichhelps
identify the correct data for further processing. Well prepared data reduces the
timerequired for data analysis and contributes to the success of the DS pipeline.
Storage(STR): It is important to find an appropriate hardware-software combina-
tion to preserve data so that it can be processed efficiently. For example, Miao et al .
usedgraphdatabasesystemNeo4j[ 52]tobuildacollaborativeanalysispipeline
[49],sinceNeo4J supports querying graph data properties.
Feature Engineering (FTR): Theentiredatasetmightnotcontributeequallyto
decision making. In this stage, appropriate features that are useful to build the
modelareidentifiedorconstructed.Featuresthatarenotreadilyavailableinthe
dataset,require engineering to create them from raw data.
Modeling(MDL): Whendataarepreprocessedandfeaturesareextracted,amodel
isbuilttoanalyzethedata.Modelbuildingincludesmodelplanning,modelselection,
mining and deriving important properties of data. Appropriate data processing
strategiesandalgorithmsare selected to create a good model.
Training (TRN): Foraspecificmodel,weneedtotrainthemodelwithavailable
labeled data. By each training iteration, we optimize the model and try to make it
better.Thequalityofthetrainingdatasetcontributestothetrainingaccuracyof
themodel.
Evaluation(EVL): Aftertrainingthemodel,itistestedwithanewdatasetwhich
has not been used as training data. Also, the model can be evaluated in real-life
scenariosandcomparedwithothercompetingmodels.Existingmetricsareused
or new metrics are created to evaluate the model.
Prediction (PRD): Thesuccessofthemodeldependsonhowgoodamodelcan
predictinanunknownsetup.Afterasatisfactoryevaluation,weemploythemodel
tosolvetheproblemandseehowitworks.Therearemanypredictionmetricssuch
as classification accuracy, log-loss, F1-score, to measure the success of the model.
Interpretation (INT): The prediction result might not be enough to make a deci-
sion. We often need a transformation of the prediction result and post-processing
to translate predictions into knowledge. For example, only numerical results do
nothelpmuchbut a good visualization can help to make a decision.
Communication (CMN): Different components of the DS system might reside
in a distributed environment. So, we might need to communicate with the in-
volvedparties(e.g.,devices,persons,systems)toshareandaccumulateinformation.
Communicationmighttakeplacein different geographical locations or the same.
Deployment (DPL): The built DS solution is installed in its problem domain to
servetheapplication.Overtime,theperformanceofthemodelismonitoredsothat
the model can be improved to handle new situations. Deployment also includes
model maintenance and sending feedback to the model building layer.

mulation, specification, and planning, which are often challenging

existence of an ML component,since DS can involve custom data
processingorstatisticalmodeling.Post-processinglayerincludes
the tasks that take place after the results have been generated. The
DS pipeline stages are described in Table 1.
RQ1b: What are the frequent and rare stages of the DS
pipeline in theory? The frequency of stage can depend on the
Figure 4: Frequency of pipeline stages in theory
focusof thepipeline oritsimportance incertaincontext (ML,big-
data management). Among 46 DS pipelines (which are not team
processes), Figure 4 shows the number of times each stage appears.
A few pipelines present stages with broad terminology that fit mul-
tiple stage-definitions. In those cases, the pipelines were labeled
withthefittedstagesandcountedmultipletimes. Modeling,data
preparation, and feature engineering appear most frequently in the
literature. While modeling is present in 93% of the pipelines, other
model relatedstages ( feature engineering,training, evaluation,pre-
diction) are not used consistently. Often trainingis not considered
asaseparatestageandincludedinsidethe modeling stage.Similarly,
wefoundthat evaluation andprediction areoftennotdepictedas
separatestages. However,by separating thestages andmodulariz-
ing the tasks, the DS process can be maintained better [ 4,76]. The
pipeline created with the most number of stages (11) is provided
byAshmoreetal .[7].Ontheotherhand,about15%ofthepipelines
fromtheliteraturearecreatedwithaminimalnumber(3)ofstages.
Among them, 80% are ML processes and falls in the category of
DSoptimizations.Wefoundthatthesepipelinesareveryspecific
to particular applications, which include context-specific stages
likedatasampling,querying,visualization,etc.,butdonotcover
most of the representative stages. A pipeline in theory may not
requireallrepresentativestages,sinceitcanhavenoveltyincertain
stagesandexcludetheothers.However,therepresentativepipeline
provides common terminology and facilitate comparative analysis.
Finding1 :Post-processinglayersareincludedinfrequently(52%)
compared to pre-processing (96%)and model building (96%) layers
of pipelines in theory.
Clearly, preprocessing and model building layers are considered
in almost all of the studies. In most of the cases, the pipelines
do not consider the post-processing activities ( interpretation, com-
munication,deployment ).Thesepipelinesoftenendwiththepre-
dictive process and thus do not follow up with the later stages
which entails how the result is interpreted, communicated and de-
ployed to the external environment. Miao et al .argued that overall
lifecycle management tasks (e.g., model versioning, sharing) are
largely ignored for deep learning systems [ 50]. Previous studies

2.3 Organizationof Pipeline Stages in Theory
RQ2:Howarepipelinestagesconnectedtoeachother? InFig-
ure 3, for simplicity, we depicted the DS pipeline as a mostly linear
chain. However, our subject DS pipelines often have non-linear
behavior. In any stage, the system might have to return to the pre-
vious stage for refinement and upgrade, e.g., if a system faces a
real-world challenge in modeling, it has to update the algorithm
whichmightaffectthedatapre-processingandfeatureengineering
as well. Furthermore, the stages do not have strict boundaries in
the DS lifecycle. In Figure 3, two backward arrows, from feature
engineering andevaluation ,indicatefeedbacktoanyoftheprevi-
ous stages. Although in traditional software engineering processes
(e.g., waterfall model, agile development, etc.), feedback loop is not
uncommon, in DS lifecycle, there are multiple stakeholders and
models in a distributed environment which makes the feedback
loops more frequent and complex. Sculley et al .pointed that DS
taskssuchassampling,learning,hyperparameterchoice,etc.are
entangledtogethersothatChangingAnythingChangesEverything
(CACEprinciple)[ 76],whichinturncreatesimplicitfeedbackloops
that are not depicted in the pipelines [ 15,24,67,83]. The feedback
loops inside any specific layer are more frequent than the feedback
loops from one layer to another. Also, a feedback loop to a distant
previous stage is expensive. For example, if we do data preparation
afterevaluation then the intermediate stagesalso require updates.
2.4 Characteristicsof the Pipelines in Theory

data managementprocess, and 3) team process.
ML process: 46% of all the pipelines we found in the literature
are describing machine learning processes. The recent advent ofartificial intelligence, supervised learning and deep learning has
ledtomoreDSsystemsthatinvolveMLcomponents.Thepipelines

Processing large amount data often requires specific algorithms

foundthat 18% of all the subject studies fall in this category.
Team process: We also found some DS pipelines that are not

flow of human activities that needs to be followed in a DS pipeline.
Thesestudiespresentahigh-levelviewforbuildingDScomponent
in a team environment. The data science teams require specific
expertise and management to build successful DS pipelines [ 4,46].
In this paper, in §3 and §4, we are only focusing on DS pipeline as
software architecture, and therefore, we did not compare the team
process pipelines in the rest of this section.
Finding 2 :Most of the pipelines in-theory involve cyber and phys-
ical components,only a few with human processes in the loop.
Weidentifiedwhetherthepipelinesinvolvecyber,physicalorhu-
man process, using our labeling process described in section §2.1.2.
Cyberprocesses refer to activities that involve automated systems
andmachinerycomputations.SincemodernDSsystemsinvolves
large amount of data and requires extensive computation, all of
the pipelines include cyber component in it. Physical processes

reasons: 1) all programs perform a DS task and provide solution to

Thereare331completedcompetitionsinKaggletodate.They
categorized the competitions into Featured,Research,Recruitment ,
Masters,Analytics ,Playground andGetting started . We collected
solutionsofallthecompetitionsfrom eachcategoryexcept Getting
startedandPlayground (these two categories are intended to serve
as DS tutorials and toy projects). First, we filtered the competitions
for which there are solutions available (many old competitions do
not contain any public solution). We found 138 such competitions.
For a given competition problem, we selected the most voted so-
lutionwhichhasatleast10votes.Thus,wegot105top-ratedDS
solutionsforanalyzingpipelinesin-the-small.Thisselectionand
pipeline creation process is shown in Figure 5.
All of the DS programs are written in Python using ML libraries
like Keras, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, etc. These packages provide
high-level Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for perform-
ingaspecific task on dataor model. We parsedthe programs into
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and collected all the API calls from the
programs. Thenthe functionalityof an APIis usedto identify the
stage of the pipeline. We extracted the temporal order of API calls
to identify the stages. Standard static analysis of the Python pro-
grams facilitate the extraction process. Our analysis suggests that
theDSprogramsfollowalinearstructurewithlessthan4%AST

For creating the dictionary, we taken a two-fold approach. First,
we understand the context of the program and API usage. Second,'DWD

3.2 Representative Pipeline in-the-Small
RQ4:Whatarethestagesof DS pipeline in-the-small ?Among
the11pipelinestagesdescribedinFigure3,wefoundonly6stages
in the DS programs that are depicted in Figure 6. Other stages (e.g.,
storage,featureengineering,interpretation,communication,deploy-
ment) are not found in these programs because these stages occur
while building a production-scale large DS system and often not
presentintheDSnotebooks.Therefore,thepipelineinDSprograms
consistsof the subset of pipeline stages in theory.
We summarized the frequency of each stage of the DS programs
in Figure 7. Among 105 programs, data acquisition anddata prepa-
rationarepresentinalmostallofthem.Surprisingly, modeling is
present inonly 70%of theprograms. We foundthat, inmany pro-
grams,nomodelingAPIshadbeenusedbecausedevelopersdidnot
useanybuilt-inMLalgorithmfromlibraries,e.g.,LogisticRegres-
sion, LSTM, etc. In these cases, the developers use data-processing
APIs on the training data to build custom model, e.g., this note-
book [37] usesdata preparation APIs to produce results. To enable
more abstraction ofthe stages in these pipelines,further modular-
izationis necessary, which has been investigated in RQ8.

of the result produced by the model. The reason for having less
numberof evaluation stageinthepipelineisthatoftenthedevelop-
ers evaluate the performance by plotting and visualizing the result.
Since the visualization APIs are not considered as evaluation stage,
we found this stage less frequently in pipelines. Also, many pro-
gramsdirectlygotothe prediction stagewithoutgoingto evaluation
stage at all. Furthermore, notebooks are often used for experimen-

experienced many missing stages in the pipeline in-the-small. The

3.3 Pipeline Organizationin the Small
RQ5: How are the stages connected with each other in pipe-
linein-the-small? ToanswerRQ5,weconsideredeachoccurrence
ofthestagesinaDSprogramandlookedatitspreviousandnext
stage.InFigure8,weshowedwhichstagesarefollowedorpreceded
by each stage. We found that datapreparation can occur before or
afterall otherstages.Apartfrom that, dataacquisition is followed
bydata preparation most of the time, which in turn is followed
bymodeling.Modeling is followed mostly by training, which in
turn is followed by prediction .Evaluation is mostly surrounded
byprediction anddata preparation . From Figure 8, we can also
find some most occurring feedback loop: evaluation topreparation ,
evaluation tomodeling andprediction tomodeling.
Data preparation tasks (e.g., formatting, reshaping, sorting) are
not limited to just before the modeling stage, rather it is done on a
whenever-needed basis. For example, in the following code snippet
from a Kaggle competition [ 38], while creating model-layers, data
preprocessing API has been called in line 2.
1x = Conv2D(mid, (4 , 1) , activation= 'relu ', padding= 'valid ' )(x)
2x = Reshape((branch_model.output_shape[1], mid, 1))(x)
3x = Conv2D(1 , (1 , mid) , activation= 'linear ' , padding= 'valid ' )(x)
4x = Flatten(name= 'flatten ' )(x)
5head_model = Model([xa_inp , x b_inp], x, name='head'
Themodeling stage is always surrounded by other stages of the
pipeline. However, there is often a loop around modeling, training,
evaluation, and prediction .Modeling often repeats many times to
improve the model over multiple iterations. For example, in thefollowingKagglecodesnippet[ 39],themodeliscreatedandtrained
multipletimesto find the best one.
1random_forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100,
random_state=50, verbose=1, n_jobs= −1)# Modeling

addition,agoodDSsolutionshouldnotonlycomputebetterpre-
dictive result, but also facilitate software engineering activities e.g.,
debugging,testing,monitoring[ 28].However, wefoundthatstages
are often tangledwith other stages [ 14,45,64] across the pipelines.
Thecodeforonestageisinterspersedwiththecodeforotherstages.
For example, while building the deep learning network ( modeling),
the developers often switch to different data preparation tasks, e.g.,
reshaping,resizing[ 32,33],whichtanglesdatapreparationconcern
with the modeling concern. We observed some early attempts to
adopt modular design practices. For instance, this notebook [ 40]
separated code into different high-level stages, namely, prepara-
tion,feature extraction ,exploratory data analysis (EDA) ,topic model ,
etc. These high-level pipelines can improve the abstraction, which
further enable the maintainability, and reusability [ 71]. In some
scenarios, reuse or maintenance might not be desired for pipelines
in-the-small.However, to enhance readability [ 44] and repeatabil-
ity[28]andeaseoftesting,debuggingorrepairing[ 88,89],more
attentionon modular design practices is needed for DS pipelines.
Finding5 :Data preparation stage is occurring significant number
of times between any two stages of pipelines in-the-small, which is
causingpipeline jungles.
We found that new data sources are added, new features are identi-
fied, and new values are calculated incrementally in the pipeline
whichevolvesorganically.Thisresultsinalargenumberofdata
preprocessing tasks like sampling, joining, resizing along with ran-
dom file input-output. This is called pipeline jungles [76], which
causestechnical debtfor DS systems in thelong run. Pipelinejun-
glesare hard to test and any small change in the pipeline will
take a lot of effort to integrate. The situation gets worse in case of
largerDSpipelines,whereseveraldatamanagementactivities(e.g.,
clean, serve, validate) are necessary through the pipeline in differ-
ent stages [ 62,63]. The recommended way is to think about the
pipelineholisticallyandscrapethepipelinejunglebyredesigningit,
which inturn takes furtherengineering effort[ 76]. We found that
the large DS projects, which are discussed in §4, isolate the data
preparation tasks into separate files and modules [ 13,73,82,94],
whichalleviatesthepipelinejunglesproblem.So,DSpipelinein-
the–smallneedsfurtherIDE(e.g.,JupyterNotebook,etc.)support

RQ6:Whatarethepatternsinpipelinein-the-smallandhow
it compares to pipeline in theory? We have not found many
stages from Figure 3, e.g., feature engineering, interpretation, com-
munication, in pipeline in-the-small. One reason is that the low-
level pipeline extractedfrom theAPI usagescannot capturesome
stages. For example, even if a developer is conducting feature engi-
neering, the used APIs might be from the data preparation stage.
Fortunately,wefoundmanyKagglenotebooksthatareorganizedby
the pipeline stages. We visited all the 105 Kaggle notebooks in our
collectionandextractedthesehigh-levelpipelinesmanually.Unlike
thelow-levelpipelines(extractedusingAPIusages),ahigh-level
pipeline consistsof the stages abstracted by the developers.
TheKagglenotebooksfollowliterateprogrammingparadigm[ 71,
85],whichallowsthedeveloperstodescribethecodeusingrichtext
and separate them into sections. We found that 34 out of 105 note-
books divided the code into stages. We collected those stages from
the Kaggle notebooks. Furthermore, we labeled these notebooks
into the 11 stages from DS pipeline in theory by two raters, and
extractedthestagesthatarenotpresentintheory.Theextracted
high-levelpipelinesandlabelsareavailableinthepaperartifact[ 5].
We observed that no notebooks specify these stages: storage,
interpretation, communication, anddeployment . These DS programs
arenotproduction-scaleprojects.Therefore,theydonotincludethe

understanding the data, compute feature importance, and visualize
the patterns, which help to build models quickly in later stages [ 7].

example,theobjectiveofthe FaceClassification projectinGitHub
[6] is to detect face from images or videos and classify them based
on gender and emotion. This problem is not specific to a particular

We collected such top-rated DS projects from GitHub to analyze
DS pipeline in-the-large.

this list which are DS libraries, frameworks or utilities. Since we
want to analyze the pipeline of data science software, we removed
those projects. Finally, we also removed the repositories which
serve educational purposes. Thus, we found a list of 21 mature
open-source DS projects. The list of projects, and their purpose are
shown in Table 2.

Then,thefile evaluate.py isexecutedtoperformtheevaluation

used the API based analysis to generate the pipeline, which was

does data preparation, training, and evaluation, when APIs are

opers in each projectranges between 1 and 40 with anaverageof

themaredeveloped byindividuals. The primarylanguage usedto
develop these projects is Python.
4.2 Representative Pipeline in-the-Large
Compared to the Kaggle programs, we found a significant differ-
ence in the pipeline of large DS projects. Because of the larger
size of the projects, the pipeline architecture is different. All the
projectscontainmultiplesourcefilesforhandlingdifferenttasks
(e.g.,modeling,training)andabout50%oftheprojectsorganizethe
source files into modules (e.g., utils,preprocessing ,model, etc.).
RQ7:WhatistherepresentativeDSpipelinein-the-large?
EachoftheprojectscontainssixstagesdescribedinFigure6: ac-
quisition, preparation, modeling, training, evaluation , andprediction .
However, since the projects are not coupled to a specific dataset
and they solve a more general problem, the projects are not lim-
ited to one single pipeline. We found that the pipeline of each
project is divided into two phases: 1) development phase and 2)
post-development phase, which is depicted in Figure 11.
Indevelopment phase ,themaingoalistobuildamodelthat

amodeling, training, evaluation loop, the final model is created and
saved as an artifact. Afterwards, the projects also create model
interfaces, which lets the user modify and exploit the model in
the post-development phase. Finally, the model artifact is saved as
a source file or some model archiving formats. For example, the0RGLI\PRGHO$FTXLVLWLRQ7UDLQLQJ 0RGHOLQJ

projectPerson-Blocker [93] andSpeech-to-Text-WaveNet [47] saved
the model in the source file ( model.py ) and lets the users train the
model in the next phase. On the other hand, the project KittiSeg
[80]andAutopilot [3]savedthebuiltmodelartifactinJSONformat
(.json) and checkpoint format ( .ckpt) respectively. We observed
that the evaluation and prediction is often not the main goal in
this phase; rather, building an appropriate model and making it
availablefor further usageis the central activity.
Inpost-development phase , the users access the pre-built
model and use that for prediction. After acquiring data, a few
preprocessing steps are needed to feed the model. In all of the
projects under this study, we found that the development phase
is similar. Howev er, we identified three different patterns in the
post-developmentphasewhichareshowninFigure11.First,the
userscanmodifythemodelbysettingitshyperparametersanduse
that to make prediction on a new dataset. Second, the users can
use the model as-it-is and train the model on the new dataset to
makeprediction.Third,theuserscanalsodownloadthepre-trained
model and directly leverage that for prediction. Finally, at the end
of this phase, the prediction result is obtained.
The post-development phase in the pipeline enabled software
reusability of the models. All of these projects have instructions in
their readmeordocumentationexplainingtheusageandcustomiza-
tion.Forexample,theprojectDeepANPR[ 22]providesinstructions
forobtaininglargetrainingdata,retrainingthemodels,andbuild
it for prediction. However, not all the projects enable reusability
in the development pipelines. Only a few ofthem provides access
to the modules by importing in new development scenario. For
instance, Darkflow [ 82] let users access the darkflow.net.build
module and use it in new application development. To increase the
reusability of DS programs, it would be desired to consider similar
accessto the development pipeline of these large projects.
4.3 Organizationof DS Pipeline in-the-Large
RQ8:Howarethestagesconnectedinpipelinein-the-large?
The abstraction in DS projects is stricter than the DS programs
described in §3. The projects are built in a modular fashion, i.e.,
one source file for a broad task (e.g., train.py, model.py ). How-
ever,insideonespecificfile,therearemanyotherpossiblestages,
especiallydata preprocessing appearsinsideallthesourcefiles.In
addition, the module connectivity is not linear. All of the modules
use external libraries for performing different tasks. As a result,
2099ICSE’22,May21–29,2022,Pittsburgh,PA, USA Sumon Biswas, Mohammad Wardat, and Hridesh Rajan
there are a lot of interdependencies (both internal and external) in
the DS pipeline. One immediate difference of these pipelines with
traditionalsoftwareisDSpipelinesareheavilydependantonthe
data.Forexample,theproject Speech-to-Text-WaveNet [47]requires
a certain format of data. When we want to use that in a new situa-
tion, the data properties might be different. So, the usage pipelines
would have a few additional stages. In some cases, the original
pipelineismodified.Here,therearemanysub-pipelinesworkto-
gethertobuildalargepipeline.However,wehavenotfoundany

pipelinesin-the-largebutnocommonframeworkisusedinpractice.
Although all the project under this study are written using
Python, no project is using any common tool that integrates the
DSmodulesandprovidesinterfacetothepipeline.Today,contin-
uous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tools are widely used
in traditional software lifecycle to automate compilation, build-
ing, and testing [ 29,41]. Additionally, from our subject studies
of pipelines in theory, we found some CI/CD tools designed for
ML pipelines available [ 30,51,53]. Surprisingly, here we found no
projectsinpipelinein-the-largeareusinganyCI/CDtools.How-
ever,theprojectsdemonstratetheneedofCI/CDintherepositories.
Inmostoftheprojects,theenvironmentsetupandaccesstofunc-
tionalities are configured through command lines scripts [ 3,70].
Some projects used docker container [6,47,73,93] to set up the
environment and run the pipeline. A few others used Python note-
books that call different modules to integrate the pipeline stages
[2,18,57]. 7 out of 21 projects used shell script for integration
(e.g., sending HTTP request to download data, model reuse, etc.)
[65,94]. Although CI/CD frameworks e.g., TravisCI, GitHub Ac-
tions, Microsoft Azure DevOps are well established for traditional
softwaresuchaswebapplications,severalchallengesremainfor
DSpipelines.Karlašetal .outlinedtheprobabilisticnatureofML
testingasamajorCI/CDchallengeandpointedoutthegapbetween
recent theoretical development of CI/CD in DS and their usage in
practice[ 41]. Hence,further researchis needed toinvestigate the
practicalchallengesof using CI/CD in data science projects.5 DISCUSSION
Throughoursurvey,empiricalstudy,andanalysis,wepresented
thestateofdatasciencepipelinethatdescribesitssemantics,design
concerns, and the overall computational paradigm. Furthermore,
thefindingsshowtheimportanceofstudyingthepipelinestructure
reminiscing the traditional software engineering works on design
patternsand architecture.
In Theory: We presented all the representative stages and sub-
tasks that inform the terminology of DS pipelines to be used in
future works. By comparing with the available pipeline categories
e.g.,MLprocess,bigdata,andteamprocesses,similaritiesanddiver-
gences can be directly identified. The presence of implicit feedback
loops and lack of post-processing stages suggest ad hoc pipeline
construction at the present time. This paper takes the first step
towards comparable and reusable pipeline construction.
In-The-Small: ThenovelAPI-basedanalysiscanbeutilizedfor
mining, extracting, and statically analyzing pipelines. We also
elicited the notion of high-level and low-level pipelines, where
thehigh-levelabstractionhasmoresimilaritywiththatintheory.
However,low-levelpipelinesexhibitmanydifferencessuchasmiss-
ing some stages, sparse data preparation, lack of modularization.
The gap between low-level pipeline and its presentation in high-
level can be reduced by making pipeline specific features available
indevelopmentenvironmente.g.,pipelinetemplateinJupyterNote-
book. Additionally, the low-level pipelines often had an important
stageexploratory data analysis missing which incurs much time
andeffort.Pipelineversioningtechniquesthatconsiderdata,model,
and source code will facilitate storing such intermediate stages.
In-The-Large: Different pipeline patterns emerged in develop-
ment and post-development phase of the large projects, which
suggestcreatingseparate developer-centric anduser-centric pipeline
structure. Intightly-coupled projects, the abstractionof stages are
contingent upon the project-specific requirements and internal/ex-
ternaldependencies,whereas,inloosely-coupledprojects,opportu-
nities remain to build reusable sub-pipelines that span over project
boundaries.Finally,thereisaneedforbuildingautomatedCI/CD
toolsfordatasciencespecifictesting,deployment,andmaintenance.
To researchers and tool builders. (1) Modularization of DS
pipeline into stages is challenging over all three representations.
Furtherworksare needed forstandardization of pipelinearchitec-
ture e.g., defining the interfaces of stages, enumerating externally
visible properties, identifying domain-specific constraints, to de-
velopreusableandinteroperableDSpipelines.(2)Weshowedpo-
tentialsfor automaticpipeline analysisframework basedon static
analysis and API specifications. A few future directions would
be mining (sub-)pipelines patterns, build AutoML pipelines [ 55],
andanalyzing evolution. (3) We confirmed several antipatterns of
pipelinesthatcallforactionse.g.,CACEprinciple,pipelinejungles,
scarcepost-processing,implicitfeedbackloop,CI/CDchallenges.
(4) Pipeline specific tool support is needed such as version control
for dataand models, storing intermediate results between stages.
To datascientists and engineers. (1) Pipelines are often built
foraprototypein-the-small,whichmightnotscaletoaproduction
level system. A well-designed pipeline inthe early stage will help
toidentifykeycomponents,estimatecost,optimize,andmanage
risksbetterinthelifecycle.(2)Therepresentativeviewsofpipelines
2100TheArtandPracticeof Data Science Pipelines ICSE’22,May21–29,2022,Pittsburgh,PA, USA
will serve as a checklist of stages and their connections. (3) Data
andalgorithmsbeingthefocusofDSpipeline,preprocessingand
modelingactivitiesarewellunderstoodandpracticedbydatascien-
tists. However, they should emphasize more on including rigorous
evaluation beyondaccuracysuchasrobustnessandfairness[ 11,12].
(4) Many people with diverse backgrounds are involved in a DS
pipeline. A pipeline with human-in-the-loop approach will benefit
identifyingcollaborationpoints,decomposingtasks,andmanage
transdisciplinary teams. For example, a pipeline can encourage
data scientists to choose a modeling technique that is maintain-
able. (5) Future work is necessary to identify the interactions of DS
pipeline with the real world i.e., which stages receive inputs, when
a checkpoint is saved, how results are disseminated, etc.
6 THREAT TO VALIDITY
ForbuildingthepipelinesfromDSprograms,wereliedontheAPIs.
Onethreatmightbe,whathappensifthedeveloperdoesnotuse
anyAPIforcompletingastageintheprogram.Weexaminedthis
possibilityandfoundthatDSprogramsareheavilydependenton
libraries and external APIs and ML tasks are always performed
using library APIs. Additionally, we validated the API-to-stage
dictionary with the API documentation and manual verification.
AnotherpossiblethreatisthattheKagglesolutionsmightnot
be representative. We adopted a two-fold strategy to mitigate that
threat. First, we selected the solutions with the most number of
votes and at least 10 votes. Second, we manually verified each
program whether it is an end-to-end DS solution. Since some most
voted solutions are only for introduction and exploratory analysis
ofthedataset,bymanualverification,weexcludedthoseprograms.
The GitHub projects are also taken from a previously published
dataset containing DS repositories. We further filtered them based
on the number of stars and whether they perform a DS task.
Moreover,sincethechosenDSprogramsfromKaggleandGitHub
are using Python as the primary language, another question might
be on the generalization of them as DS programs. According to
GitHub and Stack Overflow , Python has become the most growing
language in recent times [ 31,68]. In data science, Python is the
mostusedlanguagebecauseoftheavailabilityofnumerousML,DL
and data analysis packages such as Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow,
Keras, Caffe, Theano, Scikit-Learn and many more.
7 RELATED WORK
ManystudiespresentedMLpipelineintheirowncontext,which
can not be generalized for all DS systems. Garcia et al .focused
onbuildinganiterativeprocesswiththreemainphases:develop-
ment, training and inference. They described the interpretation of
data and code while integrating the whole lifecycle [ 25]. Polyzotis
et al.presented the challenges of data management in building

defined ML concepts, business challenges, stages in the lifecycle,
roles of DS teams with comprehensive end-to-end ML architec-
ture [74]. This gives us a holistic understanding of the business
processes (e.g., acquire, organize, analyze, deliver) of a DS project.A few other studies try to capture the DS process by surveying
andinterviewingdevelopers.Rohetal .surveyedthedatacollection
techniques in the field of big data. They presented the workflow
of data collection answering how to improve data or models in an
MLsystem[ 69].Anotherstudyidentifiedthesoftwareengineering

development teams [ 4]. They found some key differences in AI
software process compared to other domains. They considered a 9-
stageworkflowforDSsoftwaredevelopment.Hilletal .interviewed

Some articles described ML applications and frameworks which

vides high-level APIs for programming languages [ 30]. Team Data
Science Process (TDSP) is an agile and iterative process to build

DM) is a 6-stage comprehensive process model for data mining
projects across any industry [ 92]. Google Cloud Blog described the

Although there are many papers in the literature presenting DS
pipeline, thereis nocomprehensive studythat triesto understand
and compare DS pipelines in theory and practice.
8 CONCLUSION
Many software systems today are incorporating a data science

Our study analyzedthree datasets: a collectionof 71 proposals for

of 105 implementations of data science pipelines from Kaggle com-
petitions to understand data science in-the-small, and a collection
of 21 mature data science projects from GitHub to understand data
science in-the-large. We have found that DS pipelines differ signifi-
cantly between these settings. Specifically, a number of stages are
absent in-the-small, and the DS pipelines have a more linear struc-
ture. The DS pipelines in-the-large have a more complex structure
andfeedbackloopscomparedtothetheoreticalrepresentations.We
