ABSTRACT
Theevolutionofsoftwaresystemsisaninevitableprocesswhich
has to be managed effectively to enhance software quality. Change
impact analysis (CIA) is a technique that identifies impact sets, i.e.,
thesetofclassesthatrequirecorrectionasaresultofachangemade
to a class or artefact. These sets can also be considered as ripple
effectsandtypicallynon-local:changespropagatetodifferentparts
of a system.
Two classes are considered logically coupled if they have co-
changed in the past; past research has shown that the precision of
CIA techniques increases if logical and semantic coupling (i.e., the
extenttowhichthelexicalcontentoftwoclassesisrelated)areboth
considered.However,therelationshipbetweensemanticandlogicalcouplingofsoftwareartefactshasnotbeenextensivelystudiedand
no dependencies established between thesetwo types of coupling.
Aretwooftenco-changedartefactsalsostronglyconnectedfrom
a semantic point of view? Are two semantically similar artefacts
boundtoco-changeinthefuture?Answeringthosequestionswould
help increase the precision of CIA. It would also help software
maintainers to focus on a smaller subset of artefacts more likely to
co-evolve in the future.

vice versa.
Based on our findings, we conclude that identifying more ef-
ficient methods of semantic coupling computation as well as a
directionalrelationshipbetweensemanticandchangedependen-
cies could help to improve CIA methods that integrate semantic
coupling information. This may also help to reveal implicit depen-
dencies not captured by static source code analysis.
