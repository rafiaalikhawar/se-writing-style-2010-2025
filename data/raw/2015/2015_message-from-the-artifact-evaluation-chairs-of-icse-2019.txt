Message from the Artifact Ev aluation Chairs of ICSE 2019 
 
   Artifacts are digital objects created by researchers as part  of their studies or generated by their experiments. In the 
field of software engineering artifacts can be software systems  and scripts used to run experiments, input datasets, 
raw data collected in the experiment, or scripts used to analyz e results.  
 
   The review of artifacts provide d by authors of accepted tech nical papers increases the likelihood that research 
results can be independently replicated and reproduced by other  researchers. Experience also shows that papers 
providing artifacts earn increase d citations and greater presti ge in the research community.  
 
   In this spirit — and for the first time at ICSE — the artifa ct evaluation track aims to promote, share, and catalog 
the research artifacts of paper s accepted to the technical trac k. 
 
   Authors of papers accepted to the technical track were invit ed to submit their artifact for evaluation. We received 
51 submissions. Each artifact was reviewed by at least two memb ers of our evaluation committee and further 
assessed in the online discussion phase. If satisfying the crit eria, artifacts were awarded one or more badges, which 
are shown on the front page of their paper and on the conferenc e website. 
    We thank the authors for preparing and submitting research a rtifacts. It has been a privilege working with the 
members of our evalu ation committee and w ith each other across multiple time zones during the evaluation process.
