ABSTRACT
An increasingly important concern of software engineers is
handling uncertainties at design time, such as environment
dynamics that may be dicult to predict or requirements that
may change during operation. The idea of self-adaptation is
to handle such uncertainties at runtime, when the knowledge
becomes available. As more systems with strict requirements
require self-adaptation, providing guarantees for adaptation
has become a high-priority. Providing such guarantees with
traditional architecture-based approaches has shown to be chal-
lenging. In response, researchers have studied the application
of control theory to realize self-adaptation. However, existing
control-theoretic approaches applied to adapt software systems
have primarily focused on satisfying only a single adaptation
goal at a time, which is often too restrictive for real applica-
tions. In this paper, we present Simplex Control Adaptation,
SimCA , a new approach to self-adaptation that satises mul-
tiple goals, while being optimal with respect to an additional
goal. SimCA oers robustness to measurement inaccuracy
and environmental disturbances, and provides guarantees. We
evaluate SimCA for two systems with strict requirements that
have to deal with uncertainties: an underwater vehicle system
used for oceanic surveillance, and a tele-assistance system for
health care support.

1. INTRODUCTION
The ever growing demand on software has drastically in-
creased the burden on software engineers. Customers expect
software to cope with continuously changing conditions. Theyexpect the software to deal seamlessly with varying resources,
mask sudden failures, and adapt to changes in system goals.
Often, these changing conditions are dicult to predict at
design time and handling these uncertainties has become an
important concern of software engineers.
Self-adaptation is widely encouraged to address such un-
certainties [1, 2]. Self-adaptation handles uncertainties at
runtime, when the knowledge becomes available. To that end,
the system is equipped with a feedback loop that monitors the
system and environment and adapts the system to meet the re-
quirements under changing conditions. As more systems with
strict requirements require self-adaptation, providing guaran-
tees for adaptation has become a high-priority concern [3, 4,
5, 6]. Architecture-based approaches for self-adaptation [7, 8,
9], where feedback loops consist of components that realize
monitor-analyze-plan-execute (MAPE) functions, have been
widely used to ensure system goals under uncertainty. How-
ever, recent research has pointed out that providing assurances
for such systems is very challenging [10, 11], calling for new
perspectives on engineering self-adaptive systems.
More then a decade ago, Hellerstein et al. [12] argued for
using principles from control theory as a solution for run-
time adaptation with formal guarantees. This viewpoint has
recently gained increasing attention, e.g., [13, 14]. In this
approach, a software system is treated as a plant to be\` con-
trolled1, and a control feedback loop empowers the software
with self-adaptation capabilities, providing formal guarantees,
regardless of uncertain operating conditions [15, 16].
Recently, a strategy for applying control theory to com-
puting systems in a general way has been proposed in the
form of the Push-Button Methodology ( PBM ) [17]. PBM
can automatically build a controller of an adaptive software
system that rejects environmental disturbances, while provid-
ing control-theoretical guarantees for key properties. As the
approach is automated, PBM can be used by practitioners
with little control-theoretical background. However, PBM
deals only with one quantiable goal at a time, which is often
too restrictive for real applications. For example, consider an
e-commerce website that should guarantee particular response
times for dierent categories of customers, using available
resources, while maximizing prot from advertisements. An-
other example is a video streaming service that should provide
a particular video quality for each class of costumers, em-
ploying the available computation facilities, while minimizing
congestions along the streaming paths to consumers.
1In control theory terminology, \plant" usually refers to a
physical system that is adapted. It is often called the managed
system by software engineers.

In our research, we focus at one relevant adaptation prob-
lem that requires satisfying multiple goals while optimizing
the solution according to an additional goal, such as the ex-
amples given above. A well-known approach to handle such
problems is the simplex method [18] and its variations. How-
ever, simplex cannot be applied \as is" to realistic software
problems as it can not handle the variety of uncertainties and
disturbances that are inherent to software systems. Simplex
has no mechanism for rejecting disturbances, transient noise,
measurements inaccuracies, etc., nor does it guarantee system
stability or absence of errors in the system output. Recent
work has explored a control-based approach to handle multi-
ple objectives [19], and pointed to its relevance for practice.
However, that approach has restrictions regarding the guaran-
tees it can provide and the engineering support it oers. We
further elaborate on this in Section 5.
In this paper we present a new approach called Simplex
Control Adaptation (SimCA) that aims at solving the prob-
lem of adaptation for multiple objectives with guarantees.
SimCA builds upon PBM and the simplex method, combining
strengths of both approaches. SimCA is able to nd a system
conguration that satises multiple goals, reaches optimality
with respect to an additional goal, achieves robustness to
environmental disturbances and measurement inaccuracy, and
provides control-theoretical adaptation guarantees. To that
end, SimCA runs on the y experiments on the software in
an automated fashion, builds a set of linear models of the
software at runtime, creates a set of tunable controllers that
operate on these models, and combines controller outputs us-
ing the simplex method to adapt the system. The controllers
of SimCA use Kalman lters to dynamically adapt the linear
model in order to cope with disturbances and non-linearities.
The evaluation of SimCA is conducted in two steps. First,
we evaluate the control theoretical guarantees provided by the
approach, including system stability, settling time, absence
of overshoot and steady-state error, solution optimality, ro-
bustness, and detection of infeasible solutions. Not achieving
these guarantees may violate certain software qualities. For
example, lack of robustness guarantees may lead to instability
under disturbances, violating reliability requirements. A more
detailed mapping between guarantees and software qualities
is given in Section 4. Second, the eectiveness and generality
of SimCA is demonstrated on two cases: a UUV (unmanned
underwater vehicle) system performing surveillance missions,
and a service-based system for health care. These systems are
from dierent domains, but self-adaptation must guarantee
that the strict requirements of both systems are achieved
at runtime, regardless of the disturbances. In addition, we
provide a qualitative comparison of SimCA with the approach
presented in [19].
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. A
motivating scenario for SimCA is introduced in Section 2.
Section 3 presents SimCA and explains how to build self-
adaptive systems with the approach. The formal evaluation
of guarantees provided by SimCA is given in Section 4. In
Section 5, SimCA is empirically evaluated using two cases.
Section 6 discusses related work. Finally, conclusions and
directions for future research are presented in Section 7.
2. MOTIV ATING SCENARIO: UUV SYSTEM
We describe a UUV system (based on [20]) that we use as one
of the cases to evaluate SimCA in Section 5 and to illustrate
the technical description of SimCA in the next section. UUVsare increasingly used for a wide range of tasks. Here we look at
UUVs used for oceanic surveillance, e.g., to monitor pollution
of an area. UUVs have to operate in an environment that
is subject to restrictions and disturbances: correct sensing
may be dicult to achieve, communication may be noisy, etc.,
requiring a UUV system to be self-adaptive.
Furthermore, there is a need for guarantees as UUVs have
strict requirements, i.e., the system should not impact the
ocean area, and since vehicles are expensive equipment that
should not be lost during missions.
The self-adaptive UUV system in our study that is used to
carry out a surveillance and data gathering mission is equipped
with 5 on-board sensors that can measure the same attribute
of the ocean environment (e.g., water current or salinity).
Each sensor performs scans with a certain speed and accuracy,
while consuming a certain amount of energy (see Table 1). A
scan is performed every second.
Table 1: Parameters of sensors of the UUV.
UUV Energy cons., Scan Speed, Accuracy,
on-board sensor J/s m/s %
Sensor1 170 2.6 97
Sensor2 135 3.6 89
Sensor3 118 2.6 83
Sensor4 100 3.0 74
Sensor5 78 3.6 49
The UUV system has to satisfy the following requirements:
R1: A segment of surface over a distance of S(100km)
should be examined by the UUV within a given time t(10
hours in the scenario);
R2: To perform the mission, a given amount of energy Eis
available (5.4 MJ in the scenario);
R3: Subject to R1 and R2, the accuracy of measurements
should be maximized.
To realize the requirements, sensors can be dynamically
turned on and o during a mission. We assume that only
one sensor is active at a time, however, we use a combination
of sensors during each adaptation period. For example, to
perform a mission with energy consumption of 135 J/s we
may either use Sensor2 100% of the time, or use Sensor1 50%
of the time (using 170*0.5=85 J/s) and Sensor4 50% of the
time (using 100*0.5=50 J/s).
The requirements R1 and R2 are critical to the success of
the surveillance mission, but they may change at runtime due
to unpredictable events in the environment. In addition, the
adaptation task is not trivial because the system is aected
by dierent disturbances such as:
- Fluctuations in the expected behavior of the UUV (ac-
tual scanning speed or energy consumption diers from the
specication) up to 10% of the expected values;
- Inaccurate measurements: e.g., the monitoring mechanism
reports a scanning speed of 2.6 m/s instead of the actual value
of 2.2 m/s;
- Constant deviations of the sensor output due to a sensor
problem, e.g., a sensor starts consuming 50% more energy
than stated in the specication;
- Sensor failures;
- Gaussian or Random noise in the communication channel,
which may cause errors of the communicated data.
In summary, to realize its mission, the UUV needs to self-
adapt to changes in requirements and rejects dierent types of
disturbances. The achievement of goals must be guaranteed.
230Problem denition: The general adaptation problem we
aim to solve is the following:
To guarantee the satisfaction of multiple goals and
optimize the solution according to another goal,
regardless of possible uctuations in the system
parameters, measurement accuracies, requirement
changes, and dynamics in the environment that are
dicult to predict.
The UUV scenario oers one concrete instance of this general
problem. Dening and developing an adaptive solution for
this general problem introduces several key challenges. First,
the appropriate adaptation sensors (measured variables) and
actuators (knobs that can inuence the software behavior)
must be carefully chosen. Second, the software system must be
modeled. Third, the appropriate adaptation mechanism that
controls the model and satises multiple goals, while rejecting
external disturbances, must be developed. Fourth, the system
must incorporate an optimization approach to optimize the
solution according to additional goal. The following section
proposes SimCA that aims to address these challenges.
3. SIMPLEX CONTROL ADAPTATION
To build an adaptive system with SimCA, the approach
requires four elements from a software engineer:
1. A working prototype of the software (plant).
2.A set of quantiable goals to be controlled plus one op-
timization goal. For requirements with time-dependent
constraints (e.g. a constraint on the available energy to
be used in time window), we transfer the constraints to
setpoints that satisfy the constraints over time.
3.Tunable parameters (actuators) that can be used to
adapt the running system to address the goals.
4.Adaptation sensors2to measure the eect of the adap-
tation on the system.
With these four elements SimCA is able to build a self-
adaptive system that solves the adaptation problem formu-
lated in Section 2. In order to use SimCA, engineers do not
need to construct software models. Instead, the approach
works in three runtime phases:
First, in the Identication phase, SimCA synthesizes
models that capture the dependency between the adap-
tation parameters and the measured system outputs.
Second, in the Controller Synthesis phase, SimCA con-
structs an appropriate set of controllers for the synthe-
sized models.
Third, in the Operation phase, the controllers carry
out control and the outcome of multiple controllers is
combined using the simplex method to optimally drive
the outputs of the system towards the set goals.
The three phases of SimCA are performed during system
operation. We describe the phases in detail in the following
subsections.

UUV scenario
Before that, we illustrate the four elements required from a
software engineer to apply SimCA to the UUV system:
1. A working prototype is the UUV system itself.
2.The quantiable goals are the scanning speed and energy
consumption, the optimization goal is the measurement
accuracy. We transform requirements R1 and R2 into
quantiable goals as follows: we keep the average scan-
ning speed on a particular level such that the target
area of surface is examined in the given amount of time;
similarly, we keep the average energy consumption on a
particular level such that the mission is performed with
the available energy.
3.The actuator of the UUV system is the combination of
sensors that are used for performing the mission.
4.The sensor is the monitoring mechanism that measures
the scanning speed and energy consumption of the UUV
system during the mission.
3.1 Identiﬁcation Phase
During the rst phase, a set of nlinear models of the
controlled system is automatically built, where nis the total
number of goals excluding the optimization goal. Each model
Mi,i2[1;n], is responsible for one goal si.
Similar to basic PBM, identication starts by systematically
feeding sampled values of the goal siin the form of a control
signaluito the plant and measuring their eect on the system
outputOi(see Figure 1). The vector of control signals ui
used for identication looks as follows:3
ui= [mini,mini+,mini+ 2,mini+ 3, . . . ,max i]
Wheremin iandmax iare the minimal and maximum
achievable values for the i-th goal,is the sampling rate. is
a tunable parameter chosen by the system engineer; by default
= (max i mini)0:05. A higher sampling rate will provide
a more accurate model, but increase the identication time;
whether this is required depends on the domain.
During the Identication phase (and the Control Synthesis
phase, see below), the control signal ui(k)is automatically
translated (marked Trans. on Figures 1 and 2) to an actuation
signal before feeding it to the plant. A control signal may for
example be translated to the change of a parameter setting of
the system or the selection of a component or a service. This
translation is performed by the simplex method that serves as
a straightforward translator of control signals to an actuation
signal during the Identication and Control Synthesis phases.
Such simplied translation works because at this stage we
need an approximate model and not an optimal solution.
After recording all combinations of control signals and re-
sulting system outputs, the dependency between the control
signalui(k 1)and its eect on the measured output Oi(k)
is captured by the coecient iwhich is further used to build
3uiis an array of elements, with ui(k)being thek-th element
of that array, where kequals to one adaptation period
231controllerCi. Coecient iis calculated based on linear
regression using the APRE tool [21]. As a result, a set of rst
order linear models is obtained, representing the reaction of
the system to control signals for the dierent goals:
Oi(k) =iui(k 1) (Mi)
The modelMidescribes the system behavior, but does
not take into account small disturbances or sudden failures
that typically can occur in practical software systems. For
example, this model may not be able to deal with a particular
component failure at runtime.
Earlier work has show that Miis a linear model that is
practical and works for a variety of applications [17], and
this is conrmed by the two studies presented in Section
5. The dierent cases have shown that to be eective, the
model does not need to capture the precise (usually non-linear)
relationship between the control signal and the system output.
In addition, the synthesized controller has mechanisms (see
the following section) that allow to use Mieven for non-linear
systems working under disturbances.
Exploring the eect of a range of values of a goal on the
system output during Identication may aect the realization
of a temporal constraint associated with that goal. This eect
was not taken into account in the original PBM [17]. To
ensure that the constraint is not violated, the Model building
module measures the time  tiand resources  Rispent for
Identication, subtracts this amount from the available time
tiand resources Rirespectively and automatically adjusts the
quantiable goal siaccordingly:
si=Ri Ri
ti ti(1)
UUV scenario
We illustrate the Identication phase for the energy consump-
tion goal of the UUV system. According to Table 2, the
minimal available energy consumption is min E= 78J=s,
while the maximum is max E= 170J=s. Then, by default,
= (max E min E)0:05 = 4:6. The model identication
starts with sending ui(0) =min E= 78J=sto the plant that
is automatically translated by simplex to use Sensor 5 all
of the time , because Sensor 5 consumes exactly that amount
of energy according to specication. The goal of this pro-
cedure is to measure and record the actual output energy
consumption of the vehicle OE(1). After that, the plant re-
ceivesui(1) =min E+= 82:6J=s, simplex translates it
to a corresponding combination of sensors to be used, and
the output OE(2)is measured again. When the values of
Oiare measured for all k, coecient iis calculated with
the APRE tool, resulting in a system model for the energy
consumption goal of the UUV system. We observed a typical
value ofifor this model in the range 0.9. . . 1.1. After the
Identication, the goal sEis adjusted according to the amount
of consumed energy and time (see eq. 1), for the UUV case:
sE= (5:4106 0:2106)=(103600 0:53600) = 152 J=s
3.2 Controller Synthesis Phase
The second phase of SimCA, labeled controller synthesis ,
consists of two sub-phases: controller building and controller
re-building, see Figure 2. Controllers are built once, when the
system starts, and may be rebuilt during system operation.
Controller Building: during this rst sub-phase, a set of n
controllers is built using the set of models Mi,i2[1:::n],

each controller managing one goal.
A controller Cihas one tunable parameter, called pole
denoted with pi. To maintain stability and avoid oscillations,
the pole value should belong to the open interval (0 ;1). The
pole is chosen by the controller designer and allows to trade-o
certain system properties (see discussion in Section 4).
As shown in [17], the system output equation, representing
the measured output Oi(k)in response to a unit step4setpoint
siis dened as follows:5
Oi(k) =si(1 pk
i) (2)
By using Z-transform | a frequency domain representation
of a discrete time control signal | on ( Mi) and (2), and by
analyzing the system input-output relationships, the following
controller equation can be obtained:
ui(k) =ui(k 1) +1 pi
iei(k 1) (Ci)
The synthesized controller Ci,i2[1;n], calculates the control
signalui(k)at the current time step kdepending on the
previous value of control signal ui(k 1), model adjustment
coecienti, controller pole piand the error ei(k 1), with
ei=si Oi.
Controller Rebuilding: during the second sub-phase, the
controllers handle inaccuracies in Mi. To that end, the con-
trollers of SimCA incorporate two additional mechanisms
introduced by PBM:
1.Each controller uses a Kalman lter to constantly update
the value of , adapting the linear model at runtime.
This mechanism allows to cope with small perturbations
that could not be tracked by non-adaptive Miand
assures robustness for non-linear behaving systems.
2.Each controller is equipped with a change point detection
mechanism, which allows to react to unexpected critical
changes in the system. The mechanism updates the
system parameters or, in some scenarios, re-initiates
the Identication phase and rebuilds Mi. An example
of a critical change may be a software component that
suddenly becomes unavailable. Although requiring extra
computations, the mechanism is quite simple and makes
the controller extremely robust.
UUV scenario
We illustrate Control Synthesis with examples. Assume that
the identication phase has produced a model for the energy
consumption goal with E= 1. If the engineer has set the pole
for the controller to pE= 0:9, then the Controller Building
phase will synthesize the following controller:
uE(k) =u1(k 1) + 0:1eE(k 1) (3)
4Step in the setpoint of magnitude one { for example, when
scanning speed is required to change from 2 to 3 m/s.
5pk
iispito the power k.
232If, during system operation the UUV slows down due to
unexpected underwater streams in some area, the Kalman
lter will change Eaccordingly and trigger controller re-
building. If the change point detection mechanism detects
a critical change, e.g. some of the UUV sensors fail, a re-
identication will be triggered resulting in a new value of E
which will be updated in the controller equation.
3.3 Operation Phase
The third phase of SimCA, labeled operation also consists
of two sub-phases: control and optimization, see Figure 3.
Control: in the rst sub-phase, the set of controllers eec-
tively perform control. Each controller Cimanages one goal
si, rejects disturbances acting on the according output Oi(k),
and provides an output signal ui(k)that is fed to simplex (see
Optimization below). The ivalue of the controller can be
updated on the y by the embedded Kalman lter to handle
non-linear system behavior (see Controller Rebuilding). The
change point detection mechanism can interrupt the controller
to deal with invasive changes of the system. SimCA will then
restart Identication, followed by Controller Building.
Optimization: during the second sub-phase, SimCA collects
all control signals ui(k)and the system parameters P(k),6
and passes these data to the simplex block. Simplex calculates
the actuation signal usxthat drives the system towards an
output that satises all adaptation goals.

Generally, the simplex method allows to nd an optimal
solution to a linear problem written in the standard form:

wherexrepresents the vector of variables (to be determined),
candbare vectors of (known) coecients, Ais a (known)
matrix of coecients, and ( )Tis the matrix transpose [22].
SimCA uses a simplex variant with equalities ( Ax=b)
because we do not want simplex to change the eect of control
signals on the output signals. Instead, simplex is responsible
for seamless translation of control signals to actuation signals.
In SimCA each equation, except the last one, represents
a goal to be satised. The last equation ensures that the
system selects a valid actuation signal by constraining the
values that can be taken by elements of the vector x, e.g.
x0. The control signals ui(k) produced during the control
phase replace constants b, whereas matrix Aand vector cT
are substituted with the monitored parameters P(k)of the
system. The goal of simplex is to nd a proper actuation
signalusx, i.e., vector x.
For details on how simplex solves the system of equations
(4) we refer to the linear programming literature [22, 23, 24].
6P(k)contains relevant parameters of system components
that can be measured.UUV scenario
Assume that the energy consumption goal is set to sE= 152
J/s. We illustrate how the controller calculate the control
signal at time k= 200 , assuming that the control signal at
the previous adaptation step uE(199) = 149 and the amount
of energy consumed by the UUV at the previous adaptation
periodOE(199) = 150 J/s. By substituting the according
values in (3), we get the control signal value:
uE(200) = 149 + 0 :1(152 150) = 149:2
The controller will send this value to the simplex block.
To illustrate the optimization sub-phase, we rewrite (4) as
a system of equations using the UUV scenario:

crete values of Accj,Ej,Vj, see Table 1); and u1andu2are

and scanning speed controller respectively.
As it can be observed from the comparison of (4) and (5),
the monitored parameters P(k) of the system are the sensor
energy consumption Ejand the scanning speed Vjwith the
active sensor j. VectorcTis replaced with accuracies Accjof

during system operation.
4. EV ALUATION OF GUARANTEES
We start the evaluation of SimCA by formally analyzing
the adaptation guarantees provided by the approach.
4.1 Guaranteed Goal Achievement
The achievement of system goals (except the optimization
goal) is guaranteed by the controllers used in SimCA. Speci-
cally, by using controllers we can formally prove the following
four system properties: stability, steady-state error, settling
time and overshoot. Stability relates to most software quali-
ties that are subject of adaptation and shows the ability of
an adaptation mechanism to achieve goal si. For example,
lack of stability for a security goal implies periods with high
vulnerability of the system. If the system has zero steady-
state error, its goal siis reached after a certain time Kand
Oi(k) =si(k);kK.Kis called settling time, and shows
the time it takes for an adaptation mechanism to bring mea-
sured quality properties close to their goals. Settling time
is computed for a step in the setpoint of magnitude one {
e.g., demanding the scanning speed to vary from 2 to 3 m/s.
Settling time and steady-state error are also related to most
software qualities that are subject of adaptation. For example,
fast achievement of an energy consumption goal (with low set-
tling time) means spending less resources in a transient state.
233Avoiding overshoot, that is, the controlled signal does not
exceed the goal before reaching its stable area, avoids penal-
ties on the respective software quality. E.g., an overshoot of
system response time may violate a service level agreement.
Figure 4 illustrates these system properties.

Figure 4: Properties guaranteed by the controllers
The control system used in SimCA is designed to be stable
and avoid overshoots , since it has only a single pole and its
valuepibelongs to the open interval (0 ;1).
To evaluate the steady-state error (e) and unit-step settling
time (K) we recall the output equation (2). First, we calculate
the system output during steady-state, i.e. when k!1 . As
p2(0;1), in this case pk!0. From (2):
Oi(k!1 ) =si(1 pk) =si (6)
Based on (6), the steady-state error equals: e=si Oi= 0.
Theoretically, it will take innite time for Oito converge
to the exact value of goal si, i.e. to make ezero, we need
k!1 . However, the settling time is formally dened as the
time Kin which the measured variable reaches a value very
close to the goal (usually it has reached a certain percentage

As we are using an instance of simplex method with equali-
ties (see Section 3.3), it will not change the eect of control
signaluion the output signal Oi. Hence, simplex will not
alter the mentioned above guarantees provided by controllers.
4.2 Guaranteed Optimality and Scalability
Simplex guarantees the optimization goal of the obtained
solution. The simplex method was proven to always nd an
optimal solution (if it exists) to a linear problem [22, 23], such
as the one formulated in Section 3.3.
The scalability of SimCA is also inherited from simplex. To
understand the scalability of simplex, an interested reader
may ask about the number of iterations required to solve a
problem using this algorithm. Examples shown in [25] require
(2m 1)iterations worst case, with mthe number of equations.
Such cases would require too much computation. For practical
problems, the method usually nds a solution in just a few
iterations [18]. The mismatch between theory and practice is
not formulated yet, although a number of eorts have been
conducted, incl. the use of probabilistic models to synthesizeand solve linear programs to calculate the number of required
iterations. Additional details are provided in Section 6.
4.3 Guaranteed Robustness
Byrobustness we mean the amount of perturbation the
system can withstand while remaining in stable state or the
amount of inaccurate estimate in the model the system can
tolerate. Robustness directly inuences system reliability. In
line with the formal assessment of basic PBM [17], conclusions
about the system robustness can be derived for SimCA in
a similar fashion: the value of the pole piallows to trade
robustness for settling time K.
Formally, the amount of disturbance the system can with-
stand (d) by using a controller presented in Section 3.2 can
be estimated as follows: 0<(d)<2
1 pi*. This means
that the value of the pole pidenes how SimCA will react
to disturbances. For pi= 0:9, which is used in most of our
experiments, the measurement can be inaccurate by a factor
of 20, and the controller of SimCA will still adapt the system
to follow the goals. In general, higher values of pilead to
better robustness while lower pidecreases the settling time.
4.4 Detection of Infeasible Solution
The simplex method brings an additional guarantee for the
adaptation strategy: it detects infeasible solutions. According
to the principles of linear programming, every linear program
(including those solved by SimCA) is subject to one of the
following [22, 26]: (1) has an optimal solution; (2) has no
feasible solution (e.g., setting the scanning speed of a UUV
to 5 m/s which is unreachable with any of the sensors); (3)
has an unbounded optimal solution, i.e. the objective function
value seeks1(or -1), which occurs if variable values can
grow indenitely without violating any constraint.
As SimCA uses only equalities, it cannot produce an un-
bounded solution. However, when the goal is infeasible,
SimCA will converge to the nearest achievable value of the
according goal and alert the user that the goal is not reach-
able. Such clear detection of an infeasible solution oer an
advantage with respect to the basic PBM approach, for which
it is unclear if a non-zero error appears due to disturbances
or due to an unfeasible goal being set for the system.
4.5 Boundaries of Guarantees
First of all, the guarantees are achieved on the model ; if the
system is not capable to identify a suciently good model
then the controller will not be able to achieve its goals and
guarantees. The importance of successful identication is one
of the main reasons to perform it at runtime in real operating
conditions. However, as practice shows, even with poor testing
of corner cases or transient behavior during identication, the
model is representative enough to provide the guarantees.
Second, the guarantees on achieving time-dependent require-
ments depend on correct measuring the time and resources
spent during identication and computing the adjustment of
the corresponding goal.
Third, the guarantees are provided after controllers are
built, meaning that control-theoretical guarantees do not apply
during the Identication and Controller Synthesis phases.
Fourth, in the current realization, SimCA cannot provide
guarantees when goals are added/removed at runtime or when
the system behavior/architecture is invasively changed.
*Details on how to obtain this formula can be found in [17].
2345. EXPERIMENTAL EV ALUATION
We empirically evaluate SimCA with two cases. Section 5.1
describes the experimental setting of the UUV case. Sec-
tion 5.2 shows the software adaptation performed by SimCA
when the goals of the system are changed and in response to
variations in the sensor behavior at runtime. In Section 5.3 we
show the guarantees provided by SimCA with the case study.
The scalability of our approach is tested by adding a panel of
sensors to the UUV in Section 5.4. The second case with Tele
Assistance System is described and evaluated in Section 5.5.
In addition, we provide a qualitative comparison of SimCA
with the approach presented in [19] in Section 5.6. Finally,
Section 5.7 discusses threats to validity. The experiments are
performed on a Dell Notebook with 2.7 GHz Core i7 processor,
and 16 GB 1600MHz DD3 RAM. All evaluation material is
available at the project website.7
5.1 Experimental Setting: UUV case
We use the UUV system described in Section 2 as a primary
case to evaluate SimCA. The system is implemented in a
Java simulation environment that allows to model and study
the behavior of software systems. The initial parameters of
the sensors are specied in Table 1. The actual data that is
used by the adaptation mechanism at runtime is subject to a
randomly distributed disturbance up to 10% of the expected
values, simulating uctuations of actual parameters of sensors
(compared to their specication).
Adaptation is performed every 100 surface measurements
of the UUV system: 1 k= 100 measurements, and a mea-
surement is performed each second. At each adaptation step
the application calculates the average measured value of the
i-th goal (e.g., energy consumption) during the past 100 mea-
surements. Then it calculates the error eias the dierence
betweeni-th setpoint (e.g., target energy consumption) and
the measured value of the i-th goal. The application also
monitors the accuracy of surface measurements.
The task of SimCA is to maximize the measurement accu-
racy by exploiting the available energy and set the scanning
speed to examine the required surface in the given time frame.
SimCA achieves this task by calculating the value of the actu-
ation signal , which represents the portion of time each sensor
fS1;:::;S5gis used during every adaptation period. As an
indication of the complexity of the data used in the evaluation:
the total number of sensor congurations that can be selected
in the UUV scenario is 5 :5106.
Due to high dynamics and the unpredictable nature of the
environment, the controller pole piin SimCA is set to 0.9
which allows to reject errors/disturbances of high magnitude.
is kept at a default value: = (max i mini)0:05.
The application collects the UUV data to build performance
graphs, which are used to evaluate SimCA in the following
sections. The x-axis of the graphs are time instants k. Thus,
they-axis shows the average values of the measured feature
per 100 surface measurements of the UUV system.
5.2 Adaptation Results
Figure 5 shows the adaptation results of SimCA on the UUV
system congured according to Table 1 and requirements set
according to UUV scenario (Section 2). Adaptation starts
with the Identication phase that is clearly visible when k
is between 0 and 20. At time k=20 the energy consumption

setpoint slightly increases based on the energy consumed
during identication (see Section 3.1). The Control Synthesis
phase, followed by the Optimization phase, starts after the
relationship between control signals ui(k)and system outputs
Oi(k)is identied (from kequals 21 onwards). The two upper
plots in Figure 5 show that during Operation the system is
stable, i.e., the measured energy consumption and scanning
speed follow their goals. At k= 100 we change the available
energy change from 5.4 to 5.0 MJ, at k= 160 we change
the distance to be scanned from 10 to 10.5 km. The plots
show that these changes in requirements lead to corresponding
changes in goals and adaptation of the system output.
Figure 5 also shows how SimCA reacts to changes in sensor
parameters and sensor failures. At k= 220,the measurement
accuracy of sensor S3 drastically decreases from 83% to 43%.
With such a low accuracy, S3is not a part of the optimal
solution anymore and the system selects a better sensor S4
atk= 221, see the \Sensor usage" plot. At k= 290,S4 stops
working, which again leads to switching the sensors to the
optimal solution, while the measured energy consumption and
scanning speed of the UUV remain on the required level. At
this point the measurement accuracy decreases from 87% to
77%. It happens because without S4, to satisfy all goals, the
system is forced to use S5, which has lower accuracy.
The experiment ends at k= 360 , i.e. after 10 hours of
time. The total distance scanned is 10.5 km, the amount of
consumed energy is 5 MJ. Over a series of 50 experiments, we
measured an error of less than 0.01% on these values.
5.3 Adaptation Guarantees
We now conrm the guarantees formally evaluated in Sec-
tion 4 with the UUV case study.

guarantee can be observed on the \Scanning Speed" plot
of Figure 5 when kis between 160 and 176;
Guaranteed Robustness. The next experiment shows the
eects of the controller pole pion the tradeo between system
robustness and settling time. For this, we add a random
disturbance of amplitude up to 25% of the expected values
to the energy consumption output signal. Figure 6 compares
the performance of controllers with pi= 0:9 andpi= 0:2 in
such conditions. As described in Section 4, adaptation with
SimCA is inuenced by the values of the pole.
First, a smaller pole leads to a shorter settling time. This ef-
fect can be observed when the distance requirement is changed
atk= 200. The system with a smaller pole (right plots) con-
verges to a new operational goal almost immediately, while
a system with a higher pole (left plots) needs 16 adaptation
steps to converge. Experimentally we determined that due to0306090120k050100150J=s

fast convergence, the total average accuracy of measurements
is 0.1% higher for controller with lower pole.
Second, despite the decrease of the settling time, lowering
pileads to weaker disturbance rejection. This property of
adaptation mechanism of SimCA can be observed after k=
120. The system with pi= 0:2unsuccessfully tries to nd
an optimal solution until k= 200. The system with pi= 0:9
continues working as expected. Hence, the system with lower
pole is not reliable under disturbances of high magnitude.
Another benet of a high pivalue is less oscillation of sensor
usage and a smoother accuracy curve (compare according plots
on Figure 6). This means that a higher pole value leads to a
system that is less responsive to variations in parameters but
at the same switches less between solutions.
In addition to rejecting noise and measurement inaccuracy,
SimCA can reject constant disturbances. E.g., due to an error,
a monitor that measures the vehicle energy consumption can
constantly decrease the measured value by 15 J=s. The plot on
the left side of Figure 7 shows the behavior in such a scenario.
Although monitoring is not working properly, SimCA still
adapts the system by dening proper relationship between
control signal ui(k) and system output Oi(k).
Unlike SimCA, the pure simplex method fails at guaran-
teeing the control-theoretical properties such as disturbance
rejection. Hence, the simplex method produces an incorrect
output, see the right plot of Figure 7.
Detection of Infeasible Solution. Figure 8 shows the
detection of an infeasible solution. The energy consumption
remains at the required level during the entire experiment.
Initially, we set the goal distance to be examined to 10 km.
After Identication ( k>20), the system functions normally.
Atk= 150 the total distance to be examined changes to 13
km, hence the output scanning speed grows until reaching its
maximum feasible value of 3.2 m=s atk= 155 ; and the user is

Atk= 270, we change the distance requirement to an un-
reachable value of 9 km and the scans start with the minimum
possible speed among those sustaining energy consumption at
the goal, and the user is notied of the infeasible goal.
It is worth mentioning that getting an infeasible solution
does not necessarily mean that the concrete goal is entirely
unreachable. For example, the scanning speed of 3.6 m=s
can be achieved by using S2andS5. However, the energy
consumption goal of 150 J=swill be violated in such scenario as
both mentioned sensors has lower energy consumption. Hence,
in case of an infeasible solution the system may inform the
user about the contradictory goals set for the system.
5.4 Scalability of SimCA
To demonstrate the scalability of SimCA we extend the
UUV case by signicantly increasing the number of possible
actuation options (combinations of sensors). In particular, we
consider now an UUV equipped with two sensor panels, one on
the left side and one on the right side. Each panel is provided
with 5 on-board sensors that monitor a surface equal to the
surface monitored by the single panel in the original case. The
panels simultaneously monitor the respective surface, hence,
a combination of two sensors (one from each panel) is used
at the same time. The sensors have characteristics similar to
those in Table 1. Due to space constraints, we refer to the
project website for a detailed overview of the parameters of
sensor combinations (energy consumption, scanning speed,
and accuracy). The task of SimCA is to choose among 25
sensor combinations in order to satisfy the following goals:
R1: The underwater vehicle must examine S= 210kmof
surface within a period of t= 10 hours (i.e., the scanning
speed =S=t= 5.83m=s).
R2: The amount of available energy Eis limited to 5.3 MJ(i.e., mission energy consumption = E=S = 147J=s).
Note that the scanning speed specied for a combination of
two sensors is double the value of the vehicle speed as both
panels scan surface in parallel.
Figure 9 shows results of a scalability scenario with 2 sensor
panels working in parallel. The sensor data, as in the previ-
ous experiments, is subject to random disturbances of small
amplitude. In general, the system shows the same adaptation
behavior (convergence to the goal value, adaptation to sensor
parameters change, etc.) as in the case of a single sensor
panel, e.g. the change of goals at k= 100 and160switches
the sensor combination of the optimal solution. The `Sensor
Combination Used" plot shows that during operation only
6 of the 25 sensor combinations are used for this scenario.
However, note that during Identication (k = 0 to 20) other
sensor combinations are tested as well.
As SimCA has the scalability properties of simplex, we can
conclude that increasing the number of on-board sensors will
not change the adaptation outcomes.
5.5 Evaluation Scenario 2: TAS
To show the generality of SimCA, we evaluate the approach
with a second case: the TAS exemplar [27]. TAS is a service-
oriented application that provides remote health support to
patients. The main goal of TAS is to track a patient's vital
parameters in order to adapt the drug or drug doses when
needed, and take appropriate actions in case of emergency.
To satisfy this goal, TAS combines three types of services in
a workow, shown on Figure 10.

For service-based systems such as TAS, the functionality
of each service can be implemented by multiple providers
that oer services with dierent quality properties: reliability,
performance, and cost. The system design assumes that these
properties can be quantied and measured. E.g., reliability is
measured as a percentage of service failures, while performance
is measured as the service response time. At runtime, it is
possible to pick any of the provided services.
We consider that ve service providers oer the Medical

provider oers the Drug Service. Table 2 shows example
properties of available services based on data from [28].
The properties of the whole TAS system depend on the
choice of concrete service providers that process user requests.
For example, invoking S1andAS1will lead to the failure rate
TAS FR=S1FR+AS1FR= 0:36%, while invoking MS2 and
Dwill lead to the failure rate TAS FR=S2FR+DFR= 0:22%
The system requirements are the following:
R1. The average cost for invoking TAS service is set to 9 ¢
R2. The expected average response time is 30 time units
R3. Subject to R1 and R2, the failure rate of TAS should
be minimized.
Unlike the UUV case, the TAS is expected to run contin-
uously. The requirements R1-R3 and the properties of the
services may change at runtime and the system should adapt
accordingly. The adaptation task is to decide, for each re-
quest with a patient's vital parameters, which combination of
services to select such that the requirements are satised.
The TAS case is realized based on the TAS exemplar [27].
The results of SimCA applied to a TAS scenario are shown in
Figure 11. The adaptation works as intended: system outputs
follow the goal changes at k= 150 and 250, the optimal
solution is changed when S5 stops responding at k= 370. As
services in TAS fail randomly, the optimal value of fail rate
oscillates. However, on average (see the purple line on the
\Fail Rate" plot) it decreases from 0.37% to0.22% when
more resources are available to the application at k= 150 .
Note that SimCA manages to keep the failure rate low with a
more strict demand of response time from k= 250 onwards.The TAS case conrms the results obtained with the UUV
study. It supports the generality of the approach by showing
that SimCA is eective in adapting software systems indepen-
dent of concrete goals or software components that take part
in the adaptation.
5.6 Comparison of SimCA with AMOCS
Recently, [19] proposed an interesting approach for Au-
tomated Multi-Objective Control of Self-adaptive software
design (AMOCS in short). AMOCS automatically constructs
a system of cascaded controllers to deal with multiple goals.
Unfortunately, no replication package was available to quanti-
tatively compare AMOCS with SimCA. Therefore, we perform
a qualitative comparison based on the reported results.
Compared to SimCA, AMOCS has the advantage that it
does not require the extra optimization step with simplex.
Furthermore, the approach supports two schemes for ordering
goals: user-dened prioritization of goals, and automatic or-
dering where the controller automatically ranks goals based
on available actuators to achieve as many goals as possible.
However, SimCA's formal guarantees go signicantly beyond
these of AMOCS reported in [19]:
SimCA provides guarantees for robustness and steady-
state error; AMOCS' \robustness analysis is system-
dependent and unsuitable for an automated control
strategy" [19], while steady-state error is not analyzed.
Simplex provides optimal solutions, while AMOCS \uses
systematic or randomized exploration of solution sub-
space which introduces an approximation of the optimal
solution" [19].
AMOCS cannot provide guarantees for time-dependent
goals (such as the energy consumption goal in the UUV
case) because it does not take into account resources
spent on learning.
\Short overshoots are expected in AMOCS" [19]; SimCA
can avoid overshoots.
SimCA also provides important engineering support not
covered by AMOCS:
SimCA supports trading settling time with robustness
(pole placement). In AMOCS, settling time can just be
set based on domain characteristics.
Sampling and model learning is automated in SimCA.
AMOCS requires specialized knowledge and extra eorts
for this (e.g., quasi-Montecarlo and grid sampling [19]).
AMOCS \requires the number of knobs to be greater
than or equal to the number of goals" [19]. Finding
enough knobs may not be trivial or even be articial
(consider for example the TAS case).
In conclusion, SimCA contributes with a novel control-
based approach for satisfying multiple goals that signicantly
improves over AMOCS, both in terms of the guarantees it
provides and the engineering support it oers.
5.7 Threats to Validity
SimCA can handle one class of adaptation problems (sat-
isfying multiple goals, while optimizing one additional goal),
but this class of problems applies to a signicant number of
238systems, as illustrated with the cases used in this paper and
for example also those used in [19]. Supporting other types of
adaptation goals is subject of future work.
We used standard controller guarantees. In Section 4.1,
we provide an initial mapping of the controller guarantees
to software quality guarantees. However, additional research
is required both to rene and extend this mapping and to
understand the coverage of the guarantees that can be pro-
vided with the standard controller properties. We did not test
the impact of on the model quality/guarantees in dierent
operating environments; this could be a part of future work.
Regarding the scope of applicability of SimCA. First, the ap-
proach is not applicable to systems undergoing drastic changes
in their behavior at runtime as continuous re-identication is
very costly. Second, SimCA requires that goals can be quanti-
ed as a setpoint, which may not be easy for all properties;
an example is security. Third, in the experimental setting we
have used only some types of disturbances (e.g., sensor failures
and noise). Understanding the impact of other disturbance
on the adaptation properties of SimCA requires additional
evaluation. We want to highlight that in the current state of
the research in control-based software adaptation, it is di-
cult to outline precise criteria that delineate which systems
can/cannot be supported by SimCA (and other approaches
such as AMOCS). The study and empirical evaluation of new
approaches can contribute to build up this knowledge.
We evaluated SimCA in two domains, focusing on adaption
for a typical set of stakeholder requirements (resource usage,
performance, reliability, cost). While these systems can be
considered as representative instances of a signicant family
of contemporary software systems, additional evaluation is
required to validate SimCA for other types of systems.
Finally, we evaluated SimCA for simulated systems. This
is inline with the evaluation conducted by others such as [29,
28, 30]. However, further evaluation of SimCA is required to
conrm the evaluation results in real deployed systems.
6. RELATED WORK
The problem of handling multiple goals in self-adaptation
is obviously not new. Most of the existing research, including
those in architecture-based adaptation and linear program-
ming , solve this problem by introducing an optimization task
that trades o the conicting qualities looking for an optimal
solution. These solution uses many dierent techniques such
as preemption [31] to give preference to more time-critical
adaptation requirements, utility functions [32, 33, 34] to op-
timize component/service selection based on weights of QoS
criteria, estimates of performance models [35] to select ser-
vices with optimal response time, linear programming [36]
to deal with dierent operating environments and conicting
QoS requirements, or combine linear programming with local
search [37] to nd congurations with minimum cost, and
hybrid approaches [38] that rst decompose end-to-end QoS
constraints into local QoS constraints and then perform local
selections. Most of these approaches do not provide the broad
set of formal guarantees provided by SimCA. Furthermore,
the computational costs of most of the proposed solutions
grow exponentially with the size of the problem. SimCA can
rely on the scalability of simplex as shown in the evaluation.
An advanced example of an architecture-based solution is
the QoSMOS framework [27], which also uses the TAS exem-
plar for evaluation. QoSMOS employs runtime quantitative
verication to provide formal guarantees for satisfying multipleQoS goals, while optimizing cost. The control-theoretical guar-
antees provided by SimCA are out of focus in [28]. However,
the main dierence is that QoSMOS requires a set of tools that
need to be glued together to realize the feedback loop, while
with SimCA, the feedback loop is relatively straightforward
and derived automatically.
Besides [19], another approach that trades-o dierent
qualities and provides adaptation guarantees is presented
in [16] casting a discrete time Markov model for reliability
requirements to a dynamic system. The synthesized controller
trades reliability for cost by solving an optimization problem.
In [39], compared an initial version of SimCA with Activ-
FORMS [40], a formally founded architecture-based approach
for self-adaptation. The evaluation underlines the pros and
cons of both approaches in terms of robustness to disturbances
and types the guarantees that can be provided.
Simplex is a proven and practical optimization method [22].
Several variants have been developed for specic classes of
problems, e.g. [25]. Simplex and its variants do not require an
exponentially growing number of iterations when the problem
space increases and do not depend on the structure of equa-
tions. Today, Simplex remains a very popular optimization
method that is used in a wide variety of domains; recent exam-
ples are [34] where the method was used to support exploring
optimal controller parameters for complex industrial systems,
and [41] where simplex was used to support the exploration of
the large design space of a cyber-physical system architecture.
Another widespread method to solve optimization tasks is
called the interior point method. The choice of simplex over
the interior point method in SimCA was based on the scope
of the problem: the interior point method is faster but only
for specic (usually very large) problems [42].
[43] compared control-theoretical and optimization ap-
proaches, showing that continuous controller feedback oers
higher potential to meet system goals under constantly chang-
ing loads, and provides better settling time and less over-
shooting. Contrary to using either a control-theoretical or an
optimization approach, SimCA integrates the simplex opti-
mization method with a control-theoretic method (enhanced
version of PBM) to endow software systems with the self-
adaptive capabilities, exploiting the best of both worlds.
7. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we presented SimCA: a new approach that
allows building self-adaptive software systems that satisfy mul-
tiple goals, while reaching optimality with respect to an extra
goal. In addition, SimCA achieves robustness to environmen-
tal disturbances and measurement inaccuracy, and provides
guarantees for the adaptation results. The eectiveness of
SimCA was formally evaluated and demonstrated on two cases
with strict requirements.
SimCA contributes towards the application of formal tech-
niques to adapt the behavior of software systems, which is
one key approach for providing guarantees. At the same time,
by automatically building a control mechanism that adapts
the software, SimCA does not require a strong mathematical
background from a designer, which is a key aspect to pave the
way for software engineers to use the approach in practice.
In future research, we plan to study the impact of on
the model and extend SimCA to handle on the y adding
and removing goals. Our long term goal is to study and de-
velop reusable control-based adaptation solutions that provide
assurances for dierent types of goals.
