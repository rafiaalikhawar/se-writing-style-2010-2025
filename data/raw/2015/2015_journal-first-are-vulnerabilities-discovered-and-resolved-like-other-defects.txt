1 ABSTRACT
Context: Software defect data has long been used to drive soft-
ware development process improvement. If security defects (i.e.,
vulnerabilities)arediscoveredandresolvedbydifferentsoftware
developmentpracticesthannon-securitydefects,theknowledgeof
that distinction could be applied to drive process improvement.
Objective :Thegoalofthisresearchistosupporttechnicalleadersin
making security-specific software development process improvements
by analyzingthe differencesbetween thediscovery andresolution of
defects versus that of vulnerabilities.Method
: We extend Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) [ 1], a
schemeforclassifyingsoftwaredefectstosupportsoftwaredevel-
opment process improvement, to study process-related differences
betweenvulnerabilitiesanddefects,creatingODC+Vulnerabilities
(ODC+V).WeappliedODC+Vtoclassify583vulnerabilitiesand583
defectsacross133releasesofthreeopen-sourceprojects(Firefox,
phpMyAdmin, and Chrome).Results
: Compared with defects, vulnerabilities are found later in
the development cycle andare more likely to be resolvedthrough
changestoconditionallogic.InFirefox,vulnerabilitiesareresolved
33%morequicklythandefects.Fromaprocessimprovementper-
spective, these results indicate opportunities may exist for more
efficient vulnerability detection and resolution.
Figures 1 and 2 present the percentage of defects and vulnerabil-
ities found in each Activity for Firefox and phpMyAdmin, ordered

release. In these projects, pre-release effort in vulnerability and
defectdetectioncorrelateswithpre-releasevulnerabilityanddefect
resolution.Conclusion
: We found ODC+V’s property of associating vulnera-
bilityanddefectdiscoveryandresolutioneventswiththeirsoftwaredevelopmentprocesscontextshelpfulforgaininginsightintothree
open source software projects. The addition of the SecurityImpact
attribute,inparticular,broughtvisibilityintowhenthreattypesare
discovered during the development process. We would expect use
ofODC+V(andofbaseODC)periodicallyovertimetobehelpful
for steering software development projects toward their quality
assurance goals.
