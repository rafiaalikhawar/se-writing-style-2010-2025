ABSTRACT
ThisproposalisaboutastudywerecentlypublishedintheIEEE
Transaction of Software Engineering journal [4].
Context:Collaborative software engineering (CoSE) deals with
methods, processes and tools for enhancing collaboration, commu-
nication,andco-ordination(3C)amongteammembers[ 5].CoSE
can be employed to conceive different kinds of artifacts during
thedevelopmentandevolutionofsoftwaresystems.Forinstance,
when focusing onsoftware design, multiple stakeholderswith dif-
ferent expertise and responsibility collaborate on the system de-
sign.Model-DrivenSoftwareEngineering(MDSE)providessuitable
techniquesandtoolsforspecifying,manipulating,andanalyzing
modeling artifacts including metamodels, models, and transforma-
tions[1].CollaborativeMDSEconsistsofmethodsortechniquesin
which multiple stakeholders manage, collaborate, and are aware of
eachothers’workonasetofsharedmodels.AcollaborativeMDSE
approachiscomposedofthreemaincomplementarydimensions:(i)

themodels,(ii)asetofcollaborationmeans forallowinginvolved
stakeholderstoworkonthemodellingartifactscollaboratively,and
(iii) a set of communication means for allowing involved stake-
holderstoexchange,share,andcommunicateinformationwithin
the team. Collaborative MDSE is attracting several research efforts

standingexistingcollaborativeMDSEapproaches.Morespecifically,ourgoalistoassess(i)thekeycharacteristicsofcollaborativeMDSE

(iii)theinterestofresearchersincollaborativeMDSEapproaches
over time and their focus on the three dimensions of collaborative
MDSE.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3180155.3182543Method:In order to achieve this, we designed and conducted a sys-
tematicmappingstudy[ 6]oncollaborativeMDSE.Startingfrom
over 3,000 potentially relevant studies, we applied a rigorous selec-
tionprocedure[ 3]resultingin106selectedpapers,furtherclustered
into48primarystudies,alongatimespanofnineteenyears.Asuit-
able classification framework has been empirically defined and
rigorously applied for extracting key information from each se-
lectedstudy.Wecollated,summarized,andanalyzedextracteddata
by applying scientifically sound data synthesis techniques.
Results:In addition to a number of specific insights, our analysis
revealed the following key findings: (i) there is a growing scientific
interest on collaborative MDSE in the last years; (ii) multi-view
modeling, validation support, reuse, and branching are more rarely
covered withrespecttootheraspectsaboutcollaborativeMDSE;
(iii) different primary studies focus differently on individual dimen-
sionsofcollaborativeMDSE(i.e.,modelmanagement,collaboration,
andcommunication);(iv)mostapproachesarelanguage-specific,
with aprominence ofUML-based approaches;(v)few approaches
support the interplay between synchronous and asynchronous col-
laboration.
Conclusion: Thisstudygivesasolidfoundationforathoroughiden-
tificationandcomparisonofexistingandfutureapproachesforcol-laborativeMDSE[
