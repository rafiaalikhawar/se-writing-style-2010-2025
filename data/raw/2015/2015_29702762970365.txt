ABSTRACT
Mobile app reviews often contain useful user opinions like
bug reports or suggestions. However, looking for those opin-
ions manually in thousands of reviews is ineective and time-
consuming. In this paper, we propose PUMA, an auto-
mated, phrase-based approach to extract user opinions in
app reviews. Our approach includes a technique to extract
phrases in reviews using part-of-speech (PoS) templates; a
technique to cluster phrases having similar meanings (each
cluster is considered as a major user opinion); and a tech-
nique to monitor phrase clusters with negative sentiments
for their outbreaks over time. We used PUMA to study two
popular apps and found that it can reveal severe problems
of those apps reported in their user reviews.

1. INTRODUCTION
Millions of mobile apps are available on app markets, mak-
ing app development a highly competitive business. To at-
tract, retain, and improve users' satisfaction, app developers
are interested in user opinions about their apps. Fortunately,
app markets allow users to rate and write reviews about the
apps they use. Those user reviews often contain useful infor-
mation such as reports of bugs, suggestions of new features
or improvements, or simply praises or frustrations [2].
However, a popular app often receives thousands of re-
views each day and most of them do not contain information
useful for app developers [2]. Due to this large volume and
noisy nature of such reviews, reading and analyzing them
manually for relevant opinions is very ineective and time-
consuming. Therefore, researchers have proposed and de-

DOI: 10.1145/1235veloped many automated and semi-automated techniques to
analyze app reviews [5,8,17].
Most current approaches represent user opinions using sin-
gle words [2, 17]. For example, MARK detects and ranks
keywords frequently appearing in reviews with negative rat-
ings and allows users search for reviews with a specied
set of keywords. AR-Miner clusters reviews into dierent
topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Aspect
and Sentiment Unication Model (ASUM). However, single
words could only briey and loosely describe semantics and
sentiments of reviews. For example, if MARK reveals that
keyword " connect" appears frequently in negative reviews,
we could guess that users are complaining about some " con-
nection" issues. A phrase like " cannot connect to Facebook"
will inherently provide more useful information.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose PUMA, a novel ap-
proach to extract user opinions using phrases. PUMA con-
siders a phrase as a sequence of consecutive words corre-
sponding to a grammatically correct phrase, clause, or sen-
tence in English. The noun phrase " Facebook Messenger" ,
the verb phrase " kill my phone battery" , or the sentence " the
game app gets the wrong prole" are examples of phrases we
aim to extract in app reviews.
We could extract phrases directly by parsing the reviews
and collect word sequences correspondingly to phrase, clause,
or sentence structures in the resulted parse trees. However,
app reviews are often noisy, e.g. containing many typos and
grammar errors. Thus direct parsing would be inecient
and non-scalable to large amount of reviews. To avoid this
problem, PUMA uses Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags of words
rather than parse trees to extract phrases in user reviews.
The PoS tag of a word in a given sentence indicates its
functional type, e.g. whether it is used as a noun (NN),
averb (VB), a modal verb (MD), a determiner (DT), etc.
Given a word sequence, PoS tagging is the task to infer the
PoS tag for each of its words, which is clearly much easier
than parsing it. For example, PoS tagging the sentence " my
phone does not connect to Facebook" results in the PoS tag
sequence " PRP$ NN MD NOT VB TO NN" . Note that we
use the POS tags denition from Stanford POStagger [4].
Let us explain how PUMA uses PoS tags to extract phrases
via an example. First, we could observe that many valid
noun phrases contain two consecutive nouns, such as " net-
work connection" or" battery consumption" . That means, they
all have the tag sequence " NN NN" . Thus, if a word sequence
has the tag sequence " NN NN" , like " account prole" or" SMS
message" , it is likely a valid noun phrase.
Our phrase extraction technique has two phrases. First,

we mine the phrase templates , which are tag sequences fre-
quently appearing in valid phrases in a corpus of high qual-
ity product reviews from Amazon.com, like " NN NN" men-
tioned above. Then, we extract in mobile app reviews the
templated phrases , i.e. word sequences whose their tag se-
quences match the mined phrase templates .
The same opinion can be expressed by dierent phrases
having similar meanings. For example, " Internet connection"
has similar meaning to " network access" , or" connect to Inter-
net". Thus, it would be more convenient to analysts of app
reviews to group similar phrases. To do that in PUMA, we
have proposed a new similarity measure for phrases based
on the similarity of single words appearing in those phrases,
which in turn is computed based on vector-based represen-
tation of those words (word embedding). Then we imple-
mented a soft clustering algorithm to group phrases based
such similarity measurements between them.
After extracting and clustering phrases, PUMA can rank
the resulted clusters of similar phrases based on their asso-
ciations with the ratings of reviews. Thus, it can discover
phrases frequently appearing in negative reviews, which likely
indicate some complaints or issues that make users unhappy.
PUMA can also monitor the occurrences of resulted clusters
of similar phrases over time. Thus, it can help app develop-
ers to identify issues or complaints that are currently aect
a lot of users.
In short, our contributions in this work include:
1. A new phrase extraction approach using phrase templates
2. A new similarity measurement to estimate phrase simi-
larity using vector representation of words.
3. New techniques to cluster, rank, and track groups of
similar phrases overtime.
We organized the remaining of this paper the following.
Section 2 describes our approach in details. Section 3 presents
preliminary evaluation results of our approach. Section 4
discusses related work and section 5 concludes this paper.2. APPROACH
In this section, we present our approach PUMA in de-
tails. Figure 1 illustrates its main components and data
ow. As seen in the gure, PUMA mines phrase template
from a corpus of high quality product reviews from Ama-
zon.com. After mining, it fetches the raw app reviews from
app markets and uses MARK tool [18] to pre-process them.
After that, it extracts phrases in the pre-processed reviews
using phrase templates that we have mined. Then, it clus-
ters the extracted phrases into groups with similar meanings
and consider each group to express a major opinion. Finally,
PUMA rank and monitor those groups over time. We now
discuss the details of each component.
2.1 Preprocessing
PUMA uses MARK [17] to pre-process both the raw app
reviews and the product reviews from Amazon.com. MARK
pre-processor has a customized word stemmer to convert En-
glish words into its base form without being over-stemmed.
It can also correct errors, typos, slang words, acronyms and
abbreviations typically appear in reviews of mobile apps.
2.2 Mining Phrase Templates
In our approach, a phrase template is a sequence of PoS
tags corresponding to a large number of valid (i.e. grammat-
ically correct) phrases in English, such as "NN NN" (noun
phrases containing two nouns). To mine those phrase tem-
plates, we collected a corpus of 200,000 high quality reviews
of products in Amazon.com [10]. We mine phrase template
from this dataset instead of mining directly from reviews of
mobile apps because we expect the product reviews in Ama-
zon.com to be better in grammar and spelling (i.e. less noisy
than mobile app reviews), while having the expressions and
writing styles of user reviews.
After pre-processing the collected reviews, PUMA parsed
them using Stanford Parser [4]. For each resulted parse tree,
727it located the sub-tree for a phrases, a clause, or a sentence
and counted its corresponding tag sequence. After counting,
we only kept sequences that have at least 20 counts and have
length of at most 8.
We observe in the review data that some functional words
(e.g. connectors, intensiers, negators) have the same POS
tag but lead to very dierent meanings. For example, both
" and" and " but" are tagged as Coordinating Conjunction (CC).
Therefore, we obtained a list of functional words from several
English websites123so we can keep those functional words
instead of replacing them with their PoS tags. For example,
"bread and butter" will correspond to the tag sequence
"NN and NN" , not"NN CC NN" .
We also investigated the mined phrase templates manually
and removed ones that obviously do not make sense, such
as ending with \but" or\and" . Finally, we have more than
90,000 phrase templates. Although parsing Amazon reviews,
counting tag sequences of valid phrases, and validating the
resulted sequences manually are time-consuming, we only
need to do it once.
2.3 Extracting Templated Phrases
Figure 2 illustrates the algorithm in PUMA to extract
phrases using the mined phrase templates. It rst separates
a review into sentences. For each sentence, it uses a PoS
tagger to produce the corresponding tag sequence. Then,
it collects all word sequence in that sentence whose tag se-
quence matches a mined phrase template. If a word sequence
is collected, all its sub-sequences are disregarded. In addi-
tion, sequences containing only stop words are also ltered
because they would not express any useful opinion.
PUMA also performs some reductions to increase the gen-
erality of the extracted phrases. First, some modal verbs like
\do",\can" ,\will" , etc. would not contribute signicantly to
the meanings of phrases containing them. Thus, PUMA re-
places them with their PoS tag \MD" . As MARK, PUMA
only keeps verbs, nouns, and additionally adjectives com-
monly used to describe user sentiments, e.g. intrusive ,unre-
liable . All other words, e.g. possessive adjectives and pro-
nouns like \my",\yours" ,\our" , etc. are replaced by their PoS
tags. Table 1 provides some examples of the phrase tem-
plates, the actual phrases in reviews and the nal templated
phrases after extraction and reductions.
2.4 Clustering Phrases
Users' opinions can change over time after each bug x
or update. Therefore, monitoring the major problems/opin-
ions and discover new ones is an important task for app
developers. The simplest way to monitor these opinions is
to track the occurrences overtime of the phrases expressing
such opinions. However, an opinion could be described in
many ways, or in other words, many phrases could describe
the same opinion. Because there are many phrases having
the same meanings, thus, trying to list similar phrases man-
ually for tracking would be time-consuming. It is better to
extract phrases from reviews and cluster them into more
coherent topics for tracking.

2.4.1 Phrase Similarity
Our clustering algorithm requires a reliable method to
compute the similarity or distance between the templated
phrases. However, we could not nd a well-established tech-
nique in the literature for that task. Lin et al. [14] propose to
use Point-wise Mutual Information to nd the feature vector
of each phrase based on their co-occurrence with other words
in the same context. Mikolov et al. [15] proposed word2vec
tool with a similar intention of nding context vector for
words or phrases. However, both approaches suer from the
fact that our templated phrases can be too long (e.g. can
contain up to 8 words) and the average length of a review
can be very short (our dataset of 1.8 million reviews has an
average of 11.24 words per review). Sometimes, the phrase
can be as long as a whole sentence, or even a review. Thus,
the methods of nding context based on co-occurrence of
words is not applicable for our phrases.
To address this limitation, we propose our own technique
to compute similarity between two phrases using vector rep-
resentation of words from word2vec. Our technique con-
siders two phrases as two bags of word of size mandn.
First, it greedily nds the pairs of words iin our phrases
that has highest vector similarity (measured by cosine sim-
ilarity). Similarity of two phrase would then be equal to
the average similarity of these pairs times with the modied
Jaccard similarity of the two bags of word. This Jaccard
similarity considers all paired words to be in the intersection
set instead of only identical words. This modication favors
phrases of similar lengths. The following formula shows how
we calculate such similarity:
phraseSim (a;b) =Pk
i=1i
n+m k
k: number of word pairs 
a;b: two phrases that have the number of word nand
m, respectively.
: similarity of a pair of words.
2.4.2 Soft Clustering
The Soft Clustering algorithm uses the templated phrase 's
vectors as shown in algorithm 3.
In each iteration, the algorithm does the following steps:
(1) Starting: choose a starting phrase with highest nega-
tive sentimental score in the pool of available phrases S. The
negative sentimental score is the same contrast score we used
in MARK [17]. The negative sentimental score can also be

modied to positive sentimental score simply by changing
negative ratings for positive ratings.
(2) Expanding: Choose a phrase Lwith the closest Cosine
Similarity to the centroid of chosen phrases, given that the
distance is no more than a threshold mu. Stop expanding
when there is no phrase left to chose in the pool, or a K
number of phrase in cluster is reached.
(3) Releasing: Release top percents of the chosen phrases
closest to centroid from phrase pool for the next iteration.
This step helps allocating phrases with dierent meanings
in dierent context to all clusters they belongs, hence the
name Soft Clustering .
Each of the nal clusters represents a topic that users are
talking about. We rank them by the sum of negative sen-
timental score of each phrase within them by month. This
way, analysts can nd out which problems have changed
their ranking over time. Moreover, they can narrow down
the list of reviews they need to read.
Our case studies in section 3.2 show that our tracking
approach can catch real problems for the studied apps.
3. EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate our phrase-based approach on
the ability to track real-life problems. The rst subsection
discusses about our review data used for this evaluation. In
the second subsection, we show 2 case studies resulted from
our clustering and tracking of opinions.
3.1 Data
The dataset we prepared for our evaluation is showed on
Table 2. We have crawled nearly three millions of reviews
from 120 mobile apps on Google Play from January 1, 2015
to September 1, 2015. Each crawled review contains the cre-
ation time, the reviewer ID, a title, a long text description of
the review content, and the associated rating. The crawling
process is the same as in MARK [17]. We need all 120 appsTable 2: Statistics of collected data

for just two case studies is because the more apps we use,
the more general templated phrases we can extract.
This data was passed to MARK for preprocessing, and
then we extracted templated phrases on it. However, due
to the messy nature of app reviews, even our MARK cus-
tom spelling correction could not correct all words. This
left some strange misspelled words inside the cleansed re-
views. Stanford POS tagger sometime label those words as
foreign words or some other POS tags did not appeared in
the Amazon review text dataset. Therefore, we were only
able to extract templated phrases with a threshold of at least
3 occurrence on 1.8 millions reviews. This can be improved
with a better spelling corrector and a more extensive set of
phrase templates in the future. For the purpose of evaluat-
ing our approach, we used this 1.8 millions reviews dataset
through out this evaluations.
3.2 Case Studies For Problem Tracking
By applying the opinion tracking technique in section 2.4,
we were able to discover many interesting clusters for various
mobile apps. Further investigations on 2 problems discov-
ered by our technique for 2 dierent categories of app showed
us that our technique can discover real major user opinion-
s/problems. The following sub-sections shows our nding
forCandy Crush Saga ,Facebook Messenger :
3.2.1 Facebook Connection in Candy Crush Saga
We detected a cluster of phrases related to the complaint
\cannot connect to Facebook" that has an abnormal increase
in frequency on February, 2015 (Figure 4. Some example
phrases are shown in Table 4). Investigation on this com-
plaint showed that starting from February 1, 2015, all games
from King (developers of Candy Crush Saga) cannot connect
to the login system using Facebook4 5. Since this happened
to all games, not just this game, it could be a back-end
systems problem. Even though we have never got an o-
cial announcement from King regarding this problem. The
number of complaints was going down on the next month,
which was likely because developers had xed it.
3.2.2 Battery consumption in Facebook Messenger
Similar to our nding in prior work MARK [17], we also
found a cluster dedicated to \battery draining" problem on

senger noticed a signicant loss in their battery power and
started complaining about it. On the same day, Facebook
developers conrmed it was a syncing problem with their
app and released a new update to x it6.
This is an interesting nding since MARK [18] was a semi-
automated tool, which means we had to use human inter-
vention to nd this problem. However, the soft clustering
approach can automatically discover it.
3.3 Threat To Validity
There are two threats to validity of our evaluation pro-
cess. The rst is, we only applied our process on 1.8 mil-
lions reviews of 120 apps. Therefore, the apps used in this
research might not be representative. To address this threat,
we made our data publicly available when requested to en-
courage researchers to replicate and extend our experiments.
The second is, our approach cannot extract opinions cor-
responding to textual expressions that were not extracted
from Amazon reviews dataset.
4. PRIOR AND RELATED WORKS
In the recent years, researchers had answered quite a few
interesting questions about app reviews. As of 2014, Hamad
Khalid [11] [13] found that there are at least 12 types of
user complaints present in mobile app reviews by manu-
ally inspecting 6,390 reviews from iOS apps. Guzman and
Maalej [7] used Topic modeling techniques to group extracted
features from reviews and found users' sentiments for them.
Another study was conducted by Khalid et al. [12] with re-
views is to explore the correlation between them and the
devices that the app is running on, then use this informa-
tion to help Quality Assurance prioritize their eort. Wano

and Lio found out that review styles are dierent for each
category in their research [19].
More into this trend, researchers found that app reviews
could contain many valuable information. A number of re-
cent researches have focused on extracting such information
such as the work of Iacob et al. [8] that extract feature re-
quests from reviews. In the same year (2013), Carreno et
al.[6] also proposed a way to extract changed or new re-
quirements for next versions of the app from user feedbacks.
Following the trend, Fu et al. [5] proposed Wiscom, a tool
that can discover inconsistencies in reviews, identify why an
app is being liked or disliked, and provide some users' major
concerns and preferences of dierent types of apps.
In 2014, Iacob et al. [9] introduced the next version of
MARA to extract relevant information such as feature re-
quests and bug reports. AR-Miner [2] from Chen et al. was
the rst framework to extract informative user reviews then
group and rank them.
While some researchers study mobile app reviews in gen-
eral, some others prefer to target specic needs and concerns
that are expressed in the reviews. For instant, Chen et al. [3]
made a study about the unreliable maturity content ratings
for mobile apps on Android market and Apple store. They
discovered that these ratings can be not accurate and incon-
sistent with the published policies. Security and Privacy is-
sues were extracted by Cen et al. [1] using a two dimensional
labeling system. Palomba et al. [16] developed CRYSTAL to
nd traceability link between code changes and app reviews
to analyze how reviews aect development process.
However, mining user opinion using a phrase-based ap-
proach was not mentioned in prior works.The most similar
work to our research is our prior work with MARK frame-
work [17]. In this work, we use keyword-based approach as
a mean to discover user opinions. However, using keywords
alone cannot express as many sentiment levels as the phrases
because of their abstract nature. Without phrase-based ap-
proach, currently there is no method to show a complete
730user opinion using only keyword.
5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We proposed a novel phrase-based approach for user opin-
ions discovering in mobile app reviews. Our approach in-
cludes: (1) a phrase extraction process to extract templated
phrases from reviews (2) an user opinions tracking tech-
niques using phrases. Moreover, for phrase extraction, we
have semi-manually developed a dataset of 90125 phrase
templates for extracting user reviews.
We also conducted a preliminary evaluation of our ap-
proach on 2 case studies of real-life problems, showing that
it can automatically detect major user opinions and support
developers in understanding them.
For future development, we plan to conduct more exper-
iments to: compare the eectiveness of our approach with
the parsing approach on a reasonable-sized dataset; com-
pare the explanation power of single word approach to our
phrase-based approach; discover newly introduced problems
on several popular apps and contact developers to verify if
our approach really helps them discovering problems. More-
over, we intent to develop a technique that can automati-
cally highlight the important opinions on actual reviews to
support developers on the reading task using our approach.
