ABSTRACT
Wepresentaprocessdriventestautomationsolutionwhichenables
delegating(partof)automationtasksfromtestautomationengineer
(expensive resource) to test analyst (non-developer, less expensive).
In our approach, a test automation engineer implements test steps
(or actions) which are executed automatically. Such automated test
steps represent user actions in the system under test and specified
by a natural language which is understandable by a non-technical
person. Then, a test analyst with a domain knowledge organizes
automated steps combined with test input to create an automated
test case. It should be emphasized that the test analyst does not
need to possess programming skills to create, modify or execute
automated test cases. We refine benchmark test automation archi-
tecture to be better suitable for an effective separation and sharing
of responsibilities between the test automation engineer (with cod-
ing skills) and test analyst (with a domain knowledge). In addition,
we propose a metricto empirically estimate cooperation between

1 INTRODUCTION
Time to market, quicker feedbacks from end-users, risk of large
changes and similarfactors push companies andorganizations to-
wards continuous or more often software product releases. Testing
isanessentialpartofanysoftwaredevelopmentlifecyclemodel[ 9].
Consequently, suchfrequentdeliveries havedirect impactontest
activity. This is especially true for regression testing due to its
naturalgrowthbecausetoday’stestingofanewfeaturebecomes
tomorrow’s regression test. To cope with increasing demand on
frequent testing, usually with limited resources, test automation is
animportantstrategytoaddressthischallenge.However,fromone
hand,atestautomationisneithersimplenorstraightforward[ 4].
In addition to the process adjustment, it requires a set of high
technical skills, important of which is the ability of writing a com-
puter code. On the other hand, usually a test automation engineer
whopossesseshighprogrammingskillswithatesting-mindsetis
scarcer, when compared to a typical test analyst (functional tester)
who does not need to have programming experience or a technical
background.

while using the system. Examples of a test step can be "signing

automated steps combined with test input to create an automated
test case. It should be emphasized that the test analyst does not
need to possess programming skills to create, update or execute
automated test cases. We refine benchmark test automation archi-
tecture to be better suitable for effective separation and sharing of

propose a metric to empirically estimate impact of test automation
engineer’s work on the work of test analyst. We implement and
apply our test automation concept on real-world web application,
namely automating regression test of national e-health Internet
portal in Norway – Helsenorge [5].

tasks without depending on others than team members.

in 2011 [5]. In 2017 on average it had over 1.5 million visits per
month[3].Helsenorgeisintendedtobeasingle"point-of-entry"to
electronic health services for residents. It consists of two parts,namely public and private. The public part is open for all andcontains general information about diseases, treatments, patient

An authenticated individual can see his or her health-related

is expected to double number of main releases which consequently
will increase test activity. Until introducing the test automation,
significantamountofregressiontestbedonHelsenorgehasbeen
carried out manually. However, with increased number of software
releases and testing iterations, achieving required level of test cov-
erage with continuation of manual testing effort appeared to be
unfeasible. We apply automation on Helsenorge’s execution of re-
gression test. Our test automation targets mainly private part of
the portal Helsenorge.
2.3 Roles and Teams
We have defined two main roles within our automation concept,
namely test automation engineer (TAE) who possesses program-
mingskillsandtestanalyst(TA)whodoesnotneedtohavecoding
experience.Softwaredevelopmentlife-cyclemodelofHelsenorge
follows the Agile methodology [ 2]. Currently, Helsenorge consists
offiveSCRUMteamswhicharelistedinTable 1.Eachteamconsists
typically of a product owner, SCRUM Master, several programmers
and one or two TAs (i.e. team testers). A TA is a full member of
thedevelopmentteam with100%-timededicationwhereasTAE is

roles.
Helsenorge development teams are self-organizing and cross-
functionalSCRUMteams.Self-organizationmeansthattheteam
itself decides how best to accomplish its work rather than being
instructedbyothers outsidetheteam[ 11].Cross-functionalteam
possesses all the skills that are necessary for the team to complete
its tasks [11].
3 TEST AUTOMATION SOLUTION
3.1 Architecture
Figure2depicts generic test automation architecture (TAA) pro-
posed by International Software Testing Qualification Board [ 1].
A drawback with this architecture is placing Test Data and Test
Library components at the same level. We expect that managing
TestDatacomponentdoesnotrequireprogrammingskillsifone
hasadomainknowledge,whereasformanagingTestScriptcom-
ponent, one must have programming knowledge. So, Test Data
andTestScriptcomponentscanberesponsibilityofTAandTAE,
respectively.
We refine this generic TAA and propose new architecture for
Helsenorge which is shown in Figure 3. As it can be seen from this
Figure 2: Generic test automation architecture by Interna-
tional Software Testing Qualification Board [1].
figure, in our architecture test generation layer is omitted since
we manually carry out the test design and have not yet developed
a model for Helsenorge. However, we introduce a new layer for
testimplementationtomakeeasierseparationofresponsibilities
betweenTAEandTAroles.InourarchitectureTAisresponsiblefor
testdefinitionandtestexecutionlayerswhileTAEisresponsible
for test implementation and test adaptation layers. As it can be
seenfromthefigures,unlikegenericTAAinourarchitecturewe
movedTestLibraryfromtestdefinitionlayertotestimplementation
layer. This enables Test Data to be managed by TA whereas Test

We use Microsoft’s Team Foundation Server (TFS) as a configu-

subsequent subsections.
3.2 Test Implementation Layer

automatically, and is responsible for maintenance of library of test
scripts.Anautomatedstepisspecifiedasastructuredexpression

Storing standaloneautomated steps isnot so meaningfulthere-
fore they are organized into ATC by TAE. We have defined two
categoriesofATC,namelytemplateoneandordinaryone.TAEcre-
ates and implements template ATCs that also serve as a repository
ofautomatedteststeps.TAcreatesordinaryATCsusingautomated
test steps from the template ATCs.
3.3 Test Definition Layer
AttestdefinitionlayerTAcreatesnewATCusingautomatedtest
stepscreatedinpreviouslayerbyTAE.Usually,conventional(man-
ual) test cases specify expected outcome in each step. This enables
TAto be aware whatwill happen after executionof each step and
thencompareactualandexpectedoutcomes.However,inourATC,
we do not specify expected outcome in every step since we do not
compare outcome in every step but rather have one explicit step
for verifying expected outcome of the whole ATC. It is designed
sobecausefailureofcomparisoninacurrenttest step ignoresex-
ecution of the rest of the test steps in the ATC. In short, a single

input is an integral part of test case which helps TA to create more
familiar (not very different from manual test cases), readable (in
termsofbusinessprocess)andself-descriptiveautomatedtestcases.
In fact, the same test management tool (i.e. TFS) is used both for
manual and automated test cases. Test inputs can be specified both
as a value and as a variable. For example, in one ATC a test step
canbeinputtedwithvaluewhileinanotherATCthesameteststep

way they want to specify input, e.g. depending on repeatability of

twosetsoftestinput,whileATCinFigure 6iterates(runs)once.In
general, an ATC can be iterated with any number of test inputs.
3.4 Test Execution Layer
TA is responsible for arranging set of ATCs into test suites, exe-
cuting them and observing test execution report. Test suites are
executeddaily atspecified timeor canbe triggeredon demandby
TA. However, the task of failure analysis is a shared responsibility
betweenTAandTAE.Sourceoffailurecanbedifferent:defectin
SUT (primary we are interested in), error in test environment (e.g.
a service is down), outdated test script or test data and so on. Ifexecution of ATC fails then at first TA attempts to analyze and
investigate failure. If TA cannot determine the failure reason, only
then TAE starts failureanalysis and investigation, see Figure 7for
this workflow. By letting first TA to analyze and possibly partially
or fully resolve failures, we avoid TAE to be a “bottle-neck” in the

process. For TA to analyze independently it is important to report
meaningful error messages when a failure occurs.
3.5 Test Adaptation Layer
At this layer TAE implements test interface at which ATC shall
interact with Helsenorge. Once this layer is completed, usually
it does not require further modifications unless new interactionlevel is necessary to implement. Most of the manual test cases
thatTAshavecreatedrunatGraphicalUserInterface(GUI)level.
However, we have chosen to apply test automation at the REST
(REpresentationalStateTransfer)service[ 7]level,sinceelements
on GUI tends to be changed frequently. Although our approach
maynotdetectGUIspecificbugs,itprovidesopportunityforTAto
create ATC that can discover back-end defects by bypassing front-
end validation. TA can create the so called negative ATC which
tests SUT with unexpected (illegal or incorrect) inputs and verifies
relevant error messages are reported. Such back-end defects are
difficultorimpossibletodiscoverbymanualGUItests.Forinstance,
in Helsenorge portal the valid health region codes are 1 and 2.
Figure8shows an example of negative ATC which attempts to set
theregioncodetosomeinvalidvalues(i.e.11,-2and0).Thelast
step in this ATC verifies that the correct error message is reported.

the user to select the values other than 1 or 2 for health region.

4 TEST CREATION EFFICIENCY
4.1 Automation Phases with and without Test
Artifacts
Intermsofmeasurabletestartifacts,workonthetestautomation
can be divided into two phases, the ones that generate (explicit):
(1) Measurable test artifacts
(2) Non-measurable test artifacts.
InourarchitecturefromFigure 3anautomationworkonthetest
implementation,testdefinitionandtestexecutionlayersproduce
measurable test artifacts. It means at these layers one can ask ques-tionssuchas,howmanyautomatedteststeps,automatedtestcases
or test execution reports are implemented, created, or produced,respectively. However , the automation work on test adaptation
layer does not produce any direct test artifact. A test adaptationlayer produces a test code that enables interaction with SUT but
no explicit test artifacts that TA can reuse or work with.

5 BENEFITS, LESSONS LEARNED AND
LIMITATIONS
The work on designing, architecture, implementation and deploy-
ment of test automation solution for Helsenorge started early in
2017. Consequently, benefits, limitations, lessons and findings pre-
sentedinthispaperarethosewehaveexperiencedsofar.However,
we plan to observe and collect further experiences and findings
which we will report in future publications.
5.1 Benefits
The followings are the main benefits we achieved using our ap-
proach:

tion,thegreatestbenefitsthatweachievedwere,notsurpris-

Helsenorge’s service areas which are available via autho-
rization (to give access to another person). Test scenarios
ofallpossiblecombinationsofthisfeatureare32.Asingle
ATC is created to iterate over all these 32 combinations. Ac-
cording to the TA in POT team, it takes about 5 minutes
forhertomanuallytestoneiterationofthisfeature.How-
ever, automatic execution of one iteration takes about 14-15
seconds.
•Better cross-functional teams. Anotherimportantbenefitof
ourapproachwasitscontributiontowardsbettercross-functionaldevelopment teams. Cross-functional team has all necessaryskillstoaccomplishitstaskwithoutdependingonothersnot
partoftheteam[ 11].Incaseoftestingtasks,TA(whoisa
full member of the development team) can be also in charge
of test automation because independently he or she can
–create a new ATC,
–update existing ATCs,
–organize ATC into test suites,
–manage execution of test suites and analyze test report.
Thus,TA’sautomationworkdoesnotdependonTAE’swork
aslongasrequiredteststepsareautomated(i.e.implemented
by TAE). In addition, being able to independently carry out
atest automationmay helpTAinbetter estimatingtesting
tasks during work (sprint) planning.
•Negative tests. As it was pointed out, our approach enables
creating negative ATC with illegal or incorrect test inputs
that verify fail-safe scenario of the system (see for example
Figure8).Infact,weplantoincreasethenumberofnegative
ATCaswebelievemanyback-enddefectscanbedetected
by bypassing front-end validations which are not feasible
via manual GUI tests.
5.2 Lessons Learned
Thefollowingisashortsummaryofthemainlessonslearnedfrom
our experience:
•Understand before code. TAEshouldhaveaholisticperspec-
tive to design and implement efficient (reusable) automated
test steps. He or she needs to have a good understanding of
functionality and interdependencies among various parts of
the SUT before commencing to write a test code. It is also
importantachoiceoflanguageformulationforspecificationofateststepthatadequatelyreflectsSUTfunctionality.This
is especially true for frequently used test steps which are
sharedandusedbyseveralteams.Otherwise,itmayresult
in several implementation iterations or code duplication for
the same or similar functionality. Therefore, good collabora-
tionbetweenTAEanddevelopmentteams,especiallyTAs,
is essential.
•Always have maintenance perspective. Almost every test
task can be automated and test managers may have high
expectationswithrespecttoautomation.However,testau-
tomation is not a one-time job, it is a continuous processand therefore maintainability is essential. In fact, mainte-
nanceofATCcanbechallengingandfailuresourceofmany
test automation projects [ 6,10]. Consequently, TAE shallevaluate every test automation task not only from the im-
plementationperspective(short-termgoal)butalsointerms
of maintainability (long-term goal). If maintenance effort of
the task appears to outperform its automation benefits then
it shall not be automated. Our approach enabled delegating
partofmaintenanceefforttoTA(e.g.updatingATC,man-aging test data). This is important because of minimizing
riskof"bottle-necks"intheprocessduetolimitednumber
of TAE resources in the organization. In addition, to haveeffective maintenance one must create guidelines both for
TAEandTA,forexampleonhowATCswillbeimplemented,
created, updated and eventually removed; and criteria for
selecting test tasks for automation.
•Inform managers about non-measurable phases.
Projectandtestmanagersshallbeinformedandawareabout
automation phases that do not produce explicit measurable
testartifacts.Otherwise,theymaygetawrongimpression
thatthetestautomationworkisnotprogressingasexpected.
•Tool unification. It is desirable to have the same manage-
ment tool for both manual and automated test cases as well
as for requirements. This simplifies automatic generationof various test execution and test coverage reports. Oth-erwise, one needs to estimate additional work for TA to
(manually)synchronize/combinetestreportsformanualand
automated test execution from two separate sources and
maintaintraceabilitybetweentestcasesandrequirements
(possibly) manually.
5.3 Limitation and Opportunities for Future
Work
Below is the list of some main limitation and opportunities for
future work:
•Tool limitation. Several limitations that we came across dur-
ingimplementationwereintrinsictothetestmanagement
tool i.e. TFS. One of them was not being able to control exe-
cutionorderoftheATCswithinatestsuiteotherwiseone
could create more compact test suites to achieve the samelevel of test coverage. Another functionality that the tool
could provide is an automatic suggestion of test steps while
TA typing the first letters or words of the test case. This
could help to avoid false negatives due to spelling errors in
the test step language.
•Automated test data generation. Inourapproach,TAmanu-
allyupdatesATCwithtestdata.Althoughmanuallyupdating
or editing test input in an ATC is easy and straightforward,
itcanbetedioustaskwhenthenumberofATCstoupdate
is large. In addition, it may take time for TA to find test data
withtherequiredcharacteristics(e.g.findingatestperson
which has a child with digital GP or electronic prescription).
We investigate possibility to automate updating test data in
ATC i.e. automating test data generation.
•Automated test case generation. In our approach, creation
of automated test cases is performed manually. If SUT ismodified in a way that requires a modification of existing
ATCs then it creates extra work for TA to edit or even re-
createthemmanually.However,availabilityofSUTmodel

fromwhereATCscanbegeneratedautomaticallywillreduce
this work. For instance, after SUT changes, only its model isupdatedandthentestcasesaregeneratedautomaticallyfrom
the model. We plan to investigate possibility to develop a
model of Helsenorge for automated generation of test cases.
6 CONCLUSION
Weproposedatestautomationsolutionwhichwasimplemented
by using process driven test automation. It has been applied and
still in operation on a large web application of electronic health
services in Norway (Helsenorge.no) which has over one million
visits per month. Our solution enabled moving (part of) test au-
tomation tasks from test automation engineer with coding skills
(expensiveresource)totestanalystwithdomainknowledge(less
expensive knowledge). Besides expected benefits of saved man-ual testing effort and improved test coverage, another importantadvantage of our approach is that it contributed towards better
cross-functional development teams. This enables a test analyst to
independently carry out necessary test automation activities. Such
activities include creating new or updating existing automated test
cases, executing them, and analyzing test report. An important
lesson we have learned is that a test automation engineer needs to
haveagoodunderstandingoffunctionalityandinterdependenceof
the system to implement efficient automated test steps (i.e. under-
standing before coding). In addition, the test automation engineer
should always remember maintainability aspect while considering
automation of the test task.
Asoftoday,Helsenorgehas139automatedtestcases,andtest
creation efficiency ratio is 0.48 which means almost 1/3 of 139testcasesarecreatedbytestanalystswhiletherestiscreatedby
the test automation engineer. Our experience indicates promising
results,andweplantoapplytheapproachonotherproductsand
development teams within our organization.
