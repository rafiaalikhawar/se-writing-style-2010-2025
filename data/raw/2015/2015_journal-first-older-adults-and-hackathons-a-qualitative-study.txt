ABSTRACT
Globally observed trends in aging indicate that older adults con-
stitute a growing share of the population and an increasing de-
mographicinthemoderntechnologiesmarketplace.Therefore,it
has become important to address the issue of participation of older
adultsintheprocessofdevelopingsolutionssuitablefortheirgroup.
In this study, we approached this topic by organizing a hackathon
involving teams of young programmers and older adult partici-
pants. In our paper we describe a case study of that hackathon, in
whichour objectivewasto motivate olderadultsto participatein
softwareengineeringprocesses.Basedonourresultsfromanarray
of qualitative methods, we propose a set of good practices thatmay lead to improved older adult participation in similar events
andanimprovedprocessofdevelopingappsthattargetolderadults.
In our case study we wanted to analyze how the inclusion of
older adults in development teams would affect team performance.
Basedonourpreviousstudies[ 1,3]wewereinterestedinthesocial
effects of such cooperation, as well as how it would affect software
development. In order to measure these effects, we have used an
arrayofbothqualitativeandquantitativeresearchtools.Withinthehackathon setting, we created favorable conditions for cooperationofdevelopersandolderadults.However,weallowedforanorganic
emergence of the nature of cooperation between the developers
and older adults.
The most important findings from our study concern the use
of three kinds of typical interaction scenarios that differ in their
involvement of older adults. These are: 1. Isolation of Older Adults
(noinvolvementofolderadults,useofstereotypesbydevelopers);2.
Older Adults as Consultants (ad-hoc involvement of older adults in
various projects); 3. Full Cooperation (comprehensive involvement
ofolderadultsinideageneration,aswellasevaluationstageofa

Cooperation” scenario - most valuable from the point of view of
participatory design theory - is not always chosen. Either of the
twosidescandecidetonotcooperatefullywiththeother,resulting
in the“Isolation” or“Consultant” scenarios.We also observed the
role of stereotypes and attitude changes of hackathon participants.
Stereotypesareresponsibleforsomedevelopers’decisionsnotto

ingsclearlydemonstratethatdirectinteractionreducesnegative
stereotypes and improves positive intergenerational attitudes.
Another very important finding from our research confirms the
positive effect of direct involvement on the quality of applications
developedinthehackathon.However,wehaveobservedseveral
factorsthataffecttheinvolvementofolderadults.Generallyspeak-ing, it is not enough to just invite older adults to participate and be
physically present during the software design process. The most
important discovered factors that affect the nature of participation
ofolderadultsinthedevelopmentprocessare:1.Establishingini-
tialrapportbetweentheparticipants;2.Olderadults’self-esteem
is a critical aspect; 3. Collaborative motivation. (Unlike youngerparticipants, the older adults were less competitively driven and
more fair and kind in their interactions).
Basedontheobservationswemadeduringthiscasestudy,we
identified some good practices that will enhance the quality ofhackathons in which older adults are involved e.g.: 1. Mind the
space (a location familiar to the participating older adults); 2 Keep
themin touch(both juniorand olderadults participants mustnot
be left to their own devices without any guidance); 3. Take intoaccount different collaboration strategies; 4. Encourage user in-
volvement (provide supervision and mentoring with respect to the
participatory design process and optimizing user experience); 5.
Change typical hackathon schedule and scope (shorten to one-day

encouraging the use of live mockups). Full description of the study
