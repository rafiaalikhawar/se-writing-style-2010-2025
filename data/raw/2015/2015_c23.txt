ABSTRACT
Mobile app developers constantly monitor feedback in user
reviews with the goal of improving their mobile apps and
better meeting user expectations. Thus, automated ap-
proaches have been proposed in literature with the aim of
reducing the eort required for analyzing feedback contained
in user reviews via automatic classication/prioritization ac-
cording to specic topics. In this paper, we introduce SURF
(Summarizer of UserReviews Feedback), a novel approach
to condense the enormous amount of information that de-
velopers of popular apps have to manage due to user feed-
back received on a daily basis. SURF relies on a conceptual
model for capturing user needs useful for developers per-
forming maintenance and evolution tasks. Then it uses so-
phisticated summarisation techniques for summarizing thou-
sands of reviews and generating an interactive, structured
and condensed agenda of recommended software changes.
We performed an end-to-end evaluation of SURF on user
reviews of 17 mobile apps (5 of them developed by Sony
Mobile), involving 23 developers and researchers in total.
Results demonstrate high accuracy of SURF in summariz-
ing reviews and the usefulness of the recommended changes.
In evaluating our approach we found that SURF helps de-
velopers in better understanding user needs, substantially
reducing the time required by developers compared to man-
ually analyzing user (change) requests and planning future
software changes.

1. INTRODUCTION
User feedback plays a paramount role in the development
and maintenance of mobile applications. The experience an
end-user has with the app is a key concern when creating and
maintaining a successful product. Consequently, developer

end-users during the evolution of their software [19,46].
On distribution platforms such as the Apple Store and
Google Play, users can leave plain text reviews for the apps
they install and use. These reviews may not only contain
simple sentiments ( e.g., \Great app!"), but they can pro-
vide valuable information regarding several topics that are
highly relevant to the development and maintenance of the
app [17,28]. In particular, user reviews may include (i) bugs
or issues that need to be xed [28] (ii) summaries of the
user experience with certain features [10] (iii) requests for
enhancements [15], and (iv) ideas for new features [8, 28].
However, existing app distribution platforms provide lim-
ited support for developers to systematically lter, aggre-
gate and classify user feedback to derive requirements [1].
Moreover, manually reading each user review to gather use-
ful feedback is not feasible considering that popular apps
receive hundreds of reviews every day [20,28].
For this reason automated approaches have been proposed
in literature with the aim of reducing the eort required to
analyze feedback contained in user reviews [5,7{11,15,16,22,
27,29,47]. However, most of them only perform a classica-
tion (or prioritization) of user reviews according to specic
topics ( e.g., bugs, enhancements, etc.) [8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 22,
27, 32], without reducing the amount of reviews and infor-
mation developers have to deal with, which is very large for
popular apps. To the best of our knowledge, no approach is
able to, at the same time, (i) determine for a large number
of reviews the specic topic discussed in the review ( e.g., UI
improvements, security/licensing issues, etc.), (ii) identify
the maintenance task to perform for addressing the request
stated in the review ( e.g., bug xing, feature enhancement,
etc.), and (iii) present such information in the form of a con-
densed, interactive and structured agenda of recommended
software changes , which is actionable for developers.
We argue that combining topic extraction, intention clas-
sication and the ability to synthesize well dened mainte-
nance tasks regarding specic aspects of an app will con-
cretely help developers in planning further software changes
and meeting market requirements.
Paper contribution. The contributions of our paper are
summarized as follows:
we rst dene URM (UserReviews Model), a two-
level classication model which takes into account both
theusers' intentions (when giving feedback to devel-
opers) and the review topic , which is the specic aspect
of the app covered by the review;
we introduce SURF (Summarizer of UserReviewFeedback), a novel approach, built on top of URM ,
to automatically generate summaries of users feedback
with the aim of helping developers better understand-
ing user needs. SURF exploits summarization tech-
niques to summarize thousands of user reviews and
generate an interactive ,structured andcondensed agenda
of recommended software changes .
we conduct an empirical study involving 12 develop-
ers/engineers from companies in Switzerland, Italy and
the Netherlands and 11 developers/engineers from the
development team of Sony Mobile in Japan, to inves-
tigate the practical usefulness of summaries generated
bySURF in the developers' \working context";
we make publicly available in a replication package12
with (i) material and working data sets of our study,
(ii) complete results of the survey, (iii) raw data (for
replication purposes and to support future studies),
and (iv) the prototypical implementation of SURF .
2. APPROACH
In this section, we detail URM andSURF , the model
and approach we use for synthetizing app reviews.
2.1 The User Reviews Model
URM aims to model informative paragraphs [32] contained
in app reviews from a software maintenance and evolution
perspective along two orthogonal dimensions:
1.User intention : modeling the user's goals when writing
a review ( e.g.,Is the reviewer requesting a new feature or
reporting a bug? ).
2.Review topic : capturing the specic topic covered by
the review ( e.g.,Is the writer discussing the user interface
or a pricing issue? ).
Previous app review content classication attempts [11,
18, 28] have seen limited adoption by researchers because
they consider just one of these twocomplimentary dimen-
sions. In recent work [32] we introduced a taxonomy that
classies app review content into categories relevant for soft-
ware maintenance and evolution, namely feature request,
problem discovery, information seeking, information giving
and other . However, this one dimensional classication re-
sults in an insucient leverage of the available review in-
formation, because, for example, having a huge amount of
reviews classied as feature requests is of limited use to de-
velopers trying to distill actionable tasks.
For this reason, URM aims to enrich and complement the
preliminarily classication described in Table 1 by identify-
ing the specic topic of each review. In the rest of the paper
we refer to the aspects of an app targeted by a review as
thereview topics . To determine a complete set of review
topics, we analyzed 1390 reviews present in the dataset of
our previous work [32]. Thus, we split the dataset in two
parts: (i) a training set T training containing 438 randomly
selected reviews and (ii) a test set T testcontaining the re-
maining 952 reviews. Then, starting from an empty list of
topics Ltopics , two authors of the paper performed a manual
labeling of each sentence contained in T training (we work
at sentence level since dierent sentences in the same review
can contain dierent kinds of feedback). During the labeling
process, when a sentence did not match any of the dened
topics, a new topic was added to the topic list Ltopics , and

Information Giving Sentences that inform other
users or developers about some
aspect of the app.
Information Seeking Sentences describing attempts
to obtain information or help
from other users or developers.
Feature Request Sentences expressing ideas,
suggestions or needs for
enhancing the app.
Problem Discovery Sentences reporting unex-
pected behavior or issues.
Other Sentences not belonging to any
of the previous categories.
the two validators went through all the previously labeled
sentences to see whether it is more appropriate to tag some
of them with the newly dened topic. Vice versa, if a re-
view sentence matched an already dened topic in Ltopics ,
the sentence was simply tagged with that topic. Since a
review sentence can refer to more than one topic (a user
can ask to improve the UI and in the same sentence request
a bug x related to stability of the app), some sentences
were tagged with multiple labels. At the end of this pro-
cess, a preliminary set of 33 topics was dened3. Then,
we merged (or clustered) together review topics that are se-
mantically related, and that can generate redundancies and
overlaps in the recommended software changes. After this
process, we obtained a set of 12 topic clusters , detailed in
Table 2. However, a more accurate process for investigat-
ing/removing possible overlaps in the resulting clusters is
part of our future agenda.
Table 2: Topic Clusters
Cluster Description
App sentences related to the entire app, e.g.,
generic crash reports, ratings, or general feed-
back
GUI sentences related to the Graphical User Inter-
face or the look and feel of the app
Contents sentences related to the content of the app
Pricing sentences related to app pricing

tionality of the app
Improvement sentences related to explicit enhancement re-
quests

to personal data privacy
Download sentences containing feedback about the app
download
Model sentences reporting feedback about specic de-
vices or OS versions
Company sentences containing feedback related to the
company/team which develops the app
URM assigns to each review sentence one of the intention
categories (detailed in Table 1) and one or more app topic
clusters (dened in Table 2). For instance, the example sen-
tence \I love this app but it crashes my whole iPad and it has
to restart itself." will be classied as a Problem Discovery
involving the App andModel topics, since it reveals that the
user is experiencing an app crash while she is using a specic
device ( i.e., iPad).
2.2 The SURF approach
SURF automatically (i) extracts the topics treated in re-
views, (ii) classies the intention of the writers, to suggest
the specic kinds of maintenance tasks developers have to
accomplish, and (iii) groups together sentences covering the
same topic. Figure 1 depicts an overview of the SURF pro-
cess activities, which we detail in the following sections.
3http://www.i.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/SURF/APPENDIX.
pdfFigure 1: The SURF process
2.2.1 Data Collection
The most common app distribution platforms are hetero-
geneous with regard to how reviews are posted, and they col-
lect data in dierent kinds of data structures. For this reason
we designed a data exchange format for collecting informa-
tion that is potentially useful to developers and software an-
alysts for maintaining and evolving apps. Specically, since
XML is particularly well suited for data where eld lengths
are unknown and unpredictable and where eld contents are
mainly text, we developed an XML data exchange schema
for representing review data from multiple sources. For each
user review, it stores: (i) the date on which the review has
been posted, (ii) the (star) rating given by the reviewer,
(iii) the handle of the user who posted the review, (iv) the
version of the app, (v) the title of the review, and (vi) the
review text itself. The output of the Data Collection phase
of SURF is a homogenized collection of reviews for each app
in a well dened XML format.
2.2.2 Intention Classiﬁcation
SURF employs an approach we previously dened to au-
tomatically mine reviewer intentions [32]. Such an Intent
Classifier combines Natural Language Parsing (NLP), Sen-
timent Analysis (SA) and Text Analysis (TA) techniques
through a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for detecting
sentences in user reviews that are important from a mainte-
nance perspective (see Table 1). To help other researchers
replicate the analysis performed in this step of SURF we
make available online4the Java version of our Intent Clas-
sifier , already used by some developers in Germany5.
2.2.3 Topics Classiﬁcation
As discussed in Section 2.2, one of the aims of SURF is to
group sentences involving similar review topics (see Table 2).
In this step, SURF automatically associates one or more con-
cepts illustrated in Table 2 to each review sentence.
Denition of concept dictionaries. We argue that
discovering relevant keywords associated with the concepts
reported in Table 2 represents a crucial information for bet-
ter understanding relationships between concepts and in-
formative user reviews . Thus, two authors of the paper
(separately) labeled each of the sentences in T training (see
Section 2.1) with keywords that, in their opinion, led to
the assignment of a review topic to the sentence. E.g., the
keywords \orientation" and \button" can indicate that the
sentence deals with the application's GUI. We conjecture
that on top of such a labeled dataset it is possible to dene
anNLP classier able to determine the aliation of a user
4http://www.i.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/ARdoc.html
5http://bsautermeister.blogspot.ch/2015/12/
app-reviews-zu-powernapp-dienen-als.htmlreview with specic topics . Afterwards, the two raters dis-
cussed their keyword assignments as well as possible discrep-
ancies and nally created, for each concept, a nal collection
of keywords (and n-grams).
To make the dictionaries more exhaustive we used Word-
Net [24] to generate synonyms for all the keywords. How-
ever, to obtain dictionaries having a good balance between
exhaustiveness and coherency, we added the synonyms that
are, according to the Wu & Palmer semantic relatedness
(WUP) [48], at least 50% equal to the original set of key-
words. Among all the semantic relatedness metrics, we se-
lected this particular measure because it presents an upper
limit ( i.e., it is dened between 0 and 1) [48]. More for-
mally, given an ontology O ( i.e., WordNet) made by a set of
nodes C and a root node R, establishing a threshold of 0.5
to the Wu & Palmer metric means that the least common
subsumer ( i.e., the nearest common node) between C 1and
C2(i.e., the two nodes of the ontology for which we would
compute the semantic relatedness) must have a distance N
from the root node at least equal to a quarter of the sum
of the distances N 1and N 2(i.e., the distances between the
root node R and the nodes C 1and C 2, respectively):
WUP =2N
N1+N20:5 =)NN1+N2
4(1)
Oracle denition. Once the dictionaries were enriched
with WordNet synonyms, one of the authors and an exter-
nal validator (a software engineer with more than 6 years
of industrial experience) separately assigned each sentence
inTtest(described in Section 2.1) to one or more of the
12 dened concepts. For 851 of these sentences, the two
raters assigned the same labels ( i.e., inter-rater agreement
89.39%). For the remaining 101 sentences the two raters as-
signed dierent labels: 70% of them were sentences belong-
ing to multiple concepts and the raters decided to consider
both their respective suggested labels as correct; for 30% of
these sentences the raters were in disagreement. However,
after a separate discussion, they reached an agreement on
the nal labeling. The manual labelling of each of the 952
sentences in T testconstitutes our oracle for evaluating the
NLP classier described in the next paragraph.
Automatic concept identication. We built an NLP
classier to automatically assign a sentence in a review to
one or more concepts (see Table 2). As rst step we stemmed
each sentence using the Snowball Stemmer Algorithm [34] to
reduce words to their root form. Thus, we built the classier
on top of the concept-related dictionaries (i.e.,the concepts
dictionaries dened in the previous sub-steps) to assign to
each sentence in a review the probability to belong to one
or more concepts. More formally, let S and C be a sentence
and a concept respectively; let WCbe the number of tokens
inSthat also appear in the list of C-related keywords ( i.e.,
the concepts dictionary ofCdened in one of the previous
sub-steps); let WSbe the total number of token in S, the
NLP classier computes the probability that S falls in the
concept C as:
P(S;C)=WC
WS(2)
To avoid cases in which sentences are erroneously assigned
to a concept C because they contain just one word also ap-
pearing in the C-related keyword list, the topic classier
assigns to S all the concepts for which P (S;C)is greater than
0.05 ( i.e., 5%). We evaluated the eectiveness of the NLP
classier comparing the labels assigned by the classier withthe labels assigned in the human oracle dened in the pre-
vious sub-step ( i.e.,oracle denition ). The eectiveness of
the classier was evaluated relying on widely adopted met-
rics in the information retrieval eld [2]: precision, recall
and F-measure. The NLP classier performed very well the
sentences assignment to topics achieving a global recall of
0.79, a global precision of 0.73, and a global F-measure of
0.76 (seeTable 3). Hence, we used such an NLP classier in
this Topic Classication step of SURF.
2.2.4 Sentence Scoring and Extraction
SURF uses a sentence selection and scoring mechanism to
generate the summaries which is based on the following ob-
servations:
(Obs1). Maintenance feedback rst : user feedback discussing
bug reports and feature requests are more impor-
tant for developers than all others review types.
(Obs2). Review topics : developers need reasonably useful
sentences discussing a specic aspect of an app with
respect to other review sentences.
(Obs3). Review length : longer sentences are usually more
informative than shorter ones.
(Obs4). Popular features : reviews treating frequently dis-
cussed features may attract more attention of de-
velopers than reviews dealing with features or func-
tionalities rarely used or discussed by users.
The heuristics dened in this section are calibrated by us-
ing reviews of the dataset described in Section 2.1 and vali-
dated by two authors of the paper and an external validator
(a software engineer with more than 6 years of industrial
experience).
Initial clustering and preprocessing. First, we needed
to lter out useless sentences and to cluster the remaining
ones according to their review topics. In particular, we dis-
carded all sentences with less than 3 tokens ( e.g.,\Good
app", \Great feature", etc. ), which rarely provide useful in-
formation for developers. Then, we cluster sentences be-
longing to the same review topic and we remove duplicated
in the summary by applying the following process:
a. All the sentences are preprocessed applying the Snowball
Stemming algorithm [34] and stop-words removal.
b. For each pair of sentences (S i,Sj), we compute the dupli-
cate tokens rate (DTR i;j) through the formula:
DTR i;j=DTi;j
TWj(3)
where DT i;jis the number of duplicate tokens appearing
both in S iand S j; TW iand TW jare the total number
of tokens in S iand S jrespectively

ii.Sjis removed, otherwise
(b) If TWj5 and DTR i;j>0:85 =)

Scoring phase. We assign a global score GS (S;C)to each
sentence S with respect to a topic C using the equation:
GS(S;C)=IRS SP(S;C)[LS(1 +MFWR (S;C))] (4)
where, the partial scores IRS S,P(S;C),LS, andMFWR (S;C)
corresponds to our four observations, i.e, Obs1-Obs4. The
rst partial score IRS Stakes into account our Obs1: it as-
signs to each sentence San initial score on the basis of its
intention category assigned during the classication step.
Specically, we statically provide dierent relevance scores
to each of the intention categories dened in Table 1, which
are reported for completeness in Table 4. While other rele-
vance scores could be used, a systematic study on the impact
of dierent scores is part of our future agenda. However, we
did not observed any variation of the quality of the generated
summaries using dierent scores. The second partial score
P(S;C)is the probability of a sentence S to be relevant for
a given topic C, previously dened in section Section 2.2.3.
Thus, it is used to deal with Obs2. Indeed, if a sentence S
share many words with the list of C-related keywords, then,
Sis highly related to Cresulting in a higher score. Ac-
cording to Obs3, longer sentences are more useful, thus, the
length has to be incorporated in GS (S;C). To this aim, we use
the third partial score LS, which denotes the total number
of characters constituting the sentence S. Finally, for each
sentence S belonging to the topic C, we compute the most
frequent words rate, i.e., MFWR (S;C), to take into account
our Obs4. In particular, MFWR (S;C)measures the ratio of
frequent words appearing in the sentence (MFR (S;C)) with
respect of the number of total words in the sentence (TW S):
MFWR (S;C)=MFR (S;C)
TWS(5)
Sentences belonging to each of the 12 topics reported in
Table 2 are ranked through the scoring function GS(S;C)in
equation 4. However, only sentences in the top positions of
the ranked list are selected. More formally, let NSCbe the
number of total scored sentences for the topic C, the sen-
tences occupying the rst 0 :7NSCpositions in the ranked
list ( i.e., about 2/3 of total sentences) are extracted for fur-
ther processing, while the remaining sentences, occupying
the last 0 :3NSCpositions, are discarded.
2.2.5 Summary Generation
We needed to nd a proper way to present the mined
review sentences to developers such that they can (i) easily
retrieve the necessary information, (ii) properly understand
the maintenance tasks to accomplish, and (iii) identify which
parts of the app to change. To handle this, we decided to
generate summaries as structured HTML since it represents
the right compromise between compactness, informativeness
and usability. Indeed, using this format the summaries can
be easily reported in a hierarchical way, giving to developersFigure 2: An extract of summary for Stone Flood
control over paths of browsing the information that can be
progressively expanded at multiple levels of detail.
In this step, SURF summarizes the sentences collected
from user reviews (pre-processed and scored in the previ-
ous steps) via clusterization , i.e., grouping them according
to their review topics and intention categories. In partic-
ular, it performs a two-level clustering: rst it groups the
sentences according to their topics ( e.g., App, GUI, etc.)
leveraging on the GS (S;C)scores computed in the previous
SURF step; then, sentences in each topic are grouped by
intention categories, which were assigned during the inten-
tion classication step. Finally, groups in the second level
are ordered as follows: we rst show all the BUGS (i.e., the
sentences classied as Problem Discovery ), then all the RE-
QUESTS (i.e.,Feature Request ), then all the QUESTIONS
(i.e.,Information Seeking ) and nally all the INFO (i.e., all
the sentences classied as Information Giving and Other ).
Moreover, when clicking on each of the sentences reported
in the summary, a popup presents to developers the original
review from which the specic sentence has been extracted,
including app version, user handle, date, star rating, title
and the full text. SURF also uses explicitly labels with
the belonging semantic category ( i.e.,BUG, REQUEST,
QUESTION, orINFO ) with the aim at helping develop-
ers in planning and accomplishing specic maintenance task
(e.g., implementation of new functionality). Finally, in order
to further increase the readability of the summaries, SURF
shows a maximum of ten sentences for the INFO category,
i.e., only the ten sentences most frequently reported by users
in the reviews (highest GS (S;C)score).
Figure 2 depicts an extract of the summary for the app
Stone Flood (the complete summary can be found online6).
In particular, Figure 2 reports two feedbacks (extracted from
app reviews) that could be benecial for developers inter-
ested in xing bugs experienced by users (points 2 and 3 in
Figure 2) in the UI (point 1 in Figure 2) of the app.
3. STUDY DESIGN
The goal of our study is to investigate to what extent
the summaries generated by SURF help developers in bet-
ter understanding user needs and planning future software
changes. Specically, we measure usefulness in the con-
text of a working scenario in which 23 developers and re-
searchers analyzed user feedback contained in user reviews
relying on SURF with the goal of identifying feedback useful
from a software maintenance perspective (see Section 3.2).
The quality focus concerns the capability of developers to
collect useful user feedback when supported by summariza-
tion tools. The perspective is that of researchers interested
in evaluating the eectiveness of automatic approaches for
user feedback summarization when applied in a real work-
ing context. We therefore designed our study to answer the
following research questions (RQs):
RQ1: IsURM a robust and suitable model for repre-

summary.zipTable 5: Dataset
senting user needs in meaningful maintenance tasks for
developers? Our rst goal is to verify whether devel-
opers consider URM an enough robust and suitable
framework to model users' needs in terms of software
maintenance tasks.
RQ2: To what extent does a summarization technique
developed on top of URM help mobile developers bet-
ter understand the users' needs? We want to assess
whether SURF facilitates the analysis of user feedback
by developers. Thus, starting from the general RQ2
we derive two further sub-questions that need to be
answered to qualitatively and quantitatively measure
the practical usefulness of SURF and the impact of its
generated summaries in the developers' working con-
text:
{ RQ2-a: How do app review summaries generated
bySURF impact the time required by developers to
analyze user reviews?
{ RQ2-b: How do developers perceive (or consider)
the app review summaries generated by SURF in
terms of correctness, content adequacy, concise-
ness, and expressiveness?
3.1 Context
As shown in Table 5 the context of our study consists of
3439 reviews from 17 dierent apps, belonging to 9 dierent
app categories and mined from 4 dierent online platforms.
The reviews are extracted, for each app, in a period of be-
tween June 1st, 2015 and January 1st, 2016. In order to
evaluate SURF in a real working context, Sony Mobile pro-
vided us with access to the Google+ beta test pages of 5
apps ( i.e., Lifelog Beta, TrackID Beta, Sketch Beta, Movie
Creator Beta, Video Beta) used by developers to collect feed-
back by beta testers about new functionalities. Table 5 re-
ports the main information of all the apps considered in our
study: (i) the app name, (ii) the app category, (iii) the plat-
forms from which reviews have been gathered, and (iv) the
number of reviews. For each user review involved in our
study, we collected the title, comment and posting date, theauthor's nickname, the version of the app to which the re-
view is referring, and the star rating. It is important to
highlight that both SURF and URM have been dened re-
lying on app reviews contained in a dierent dataset from
the one used for answer our research questions. Specically,
URM and SURF was dened and calibrated on reviews of
the dataset described in Section 2.1 while the evaluation of
both URM and SURF was performed considering reviews of
the dataset described in Table 5.
3.2 Analysis Method
To answer RQ1 andRQ2 , we performed two experiments
involving developers, testers, managers and researchers from
the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy and Japan (in total 23
participants) asking them to complete a survey7to eval-
uate: (i) the suitability and robustness ofURM (RQ1),
(ii) the practical usefulness ofSURF in a real working envi-
ronment and how it can speed up the process of collecting
useful review feedback (RQ2-a) and (iii) the quality of the
summaries generated by SURF according to 4 widely known
dimensions [25,33,43] (RQ2-b):
1.Correctness , which measures the accuracy of the au-
tomated classication made by SURF
2.Content adequacy , which assesses whether SURF gen-
erates summaries containing all important information
to understand user needs
3.Conciseness , which assesses whether SURF generates
summaries not containing any superuous and unneeded
information
4.Expressiveness , which assesses whether SURF pro-
duces summaries that are easy to read and whether
the way they are presented facilitates the understand-
ing of the user needs
Table 6 summarizes the questions in our survey. We de-
signed two experiments: the rst mainly aims at assessing
the quality of extracted feedback and the meaningfulness
thereof for developers, while the second aims to investigate
the practical usefulness of SURF's summaries in a working
environment when compared to the analysis of app reviews
without the support of the summaries.
Experiment I . To evaluate SURF we rst generated the
summaries of reviews on 15 apps: Picturex, PowernAPP,
CSTP, BLINQ, Doodle Pairs, Karaoke SingMe FreeLite,
Karaoke SingMe, Minesweeper Reloaded, Sheep-O-Block,
Stone Flood, Weight Track, Wi File Transfer, Movie Cre-
ator Beta, Video Beta, and TrackId Beta. Then we con-
tacted all the original developers of each of the selected apps
and asked them to complete the survey and evaluate the
summaries generated by SURF. Initially, all of the origi-
nal developers of such apps conrmed their availability to
participate in our study. However, in the end, only six of
them were actually able to participate. Consequently, for
the remaining apps, we asked other developers (or experts)
to evaluate the usefulness of SURF's summaries. Thus, for
this rst experiment we involved 16 participants in total. 6
of them are the original developers of ve applications con-
sidered in our dataset ( i.e., Picturex, PowernAPP, CSTP,
Movie Creator Beta, and Video Beta) while of the others,
4 are researchers in the eld of software engineering and 6
are software developers employed in Italian, Swiss, Dutch
and Japanese companies. We assigned to each participant
7http://www.i.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/SURF/Survey.pdfTable 6: Survey Questions
an app (except for the six original developers involved in
our study) and provided the corresponding summaries gen-
erated by SURF. After that we explained to the participants
the tasks to be performed during the experiment ( i.e., how
to browse the summaries and validate them) and asked them
to answer the questions of our survey.
Experiment II . The second is a controlled experiment
involving 7 participants, all employed at Sony Mobile. The
survey participants had the following proles: (i) test en-
gineers who do not program but deal with bug db ( e.g.,
Bugzilla), (ii) device driver engineers who have never worked
with applications, (iii) product project managers who care
about software requirements, deadlines, and people work-
load, and (iv) team managers who evaluate technical per-
formance. The summaries enrolled in this experiment are
regarding the user reviews of two Sony Mobile' apps (Lifelog
Beta and Sketch Beta). The data of the reviews was col-
lected from specic Google+ pages of Sony Mobile.
We rst separated the participants in two groups: Group
1 (3 subjects) and Group 2 (4 subjects). Then we performed
two sub-experiments: Experiment II-A and Experiment II-
B. During the Experiment II-A, Group 1 analyzed the orig-
inal reviews contained in the Google+ page of Lifelog Beta
trying to manually extract useful feedback and to classify
it according to Tables 1 and 2. Meanwhile, Group 2 ana-
lyzed the original reviews contained in the Google+ page of
Sketch Beta in the same fashion. Likewise, during Experi-
ment II-B, Group 1 analyzed the summary of Sketch Beta's
reviews generated by SURF, with the purpose of validat-
ing its content, while Group 2 validated the Lifelog Beta's
summary. The time for the entire Experiment II was of
30 minutes (depending on the availability of Sony Mobile'
participants): (i) 5 minutes for explaining the purpose of
the study, sharing the materials and grouping participants
in Group 1 and Group 2, (ii) 10 minutes for experiment II-
A and experiment II-B, and (iii) 15 minutes for answering
the questionnaire. The short time was necessary to remove
the inuence of confounding factors (e.g., collaboration with
colleagues, access to the web) and have high condence in
the (exclusive) impact of our method on the task's outcome.Table 7: Classication Accuracy
We plan to replicate our experiments involving developers
of further apps, performing longer evaluation tasks.
For each task, the participants reported the number of
reviews they analyzed and classied during Experiments II-
A and II-B and answered the questions of our survey.
3.3 Research Method
In order to assess the suitability and the robustness of
URM and answer RQ1 we asked the survey participants to
rank the categories of reviews reported in the summaries (Q7
in Table 6) and to also suggest possibly missing categories
(Q7.1 in Table 6).
To answer RQ2-a we asked the survey participants to
report the time required for performing the validation of
summaries we provided (Q2 in Table 6) and to express their
opinion on the speed-up introduced by the summary in an-
alyzing the user feedback (Q6 in Table 6). To qualitatively
complement this quantitative information we also asked re-
spondents to judge the usefulness and the comprehensibility
of the provided summaries (Q3 in Table 6), and to pro-
vide their opinion on any diculties when analyzing the user
feedback in the reviews WITH or WITHOUT the provided
summary (Q4 and Q5 in Table 6).
Finally, to answer RQ2-b we asked survey participants
to manually validate the classication correctness of data
contained in the summaries (Q1 in Table 6) and provide
their opinion on (i) the content adequacy (Q9 of Table 6),
(ii) the conciseness (Q10 of Table 6), and (iii) the expressive-
ness (Q12 of Table 6). We complement this data by asking
survey respondents for their opinion on the statement in Q8
of Table 6 and for a general judgment on the usefulness of
the summarization approach in a real working context (Q13
in Table 6).
4. RESULTS
4.1 RQ1 Results
To answer RQ1, we analyzed replies collected from survey
participants of both experiments.
78.26% (18 out of 23) of participants declared that URM
is not missing any relevant information and that the topics
considered in URM are exhaustive, or maybe even too de-
tailed ( i.e., just one participant complained about the num-
ber of topics in the model: \. . . don't need many categories, 3 -
5 categories are enough. . . " ). The remaining feedback com-
prised proposals to (i) discriminate change requests between
adaptive and corrective maintenance, (ii) add a raging cus-
tomers category, (iii) introduce an advertisement category,
(iv) add a topic dealing with \the connection to external de-
vices" , and (v) insert a topic treating the \comparison with
other apps" .
Since the aim of our work is to facilitate the extraction
of useful feedback from a maintenance perspective, we be-lieve that the raging customers andadvertisement categories
would not add valuable information for developers, while the
other suggestions can be considered for future improvements
of the model.
From a software development perspective participants con-
sidered the most important topics highlighted by URM to
be: (i) the App(82.61% of participants ranked it in the rst
three positions), (ii) the GUI (60.87% of participants ranked
it in the rst three positions), and (iii) the Feature or Func-
tionality (34.78% of participants ranked it in the rst three
positions). Vice versa, the topics considered least important
are (i) the Company (69.57% of participants ranked it in
the last three positions), (ii) the Model (65.22% of partici-
pants ranked it in the last three positions), and (iii) Down-
load (52.17% of participants ranked it in the last three posi-
tions). A possible explanation for these ranking results may
be related to the fact that app developers are more con-
cerned with collecting functional requirements rather than
non-functional ones. Survey respondents also considered the
intention classication of sentences that URM provides to
be very interesting. For instance, some participants say
that \. . . I found the classication GUI-BUG, APP-BUG,
etc very useful. . . ", \. . . in case I'm searching for BUGs,
I can just look for the category, instead of reading every-
thing over and over again. . . ", \. . . categorization of reviews
with a summary is very helpful to me. Especially the cate-
gories/topics related to bugs, crashes and security issues. . . " .
In summary, we can conclude that:
RQ1 According to the developers' judgment URM has
shown to be robust and suitable enough for representing
user needs in meaningful maintenance tasks and to be us-
able in practical contexts. The most important topics mod-
eled in URM are the App, GUI and Feature or Function-
ality categories.
4.2 RQ2 Results
4.2.1 RQ2-a Results
Experiment I results. Survey participants spent, on
average, 28 minutes and 12 seconds for browsing and vali-
dating the summaries. 93.75% (15 out of 16) of participants
considered our approach time-saving: 75% (12 out of 16) of
survey respondents replied that SURF allows them to save
at least one third of the time that they would otherwise
have spent on manually collecting and analyzing user re-
views. Among these 12 participants, 9 subjects (75%) claim
that, with the summaries, the saved time ranges between
50% and 95%, while 18.75% (3 out of 16) of participants
armed that our approach allows to save 10%-20% of time.
Only one subject stated that summaries do not allow to save
any time. We noticed that among the apps having less than
100 reviews, 67% (6 out of 9) of subjects declared that our
approach allows to save more than 50% of time, but amongTable 8: Aggregated answers from participants
the apps having more than 100 reviews we observe a degra-
dation of this result. Indeed, for such apps the subjects who
claim 50% as the saved time are just 3 out of 7 (47%). A
possible explanation for this degradation could reside in the
fact that, for apps with more reviews, SURF generates longer
summaries which need more time to be read and analyzed
and this could inuence the perception of the real gain of
time enabled through the approach.
These results are related to the time saving capability of
SURF perceived by developers . However, this measure is
fairly subjective and a more quantitative evaluation is re-
quired. Thus, in order to avoid a biased estimation of these
results, we discuss the validation times declared by the sub-
jects in the survey (Q2 in Table 6) and compare them with
the execution times required by SURF to generate the sum-
maries. The execution times have been measured through
a 32-bit Intel Celeron Dual-Core CPU T3500 2.10 GHz ma-
chine with 2 GB DDR3 RAM running Windows 7. On aver-
age the tool spent about 1.05 seconds per review. Indeed, for
analyzing each app, that in average has 220 reviews, SURF
requires an average execution time of 3 minutes and 51 sec-
onds. The 15 summaries involved in Experiment I contain,
in total, 1737 sentences and each summary contains, on av-
erage, around 116 sentences. Considering that the average
number of sentences is 116, survey participants spent an av-
erage validation time of 14.59 seconds per sentence (since
the average validation time in the experiment is 28 min-
utes and 12 seconds). This means that, when supported
by SURF, a developer spent, for extracting, analyzing and
validating each user feedback an average total time of 15.64
seconds ( i.e., 14.59 seconds + 1.05 seconds). Guzman et
al.[10] demonstrated that, for a ne-grained manual analy-
sis of 900 user reviews, in the best case, developers spent 8
hours. We can infer that validators in [10] spent an average
time of 32 seconds for analyzing each user review feedback.
Thus, when supported by SURF, the time required by devel-
opers for analyzing each user feedback decreases by at least
51.12% (from 32 to 15.64 seconds).
From a qualitatively point of view, 87.50% of subjects con-
sidered the provided summaries highly/enough useful and
comprehensible (see Q3 in Table 8) and 62.50% of partic-
ipants armed that analyzing user feedback with the pro-
vided summaries is easy (see Q4 in Table 8).

empirically conrm most of the results obtained in Exper-
iment I. However, contrary to Experiment I, only 3 out 7
participants (42.86%) declared that our approach allows to
save 30%-50% of time. In this case the time saving capa-
bility of SURF perceived by developers is, again, subjective
and a more quantitative evaluation is needed. We notice
that in Experiment II-A, when analyzing user feedback us-
ing Google+ pages during a time slot of 5 minutes, each
of the subjects extracted, on average, 5.86 feedbacks use-
ful for software maintenance. Vice versa, in Experiment II-
B, when analyzing user feedback using SURF's summaries,
in the same time, subjects extracted in average many more
feedbacks, i.e., 16.57 instead of 5.86. This means that for ex-
tracting a single useful feedback without the summaries, the
participants spent, on average, 51.19 seconds, while for ana-
lyzing (and validating) a single feedback extracted through
SURF, the subjects spent, on average, 18.10 seconds. For
the two apps involved in the Experiment II ( i.e., Lifelog Beta
and Sketch Beta) there were, in total, 259 user reviews and
the tool had a total execution time of 10 minutes and 58 sec-
onds for generating the two summaries. Thus, considering
that, in this experiment, the average execution time required
by the tool for each review is 2.54 seconds, we can conclude
that when supported by SURF the time required by par-
ticipants for extracting (and analyzing) each user feedback
decreases from 51.19 to 20.64 (18.10 + 2.54) seconds, i.e.,
59.68%.
It's important to highlight that 27 out of 41 ( i.e., 66%) of
feedbacks manually extracted by subjects also appear in the
summaries automatically generated by SURF. In summary,
we can conclude that:
RQ2-a Developers consider the summaries generated by
SURF useful (manually extracted feedback appears also in
the automatic generated summaries) and comprehensible.
SURF helps to prevent more than half of the time required
by developers for analyzing users feedback and planning
software changes.
4.2.2 RQ2-b Results
Experiment I results. Table 7 shows for each app (each
row) and each app topic (each column) the amount of sen-
tences misclassied by SURF according to the judgment of
respondents as well as the total sentences appearing in the
summary. The validation task performed by the survey par-
ticipants highlights the very high classication accuracy of
SURF , which is 91%.68.75% (11 out of 16) of subjects considered the sum-
maries' content to be adequate: 7 out of 11 participants
armed that summaries we provided have no loss of infor-
mation, while 4 of them declared that, even if there were a
possible information loss, our summaries still provide a com-
plete overview of user needs (see Table 9). On the contrary,
4 subjects out of 16 (25%) believed that some important in-
formation does not appear in the summaries ( e.g., pictures
or videos of the original reviews that could explain the con-
text for reproducing bugs).
About conciseness, 87.50% of subjects (14 out of 16) de-
clared that summaries do not contain unnecessary informa-
tion (see Table 9), while 2 subjects out of 16 (12.50%) said
that they contain just some unnecessary information ( e.g.,
sentences that do not provide any useful information for de-
velopers).
As shown in Table 9, 87.5% (14 out of 16) of subjects
consider the provided summaries readable and easy to un-
derstand (11 out of 14) or somewhat readable and under-
standable (3 out of 14). For example, participants say about
the summaries generated by SURF: \. . . it's simple & use-
ful. . . ", \. . . everything is very compact and we have a good
overview. . . ", \. . . The summaries are very concise and easy
to read. . . ", \. . . The information is more on less reorga-
nized and expressed in form of change requests which I nd
very useful. . . ", \. . . It is very clear and hierarchically orga-
nized. . . ", \. . . The summary is self explanatory. . . ", \. . . the
use of pop-ups allows a developer to trace the entire user
comment. . . " ). 2 subjects (12.50%) believed that the sum-
maries are hard to read and understand ( e.g.,\. . . It is pre-
sented in a very old-fashioned HTML style" ).
Moreover, 87.5% of subjects considered SURF useful in a
working context (see Q13 in Table 8): \. . . If we have more
huge feedbacks, I think this system is useful. I think this can
be used for not only reviewing details of each feedback but
also understanding statistical bug/request trends. . . ", \. . . The
tool you propose is very useful to highlight the most useful
reviews. Without your tool reviews are just reviews, not re-
quests. . . " ).
Experiment II results . 42.86% of participants (3 out
of 7) declared that the provided summaries are lacking some
important information (see Table 9), like screenshots posted
by beta-tester useful for reproducing certain bugs ( i.e., 4
out of 7 participants complain about this issue). However,
screenshots are not allowed in the user reviews of the most
popular mobile distribution platforms and our approach was
originally conceived to collect data from these platforms, and
not from pages hosted on a general purpose social network
(i.e., Google+). As shown in Table 9, 28.57% of the subjects
(2 out of 7) armed that summaries do not contain unnec-
essary information, while 4 participants ( i.e., 57.14%) said
that they contain some unnecessary information ( e.g., sen-
tences not providing any useful information for developers
or duplicate data). Regarding the expressiveness, 85.71%
of the participants (6 out of 7) claimed the summaries are
readable and understandable (see Table 9). Furthermore, all
the subjects generally considered the summaries highly useful
for better understanding user needs (see Q13 in Table 8). In
summary, we can conclude that:
RQ2-b According to the survey participants, the sum-
maries generated by SURF are reasonably correct, ade-
quate, concise, and expressive. Moreover, they are also
considered useful in a real \ working context ".Feedback of survey participants. Some of the partici-
pants suggested to extend SURF's functionality to make them
even more readable For instance: \. . . I would improve the
report design with a more readable interface and by includ-
ing extra information. . . ", \. . . To make the summary more
immediate would need to enter a statistical graph for all top-
ics. . . ", \. . . a better graphic: a graphic report of the amounts
of bugs, requests, info etc, a navigation bar or menu, hierar-

5. THREATS TO VALIDITY
This section outlines potential threats to the validity of
our study.
Internal validity . These threats concern confounding
factors that could inuence our results. The main threat
to internal validity in our study is that the assessment is
performed on data provided by human subjects, hence it
could be biased. To counteract this issue, we selected 23
dierent subjects in our study who (i) meet dierent pro-
les in the eld of software development, (ii) have dierent
cultural backgrounds ( i.e., they come from 4 dierent na-
tions), and (iii) 6 of them were the original developers of 5
apps in our dataset (see Section 3.1). Moreover, in the Ex-
periment I, the validation times are manually reported by
the subjects: they could entail imprecisions. For alleviating
this issue we provided precise timing instructions to partic-
ipants. Another issue consists in the preventive assignment
of some scores. We statically assign some of the values on
the basis of certain observations. Further investigation is
needed to establish whether dierent distributions of these
values enable better results.
External validity . These kinds of threats relate to the
generalizability of our ndings. Our experiments are small
in scale ( i.e., 17 apps out of millions) and the chosen apps
may not be representative. To mitigate this issue we in-
vestigated user reviews of apps belonging to 9 dierent app
categories and mined 4 dierent online platforms (see Sec-
tion 3.1). Specically, to assess the robustness of SURF in
classifying and summarizing user feedback, we considered
reviews that contain dierent vocabularies and were written
by dierent user audiences: users of these apps (i) interact
with devices and technologies in dierent ways, (ii) belong
to dierent age groups, and (iii) have dierent expectations.
In Experiment II, participants validated the summaries for a
total time of 10 minutes. Specically, the availability of Sony
Mobile' participants in performing Experiment II was only
30 minutes, of which (i) 5 minutes were spent explaining
the purpose of the study, sharing the materials and group-
ing participants in Group 1 and Group 2, (ii) 10 minutes
were used for conducting Experiment II-A and Experiment
II-B, and (iii) 15 minutes were available for answering the
questionnaire. Manually analyzing the user feedback for 10
minutes is not sucient to generalize our ndings. However,
in Experiment I, participants had all the time they needed
to validate recommended feedback and analyze reviews. It is
important to highlight that the gain times (RQ-a) obtained
when using SURF are almost identical in Experiment I and
Experiment II. In future work we are interested in replicat-
ing the study involving additional developers of other com-
panies to consolidate our ndings.
Finally, only one of the apps in our dataset is not free
(Karaoke SingMe). Commercial apps may have dierentreview patterns. In the future, for alleviating this threat,
we plan to extend the investigation to the user reviews of
more commercial apps.
6. RELATED WORK
Several researchers have focused on mining and analyzing
app data with the goal of deriving important information
to help developers evolve their apps [7, 13, 28, 29, 32, 39, 40].
First of all, Harman et al. introduced the concept of app
store mining and identied important correlations between
the customer rating and the download rank of apps [13].
Pagano et al. investigated the correlation between reviews
and ratings [28] while Bavota et al. presented a study re-
vealing a direct relationship between the rating of an app
and the fault-proneness of the underlying API used by the
developers [3].
Recently, approaches have been proposed for automati-
cally mining requirements from app reviews [ ?,4,8,10,15,22,
30,32,38]. For instance, Chandy et al. used a Latent Class
graphical model, clustering reviews to identify spam [4]. Gu
et al. on the other hand focused on identifying positive
reviews using a pattern-based parsing approach to extract
opinions and summarize reviews [9]. Guzman et al. per-
formed sentiment analysis to extract coherent features from
reviews that relate to requirements evolution tasks [10].
Numerous researchers have also applied natural language
processing and text retrieval techniques towards automating
the extraction of useful content from app reviews. Speci-
cally, Iacob et al. used Latent Dirichlet Allocation to extract
feature requests from user reviews [15] while Carreno et al.
use topic modeling to extract common topics in a corpus
of user reviews and summarize each topic with a few sen-
tences [8]. Chen et al. presented a computational framework
which automatically groups, prioritizes and visualizes infor-
mative reviews [5]. Likewise, Maalej et al. classied app
reviews into bug reports, feature requests, user experience
and ratings [22]. Panichella et al. [32] proposed an approach
that combines natural language parsing, sentiment analysis
and text analysis techniques, through a Machine Learning
(ML) algorithm in order to detect sentences in user reviews
that are important from a maintenance perspective. We rely
on this approach for performing the intention classication
described in Section 2.2.2.
Most of the automated approaches discussed above per-
form an automatic classication (or clustering/prioritization)
of user reviews according to specic topics ( e.g., bugs, fea-
tures etc.) and, as pointed out by Gu et al. , they \are based
on a bag-of-word assumption without considering sentence
structures and semantics" [9].
Our research represents a cross-section of the eld of is-
sue categorization [14] and classication/summarization of
natural language corpora [6, 31, 35{37, 41, 44, 45] or source
code [12,21,23,25,26,42,43] in the specic context of mobile
app reviews. From an engineering point of view, our work
extends the line of research on mining requirements from
app reviews and it is novel for three main reasons. First
of all we present URM, a conceptual model that takes into
account both the users' intentions (when giving feedback
to developers) and the aspect concerning the app, which is
the subject of the review, to model users' needs in terms of
software maintenance and evolution tasks that are impor-
tant for developers. Moreover, we propose a novel approach,
namely SURF, which combines sophisticated summarization
techniques for generating (according to URM) summaries ofthousands of user reviews in form of an interactive ,struc-
tured andcondensed agenda of future change tasks . Finally,
we evaluate the impact of the generated summaries in a real
scenario where developers analyzed feedback in user reviews
of real mobile apps with the support of SURF's summaries.
To the best of our knowledge only the work by Gu et al. [9]
is closely related to ours. Indeed, Gu et al. proposed a sum-
marization framework, called SURMiner, which classies re-
views into ve categories and extracts aspects (or opinions)
in sentences. The approach by Gu et al. considers aspect
evaluation sentences, from which it extracts aspect-opinion
pairs, associates a sentiment value to each pair and provides
developers with positive and negative opinions about each
aspect. Our approach is based on URM, which models the
user feedback as explicit maintenance tasks considering a
broader set of review types (see Table I and II). Thus, it
does not only deal with feedback reporting user opinions
about aspects (that are modeled in the Information Giving
category). SURF's summaries present to developers also
feature requests and bug reports related to specic parts of
an app.
7. CONCLUSION
SURF's ability to summarize thousands of app reviews in
form of an interactive ,structured and condensed agenda of
recommended software changes represents a signicant step
forward on the cutting edge of app review mining. SURF
assists developers in eectively and quickly understanding
user needs and substantially reduces the time required for
both the manual analysis of user feedback and the plan-
ning of software changes. Through SURF a developer can
quickly become aware of requests and issues reported by the
users, for instance to add a new option in the UI, to x a
stability issue or to protect the privacy of the user, all with-
out analyzing hundreds of useless reviews. We assess the
robustness and suitability of URM (RQ1) as well as the
usefulness of SURF (RQ2) in a working context by con-
ducting two experiments involving 17 real-word apps and
23 subjects having dierent proles in the eld of software
development.
In future work, we plan on making the summarization
interface more interactive, using more eective visualiza-
tions of feedback distributions. Moreover, we are interested
in (i) improving the classication capabilities of SURF by
adding new natural language heuristics, (ii) adding inter-
nationalization (as currently only English reviews are sup-
ported) and (iii) implementing, on top of SURF, a mecha-
nism able to recognize which part of the source code needs
to be changed in the app to perform the change tasks sug-
gested by SURF. We nally, plan to integrate a prioritization
mechanism in SURF to help developers focus on the most
relevant tasks.
