ABSTRACT
Requirements Engineering includes various activities aimed at dis-
covering, analyzing, validating,evolving, andmanagingsoftware
and systems requirements. Many of these activities are human fac-
ing,effortintensive,andsometimeserrorprone.Theycouldbenefit
greatly from cutting edge advances in automation. However, the
softwareengineeringcommunityhasprimarilyfocusedonautomat-
ing other aspects of the development process such as testing, code
analytics, and mining software respositories. As a result, advances
