Abstract —Rather than tediously writing unit tests manually,
tools can be used to generate them automatically — sometimes
even resulting in higher code coverage than manual testing.
But how good are these tests at actually ﬁnding faults? To
answer this question, we applied three state-of-the-art unit test
generation tools for Java (Randoop, EvoSuite, and Agitar) to
the 357 real faults in the Defects4J dataset and investigated how
well the generated test suites perform at detecting these faults.
Although the automatically generated test suites detected 55.7%
of the faults overall, only 19.9% of all the individual test suites
detected a fault. By studying the effectiveness and problems of the
individual tools and the tests they generate, we derive insights
to support the development of automated unit test generators
that achieve a higher fault detection rate. These insights include
1) improving the obtained code coverage so that faulty statements
are executed in the ﬁrst instance, 2) improving the propagation
of faulty program states to an observable output, coupled with
the generation of more sensitive assertions, and 3) improving the
simulation of the execution environment to detect faults that are
dependent on external factors such as date and time.
I. I NTRODUCTION
Unit testing is a common practice in object oriented
programming, where each class is typically accompanied by
a set of small, quickly executable test cases. There are many
beneﬁts to unit testing; unit tests serve as documentation and
speciﬁcation, and they help in ﬁnding faults. However, writing
unit tests can also be tedious, and writing good unit tests can
sometimes be more of an art than a science.
To support developers in unit testing, researchers have
explored different approaches to automatically generate unit
tests, thus relieving the developers of part of their hard work.
These automated unit test generation tools have become very
effective — automatically generated unit tests may even cover
more code than those written by developers [14]. However,
a high degree of code coverage does not imply that a test is
actually effective at detecting faults.
Because code coverage cannot measure fault-ﬁnding effec-
tiveness, a standard method is to compare test suites in terms
of their mutation scores — that is, by measuring how many
seeded faults a test suite ﬁnds. Even though there is evidence
suggesting that test suites that are good at ﬁnding seeded faults
are also good at ﬁnding real faults [3], [26], the quantiﬁcation
in terms of the mutation score can be misleading: Just because
a test suite ﬁnds a high number of seeded faults does not
necessarily mean that it will ﬁnd the faults that matter — the
ones that developers actually make.
In this paper, we empirically evaluate automatic unit test
generation using the Defects4J dataset, which contains 357 realfaults from open source projects [25]. We applied three state-
of-the-art unit test generation tools for Java, RANDOOP [30],
EVOSUITE [13], and AGITAR ONE[1], on the Defects4J dataset,
and investigated whether the resulting test suites can ﬁnd the
faults. Speciﬁcally, we aimed to answer the following research
question:
“How do automated unit test generators
perform at ﬁnding faults?”
Our experiments indicate that, while it is possible for automated
test generation tools to ﬁnd more than half of the faults, running
any individual tool on a given software project is far from
providing any conﬁdence about ﬁnding faults. In fact, only
19.9% of all the test suites generated as part of our experiments
ﬁnd a fault. This raises a second research question:
“How do automated unit test generators
need to be improved to ﬁnd more faults?”
Our experiments indicate that in many cases, code coverage
remains a major problem, preventing automatically generated
unit tests from detecting faults. More concretely, 16.2% of
all faults and 36.7% of the non-found faults were never even
executed by the generated tests in the ﬁrst place. However,
code coverage is not the only problem: 63.3% of the non-
found faults were covered by automatically generated tests at
least once, but the tests did not manage to reveal them. This
calls for improved techniques to achieve fault propagation and
for improved generation of assertions to detect the propagated
faults. Unexpectedly, we also found that 15.2% of all tests were
ﬂaky — that is, their passing/failing behavior was temporary
due to environmental and other dependencies, rendering them
useless and providing reinforcement for recent research on test
isolation [5].
The contributions of this paper are as follows:
1)A large-scale experiment, applying three state-of-the-art
automated unit test generators for Java to the 357 faults
in the Defects4J dataset.
2)A detailed analysis of how well the generated suites
performed at detecting the faults in the dataset.
3)The presentation of a series of insights gained from the
study as to how the test generators could be improved to
support better fault discovery in the future.

iments, including a discussion of the automatic unit test
generators studied, how we designed the experiments, and

Defects4J dataset provides a buggy (i.e., faulty) and a ﬁxed
version. Test suites are generated with all tools on the ﬁxed
version, and executed on the buggy version.
II. M ETHODOLOGY
In order to answer our research questions, we designed an
experiment according to the high-level methodology shown in
Figure 1. We considered Defects4J, a database of known, real
faults, where each fault is represented by a buggy and a ﬁxed
program version. We applied three automated test generation
tools ( AGITAR ONE,EVOSUITE , and RANDOOP ) on the ﬁxed
version, and executed each generated test suite on the buggy
version to determine whether it detects the fault — that is,
whether is fails on the buggy version. This means that we are
considering a regression testing scenario, where a developer
would apply test generation to guard against future faults. We
then analyzed in detail which faults were detected and how, and
which faults were not detected, and why. This section describes
the experimental setup in detail.
A. Subject Programs
The Defects4J [25] dataset consists of 357 real faults from
ﬁve open source projects: JFreeChart (26 faults), Google
Closure compiler (133 faults), Apache Commons Lang (65
faults), Apache Commons Math (106 faults), and Joda Time
(27 faults). Defects4J makes analyzing real faults easy: For
each fault, it provides 1) commands to access the buggy and
the ﬁxed program version, which differ by a minimized change
that represents the isolated bug ﬁx, 2) a developer-written test
suite containing at least one test case that can expose the fault,
and 3) a list of classes relevant to the fault — that is, all classes
modiﬁed by the bug ﬁx. As per the regression testing scenario
(i.e., guarding against future faults in modiﬁed code), we used
this list of relevant classes for test generation.
B. Automated Unit Test Generation Tools
All software projects in Defects4J are written in Java,
therefore we also considered test generation tools for Java.
NightHawk [4], JCrasher [10], Carfast [31], T3 [33], and
RANDOOP [30] are instances of random unit test generation
tools. We chose RANDOOP as it is the most stable and popular
representative of these random testing tools.
TestFul [6], eToc [40], and EVOSUITE [13] are instances of
search-based unit test generation tools, which use meta-heuristic
search techniques to optimize test suites with respect to code
coverage criteria. We chose EVOSUITE as it subsumes the
other tools in terms of functionalities, and is the only actively
maintained tool out of the three.
Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) testing tools for Java
such as DSC [22], Symbolic PathFinder [32], and jCute [36]
require test drivers, whereas our scenario of unit test generation
assumes that the tests generated include these test drivers — as
typical unit tests do (i.e., in terms of method call sequences).
While EVOSUITE has an experimental DSE extension [17], it
is not yet enabled by default, and therefore was not used in
our experiments. Note that for C#, tools such as Seeker [38]
or Symstra [45] can generate method call sequences, but the
only publicly available tool — Pex [39] — has only a limitedability to do so. However, our experimental setup based on
Defects4J requires tools that apply to Java.
Finally, there are commercial unit test generation tools for
Java, of which naturally less is known about implementation
details. We tried Analytix CodePro [9], Parasoft JTest [24],
and AGITAR ONE[1]. CodePro achieved low coverage and
is no longer ofﬁcially supported. Although we were able to
generate test suites with JTest, we were unable to execute
the tests with our analysis framework (even with help from
Parasoft’s support team) because the tests depend on JTest’s
proprietary stub generation utility. As AGITAR ONEexhibited
fewer problems with test dependencies compared to JTest, we
chose A GITAR ONEfor our experiments.
RANDOOP [30] implements feedback-directed random test
generation for object-oriented programs. This means that it
iteratively extends sequences of method calls with randomly
selected candidates until the generated sequence raises an
undeclared exception or violates a general code contract.
RANDOOP also executes its generated sequences and creates
assertions that capture the behavior of the class under test.
However, RANDOOP cannot target a speciﬁc class under test
since it uses a bottom-up approach that requires that all
dependencies of a method call (i.e., arguments) have been
instantiated in a prior iteration. RANDOOP therefore requires, as
input, a list of all classes it should explore during test generation.
For each class under test we provided a list containing the class
under test and all its dependencies as determined by Defects4J1.
We applied RANDOOP for three minutes on each run, using a
unique random seed since RANDOOP is deterministic by default
(i.e., the random seed is always 0). For all other settings, we
applied the defaults, with the exception of enabling null values
as method arguments with a probability of 0:1; this improves
RANDOOP ’s effectiveness in our experience [26].
EVOSUITE [13] applies a genetic algorithm in order to
evolve a set of test cases that maximizes code coverage. It starts
with a population of test suites of random test cases, and then
iteratively applies search operators such as selection, mutation,
and crossover to evolve them. The evolution is guided by a
ﬁtness function based on a coverage criterion, which is branch
coverage by default. Once the search ends, the test suite with
the highest code coverage is minimized with respect to the
coverage criterion and regression test assertions are added [16].
EVOSUITE then checks for each test whether it is syntactically
valid by compiling it, and executes it to check whether it is
stable (i.e., passing). Any failing assertions at this point are
commented out by EVOSUITE . Since EVOSUITE can target a
speciﬁc class under test, we generated, for each fault, a test
suite targeting only classes relevant to that fault, as reported
by Defects4J. We used EVOSUITE with its default options,
except for two settings: 1) We set the stopping criterion for
the search to three minutes per class and 2) we deactivated
the mutation-based ﬁltering of assertions such that all possible
regression assertions are included, because the ﬁltering can be
computationally costly and caused some timeouts.
AGITAR ONE[1] is a commercial test generation tool for
Java developed by Agitar Technologies, which is advertised
as being able to achieve 80% code coverage or better on any
class. The tool consists of a client and a server application.
According to AGITAR ONE’s support, the test generation is
1Defects4J dynamically determines dependencies by monitoring the class
loader during the execution of the developer-written tests.”fairly“ deterministic, and a user should notneed to generate
multiple test suites for a given program version2. The client is
an Eclipse plugin that connects to the server3to request the
generation of test cases, and the server takes a variable amount
of time to do so, depending on the class under test. As we
did not succeed in automating A GITAR ONE, we imported the
ﬁxed project version of each Defects4J bug into Eclipse and
manually invoked AGITAR ONE’s Eclipse plugin to generate
test suites. AGITAR ONEcan target a speciﬁc class under test,
and we therefore generated a test suite for each class relevant
to the fault. If AGITAR ONEfailed to generate tests for a class,
we re-attempted the request ﬁve times. Nevertheless, the tool
was not able to generate a test suite for 34 (9.5%) faults
(RANDOOP andEVOSUITE were not able to generate any test
suites for 2 and 1 ( <1%) faults). AGITAR ONEmakes heavy use
of a proprietary mocking system that requires AGITAR ONE’s
own test runner. As we could not integrate this test runner
in Defects4J’s infrastructure, which uses Apache Ant’s JUnit
test runner, we collected the same experimental data as for the
other tools using A GITAR ONE’s dedicated test runner.
C. Experiment Procedure
We applied the following procedure.
1)Test Generation: RANDOOP and EVOSUITE are both
randomized tools, capable of producing different results on
each invocation. To account for this randomness, we generated
10 test suites for each tool and fault on the ﬁxed version as
provided by Defects4J. As AGITAR ONErequired manual effort
to generate and analyze a test suite (e.g., manually selecting
the classes under test and starting the tool in Eclipse), we only
generated 1 test suite for each fault with A GITAR ONE.
2)Flaky Tests: In order to determine whether a test detects
a fault, we require it to pass on the ﬁxed version and fail on the
buggy version. However, tools may generate ﬂaky (unstable)
tests, which may also fail on the ﬁxed version. For example,
a test case that contains an assertion that refers to the system
time will only pass during generation, and will fail when re-
executed later. We applied the following automated process to
remove ﬂaky tests: First, all non-compiling test classes were
removed. Then, each compilable test suite was executed on the
ﬁxed version ﬁve times. If any of these executions revealed
ﬂaky tests, then these tests were removed, and the test suite
re-compiled and re-executed. This process was repeated until
all remaining tests passed ﬁve times in a row.
Technically, a test may reveal its ﬂakiness only at a later
stage (e.g., if a test depends on the current date, it might fail
only after the current day is over). By that time, the source
code of the class under test might have been changed, and one
would need to spend time to understand whether a failing test
has found a fault or it is just ﬂaky. Although possible, we did
not encounter any such cases in our experiments.
3)False Positives: Even if a test is not ﬂaky, it might
still fail on the buggy version for reasons that are unrelated
to the actual fault — that is, it is a false positive . Flaky
tests can technically also be false positives, but false positives
mainly happen when test generation tools break the object-
oriented principle of encapsulation, for example by calling
private methods directly through reﬂection, or by capturing
outdated behavior of dependency classes with mocks.
2Personal communication, August 2015
3The test generation server was deployed on a Linux computer with 64GB
of RAM and 32 CPU cores @2.1GHzWe identiﬁed false positives as follows: For each test that
failed on a buggy version, we compared the failure message and
stack trace produced by the failing tests of the developer-written
test suite included in Defects4J with that of the generated test.
If a test failed with the same exception or a similar assertion,
we considered it a true positive. If the exception or assertion
differed, we manually validated whether the failure was caused
by the fault or whether it is a false positive.
We found false positives for RANDOOP andAGITAR ONE
but not for EVOSUITE . Note that RANDOOP suffered false
positives only for Closure, and only with tests that executed a
dependency class rather than any of the relevant classes. For
AGITAR ONEwe identiﬁed two common types of false positives:
test failures due to mocking and accessing (missing) private
class members. Consequently, we automatically classiﬁed an
AGITAR ONEtest as false positive if it only failed because of
mocking or missing private class members (see Section IV-D ).
While we could have prevented this problem to a certain extent
by changing the faults provided by Defects4J (i.e., inlining all
changes or maintaining unused code), we argue that this would
not reﬂect common practice.
4)Fault Detection: To determine fault detection we exe-
cuted the test suites against the buggy version of each bug
as provided by Defects4J. For RANDOOP andEVOSUITE , we
executed the test suites using Defects4J’s JUnit test runner; for
AGITAR ONEwe used its proprietary JUnit test runner. For each
executed test, we collected information on whether it passed
or failed, and if it failed we logged the reason (i.e., the failure
message and stack trace).
5)Coverage Analysis: In order to study how code coverage
relates to fault detection, we measured statement coverage on
each class relevant to the fault. Furthermore, given the set of
program statements modiﬁed by the bug ﬁx (i.e., the difference
between the buggy and the ﬁxed version), we measured bug
coverage — that is, whether a fault was 1) fully covered
(all modiﬁed statements covered), 2) partially covered (some
modiﬁed statements covered), or 3) not covered.
For RANDOOP and EVOSUITE , we used Cobertura4to
measure code coverage. As AGITAR ONE’s proprietary coverage
tracking mechanism conﬂicts with Cobertura, we relied on the
proprietary coverage ﬁles generated by AGITAR ONE. To that
end, we extended Crap4j5[35] and extracted the code coverage
ratio from the coverage ﬁles produced by AGITAR ONE’s test
runner for each relevant class. To determine whether a fault
was fully, partially, or not covered, we manually inspected
the visual code coverage indicators of the modiﬁed statements
using A GITAR ONE’s Eclipse plugin.
D. Threats to Validity
In this study, we used bugs taken from only ﬁve Java
open source projects, which may not generalize to all pro-
gramming languages and different program characteristics,
and thus constitutes a threat to external validity . Our study
considered three state-of-the-art test generation tools, of which
one is commercially available and actively used by developers.
However, our study does not include tools based on Dynamic
Symbolic Execution or other specialized techniques, and such
tools may be more effective at some challenges we identiﬁed
than the tools used in our study (e.g., complex conditions).

A potential threat to internal validity is that not all tests
that detected a fault were manually investigated to ensure the
validity of the bug detection result. However, we mitigated
this threat by using several sanity checks, such as comparing
failure reasons of generated and developer-written test suites.
Furthermore, we manually inspected a large number of test
suites, in particular the ones that exhibited an unexpected failure
reason. AGITAR ONEmay produce different test suites when
invoked on the same class several times, depending on external
factors such as available resources. Thus, there is a potential
threat as we only generated a single test suite for each bug
with AGITAR ONE. However, we experimentally validated the
claim of Agitars support of the tool being fairly deterministic
by sampling 10 faults, and found that the tool is generally
consistent in whether it detects a bug. Moreover, AGITAR ONE
spent signiﬁcantly more than three minutes on some classes,
and allowing RANDOOP and EVOSUITE more time for test
generation may produce better results. However, based on our
experience, a search budget of three minutes is sufﬁcient for the
search in EVOSUITE to converge in most cases, such that more
time would not further change the tests. For RANDOOP we
observed that code coverage saturated already within <1 min,
and the test suites exhibit a very high degree of redundancy.
Therefore, we do not expect our choice of test generation time
to affect effectiveness.
A potential threat to construct validity is the use of all bugs
in the Defects4J dataset, as Defects4J does not distinguish the
type or severity of faults. Furthermore, each bug is represented
by a minimized diff between the buggy and a later ﬁxed
version, rather than the actual code change that introduced
the bug. Thus, although the bugs are real bugs, not all may be
representative for regression faults. Therefore, our study might
underestimate the effectiveness of automated test generation
tools for regression testing if some types of the undetected
faults are unlikely to be inadvertently introduced by a developer
in the future. Likewise, our study might overestimate theeffectiveness if some types of the detected faults are unlikely
to be inadvertently introduced in the future. Furthermore, our
study relies on the versions of code committed to a public
repository and does not include regressions that a developer
identiﬁed before committing the changes to the repository. This
may underestimate the effectiveness of test generation tools if
these uncommitted changes are easier to detect. This threat is
mitigated somewhat as the bugs are taken from all stages of
the project history, including earlier stages of development.
III. D O AUTOMATED UNIT TEST GENERATION TOOLS
FIND REAL BUGS ?
A. How many usable tests are generated?
The left-hand side of Table I reports the outcome of
the test generation. Unlike AGITAR ONE, both EVOSUITE
and RANDOOP generated test classes that did not compile.
Unsurprisingly, RANDOOP generated the largest number of
tests for all projects as it does not target a speciﬁc class under
test. In contrast, EVOSUITE andAGITAR ONEgenerate tests
speciﬁcally for the selected classes under test, resulting in
substantially fewer tests. For reference, we also include the
number of tests in the developer-written test suites (manual).
Note that these numbers refer to all relevant tests, as reported
by Defects4J: A test is considered relevant if it directly or
indirectly covers any of the classes relevant to the fault.
AGITAR ONEgenerated the lowest ratio of ﬂaky tests overall,
with a maximum of 3.3% for Time. As Time makes heavy use
of the system time, this is not surprising. EVOSUITE suffered
between 0.2%–5.4% ﬂaky tests, but interestingly fewer for
Time — presumably due to its built-in test isolation and check
for ﬂaky tests. Unlike AGITAR ONEandEVOSUITE ,RANDOOP
does not isolate tests from the environment, and as a result
suffered between 5.7%–36.8% ﬂaky tests. We mainly observed
false positives for AGITAR ONE, in particular for Closure, due
to the use of mocking and reﬂection to increase code coverage.
Out of the three test generation tools, AGITAR ONEgenerally
achieved the highest code coverage ratio, except for Lang.EVOSUITE andRANDOOP struggled to achieve code coverage
on Closure — most likely because of the large number of
private methods. In comparison to the developer-written test
suites, the test generation tools achieved lower code coverage
overall, except for Chart. Yet, all tools achieved higher code
coverage than developer-written test suites for some classes.
EVOSUITE and RANDOOP generated 3.4% and 8.3%
non-compilable test suites on average. Moreover, on average,
21% of RANDOOP ’s tests were ﬂaky, and 46% of
AGITAR ONE’s failing tests were false positives.
B. How many bugs are found?
Overall, the generated test suites found 199 out of the 357
bugs (55.7%). On the face of it, ﬁnding more than half of
the bugs sounds like an encouraging result. However, consider
Table III, which gives a visual overview of the bug-ﬁnding
results of the analyzed tools on the complete set of bugs: Found
bugs are denoted with ﬁlled boxes, there is one row for each
bug, and one column for each execution of a test generation
tool. Clearly, the ﬁlled boxes are sparse in this table as only
19.9% of all executions detected a bug.
Considering tools individually, EVOSUITE ,AGITAR ONE,
andRANDOOP found 145, 130, and 93 bugs, respectively. That
is, the number of bugs found by each tool is comparable —
around one third of all bugs, which is already substantially less
than the overall number of bugs found (199). However, as the
sparsity of black boxes in Table III shows — even for bugs
that were found — tools like RANDOOP andEVOSUITE use
randomized algorithms, so the properties of the generated tests
differ for each run. Consequently, a bug may be found in one
run, but not in the next. If we say a bug is “likely to be found”
if it was found in more than half of the executions of the
tool, the number of bugs found for RANDOOP andEVOSUITE
changes to 54 and 83, respectively. If we consider a bug as
found only if allexecutions of a tool detected the bug, then
these numbers decrease to a sobering 28 and 38.
Regarding the effectiveness of the tools per project, there
are some distinct differences: The part of Table III for the Chart
project is quite densely populated, whereas the Closure project
seems to be generally more problematic for test generation
tools. Table I summarizes the visual presentation of Table III
in numbers, and conﬁrms this intuition: For the Chart project,
RANDOOP and AGITAR ONEfound more than half of the
bugs on average (only EVOSUITE struggled and only detected
9.7 out of 26 bugs on average). For the Closure project,
even AGITAR ONEdiscovered only 25 out of 133 bugs, and
RANDOOP found just 2.2 bugs on average. The bug detection
results for the Lang and Time project look similarly grim.
The Math project seems to be slightly better suited for test
generation, with AGITAR ONEﬁnding half of the bugs, and
EVOSUITE coming close to this result.
The picture painted overall is that if one wants to ﬁnd all
bugs, one should not rely solely on an automated unit test
generation tool. This suggests that plenty remains to be done to
improve automated test generation tools. Nevertheless, the fact
that 199 bugs were found fully automatically does showcase
the potential of such tools for widely used practices such as
regression testing. The results also show that none of the test
generation approaches is strictly superior to the other two.
Automated test generation tools found 55.7% of the bugs we
considered, but no tool alone found more than 40.6%.TABLE II: The percentage of detected bugs, categorized by
whether the bug in question was found by the developer-written
test suite with either an assertion, an exception, or both.

Average bug detection rate of all toolsRatio of detected bugsDetected by

Fig. 2: Ratio of bugs that were detected by an assertion or an
exception, grouped by the intervals of the average bug detection
rate of all tools. The total number of bugs is 199 and 46, 77,
46, and 30, respectively for each interval. Note that a bug may
be detected by both an assertion and an exception.
C. How are the bugs found?
Overall, the generated test suites detected more bugs with
an assertion (146) than with an exception (109). Note that 56
bugs were detected with both an assertion and an exception,
by different tests. EVOSUITE is the only tool that detected 5
bugs via timeout; we treat this as a case of exception for the
following discussion. The right-hand side of Table I details the
results and shows how effective assertions and exceptions are
for each project.
Assuming that a developer-written test that reveals a bug is
indicative of whether an assertion or an exception is required
for that bug, we can determine if the tools are better at
detecting bugs requiring an assertion or an exception. Table II
shows how many of the bugs (detected by the developer-
written test suites with an assertion or an exception) were
detected by the generated test suites. In the majority of
cases, clearly more of the bugs that trigger an exception
were found than of those that require an assertion. The main
exception is EVOSUITE for the Time project, where 80%
of the bugs requiring an assertion were found, compared to
only 42.9% of the bugs requiring an exception.
Figure 2 shows the ratio of bugs detected by assertion or
exception for different intervals of the average bug detection
rate of all tools. Note that the average bug detection rate is
computed as the mean across tools rather than the mean acrossTABLE III: Summary of bug-ﬁnding results for each bug, tool, and execution. For each tool execution, if a compilable test suite
was generated, a bug may have been detected ( /uni220E), fully covered but not detected ( /uni229E), partially covered but not detected ( /uni22A1),
or not covered at all ( /uni25FB). Otherwise, the test suite was not compilable ( ★), resulted in conﬁguration errors in our evaluation
framework ( ⊖), or it was not even generated ( ◯). Bugs that were either never found, always found, or found by only one tool,
are highlighted with different colors (no tool, all tools, only A GITAR ONE,only E VOSUITE , or only R ANDOOP ).

all test suites because the numbers of generated test suites differ
for the tools. The plot suggests that hard to ﬁnd bugs (i.e., bugs
with a low average detection rate) are more often detected by
an assertion than by an exception. Furthermore, bugs that are
easier to ﬁnd are more often detected by an exception than
bugs that are harder to ﬁnd.
More bugs were detected with a test assertion than with an
exception (146 vs. 109), but the detection ratio is lower for
bugs requiring assertions (37.34% vs. 49.4% avg. per tool).
D. Are bugs that are covered usually found?
Figure 3 compares the code coverage ratios of generated
test suites that detected a bug and generated test suites that
did not, clearly showing that code coverage matters when it
comes to detecting faults. This is also conﬁrmed by a strong
correlation between code coverage and bug detection (Pearson
correlation of 0.40 on average per tool).
However, a high code coverage ratio does not necessarily
indicate that the bug was covered. Table IV therefore reports
the bug coverage (as described in Section II-C5) for all test
suites that did notdetect a bug. In general, fewer than 50% of
the undetected bugs are fully covered by the test suites. A bug
that is fully covered but not detected is indicative of a problem
in generating an assertion since a test suite very likely detects a
fully covered bug, even without an assertion, if that bug raises
an exception. A notable exception in terms of fully covered
bugs is given by EVOSUITE for the Time project, where 66.8%
of the undetected bugs are fully covered. We surmise that in
these cases EVOSUITE removed assertions while checking forunstable tests. Although full bug coverage is not sufﬁcient to
trigger the bug, the tools struggled to achieve full bug coverage
for the majority of bugs.
Of all test suites that did not reveal a fault, 46.8% did not
fully cover it, and 26.6% did not even cover it partially.
IV. H OW CAN THE TOOLS BE IMPROVED ?
Table III shows that the majority of the generated test suites
did not detect the corresponding fault. The faults that were
always detected by all generated test suites6are simple faults,
such as a NullPointerException caused by a missing
input validation, or easily executable and observable changes,
such as Math-22:
1public boolean isSupportLowerBoundInclusive() {
2- return true;
3+ return false;
4}
Note that in this and all following code snippets, ’ +‘ indicates
an added line and ’ -‘ a removed line, in the ﬁxed version.
However, most bugs are not this trivial. To gain insights on
how to increase the fault detection rate of test generation tools,
we investigated the challenges that prevent fault detection. To
this end, we ﬁrst looked at the 12 faults that no tool managed to
cover (not even partially) and the 4 undetected faults that were
fully covered. We then looked at the 76 faults that only one tool
managed to detect — 28 by AGITAR ONE, 35 by EVOSUITE ,
and 13 by RANDOOP ; these reveal strengths of a particular
tool that others are missing. Finally, we studied the root causes
for ﬂaky and false-positive tests. The remainder of this section
presents our ﬁndings.
A. Improving Coverage
A test has to cover a fault to detect it, and Figure 3 shows
that test suites that detect a fault achieve signiﬁcantly higher
code coverage. We identiﬁed four challenges that inhibit test
generation tools from achieving such high code coverage.
1)Creation of Complex Objects: Out of the 12 faults7that
were not covered by any of the generated test suites, the majority
(9) of them are from the project Closure. For these 9 faults,
reaching the buggy code requires the creation of a complex
data structure (e.g., a control ﬂow graph). This is a highly
complex and challenging task for an automated test generation
tool since it requires a certain sequence of method calls prior
to exercising the target method. This task is also demanding
for human testers, as evident in Closure’s developer-written
tests that detect the fault: The tests create a complex string (i.e.,
program text) and re-use the compiler infrastructure to create
an appropriate data structure. For an automated test generation
tool, however, generating such a complex input string is as
challenging as initializing a complex data structure. Consider
the following fault (Closure-14):
1for (Node finallyNode : cfa.finallyMap.get(parent)) {
2- cfa.createEdge(fromNode, Branch.UNCOND, finallyNode);
3+ cfa.createEdge(fromNode, Branch.ON_EX, finallyNode);
4}
Covering this fault requires constructing a control ﬂow graph in
advance, with an edge connecting two consecutive finally
blocks. The developer-written test achieves this by constructing
a control ﬂow graph object from a complex input string:
6Chart- f14, 18, 22 g, and Math- f6, 22, 35, 61, 66, 103 g
7Closure- f14, 15, 17, 32, 53, 66, 71, 86, 111 g, Lang-24, and Math-311String src = "X:while(1){try{while(2){try{var a;break X;}" +
"finally{}}}finally{}}";
2ControlFlowGraph<Node> cfg = createCfg(src);
3assertCrossEdge(cfg,Token.BLOCK,Token.BLOCK,Branch.ON_EX);
In contrast, no coverage guidance exists for generating such
complex strings within an automated test generation tool.
Some bugs requiring the creation of complex objects were
found; for example, for Closure-80, an AGITAR ONEtest created
a mocked instance of a particular Node , and for Closure-
109, a RANDOOP test managed to create a valid control ﬂow
graph from a complex input string, reusing a string constant
from a dependent class. RANDOOP also succeeded in detecting
several faults8by indirectly testing the class under test through
dependencies. In these cases, RANDOOP overcame the object
creation problem by exploiting existing logic in classes that
are clients of the class under test.
Some viable solutions (which are not implemented in
the used tools) exist to address the generally acknowledged
problem of complex objects [43]. For example, seeding objects
observed at runtime [23], mining of common usage patterns
of objects [15] to guide object creation, or carving of complex
object states from system tests [11]. However, in the absence
of example information the problem is unsolved.
2)String Optimization: Complex strings not only occur in
the developer-written test suites for Closure, but are also a
recurring pattern in the generated test suites for faults that are
only detected by one tool. AGITAR ONEdetected the string-
related fault in Closure-155, and EVOSUITE detected several
faults9that require a speciﬁc input string. For example, consider
Lang-16, a fault whose detection requires the satisfaction of
the following condition:
1if (str.startsWith("0x") || str.startsWith("-0x")
2+ || str.startsWith("0X") || str.startsWith("-0X")) {
3 return createInteger(str);
4}
EVOSUITE generates strings using its genetic algorithm and
seeded values [12], taken from string constants and runtime
observations. The following test detects the fault above:
1public void test085() throws Throwable {
2 String string0 = "-0XeD";
3 int int0 = NumberUtils.createNumber(string0);
4 assertEquals((-237), int0);
5}
Search-based tools are capable in principle of generating string
inputs [2], but doing so with a search algorithm can take
very long. Symbolic approaches using string solvers [18] or
dedicated solvers for regular expressions [41] are generally
restricted to ﬁxed length strings. If an input grammar is known,
then this can be used to generate test data more efﬁciently [8].
The results of web queries can also serve as useful test data [28].
Nevertheless, our experiments showed that state-of-the-art tools
still struggle with string optimization.
3)Complex Conditions: Lang-24, a fault that no tool
detected, is an example for a complex condition that needs to
be satisﬁed to detect the fault:
1if (chars[i] == ’l’ || chars[i] == ’L’) {
2- return foundDigit && !hasExp;
3+ return foundDigit && !hasExp && !hasDecPoint;
4}
Detecting this fault is challenging for two reasons: First, a
randomly initialized character array ( chars ) is unlikely to
8Math- f2, 9, 54 g, Time- f10, 22 g, and Lang-56
9Lang- f16, 36, 44, 44, 58, 60 g, Time-24, and Closure-73satisfy the outer condition. Second, search-based tools like
EVOSUITE suffer from boolean ﬂags such as foundDigit ,
hasExp , and hasDecPoint , which provide no guidance to
the search. This problem of boolean ﬂags is well known, and
testability transformation [20] is generally accepted as solution.
Note that DSE would not suffer from this problem [17], [19].
Lang-48 a fault that only EVOSUITE detected, exempliﬁes
a problem related to complex conditions involving subtyping:
1public EqualsBuilder append(Object lhs, Object rhs) {
2 ...
3 Class lhsClass = lhs.getClass();
4 if (!lhsClass.isArray()) {
5- isEquals = lhs.equals(rhs)
6+ if (lhs instanceof java.math.BigDecimal) { ... }
7+ else { isEquals = lhs.equals(rhs) }
8 } ...
9}
In principle, when creating an input value for a parameter of
typeObject , any class can be used. EVOSUITE addresses
this challenge by explicitly using classes that are used in casts
or type comparisons, and therefore generates a test case that
passes an object of type BigDecimal as argument to the
append method.
4)Private Methods/Fields: Many of the faults in the Closure
project, in particular those not detected by any tool, exist in
private methods. This presents an additional challenge for an
automated test generation tool, which usually tests using only
the public interface of a class under test. For instance, in
Closure-1, a simple change is introduced in a private method:
1private void removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs(Scope fnScope) {
2+ if (!removeGlobals) {
3+ return;
4+ }
5Node function = fnScope.getRootNode();
It is, however, difﬁcult to (indirectly) test this method due to
the complex class hierarchy and data structures of this project.
AGITAR ONEtries to sidestep this problem by access-
ing private ﬁelds and methods. While it may not gen-
erally be desirable to explicitly call private methods, it
enables AGITAR ONEto cover methods that are hard to
reach through the public API of the class. Covering
theremoveUnreferencedFunctionArgs method, AG-
ITAR ONEtriggers a NullPointerException by setting
the value of the private ﬁeld removeGlobals tofalse ,
and passing in null asfnScope :
1RemoveUnusedVars removeUnusedVars = (RemoveUnusedVars)
2Mockingbird.getProxyObject(RemoveUnusedVars.class, true);
3setPrivateField(removeUnusedVars,
4 "removeGlobals", Boolean.FALSE);
5Mockingbird.enterTestMode(RemoveUnusedVars.class);
6callPrivateMethod("com.google.javascript.jscomp.
RemoveUnusedVars", "removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs",
new Class[] {Scope.class}, removeUnusedVars, new Object
[] {null});
Although the test does ﬁnd the bug, it is unclear whether
such a change could be triggered without modifying the
state through private ﬁelds and methods. Similarly, AGI-
TARONEdetected Closure- f45, 83, 102 gand Math- f18, 33,
78gby asserting the value of private ﬁelds using reﬂection.
Whether or not accessing private methods and ﬁelds is a
good approach is debatable but, as shown, it has the potential
to reveal faults. However, it can cause false positives, as
will be discussed in Section IV-D . This problem can only
be overcome by improving test generation tools to achieve
coverage of private methods fully through the public API.B. Improving Propagation and Detection
Even if covered, a fault might not propagate or, if it does,
the test oracle might not be able to detect the change in the
outcome. Recall that a third of the undetected faults were fully
covered and many more were partially covered (Table IV). This
section details challenges in revealing those covered faults.
1)Propagation: Across all projects and test suites, we found
ﬁve faults (Closure- f31, 70, 121 gand Math- f12, 30 g) that were
always fully covered but never detected.
Unlike Closure- f31, 70, 121 gand Math-30, Math-12
represents a unique case not directly related to propagation,
where the fault is simply a forgotten implementation of the
Serializable interface. This fault is trivially covered, but
in order to detect it, a test would need to serialize an object of
that class using an ObjectOutputStream .
Math-30 is an integer overﬂow error, which means that
not only does the code need to be covered, but it also has to
be executed with values that lead to an overﬂow. Closure-31,
70, and 121 have a potential inﬂuence on private members of
the faulty class. However, these private members are complex
objects, and a change to them can only be observed by involving
the faulty object in further complex interactions, rather than
simply writing an assertion on a return value of a public method.
To some extent, this is the result of focusing on simple structural
criteria such as branch coverage, rather than aiming to exercise
more complex intra-class data ﬂow dependencies [21].
2)Assertion Generation: Considering that more faults are
detected with an exception, but the majority of faults require
an assertion (Table II), a key challenge for test generation tools
is generating adequate assertions (i.e., test oracles).
Assertions are typically generated based on observations of
the public API [16], [30], [44] during execution. However, our
experiments revealed some particular cases where only AGI-
TARONEwas able to generate the appropriate assertions: For
Chart-6, Closure- f12, 21, 22, 129 g, and Math-48, AGITAR ONE
detected the fault by asserting on the object state in the catch
clause. In contrast, EVOSUITE andRANDOOP only verify that
an expected exception is thrown. For example, Closure-129 is
a fault for which both the buggy and the ﬁxed version throw a
NullPointerException , but differ in where it is thrown.
AGITAR ONEdetected this change as follows:
1try {
2 prepareAnnotations.visit(t, n, parent);
3 fail("Expected NullPointerException to be thrown");
4} catch (NullPointerException ex) {
5 ...
6 assertThrownBy(PrepareAst.PrepareAnnotations.class, ex);
7}
C. Flaky Tests
It is important for regression tests to be deterministic and to
produce the same outcome in consecutive runs. Recall that we
automatically removed 15.2% of ﬂaky tests to achieve this goal.
However, removing such a large portion of tests also means
losing any additional coverage gained by such tests.
1)Environment Dependencies: Flaky tests are frequently
caused by environmental dependencies of the software under
test, such as the current time/date of the system. This problem
is particularly frequent for Time, but also occurs in the other
projects. For example, detecting the fault in Lang-8 requires a
call to the method format of the FastDatePrinter class,
which takes a Calendar as input — by default, a Calendar
will be initialized to the current time.EVOSUITE addresses this problem by using a mocked
version of the concrete implementations [5]. This means that
if the program accesses the current time on the system, then
EVOSUITE provides a mocked time, so that any assertion
that depends on the time value will deterministically pass or
fail when executed at a later time. The following gives an
example for a test, generated with EVOSUITE , which uses a
mocked version of the concrete class GregorianCalendar ,
MockGregorianCalendar :
1String string0 = "Z,˜jsZ/7’{p!wd";
2int int0 = 0;
3SimpleTimeZone simpleTimeZone0 = new SimpleTimeZone(int0,
string0);
4Locale locale0 = Locale.GERMAN;
5String string1 = " *z";
6FastDatePrinter fastDatePrinter0 = new FastDatePrinter(
string1, simpleTimeZone0, locale0);
7MockGregorianCalendar mockGregorianCalendar0 = new
MockGregorianCalendar(locale0);
8String string2 = fastDatePrinter0.format((Calendar)
mockGregorianCalendar0);
9assertEquals(" *GMT", string2);
In contrast, RANDOOP does not use mocking, and for the
10 runs on the same fault, it generated 84% ﬂaky tests.
AGITAR ONEalso applies mocking, but was not able to detect
this fault, which additionally requires a speciﬁc constraint to
hold: the time zone represented by the SimpleTimeZone
instance (line 3) must differ from the time zone used in the
Calendar instance (line 7).
The faults Time-12, Time-14, and Lang-65 pose similar
challenges to the test generation tools. Note that the problem of
environment dependencies is not restricted to objects generated
explicitly by the test generator, as other classes may refer to
the system time or other external resources directly. EVOSUITE
tries to overcome this problem using bytecode instrumentation,
such that the environment dependencies can be controlled when
directly accessed by the code under test.
2)Static State: A local dependency on the static state of
the system under test can also result in ﬂaky tests, such that any
changes to the state with one test can affect the outcome of the
remaining tests. E VOSUITE explicitly tracks changes to static
variables, and resets the static state before test execution [5],
and as a result was the only tool to detect Time-11, where
classZoneInfoCompiler uses a static variable cVerbose .
The issue of static state has been raised in the context of test
generation previously [10], and has recently also been veriﬁed
in the context of manually written test suites [7], [27], [46].
D. False Positives
During our evaluation, in particular during the validation
of the test results, we encountered a number of false positives.
The RANDOOP tests contained a few false positives due to
non-deterministic failures unrelated to the fault. In particu-
lar, these tests caused an IllegalStateException by
manipulating the threading behavior in Closure. While these
tests are technically ﬂaky tests, their likelihood of failing is
very low, explaining why they never failed on the original
version when checking for ﬂaky tests. The majority of false
positives observed are caused by AGITAR ONE’s access of
private ﬁelds/methods/classes through Java reﬂection, which
breaks object-oriented principles such as encapsulation , and
AGITAR ONE’s use of aggressive mocking ,
1)Accessing Private Fields/Methods: To maximize cover-
age, AGITAR ONEuses Java reﬂection to access the private
API of the class under test. However, developers may add,remove, or change private ﬁelds or methods to improve code
quality or optimize the existing implementation. These changes
do not affect any client of the class under test as its public
API remains unchanged. Detecting regressions that are purely
related to the private API therefore increases the likelihood of
false positive test results.
Closure-3 is an example of a change of a private method,
including its signature:
1- private boolean canInline() {
2+ private boolean canInline(final Scope scope) {
3 ...
4+ case Token.NAME:
5+ Var var = scope.getOwnSlot(input.getString());
6+ if (var != null && var.getParentNode().isCatch()) {
7+ return true;
8+ } ...
While AGITAR ONEgenerated a test that detects this change
with a NoSuchMethodException , the test does not fail
because of the root cause — that is, the test does not cover the
Token.NAME case and would therefore pass if the method
signature would remain unchanged. Overall, AGITAR ONE
suffered 26 (12%) false positives caused by the use of reﬂection.
2)Aggressive Mocking: Another example for breaking
encapsulation is AGITAR ONE’saggressive mocking , which
monitors and asserts on the internal state (e.g., the order of
method calls) of the class under test, rather than testing the class
on what its public method returns, and on the side effects it
has on its input parameters once its methods have completed to
execute. How such input objects are manipulated is an internal
detail that is not part of the public interface speciﬁcation. As
such, it can change without modifying the semantics of the
methods. Consider the following example:
1public int sum(Foo foo){
2- return foo.getX() + foo.getY();
3+ return foo.getY() + foo.getX();
4}
IfgetY andgetX are pure (i.e., no side effects), then that
function can be refactored as shown, and the order in which the
function sum calls the methods in Foo is irrelevant. However,
an aggressive mocking strategy would check the order in which
the mocks are used, and fail if a different one is encountered.
For example, consider Closure-5, where the developers
added a check to handle the special case of a deleted property:
1+ if (gramps.isDelProp()) {
2+ return false;
3+ }
A valid way to detect this bug would be by using an assertion on
the return value. However, with AGITAR ONE’s aggressive mock-
ing, adding such a method call would lead to a failure without
even evaluating isDelProp , as the method is unexpected
and thus triggers a TestException , indicating an error
originating in AGITAR ONE’s mocking framework. Similarly,
deleting the method call would trigger a TestException
for any subsequent method call on the same object — in neither
case would the actual return value be considered.
For 67 faults, AGITAR ONEgenerated a test that failed with
aTestException and a failure message referring to an
“unexpected method”. Such a mocking error may be a true
positive if there is a speciﬁcation on the order of method
calls when communicating with external classes/resources.
However, manual investigation of the bug descriptions of these
67 faults suggests that none of them are related to such aspeciﬁcation. We therefore consider each test that fails due to
aTestException as a false positive caused by mocking.
Applying this interpretation, 31% of all test suites generated
byAGITAR ONEsuffered from false positives due to the use
of aggressive mocking (10 of these test suites additionally
include false positives due to accessing private methods/ﬁelds
with reﬂection). However, note that this may be an over-
approximation because a mocking exception could be caused
by a state change induced by the bug.
V. R ELATED WORK
The most closely related work to ours is that of Xiao
et al. [43], who identify two main problems when aiming
to achieve high code coverage with generated tests, external
method calls andcomplex object creation . The external method
call problem is related to the environment dependencies issue
(Section IV-C 1) that we saw in terms of relation to date and time.
Just like EVOSUITE uses mocking to overcome dependencies
on time or ﬁles [5], this is also possible, for example, for
database applications [37]. We also saw several instances of
the complex object creation problem in the faults we analyzed.
Xiao et al. [43] propose a collaborative approach between the
tools and the developers, such that the underlying coverage
problems is reported back to the developer to provide further
guidance to the tool. The aim of our analysis is to identify
problems that prevent automated test generation tools from
ﬁnding faults rather than just covering code, with the hope to
improve these tools in the future to ﬁnd more faults.
There have been studies of the effectiveness of various
software defect detection techniques, e.g., [29], [34], [42].
Generally, these studies showed that different techniques are
complementary and dependent on the underlying faults; we
saw similar results in our study: The individual performance
of each of the tools in our study lies beneath the potential of
combining all the tools.
VI. C ONCLUSIONS
Automated unit test generation tools are typically evaluated
in terms of the code coverage that they can achieve on open
source software projects. This paper contributes a systematic
study of the fault detection potential of the generated test
suites, using three state-of-the-art test generation tools and the
Defects4J dataset. The results show that 1) the test generation
tools ﬁnd 55.7% of faults, but no tool alone ﬁnds more than
40.6% of faults. 2) Achieving code coverage remains a problem:
16.2% of the faults were never even executed by the generated
tests, and 26.6% of the test suites that did not reveal a fault did
not even cover the fault partially; however, 3) 63.3% of the non-
found faults were covered by automatically generated tests at
least once, suggesting problems that go beyond code coverage.
One speciﬁc issue is that 15.2% of all tests were ﬂaky. In order
to guide future research on automated unit test generation, we
investigated the challenges that need to be addressed in order to
improve fault detection, and our qualitative analysis of difﬁcult
to ﬁnd faults reveals speciﬁc challenges that prevent tools from
achieving the required code coverage and generation of test
oracles. We hope that our insights will lead to future research
to address these challenges, and our data will serve to evaluate
the progress of research on automated unit test generation.
