ABSTRACT
Mobile apps have become ubiquitous. For app developers, it is a
key priority to ensure their apps’ correctness and reliability. How-
ever, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes,
weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of
the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful
insights to guide developers,or help improve testing and analysis
tools. However, such studies do not exist — this paper fills this gap.
Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique ex-
ception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed
thatframework-specificexceptions accountforthemajorityofthese
crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-
specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying
their characteristics ( e.g., manifestation locations, common fault
categories),(2)evaluatingtheirmanifestationviastate-of-the-art
bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the
insightstheyprovide,thesefindingsmotivateandenablefollow-up
researchonmobileapps,suchasbugdetection,faultlocalization
and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of
our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and
implementedExLocator,anexceptionlocalizationtool,forAndroid
apps.Stoatisabletoquicklyuncoverthreepreviously-unknown,
confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capa-
ble of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in
real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available
to share with and benefit the community.

1 INTRODUCTION
Mobileapplicationshavegainedgreatpopularityinrecentyears.
Forexample,GooglePlay,themostpopularAndroidmarket,has
overthreemillionapps,andmorethan50,000appsarecontinuously
published on it each month [ 6]. To ensure competitive edge, app
developers and companies strive to deliver high-quality apps. One
of their primary concerns is to prevent fail-stop errors, such as app
crashes from occuring in release versions.
Despite the availability of off-the-shelf testing platforms ( e.g.,
Roboelectric[ 76],JUnit[50],Appium[ 7]),andstaticcheckingtools
(e.g., Lint [31], FindBugs [ 23], SonarQube [ 82]) [51,53], many re-
leased apps still suffer from crashes — two recent efforts [ 63,85]
discovered hundreds of previously unknown crashes in popular
and well-tested commercial apps. Moreover, researchers have con-
tributed a line of work [ 3,5,10,17,43,44,60,61,63,83–85,88,91]
to detect app crashes, but none of them have investigated the root
causes. It leaves developers unaware of how to avoid and fix these
bugs, and hinders the improvement of bug dete ction, fault localiza-
tion [48,66,81,90], and fixing [ 25] techniques. As observed by our
investigation on 272,629 issues from 2,174 Android apps hosted on
GithubandGoogleCode,developersareunabletoresolvenearly
40% reported crashes,1which greatly compromises app quality.
This situation underlines the importance of characterizing a
largenumberofdiversereal-worldappcrashesandinvestigating
how to effectively detect and fix them. However, such a study is
difficult and yet to be carried out, which has motivated this work.
When an app crashes, the Android runtime system will dump
an exception trace that provides certain clues of the issue ( e.g., the
exception type, message, and the invoked methods). Each excep-
tion can be classified into one of three categories — application
exception, framework exception, and library exception — based on
1Filtered by the keywords “crash” or “exception” in their issue descriptions.

study focuseson frameworkexceptions, whichaccount formajor-
ityofappcrashes(affectingover75%oftheprojects),asrevealed

Wefacetwokeychallengesincarryingoutthestudy.Thefirstis

a comprehensive set of crashes from a large number of real-world
apps. Ideally, for each crash, it includes exception trace, buggy
sourcecode,bug-triggeringinputs,andthepatches(ifexists).How-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, no such dataset is publicly
available. Despite open-source project hosting platforms maintain
issue repositories, such as Github, our investigation reveals only
asmallsetofcrashissues(16%)areaccompaniedwithexception

ingoftheapplicationlogicaswellastheAndroidframework(or
libraries). It is also necessary to cross-validate the root causes ( e.g.,
reproducing crashes, investigating knowledge from developers).
However, no reliable tool exists that can facilitate our analysis.
To overcome these challenges and conduct this study, we made
substantialefforts.Wehavecollected16,245uniqueexceptiontraces
from 2,486 open-source Android apps by (1) mining their issue
repositorieshostedonGithubandGoogleCode;and(2)applying
state-of-the-artapptestingtools(Monkey[ 34],Sapienz[ 63],and
Stoat [85]) on their recent versions (corresponding to 4,560 exe-
cutables)tocomplementthemineddata.Thewholedatacollection
processtookfourmonths.Weidentified8,243uniqueframework
exceptions, and spent nearly six person-months carefully inves-tigating these crashes by examining the source code of apps and
theAndroidframework,fixesfromdevelopers,bugreportsfrom
testing tools, and technical posts on Stack Overflow. We aim to
answer the following research questions:
•RQ1:Compared with other exception categories, are framework
exceptions recurring that affect most Android apps?
•RQ2:What arethe common faults madeby developers thatcause
framework exceptions?
•RQ3:What is the current status of bug detection techniques on
detecting framework exceptions? Are they effective?
•RQ4:Howdodevelopersfixframeworkexceptions?Arethereany
common practices? What are the difficulties for fixing?
Through answering the above questions, we aim to characterize
Androidappcrashes(causedbyframeworkexceptionsinparticular)
andprovideusefulfindingstodevelopersaswellasresearchers.For
example,ourinvestigation revealsframeworke xceptionsareindeed
recurring.Moreover,theyrequiremorefixingefforts(onaverage
4daysperexception)buthavelowerissueclosingrate(only53%)
than applicationexceptions (67%). Throughcareful inspection, we
distilled 11 common faults that developers are most likely to make,
yet have not been well-investigated by previous work [18, 45, 92].
Wefurtherevaluatethedetectionabilitiesofcurrentdynamic
testing and static analysis techniques on framework exceptions.
We are surprised to find static analysis tools are almost completely
ineffective (only gives correct warnings on 4 out of total 77 excep-
tion instances), although there are some plausible ways to improve
them. Dynamic testing tools, as expected, can reveal frameworkexceptions, but still far from effective on certain fault categories.
Theirtestingstrategieshaveabigimpactonthedetectionability.
In addition, we find most exceptions can be fixed by four common
practiceswithsmallpatches(lessthan20codelines),butdevelopers
still face several challenges during fixing.
Our findings enables several follow-up research, e.g., bug de-
tection,faultlocalization,andpatchgenerationforandroidapps.
To demonstrate the usefulness of our findings, we have optimized
Stoat,adynamictestingtool,andimplementedExLocator,anexcep-
tionlocalizationtool,forandroidapps.Theresultsarepromising:
Stoat quickly revealed 3 previously unknown bugs in Gmail and
Google+;ExLocatorisabletopreciselylocalizetherootcausesof

To summarize, this paper makes the following contributions:
•To our knowledge, we conducted the first large-scale study to
characterizeframework-specificexceptionsinAndroidapps,and
identified 11 common fault categories that developers are most
likelytomake.Theresultsprovideusefulinsightsfordevelopers
and researchers.
•Our study evaluated the state-of-the-art exception detection
techniques,andidentifiedcommonfixingpracticesofframework

bug detection and fixing techniques.
•Ourfindingsenableseveralfollow-upresearchwithalarge-scale
and reusable dataset [ 21] that contains 16,245 unique exception
traces from 2,486 open-source apps. Our prototype tools also
demonstrate the usefulness of our findings.
2 PRELIMINARY
2.1 Existing Fault Study
Researchers have investigated Android and Symbian OSes’ fail-
ures [62] and Windows Phone app crashes [ 75]. As for the bugs of
Androidapps,anumberofstudiesexistindifferentaspects:perfor-
mance [55], energy [ 11], fragmentation [ 89], memory leak [ 78,79],
GUI failures [ 1,4], resource usage [ 54,56], API stability [ 64], se-
curity [20,65] andetc. However, none of them focus on functional
bugs, which are also critical to user loyalty and app success. Our
work focuses on this scope.
Oneofthefirstattemptsatclassifyingfunctionalbugsisfrom
Huet al.[45]. They classify 8 bug types from 10 apps. Other ef-
forts [18,92], however, have different goals: Coelho et al.[18] ana-
lyzeexceptionstoinvestigatethebughazardsofexception-handling
code (e.g., cross-type exception wrapping), Zaeem et al.[92] study
bugstogeneratetestingoraclesforaspecificsetofbugtypes.None
ofthemgiveacomprehensiveanalysis,andthevalidityoftheircon-
clusions are unclear. Therefore, to our knowledge, we are the first
to investigate Android app crashes, and give an in-depth analysis.
Our study focuses on the framework-specific exceptions (frame-
work exception for short throughout the paper) that can crash apps,
i.e., those exceptions thrown from methods defined in the Android
framework due to an app’s violation of constraints enforced by
the framework. Note we do not consider the framework excep-
tionscausedbythebugsoftheframeworkitself.Wedonotanalyzeapplicationexceptions(leavethisasourfuturework)andlibraryex-
ceptions(sincedifferentappsmayusedifferentthird-partylibraries
whose analysis requires other information).

2.2 Exception Model in Android
AndroidappsareimplementedinJava,andthusinheritJava’sexcep-
tionmodel.Javahasthreekindsofexceptions.(1) RuntimeException ,
the exceptions that are thrown during the normal operation of the
Java Virtual Machine when the program violates the semantic con-
straints (e.g., null-pointer references, divided-by-zero errors). (2)
Error, which represents serious problems that a reasonable ap-
plication should not try to catch ( e.g.,OutOfMemeoryError ). (3)
Checked Exception (all exceptions except (1) and (2)), these ex-
ceptionsarerequiredtobedeclaredinamethodorconstructor’s

conditionsthatareasonableclientprogrammightwanttocatch.
ForRuntimeException andError, the programmers themselves
have to handle them at runtime.
Figure1showsanexampleof RuntimeException trace.Thebot-
tompartrepresentsthe rootexception, i.e.,NumberFormatException ,
which indicates the root cause of this exception. Java uses excep-
tion wrapping, i.e., one exception is caught and wrapped in another
(in this case, the RuntimeException of the top part), to propagate
exceptions. Note the root exception can be wrapped by multipleexceptions, and the flow from the bottom to the top denotes the
order of exception wrappings. An exception signaler is the method
(invalidReal in this case) that throws the exception, which is the
first method call under the root exception declaration .

We also collect other data for analysis from Stack Overflow and
static analysis tools. The details are explained as follows.

Github and Google Code . We collected exception traces from
Github and Google Code since they host over 85% (2,174/2,549)
F-droid apps. To automate data collection, we implemented a web
crawler to automatically crawl the issue repositories of these apps,
and collected the issues that contain exception traces. In detail,
the crawler visits each issue and its comments to extract valid
exception traces. Additionally, it utilizes Github and Google Code
APIs to collect project information such as package name, issue id,
number of comments, open/closed time. We took about two weeks
andsuccessfullyscanned272,629issuesfrom2,174apps,andfinally
mined 7,764 valid exception traces (6,588 unique) from 583 apps.
AutomatedTestingTools. Wesetupasfollows:(1)Wechosethree
state-of-the-art Android app testing tools with different testing
techniques: Google Monkey [ 34] (random testing), Sapienz (search-
based testing), and Stoat (model-based testing). (2) We selected
all the recent release versions (total 4,560 versions of 2,104 apps,
each app has 1∼3 recent release versions) maintained by F-droid as
testing subjects. Each tool is configured with default setting and
given 3hours to thoroughly test eachversion on asingle Android
emulator. Each emulator is configured with KitKat Android OS
(SDK 4.3.1, API level 18). The evaluation is deployed on three phys-
icalmachines(64-bitUbuntu/Linux14.04).Eachmachineruns10
emulatorsinparallel.(3)WecollectcoveragedatabyEmma[ 77]or

of Github/Google Code only record 545 unique crashes for these
recent versions, which accounts for only 5.6% of those detected
by testing tools. This indicates these detected exception traces can
effectively complement the mined exceptions.Stack Overflow.
According to exception traces mined from the
twosourcesabove,wealsocollectthemostrelevantpostsonStack

artstaticanalysis tools(Lint,PMD, FindBugs, SonarQube),which

tation [26] and use the rules below (adopted by prior work [ 18]) to
categorizeexceptions:(1) ApplicationException :thesignalerisfrom
the app itself (identified by the app’s package name). (2) Frame-
work Exception : the signaler is from the Android framework, i.e.,
from these packages: “ android.* ”, “com.android.* ”, “java.*”,
and“ javax.*”.(3)LibraryException :thesignalerisfromthecore
libraries reused by Android ( e.g.,“org.apache.* ”, “org.json.* ”,
“org.w3c.*” and etc) or third-party libraries used by the app.

accordingtotheaboverules,andshowsthenumberoftheiraffected
projects,occurrences, numberofexceptiontypes, issuedurations
(the days during the issue was opened and closed), and the fixed
issue rate (the percentage of closed issues). From the table, we
observe two important facts: (1) Framework exceptions are more
pervasiveandrecurring.Itaffects75.3%projects,andoccupies50.8%
exceptions.(2) Frameworkexceptionsrequiremorefixingeffort.On
average,ittakes2moretimeseffort(seecolumn5)tofixaframe-
work exception than an application exception
These facts are reasonable. First, most apps heavily use APIs
provided by Android Development Framework (ADF) to achieve
their functionalities. ADF enforces various constraints to ensure
thecorrectnessofapps,however,ifviolated,appsmaycrashand
throwexceptions.Second,fixingapplicationexceptionsisrelatively
easy since developers are familiar with the code logic. However,
whenfixingframeworkexceptions,theyhavetounderstandand
locate the constraints they violate, which usually takes longer.
LocationsofFrameworkExceptionManifestation .Tofurther
understand framework exceptions, we group them by the classnames of their signalers. In this way, we get more than 110 groups.
To distill our findings, we further group these classes into 17 mod-
ules. Amoduleis used to achieve either one general purpose or
stand-alonefunctionalityfromtheperspectiveofdevelopers.We
group the classes that manage the Android application model,
e.g.,Activities, Services, into App Management (corresponding to
android.app.* ); the classes that manage app data from content
providerandSQLiteintoDatabase (android.database.* );theclasses
that provide basic OS services, message passing and inter-process
communication into OS(android.os.* ). Other modules include
Widget(UI widgets), Graphics (graphics tools that handle UI draw-
ing),Fragment (one special kind of activity), WindowsManager
(manage window display) and etc.

Figure 3: Exception-proneness of Android modules for
framework exceptions (M. refers to Management)
Figure3showstheexception-pronenessofthesemodulesacross
all apps. We find App Management, Database andOSare the top
3 exception-prone modules. In App Management, the most com-
mon exceptions are ActivityNotFound (caused by no activity is
foundtohandlethegivenintent)and IllegalArgument (causedby
improper registering/unregistering Broadcast Receiver in the
activity’s callbacks) exceptions. Although Activity ,Broadcast

Answer to RQ1: Framework exceptions are pervasive, among
which App Management, Database and OS are the three most
exception-prone modules for developers.
4.2 RQ2: Taxonomy of Framework Exceptions
Thissectioninvestigatesframeworkexceptions.Weclassifythem
intodifferentcategoriesbytheirrootcauses. Rootcause,fr omthe
view of developers, is the initial cause of the exception.
ExceptionBuckets .Followingthecommonindustrialpractice,we
group framework exceptions into different buckets. Each bucket
containstheexceptionsthatsharethesimilarrootcause.Toachieve
this,weusetheexceptiontype,messageandsignalertoapproxi-
matetherootcause.Forexample,theexceptioninFigure1islabeled
as (NumberFormatException ,“invalid double ”,invalidReal ). Fi-
nally, we get 2,016 buckets, and find the exceptions from the top
200 buckets have occupied over 80% of all exceptions. The remain-
ing20%bucketshaveonly5exceptionsorfewerineachofthem.
Therefore, we focus on the exceptions of the top 200 buckets.
Analysis Methods . We randomly select a number of exceptions
from each bucket, and use three complementary resources to fa-
cilitate root cause analysis: (1) Exception-Fix Repository. We set up
a repository that contains pairs of exceptions and their fixes. In
particular,(i)from2,035AndroidappshostedonGithub,wemined
284frameworkexceptionissuesthatareclosedwithcorresponding
patches. To set up this mapping, we checked each commit message
by identifying the keywords “fix”/“resolve”/“close” and the issue id.
(ii)Wealsomanuallycheckedtheremainingissuestoincludevalid
ones that are missed by the keyword rules. We finally got 194 valid
issues. Weinvestigate each exception trace and its patchto under-
standtherootcauses.(2) ExceptionInstancesRepository.Fr omthe

to facilitate analysis by using available reproducing information.
(3)TechnicalPosts.Foreachexceptiontype,wereferredtotheposts

information from developers and cross-validate our understanding.
Taxonomy .Weanalyzed86exceptiontypes2(covering84.6%ofall
framework exceptions), and finally distilled 11 common faults that
developers are most likely to make. Table 3 lists them by the order
of closing rate from highest to lowest. We explain them as follows.
•Component Lifecycle Error . Android apps are comprised of dif-
ferent components. Each component is required to follow a pre-
scribed lifecycle paradigm, which defines how the component is
created, used and destroyed [ 39]. For example, Activity provides
a core set of six callbacks to allow developers to know its cur-rent state. If developers improperly handle the callbacks or miss
state checking before some tasks, the app can be fragile consid-ering the complex environment interplay (
e.g., device rotation,

them are triggered by null object references. So we did not continue to analyze them.	  " # /

NoteSyncTask every time when a note sync is requested, which
connects withthe remote severand updatesthe local databaseby
calling updateNote() .However,whenther earemultipleupdate
threads,suchinterleavingmayhappenandcrashtheapp: Thread
Aisexecutingtheupdate,and ThreadB getsthereferenceofthe
database; Thread A closes the database after the task is finished,
andThread B tries to update the closed database. The develop-
ers fixed this exception by leaving the database unclosed (since
SQLiteDatabase alreadyimplementedthread-safedatabaseaccess
mechanism) in revision aa1a972 [73].
•UIUpdate Error .EachAndroidappownsaUIthread,whichis
in charge of dispatching events and rendering user interface. To
ensure good responsiveness, apps should offload intensive tasks
to background threads. H owever, many dev elopers fail to keep
in mind that Android UI toolkit is not thread-safe and one should
not manipulate UI from a background thread [37].cgeo[15] (Fig-
ure 6) is a popular full-featured client for geocaching. When re-
freshing cacheList (cacheList is associated with a ListView via
anArrayAdapter ), the developers query the database and sub-
stitute this list with new results (via clear() andaddAll() )i n
doInbackground . However, the app crashes when the list is re-
freshed. The reason is that cacheList is maintained by the UI
thread, which internally checks the equality of item counts be-tween
ListView andcacheList . But when a background thread
touches cacheList , the checking will fail and an exception will
be thrown. The developer realized this, and fixed it by moving the
refreshingoperationsinto onPostExecute ,whichinsteadrunsin
the UI thread (in revision d6b4e4d [16]).
•FrameworkConstraintError .Androidframeworkenforcesvar-
ious constraints for app development. For example, Handler is
part of Android framework for managing threads, which allows to
sendandprocessmessagesorrunnableobjectsassociatedwitha
thread’smessagequeue[ 29].Each Handler instancemustbeassoci-
atedwithasinglethreadandthemessagequeueofthisthread3.Other-
wise, a runtime exception will be thrown. Local-GSM-Backend [57]
(Figure 7), a popular cell-tower based location lookup app, uses
a thread workerto monitor the changes of telephony states via
PhoneStateListener .However,thedevelopersareunawarethat
PhoneStateListener internallymaintainsa Handlerinstanceto
deliver messages [ 36], and thus requires setting up a message loop
inworker. They later fixed it by calling Looper#prepare() (in
revision 07e4a759 [ 58]). Other constraints include performance
3A thread by default is not associated with a message queue; to create it,
Looper#prepare() should be called in the thread [32].!" *	   +,

•DatabaseManagementError .Impropermanipulatingdatabase

(Figure 8) is a popular app for managing the reading and watching
ofanime.Whentheuserupgradesfromv1.2tov1.3,theappcrashes

called if no old version database file exists, so the new database
tablefriendsisnotsuccessfullycreatedwhenupgrading.Instead,
onUpgrade() is called, it crashes the app because the table friends
does not exist (fixed in revision b311ec3 [9]).
•API Updates and Compatibility . Android system is evolving

Forexample, OutOfMemoryError occursifloadingtoolargeBitmaps;

but no valid audio/video data is received.
•XML Design Error . Android supports UI design and resource
configuration in the form of XML files. Although IDE tools have
providedmuchconvenience,mistakesstillexist, e.g.,misspelling
custom UIcontrol names,forgetting toescape special characters
(e.g., “$”, “%”) in string texts, failing to specify correct resources in
colors.xml andstrings.xml.
•API Parameter Error . Developers make this type of mistakes
when they fail to consider all possible input contents or formats,
and feed malformed inputs as the parameters of APIs. For example,
they tend to directly use the results from SharedPreference or
database queries without any checking.
•Resource Not Found Error .Androidappsheavilyuseexternal

4.3 RQ3: Auditing Bug Detection Tools
Dynamictestingand staticanalysisarethe twomainavenuesto
helpdetectsoftwarebugs.Thissectioninvestigatesthedetection
abilities of these two techniques on framework exceptions (catego-
rizedinSection4.2).Inparticular,weselectthreestate-of-the-art
testing tools, i.e., Monkey, Sapienz, and Stoat; and four static analy-
sistoolswidelyusedbyandroiddevelopers[ 53],i.e.,Lint,FindBugs,
PMD,andSonarQube.Lint,developedbyGoogle,detectscodestruc-
tural problems, and scans for android-specific bugs [ 27]. PMD uses
defect patterns to detect bad coding practices. FindBugs, provided
as a plugin in Android Studio, also enforces various checking rules,
andadoptscontrol-anddata-flowanalysistoscanpotentialbugs
(e.g., null-pointer dereferences). SonarQube is a continuous code
quality platform that provides bug reports for suspicious code.
Static Analysis Tools . We randomly select 75 distinct exception
instances (corresponding to column 4 in Table 3) from Github that
coverallmanifestationsofrootfaults,andcheckoutthecorrespond-
ing buggy code version to investigate how many of them can bedetectedbystaticanalysistools.Ourinvestigationfindsstatictoolsspecializeindetectingbadpractices,codesmells,andpotentialbugs
that may lead to severe errors, but with a mass of false alarms.
As shown in Table 3, FindBugs, PMD, and SonarQube fail to
report any warnings on these bugs. Lint only identifies 4 out of 75
bugs, whichinclude oneXML error(the resource file“string.xml”
containsanillegalcharacter“$”)andthreeframeworkconstraint
errors (duplicate resource ids within a layout file; Fragment cannot
be instantiated; using the wrong AppCompat method). In addition,
although these tools claim to support android projects, we have
notfoundanyandroid-specificrulesinFindBugsandSonarQube,
and only three android rules [ 74] in PMD. Lint defines 281 android
rules [27] but detects only a few bugs. Therefore, the current static
analysis tools focus more on basic Java defects, and much less
effective in detecting framework exceptions of Android apps.Dynamic Testing Tool
. We apply testing tools on each app (total
2,104) with the same configuration in Section 3.2. As we observed,
theycandetectmanyframeworkexceptions.Tounderstandtheir
abilities, we use two metrics4. (1)detection time (the time to detect
anexception).Sinceoneexceptionmaybefoundmultipletimes,weusethetimeofitsfirstoccurrence.(2) Occurrences (howmanytimes
an exception is detected during a specified duration). Figure 9 and
Figure10,respectively,showthedetectiontimeandoccurrencesof
exceptions by each tool grouped by the fault categories.
Figure 9 shows concurrency errors are hard to detect for all
threetools(requiringlongertime).Butforotherfaultcategories,
the time varies on different tools. For example, Sapienz is betterat database errors (since Sapienz implements a strategy,
i.e., fill
strings in EditText s, and then click “OK” instead of “Cancel” to
maximizecodecoverage,whichismorelikelytotriggerdatabase
operations);MonkeyandSapienzarebetteratlifecycleerrors(sincebothofthememiteventsveryquicklywithoutwaitingtheprevious
ones to take effect, e.g., open and quickly close an activity without
waiting the activity finishes its task). Figure 10 shows it is easy for
three tools to detect API compatibility, Resource-Not-Found and
XML errorssince the occurrencesof these errors aremuch more
thanthoseoftheothers.Butforothercategories, e.g.,Concurrency,
Lifecyle,Memory,UIupdateerrors,allofthreetoolsarefarfrom

dump the exact trace that causes a crash. Instead, they output the whole trace, which
cannot reflect their detection abilities.

Figure 9: Detection time of exceptions by each tool
Figure 10: Occurrences of exceptions by each tool
effectiveregardlessoftheirtestingstrategies.Themainreasonis
that these errors contain non-determinism (interact with threads).
After an in-depth inspection, we find that some Database errors
are hard to trigger because the app has to construct an appropriate
database state ( e.g., createa table or inserta row, and fill inspecific
data)asthepreconditionofthebug,whichmaytakealongtime.As
for Framework Constraint errors, some exceptions require special
environmentinterplay.Forexample, InstantiationException of
FragmentcanonlybetriggeredwhenaFragment(withoutanempty
constructor)isdestroyedandrecreated.Toachievethis,atesting
toolneedstochangedevicerotationatanappropriatetiming(when
the target Fragment is on the screen), or pause and stop the app by
switchingtoanotherone,andstaythereforalongtime(letAndroid
OSkilltheapp),andthenreturnbacktotheapp.Concurrencybugs
are hard to trigger since they usually need right timings of events.

•MoveCodeintoCorrectThread .MessingupUIandbackground

suchproblemsistomoverelatedcodeintocorrectthreads.Figure12
fixes CalledFromWrongThread by moving the code of modifying
UIwidgetsbacktotheUIthread(via Activity#runOnUiThread() )
that creates them. Similar fixes include moving the showings of
ToastorAlertDialog intotheUIthreadinsteadofthebackground
thread since they can only be processed in the Looperof the UI
thread [24,67]. Additionally, moving extensive tasks ( e.g., network
access, database query) into background thread can resolve such
performance exceptions as NetworkOnMainThread and “Applica-
tion Not Responding" (ANR) [30].
•WorkinRightCallbacks . Inappropriate handling lifecycle call-
backs of app components ( e.g.,Activity ,Fragment ,Service) can
severely affect the robustness of apps. The common practice to
fix such problems is to work in the right callback. For example, in
Activity , putting BroadcastReceiver ’s register and unregister
intoonStart() andOnStop() oronResume() andOnPause() can
avoid IllegalArgument ;andcommittinga FragmentTransaction

require fewer code changes (most patches are less than 20 lines).
Because most of themcan be fixed by refining conditionalchecks.
We also note UI Error,Concurrency Error, and Memory/Hardware
Errorrequire larger code patches.
Further, by investigating the discussions and comments of de-
velopers when fixing, we find three important reasons that reveal
the difficulties they face.
•DifficultyofReproducingandValidation .Onemaindifficulty
is how to reproduce exceptions and validate the correctness of
fixes [68]. Most users do not report complete reproducing steps/in-
puts and other necessary information ( e.g., exception trace, device
model,codeversion)todevelopers.Eveniftheexceptiontraceis
provided,reproducingsuchexceptionsasnon-deterministicones
(e.g.,concurrencyerrors)isratherdifficult.Insuchcases,afterfixing
theissue,theychoosetoleaveitfortheappuserstovalidatebefore
closing the issue. As shown in Figure 13 and Table 3, concurrency
errors have longer issue durations and lower fixing rate.
•Inexperience with Android System . A good understanding of
Android system is essential to correctly fix exceptions. As the clos-
ing rates in Table 3 indicate, developers are more confused by
Memory/HardwareError,LifecycleError,ConcurrencyError,and
5To reduce “noises", we exclude comment lines ( e.g., “//...”), annotation lines ( e.g.,
“@Override”), unrelated code changes (e.g., “import *.*”, the code for new features).UI Error. We find some developers use simple try-catch or compro-
misingways( e.g.,use commitAllowingStateLoss toallowactivity
state loss) as workarounds. However, such fixes are often fragile.•Fast Evolving APIs and Features
. Android is evolving fast. As
reported,onaverage,115APIupdatesoccureachmonth[ 64].More-
over, feature changes are continuously introduced. However, these
updates or changes may make apps fragile when the platform they
aredeployedisdifferentfromtheonetheywerebuilt;andthedevel-
opers are confused when such issues appear. For example, Android
6.0introducesruntimepermissiongrant—Ifanappusesdanger-
ous permissions, developers have to get permissions from users at
runtime. However,we find several developerschoose to delaythe
fixing since they have not fully understand this new feature.
AnswertoRQ4: Refiningconditionalchecks,usingcorrectthread
types,workingintherightcallbacks,adjustingimplementation
choicesarethe4commonfixpractices.Memory/Hardware,Life-
cycle, Concurrency, and UI update Error are more difficult to fix.
4.5 Discussion
Throughthisstudy,wefind:(1)Besidesthetrivialerrors,developers
are most likely to introduce Lifecycle, Memory/Hardware, Concur-
rency, and UI update errors, which requires more fixing efforts.
(2) Bug detection tools need more enhancement. Static analysis
tools could integrate new rules especially for UI update, Lifecycle,
FrameworkConstrainterrors.Testingtoolscouldintegratespecific
testing strategies to detect these errors. (3) To counter framework
exceptions,developersshouldgainmoreunderstandingonAndroid
system;differentsupportingtoolsshouldbedevelopedtoreproduce
exceptions fordebugging, locate theirroot causesfor fixing, and
check API compatibility across different SDKs.
Linares-Vásquez et al.[52] also investigated android app bugs
very recently, but our study significantly differs from theirs. We
focuses on framework exceptions and givea comprehensive, deep
analysis,includingexceptionmanifestations,rootcauses,abilities
ofexistingbuganalysistools,andfixingpractices.Whiletheyfocus
ondesigningmutationoperatorsfromexistingbugs,andtheir38
operatorsonlycover8outof75instancesdistilledbyourstudy.We
believeourresultscanfurtherimproveexistingmutationoperators.
The validity of our study may be subject to some threats. (1)
Representativenessofthesubjects.Tocounterthis,wecollectedall
thesubjects(total2486appsatthetimeofourstudy)fromF-Droid,
which the largest database of open-source apps, and covers diverse
app categories. We believe these subjects are the representatives of
real-world apps. (2) Comprehensiveness of app exceptions. To collect
a comprehensive set of exception traces, we mine from Github and
GoogleCode;andapplytestingtools,whichleadstototal16,245
exceptions.Toourknowledge,thisisthelargeststudyforanalyzing
Android appexceptions. (3) Completeness/Correctness ofexception
analysis. For completeness, (i) we investigated 8,243 frameworkexceptions, and carefully inspected all common exception types.
(ii)Wesurveyedpreviouswork[ 2,3,14,18,22,40,45,46,60,61,63,
85,92]thatreportedexceptions,andobservedallexceptiontypes
and patterns were covered by our study. For correctness, we cross-
validated our analysis on each exception type, and also referred to
thepatches fromdevelopersand StackOverflowposts tovalidate
our analysis. The whole dataset is also made publicly available.

5 APPLICATIONS OF OUR STUDY
This section discusses the follow-up research motivated by our
findings, and also demonstrates usefulness by two prototype tools.
5.1 Benchmarking Android App Exceptions
OurstudyoutputsalargeandcomprehensivedatasetofAndroid
app exceptions (especially for framework exceptions), which in-
cludes total 16,245 unique app exceptions and 8,243 unique frame-
work exceptions. Each exception is accompanied with buggy code
version,exceptiontrace,errorcategory,andpossiblefixes.Webe-
lieve this dataset can (1) provide an effective and reliable basis for
comparing dynamic/static analysis tools; (2) enable the research
oninvestigatingfaultlocalizationtechniquesandgivealargeset
ofexceptionsasbenchmarks;and(3)enablepatchgenerationby
comparing the exceptions and their fixes.
5.2 Improving Exception Detection
Dynamictestingandstaticanalysisarethetwoavenuestodetect
faults.However,moreimprovementsshouldbemadeonbothsides.
Dynamic Testing . Enhancing testing tools to detect specific er-
rors is very important. For example, (1) Generate meaningful as
well as corner-case inputs to reveal parameter errors. We find ran-
dom strings with specific formats or characters are very likely
torevealunexpectedcrashes.Forinstance,Monkeydetectsmore
SQLiteException sthantheothertoolssinceitcangeneratestrings
with special characters like “"” and “%” by randomly hitting the
keyboard.WhenthesestringsareusedinSQLstatements,theycanfailSQLquerieswithoutescaping.(2) Enforceenvironmentinterplay
toreveallifecycle,concurrencyandUIupdateerrors .Wefindsome
special actions, e.g., change device orientations, start an activity
and quickly return back without waiting it to finish, put the app at
backgroundforalongtime(bycallinganotherapp)andreturnback
to it again, can affect an app’s internal states and its component
lifecycle.Therefore,theseactionscanbeinterleavedwithnormal
UIactionstoeffectivelycheckrobustness.(3) Considerdifferentapp
andSDKversionstodetectregressionerrors.Wefindappupdatesmay
introduceunexpectederrors.Forexample,asshowninFigure8,the
changes of database scheme can crash the new version since the
developershavenotcarefullymanageddatabasemigrationfromthe
old version. (4) More advanced testing criteria [49, 86] are desired.
StaticAnalysis .Incorporatingnewcheckingrulesintostaticanal-
ysis tools to enhance their abilities is highly valuable. Through our
study,wefinditisfeasibletochecksomeframeworkexceptions,
especially for framework constraint, lifecycle and UI update errors.
Forexample,towarnthepotentialcrashinFigure7,staticanalysis
can check whether the task running in the thread uses Handler
to dispatch messages, if it uses, Looper#prepare() must be called
atthebeginningof Thread#run() ;towarnthepotentialcrashin
Figure 4, static analysis can check whether there is appropriatechecking on activity state before showing a dialog from a back-
ground thread. In fact, there is already some initial work [ 40] that
implements lifecycle checking on Lint.Demonstration of Usefulness
. We enhanced Stoat [ 85] with two
strategies: (1) randomly generate inputs with 5 specific formats
(e.g., empty string, lengthy string, null) or characters ( e.g., “"”, “%”)
tofillin EditText sorIntent’sfields;(2)randomlyinject3typesof special actions mentioned above into normal UI actions. We
appliedStoatondozensofmostpopularapps( e.g.,Facebook,Gmail,
Google+, WeChat) from Google Play, and successfully detected3 previously unknown bugs in Gmail (one parameter error) and
Google+ (one UI update error and one lifecycle error). All of these
bugsweredetectedinthelatestversionsatthetimeofourstudy,
and have been reported to Google and got confirmed. However,these bugs have not been found by Monkey and Sapienz, while
other testing tools, e.g., CrashScope [ 69] and AppDoctor [ 46] only
consider 2 and 3 of these 8 enhancement cases, respectively.
5.3 Enabling Exception Localization
We find developers usually take days to fix a framework exception.
Thus, automatically locating faulty code and proposing possible
fixes are highly desirable. Our study can shed light on this goal.
DemonstrationofUsefulness . We have built a framework excep-
tionlocalizationtool,ExLocator,basedonSoot[ 87],whichtakes
asinputanAPKfileandanexceptiontrace,andoutputsareport
that explains the root cause of this exception. It currently supports
5 exception types from UI update, Lifecycle, Index, and Framework
Constraint errors (As Figure 13 shows, these errors are more dif-ficult to fix). In detail, it first extracts method call sequences and
exceptioninformationfromtheexceptiontrace,andclassifiesthe
exceptionintooneofoursummarizedfaultcategories,andthenuti-
lizesdata-/control-flowanalysistolocatetherootcause.Thereport
givesthelinesormethodsthatcausestheexception,thedescription
ofthe rootcause andpossible fixingsolutions, andcloselyrelated
Stack Overflow posts. We applied our tool on total 27 randomly
selected cases from Github, and correctly locates 25 exceptions out
of 27 (92% precision) by comparing with the patches by develop-
ers. By incorporating additional context information from Android
framework( e.g.,whichframeworkclassesuse Handler),ourtool
successfully identified the root causes of the remaining two cases.
However, all previous fault localization work [ 48,66,81,90] can
only handle general exception types.
6 CONCLUSION
Thispaperconductsalarge-scaleanalysisofframeworkexceptions
in Android apps. We constructed a comprehensive dataset that
contains 16,245 uniqueexception traces. After investigating8,243
frameworkexceptions,weidentifiedtheircharacteristics,evaluated
their manifestation via popular bug detection tools, and reviewed
their fixes. Our findings enables several follow-up research. We
demonstratedtheusefulnessofourfindingsbytwoprototypetools.
