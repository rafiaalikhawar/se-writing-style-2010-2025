ABSTRACT
 
The automotive industry adopts various approaches to reduce the 
production lead time in order to be competitive on the market. 
Due to the increasing amount of in
-
house software development, 
this indus
try gets new opportunities to decrease the software 
development lead
-
time. This can have a significant impact on 
decreasing time to market and fewer resources spent in projects. 
In this paper we present a study of software development areas 
where we percei
ved barriers for fast development and where we 
have identified enablers to overcome these barriers. We conducted 
a case study at one of the vehicle manufacturers in Sweden using 
structured interviews. Our results show that there are 21 barriers 
and 21 corr
esponding enablers spread over almost all phases of 
software development.

INTRODUCTION
 
The increasing number of electronic control units in cars leads to 
the growing complexity of software components. This, in turn, 
leads to long development lead times. The software used
 
in 
components is developed by both supplier and car vendors, often 
in parallel. However, a modern trend in automotive software 
development is to develop software in
-
house (i.e. by the car 
manufacturers themselves) or at least increase the number of 
ECUs f
or which the software is developed in
-
house. This allows 
for full control over the development, to keep specifications 
confidential and to have the same behavior of common 
functionality in all projects despite different suppliers. In order to 
reduce the so
ftware lead time that is necessary to consider the 
distinctive structure of mechatronics organizations which does not 
match com
pletely the software structure. 
There are different 
approaches used in software companies to improve the software 
development pro
cess, but in order to find the method which is 
applicable for a mechatronics organization we need to first find 
the specific barriers that prevent us from achieving high 
development speed. Once these are identified we can identify the 
enablers (usually mod
ern software development techniques) 
which can   overcome these barriers. Based on the above we 
explore the following research question in
 
this paper:
 
What are the main barriers and enablers for shortening the 
software development lead
-
time in a mechatroni
cs organization?
 
In this research project, we explore software development process 
considering the upper layer of production including design and 
verification of functions, systems and components. The 
contribution of this paper is a list of barriers and re
lated enablers 
which could be added to the current development process. We 
also outline related levels for each barrier in the current software 
development V
-
model.

ORANIZATIONAL CONTEXT
 
Case Descriptions: 
Volvo Cars 
is a manufacturer of cars and has 
a lon
g
-
term tradition of developing integrated mechanical, 
electrical/electronic and software systems. Volvo Cars is a 
Swedish car original equipment manufacturer (OEM), based in 
Gothenburg. Volvo Cars was developing software and hardware 
in a distributed softw
are development environment. For a number 
of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) both in
-
house software 
development teams develop the software 
and 
external suppliers 
who design, implement and test the functionality based on 
specifications from Volvo Cars [1].

RESEARCH METHOD AND STUDY 
DESIGN
 
In this research we performed a set of individual interviews with 
12 people. Interviewees were from Volvo Cars with at least 5 
years
’
 
experience from automotive industry and various roles 
involving commodity purchaser, tech
nical leader, technical expert, 
manager, system architect, quality assurance, integrator, system 
developer
 
and system designer. Interviews were conducted in 
English and Swedish and lasted for approximately 1 hour. In 
addition to the interviews, we used doc
umentation review and 
field notes as complementary data collection methods. The 
documents included software development documents and project

Findings & Analysis:
 
In this section, we outline the identified 
barriers in product life cycles that has an effect on software lead
-
time. 
Moreover 
we propose corr
esponding actions (enablers) that 
could be adopted by current process for resolving them.
 
The 
results from this research are outlined in figure 1 where an 
overview of production life cycles (levels 0 to 13) and barriers 
(blue diamonds) for shortening softw
are lead times are illustrated 
individually for each of the stages in V
-
model. In order to gain a 
better understanding we classify identified barriers for each 
individual level in 
separate tables.
 
 
3.1
 
Barriers
 
at the Function Definition Level
 
The barriers are
 
listed in table 1 and 
related to the processes of 
definition functions and how the projects are structured. The main 
enablers to decrease the lead
-
time for this phase include the 
alignment between project and product structure as well as the 
ways in which
 
communication is structured. 
 
3.2
 
Barriers at the System Design Level
 
The 
logical view of entire system irrespective to hardware 
is
 
provided
 
at this level
. 
The main barriers at this stage
 
are
 
listed in 
table 2. They are
 
allied
 
to inadequate requirement
s
 
provi
ded 
at 
function definition level, 
incomplete interface between nodes and 
the requirements 
that
 
are generated without 
considering the
 
software architecture.
 
The main enablers include

principles at architect level to

. This is 
achieved by dev

minimization of interaction points [7]. Another enabler is 
improving
 
the 
quality
 
at requirement level
 
through using 
approaches such as 
requirement management framework
 
[3].

Barriers at the Component
 
Design L
evel
 
As 
listed in 
table 
3
,
 
the
 
key barriers 
of this level 
are related to 
complex structure of sub
-
systems, softw
are implementation and
 
component structure
 
which
 
does not fulfill the interfaces defined 
at system level. The main enablers are improving the 
co
mmunication between purchasing with technical group at OEM 
and supplier and enhancing the system architect.
 
 
3.4
 
Barriers at the Component Verification 
 
The main barriers at this level are associated to supplier and 
hardware issues
 
and listed in table 4
. The
 
key enablers are 
improvement of relationship to supplier and choosing the right 
supplier for component at beginning of project, evaluating the 
products delivered from the suppliers and providing information 
required to prepare accurate cost estimation for
 
the whole project.
 
3.5
 
Barr
iers at the System Verification Level
 
Significant barrier 
at this level is mentioned 
in table 5. It is 
linked 
to 
misalignment of release plan between vari
ous software 
development teams. It 
entails to delay in verification and high r
isk 
to find critical bugs due to the short testing period. Related enabler
 
is having synchronized time plan between electrical and software 
development for harmonizing the release plans and reducing 
deviation in verification plan. All parties should approv
e this plan 
before starting the main development. 
 
3.6
 
Barriers at the Function Verification 
 
Function verification includes testing of the final implemented 
solution in a car and approving both the software and hardware 
that meet the customers expectation acc
ording to the functional 
list provided at the beginning of project. 
Table 6 shows a list of 
b
arriers 
which 
are related to sourcing plan and late verification. 
The number of resources allocated in project and the amount of 
implementation and verification in
creased as we come closer to 
the conclusion of the project. This results in finding number of 
issues in the ending phase of the project. Enablers related to this 
level are performing review on specification at each engineering 
step and applying a n
ew resou
rce planning management
.

Late evaluation of supplier solution:
 
difficult to predict 
issues related to supplier until
 
the project reaches late stages 
such as component verification phase, risk for delay in 
project time plan
 
Multiple suppliers strategy
 
and using supplier management 
techniques 
:
 
start the project parallel with at least two suppliers 
for a short time of per
iod to encourage competition between 
suppliers and raise the level of performance [8], performing 
iterative development
 
in a supplier development approach

CONCLUSIONS
 
In this study, we addressed 21 barriers preventing shortening of 
the softwar
e development lead
-
time in the automotive industry. 
As we can see in Figure 1 most barriers are allocated at the left 
site of the V
-
model where design and implementation is 
conducted. We identified that inadequate or unclear requirement is 
the common barri
er for all implementation steps. In future work, 
we aim to explore further identified barriers and determine the 
effect of individual barrier in software lead
-
time. The company is 
moving towards more iterative development and therefore more 
research will f
ollow in this area.
