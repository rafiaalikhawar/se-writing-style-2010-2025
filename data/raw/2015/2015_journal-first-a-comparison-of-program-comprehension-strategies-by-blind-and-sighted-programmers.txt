Programmers who are blind use a screen reader to speak source

Inthispaper[ 1],wepresentanempiricalstudycomparingthe
programcomprehensionstrategiesofblindandsightedprogram-
mers. We recruited twelve blind programmers to read and sum-
marize a series of Java methods. We tracked their cursor using ascreen reader extension and compared the results to a previous
eye-tracking study [ 2]. The eye-tracking study used the same java
methodswhichweretakenfromavarietyofdifferentapplication
domains. Both studies examined three code areas: method signa-
tures,methodinvocationsandcontrolflowstatements.Theseareas
have previously been suggested as being important to code com-
prehension.Theeye-tracking studymeasuredthreemetrics:gaze

https://doi.org/10.1145/3180155.3182544both blind and sighted programmers prioritize reading method sig-
natures over other areas of code. Blind programmers also returned
to method signatures more often than the rest of the method. This
finding emphasizes the importance of readable method signatures
to the process of code comprehension and suggests that blind and
sightedprogrammersuseverysimilarstrategieswhenreadingcode.
We then recruited independent experts to compare the sum-
maries produced by the blind and sighted groups. The goal was to
measurewhethertherewasany differencebetweenthedegreeof
comprehension on the part of blind and sighted programmers. The
experts took an online survey that presented them with a method
andasummaryforthatmethod.Theexpertswerenottoldwhether
the summary had been produced by a blind or sighted program-
mer. The experts answered five questions meant to rate the quality
of the summary. Possible scores ranged from “strongly disagree”
to“stronglyagree.”Therewerenodifferencesbetweenthescores
giventotheblindgroupversusthesightedgroup.Bothgroupsof
programmers obtained an equally high degree of comprehension.
Our conclusions are that 1) blind programmers employ simi-
lar code comprehension strategies as sighted programmers, and 2)
blindprogrammerscomprehendcodetothesamedegreeassighted
programmers. We hope that these findings will contribute to an
increasedfamiliaritywithandunderstandingofblindprogrammers
on the part of potential employers. We also hope that these find-
ings will lay the foundation for further investigation into potential
differences between blind and sighted programmers.
