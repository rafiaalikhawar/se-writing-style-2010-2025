Abstract: Code reviewisknowntobeanefﬁcient quality assurance technique. Manysoftware
companies today useit,usually with aprocess similar tothepatch reviewprocess inopen source
softw aredevelopment. However,there isstillalargefraction ofcompanies performing almost no
code reviewsatall.And thecompanies thatdocode reviewshavealotofvariation inthedetails
oftheir processes. Wehaveperformed agrounded theory study toclarify process variations and
their rationales. Thestudy isbased onintervie wswith softw aredevelopment professionals from 19
companies. These intervie wsprovided insights intothereasons andinﬂuencing factors behind the
adoption ornon-adoption ofcode reviewsasawhole aswell asfordifferent process variations. We
havecondensed these ﬁndings intosixhypotheses andaclassiﬁcation oftheinﬂuencing factors.
Ourresults showtheimportance ofcultural andsocial issues forreviewadoption. Theytracemany

There isalotofevidence thatInspections andother types ofcode reviewareefﬁcient
softw arequality assurance techniques. Nevertheless, theyarenotadopted throughout the
whole industry .Inmanycompanies thatdocode reviews,thereviewprocess isconverging
towardsalightweight process thatisbased ontheregular reviewofchanges [RB13] and
thatissimilar totheprocesses used bymanyopensource projects. Looking beyond the
convergence inthegeneral structure ofthereviewprocess, wefound alotofvariation
inthedetails [Ba16a], afactalso observ edinearlier studies [HTH05]. Which part of
these variations isaccidental, andwhich factors inﬂuence thechoices takenbyindustrial
practitioners?
Toassess these andother questions, weperformed aGrounded Theory [GS67] study based
onintervi ewswith24softw areengineering professionals from 19companies. Theyde-
scribed 22different cases ofcode reviewuse.Theintervie wswere semi-structured, using
open-ended questions. Thebroad research questions treated inthearticle are:Why are
code reviewsused (ornotused) byindustrial softwar edevelopment teams? andWhy are
code reviewsused thewaytheyare?
Ofthestudied companies, elevenhavearegularcode reviewprocess. Theremaining eight
only doirregular code reviews,i.e.code reviewisnotcodiﬁed intheteam’ sprocess and
used only onapersonal basis, ifatall.
Wecondensed ourﬁndings ontheadoption ofreviewsinto thefollowing hypotheses:

Likeprevious studies [BB13], wefound thatteams usecode reviewtoreach arange ofin-
tended effects: Findings defects andbetter code quality ,butforexample alsobetter knowl-
edge distrib ution, forming ofashared culture andﬁnding better solutions.
Theintervie wees mostly relied ontheir ownorcolleagues’ experiences andconsidera-
tions togainknowledge onreviewprocesses. Webpages andpractitioners’ journals and
conferences were alsoused, while scientiﬁc journals orconferences were notused atall.
Weidentiﬁed severalconte xtual factors thatinﬂuence thereviewprocess andgrouped them
intoﬁvecategories: “Culture”, “development team”, “product”, “development process”
and“tool conte xt”.Theyinﬂuence thereviewprocess directly ,mainly bymaking certain
process variants infeasible orunattracti ve.Butamajorinﬂuence isalsoexertedindirectly ,
mediated through theintended combination ofrevieweffects. This does notmean that
everyprocess choice ismade thoughtfully: Manyminorprocess aspects juststaytheway
theywereﬁrsttried. Weformulated thefollowing hypotheses forthissubject area: (5)The
