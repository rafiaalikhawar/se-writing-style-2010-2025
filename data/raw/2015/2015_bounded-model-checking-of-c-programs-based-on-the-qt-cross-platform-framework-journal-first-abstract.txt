ABSTRACT
This work proposes an abstraction of the Qt framework, named
as Qt Operational Model (QtOM), which is integrated into two
differentverificationapproaches:explicit-statemodelcheckingand
symbolic(bounded)modelchecking.Theproposedmethodology
is the first one to formally verify Qt-based applications, which
has the potential to devise new directions for software verification
of portable code. The full version of this paper is published in
SoftwareTesting,VerificationandReliability,on02March2017and

https://doi.org/10.1145/3238147.3241981To tackle this problem, Monteiro et al.[4] propose a simplified ver-
sionoftheQtframework,whichisintegratedintoamodelchecker
based on satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), known as the Effi-
cient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC) [ 2,5],
inordertoverifyactualQt-basedapplications.Importantly,such
an approach resulted in a success rate of 89% based on the devel-
oped benchmarktest suite.Furthermore, thesimplified version of
theQtframework,namedasQtOperationalModel(QtOM),was
also evaluated using other state-of-the-art verifiers for C++ pro-
grams. In fact, QtOM was combined with two different verification
approachesduring theexperimentalevaluation,i.e.,explicit-state
model checking and symbolic (bounded) model checking, which
highlights its flexibility.
Contributions. Monteiro et al.[4] extend a previous published
work by Garcia et al.[1] and Monteiro et al.[3]. QtOM was ex-
panded,inordertoincludenewfeaturesfromthemainQtmodules:
QtGUI and QtCore. Indeed, the main contributions here are (i)the
supportforsequentialandassociativetemplate-basedcontainers,
(ii)the integration of QtOM into the verification process of the
state-of-the-art C++ verifiers DIVINE and LLBMC, and (iii)the
verification of two Qt-based applications known as Locomaps and
GeoMessage. Furthermore,the employed benchmark suitewas ex-
tensivelyrevisedandexpanded,now13timesbiggerthantheprevi-ouswork,andtheperformanceofthreeSMTsolvers(i.e.,Z3,Yices,
and Boolector) was evaluated, along with the proposed approach.
Availability of Data and Tools. The performed experiments
are based on a set of publicly available benchmarks. All bench-
marks, tools, and results, associated with the current evaluation,
are available at http://esbmc.org/qtom.
