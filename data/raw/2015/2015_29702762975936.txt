ABSTRACT
Software requirement selection is to nd a subset of require-
ments (so-called optimal set) that gives the highest cus-
tomer value for a release of software while keeping the cost
within the budget. Several industrial studies however, have
demonstrated that requirements of software projects are in-
tricately interdependent and these interdependencies impact
the values of requirements. Furthermore, the strengths of
dependency relations among requirements vary in the con-
text of real-world projects. For instance, requirements can
be strongly or weakly interdependent. Therefore, it is im-
portant to consider both the existence and the strengths
of dependency relations during requirement selection. The
existing selection models however, have ignored either re-
quirement dependencies altogether or the strengths of those
dependencies. This research proposes an Integer program-
ming model for requirement selection which considers both
the existence and strengths of requirement dependencies.
We further contribute a graph-based dependency modeling
technique for capturing requirement dependencies and the
their corresponding strengths. Automated/semi-automated
techniques will also be devised to identify requirement de-
pendencies and the strengths of those dependencies.

1. RESEARCH PROBLEM
Due to the budget constraints, it is hardly if ever possible
to fully implement the requirements of a software release [2].Therefore, requirement selection is needed to nd an optimal
set of requirements with the highest customer value while
keeping the cost within the budget [26, 9, 21]. This prob-
lem, also known as the Next Release Problem (NRP) [2], is
mathematically formulated as a Binary Knapsack Problem
(BKP) [34].
Based on the BKP formula, the existing selection mod-
els aim at maximizing the accumulated value of selected re-
quirements on the assumption that the customer value of an
optimal set equals to its accumulative value [15]. However,
several studies have argued that this assumption does not
hold when interdependencies exist among requirements [6,
32, 15]. The reason is that interdependent requirements in-
uence each other's values [10, 6]. As a result, excluded
requirements may impact the values of the selected require-
ments that depend on them. This is also known as the
penalty of excluding requirements [3].
Furthermore, several industrial studies have consistently
shown that requirements of software projects are highly in-
terdependent [7] and these dependency relations can be of
various strengths [9, 25, 24] in real world software projects.
For instance, requirements can weakly or strongly depend on
each other [35]. Therefore, it is important to consider both
the existence and the strengths of dependency relations to
capture the impacts of requirements on each other's values
during a requirement selection.
However, the existing requirement selection models either
assume that requirements are independent [19, 38, 11, 12,
18, 17] or they formulate interdependencies as precedence
constrains of BKP formula without considering the strengths
of dependency relations [1, 23, 34, 4, 30, 8, 31, 5, 36, 33, 13,
37, 16, 22, 28, 2]. As such, by excluding a requirement
from the optimal set, all of its dependent requirements also
have to be excluded even if budget is available to implement
them [20]. We refer to this situation as Selection Deciency
Problem (SDP) . As a result of SDP, any small increase in the
number of dependency relations would dramatically depre-
ciate the accumulated value of optimal set [20]. Therefore
SDP can severely impact the eciency of BKP-PC models.
2. RELATED WORK
It is important to consider the impact of interdependen-
cies during a requirement selection process [10, 6]. In this
context, the existing requirement selection models can be
categorized into two distinct groups. The rst group of se-
lection models [38, 19, 11, 12, 18, 17] referred to as BKP
models are solely based on the classical formulation of the

denote the value and the cost of rirespectively. Also, bde-
notes the available budget of the release. A binary variable

or not ( xi= 0).
As given by (1)-(3), BKP models nd a subset of Rthat

To consider requirement interdependencies, another group
of selection models [1, 23, 34, 4, 30, 8, 31, 5, 36, 33, 13, 37,
16, 22, 28, 2] referred to as BKP-PC models formulate de-
pendency relations as precedence constrains of BKP formula
as given by (4)-(7).

For instance, for a given requirement set R=fr1; r2; r3g
and the set of explicit dependencies D=fd1: (r1; r2),d2:
(r2; r3)g. The dependency relation d1from r1tor2means
that for r1to be satised, r2also needs to be implemented.
Therefore, requirement r1can not be included in the optimal
set unless r2is also included. In a similar way, d2expresses
that requirement r2can not be selected unless r3is also
selected. Constraint (6) formulates these dependencies as
precedence constraints PCS =fx1x2; x2x3g. It is
clear that the implicit dependency relation d3: (r1; r3) can
also be implied from explicit dependencies in D.
However, BKP-PC models only capture the existence/non-
existence of dependency relations but not their strengths [9,
25, 24]. As such, a requirement can not be selected even in
the presence of sucient budget unless all of its dependent
requirements are also selected. Consequently, any small in-
crease in the number of dependency relations would largely
depreciate the accumulated value of selected requirements [20].
We refer to this problem which can severely impact the ef-
ciency of BKP-PC models as selection deciency problem
(SDP ).
In one study, Chen et al. [20] presented a BKP-PC model
and simulated it for dierent number of dependency rela-
tionships. They concluded that a 2% increase in the num-
ber of dependency relationships would lead to almost 10%
decrease in the accumulated value of the optimal set. The
SDP occurs if the condition (8) holds. In this equation the
dependency set Dspecies the explicit dependency relations
among a set of requirements R=fr1; :::; r ngwhich Ris par-titioned into two distinct subsets: an optimal set ORand

Akker et al. [32] took a dierent approach toward require-
ment selection by rst partitioning requirements into a set of
m1 distinct collections S=fs1; :::; s mgand then assign-
ing a collection value to each individual collection. As given
by (9)-(12), for each realized collection sjinS, the dierence
between value of collection ( wj) and its corresponding accu-
mulated valueP
rk2sjvkis added to the accumulated value
of selected requirements (Pn
i=1vi) to derive the customer
value (CV) of the optimal set. yjin (9) species whether
collection sjis fully realized ( yj= 1) or not ( yj=0) and nj

Akker's model [32] thus, factors in requirement dependen-
cies by considering the dierence between estimated values
of collections and their corresponding accumulated values.
As such, the Akker's model [32] relies on estimating the
values of collections (subsets of requirements) which can be-
come computationally as complex as O(2n) for a require-
ment set of size n. Such complexity however, may threaten
the practicality of the model considering the fact that value
estimations of such large numbers have to be performed
manually in Akker's model [32].
As one example, for a requirement set of size 20 which
is considered to be relatively small, a maximum number of
220manual estimations might be needed in worst case which
is tedious and time-consuming for software practitioners if
practical at all.
It is also worth mentioning that using heuristics [4] and ap-
proximation [29] techniques can generally reduce computa-
tional complexity of selection models making them scalable
to larger number of requirements. Such models however, do
not guarantee nding the exact optimal set [29].
3. AIMS AND METHODS
This research focuses on considering requirement depen-
dencies in software requirement selection. aims are three-
fold:
First, we aim to present an integer programming model
for requirement selection which maximizes the overall value
of selected requirements while mitigating the adverse im-
pact of selection deciency problem ( SDP ). In doing so, we
propose an integer programming model for selection of soft-
885ware requirements which not only considers the existence of
requirement dependencies, but more importantly factors in
the strengths of those dependencies. Such model also needs
to be scalable to large number of requirements. The reason
for choosing integer programing over alternative heuristic-
based [4] and approximation [29] techniques is that such
techniques do not guarantee nding the exact optimal sub-
set of requirements.
Second, we present a graph-based dependency model for
capturing requirement dependencies of various strengths to
serve as the input of the proposed selection model. Weighted
directed graphs with various algebraic structures will be ex-
plored for this purpose. The strength of an explicit depen-
dency thus can be captured by the weight of its correspond-
ing graph edge. The algebraic structure of the dependency
model should also allow for inferring implicit requirement
dependencies and their corresponding strengths.
Last but not least, we develop a reasonably ecient tech-
nique for identication of requirement dependencies and their
corresponding strengths. Software requirement dependen-
cies are traditionally identied by performing pairwise com-
parisons among requirements of software projects [7, 14, 32,
20, 30]. The number of (manual) comparisons required for
a requirement set of size nhowever, can become as complex
asO(n2) which makes dependency identication a complex
task [7] to software practitioners. Hence, we aim to reduce
this complexity and help automate/semi-automate the pro-
cess of dependency identication.
4. VALIDATION
To verify the work, simulations will be carried out and per-
formance of our proposed selection model will be compared
against that of the existing selection models. Our proposed
experimental process is illustrated by Figure 1.
The process starts with reading a requirement set. Re-
quirement dependencies and their corresponding strengths
then, will be identied and subsequently modeled by our
proposed dependency model which is a graph-based model.
A range of budgets afterwards will be specied to examine
the performance of the selection models in the presence of
various budget constraints.
At the end of each simulation, an optimal set of require-
ments will be provided by each of the experimented selection
models which allows for comparison among those models.
Simulation will be repeated for dierent datasets of vari-
ous sizes to demonstrate scalability of our proposed selection
model.
We will further study a real world software project to
demonstrate practicality of our work. A prototype will be
developed for this purpose.
