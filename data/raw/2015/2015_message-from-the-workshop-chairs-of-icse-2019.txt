Message from the Workshop Chairs of ICSE 2019 
 
   It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Workshops Tra ck of the 41st International Conference on Software 
Engineering!  
 
   The workshops at ICSE 2019 provide a forum for groups of 20‒ 50 participants to discus s topics in  software 
engineering research and practi ce. ICSE workshops serve as incu bators for scientific communities that form and 
share a particular research agen da. ICSE workshops also provide  opportunities for researchers to exchange and 
discuss scientific and engineering ideas at an early stage, bef ore they have 
matured to warrant conference or journal publication. 
 
   This year we received 44 works hop proposal submissions, a re cord for the ICSE conferen ce series! Each proposal 
was reviewed by three members of  our program committee and furt her assessed in the online discussion phase. 
 
   The program committee accepted 25 one-day and 2 two-day work shops, which cover interesting and novel topics 
in software engineering and rela ted disciplines. Four of the ac cepted workshops have been formed by combining 
pairs of workshop proposals with significant overlap – a proces s that strengthened the original proposals even 
further.

multidisciplinary aspects. We ho pe that the workshop program wi ll help to advance the state of software engineering 
research and practice by stimulating new collaborations and for ging new research communities. It has been a 
privilege working with the program committee and with each othe r across multiple time zones towards putting this 
program together.
