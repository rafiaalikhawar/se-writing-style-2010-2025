ABSTRACT
Thedevelopmentofasoftwaresystemrequirestheorchestration
of many different people using many different tools. Despite the
needforadeveloperwhoisperformingatasktounderstandthe
contextinwhichthattaskisundertaken,thetoolsweimagine,build
andprovidetosupportsoftwaredevelopersaretypicallyisolated.
Insteadofthetoolshelpingadeveloperworkwithintheappropriatecontext, it is the developer who must bring the context to the tools.
In thistalk, I will argue thatthe lack ofcontext in thesoftware
engineering tools we build limits the effectiveness of developers
and of our software development practices.

•Software and its engineering;
