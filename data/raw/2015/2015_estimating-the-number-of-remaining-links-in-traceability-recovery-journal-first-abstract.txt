ABSTRACT
Although very important in software engineering, establishing
traceabilitylinksbetweensoftwareartifactsisextremelytedious,
error-prone,anditrequiressignificanteffort.Evenwhenapproaches

of candidate traceability links produced by a Natural LanguageProcessing techniques-based recovery approach. We have evalu-ated the accuracy of the ENRL approach by considering several
ML classifiers and NLP techniques on three datasets from industry
and academia, and concerning traceability links among different
