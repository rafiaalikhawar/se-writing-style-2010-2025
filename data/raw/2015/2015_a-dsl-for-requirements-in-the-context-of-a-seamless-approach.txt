ABSTRACT
Reducing the lack of consistency between requirements and the
system that should satisfy these requirements is one of the ma-jor issue in Requirement Engineering (RE). The objective of my
thesisworkistoproposeaseamlessapproach,allowinguserstoex-press requirements, specifications and the system itself in a unique
language.
The purpose of formal approaches is to reduce inconsistency.
However,most developersare not familiarwith theseapproaches,
and they are not often used outside the critical systems domain.
Since we want that non-experts can also use our approach to vali-
datesystemsintheearlystageoftheirdevelopment,wepropose
aDomainSpecificLanguage(DSL)thatis:(i)closetonaturallan-
guage,and(ii)basedonaformalsemantics.UsingModel-Driven
Engineering(MDE),thislanguagebridgesthegapnotonlybetweenthe several stakeholders that can be involved in a project, consider-ing their different backgrounds, but also between the requirements
and the code.

1 RESEARCH PROBLEM
One of the main challenge in Requirements Engineering (RE) is to
introduce formality in the expression of requirements. If formal ap-
proachesareusedincriticalsystems,mostofthetimerequirementsare still expressed in Natural Language (NL). This can be explainedbytheforceofhabits,bythelackofknowledgeonformalmethods,

the stakeholders. However, the use of a formal approach to express
requirements shall lead to validate the systems in a rigorous way.
To overcome the difficulty of formal methods adoption, trace-
ability is often used. This can help to detect which requirements
aresatisfied–providingacoverageinformation–,butgiventhat
traceabilitylinksarenotsemanticallydefined,theselinkscannot
be automatically analyzed.
There is so a main question to address: How to link requirements
and other artifacts (such as requirements or even system parts) to au-
tomaticallyvalidateasystem? Thisquestionalsoraisestheproblem
thatincomplex systems,stakeholderswithdifferentbackgrounds
are involved and often use heterogeneous tools. INCOSE [ 1] em-
phasizesthisneedtoconciliatetheseveralviewsofasystem,and
address it as a major challenge.
These questions are critical. Indeed, a lack of consistency be-
tweenrequirementsandsystemscanleadtodramaticfailures,such
as some of the one listed in [2].
2 PREVIOUS WORKS
Aswestatedin[ 3],twoworldscanbedistinguishedinRE1.Formal
methods are, by definition, the more mathematically rigorous, and
approaches like Event-B [ 4] or VDM [ 5] have been successfully
used among years. As mentioned in section 1, the major issues
of these approaches is linked to their main advantage: there are
formal, and so, discouraging to non-experts.
That is why the most used tools, industrial ones, rely on Nat-
ural Language. IBM Rational Doors [ 6] or Reqtify [ 7] thus allow
to create traceability links between requirements, expressed in a
Microsoft Word document for example, with a part of the system –
e.g.,someCcode.SysML[ 8]alsoproposesarequirementsdiagram,
that allows users to link requirements to other parts of systems
(such as blocks). If SysML’s relationships own a type, contrary
tothepreviouslymentionedindustrialapproaches,therearenot
semantically defined.
Someapproachestrytoproposeabridgebetweenthe“formal
world" and the “NL world". For example, Relax [ 9] or Stimulus [ 10]
propose to express requirements in a constrained NL, allowing
users to express requirements as they usually do. Their approaches
arehoweversemanticallydefined–infuzzybranchingtemporal
logic[11]forRelaxandonaprogramminglanguagebasedonLucid
Synchrone [ 12] and Lutin [ 13] for Stimulus. This helps the user to
check requirements, while using an easy-to-handle tool. However,
these approaches do not address the problem of linking require-
mentstothesystem,andaremorespecificallydesignedtoeaseand
strengthen the requirements elicitation (making it rigorous).

TheSingleModelPrincipleproposedin[ 14]andadaptedin[ 15]
recommends the use of an unique paradigm to express the several
artifactsofthesystem.Thisshouldhelptoavoidthegapintroduced
by the use of several languages, allowing users to validate the

seamless idea.
3 PROPOSED APPROACH
3.1 Seamless Requirements
In[16],asetofpatternsareproposedtotransformNLrequirements
toaprogrammaticrepresentation,basedonDesignbyContracts
[17].Theserepresentations–named specificationdrivers in[18]–
shallbeusedtovalidatethatotherpartsofsystem,controlledby
these specification drivers, are complying with the requirements.
By using a programming language that integrates Design by
Contracts(suchasEiffelorJML[ 19]),thisapproachisseamless.It
allowsuserstorepresentrequirements(via specificationdrivers )and
systemimplementation(viathecode)inasameparadigm.Moreover,
the solver can be used to prove this validation (for example, the
Autoproof tool [ 20] for Eiffel), by calling it on specification drivers.
−−Require an a mbulance to be
mobilized_within_two_time_units
local
old_distance: INTEGER

from
old_distance := distance

until
mobilized = mobilize or
(distance −old_distance) >= 2
loop
mobilize_ambulance
end
ensure
is_mobilized: mobilized = mobilize
distance_less_than_two: distance −
old_distance <= 2
end
Listing 1: Example of a functional requirement from the
London Ambulance Service (LAS) system [21]expressed
with specification driver in Eiffel
Listing 1 is an example of a specification driver. This driver
controls the validation of the requirement “After being allocated,
an ambulance shall be mobilized within two time units". The mo-
bilize_ambulance feature is the controlled one – i.e., the feature
that should satisfy the requirement.
3.2 Semantics of Relationships
Since it is possible in Eiffel to express requirements and other arti-
facts,weproposetoexplicitrelationshipsbetweentheseartifacts.
We use for this purpose the Eiffel Information System (EIS) mecha-
nism.ThismechanismexploitstheEiffelnotionofnote(equivalenttoJavaannotations),thatletdevelopersputinformationintheformof:
<Notes> ::=‘note’ <Note>+
<Note>::=<Tag> ‘:’ <String> <NEWLINE>
This mechanism allows the users of EiffelStudio (the main IDE
for Eiffel) to create links between parts of code (features, classesor clusters) and other documents (such as Microsoft Word, PDF,
website,...).Ifoneofthe endpoint of this link is modified, the IDE
warn the user that a change occurred and he should probably take
care of it.
To make explicit the relationships linked to requirements ex-
pressed through specification drivers, we modify this mechanism2.
More fine grain are thus possible, allowing users to link parts of
features (such as assertions, used to express the specifications’ con-
straints).EISlinkscanalsobeusedtolinkpartsofcodebetween
themselves (for example a specification driver and the feature that
should satisfy this driver), and these relationships are now typed.
Theseaddshouldleadtoclarifytheseveralrelationshipsexisting
between artifacts.

distance_less_than_two that are used to verify the validation
of the specification driver by the feature mobilize_ambulance .
Moreover, we add semantics to these links, defined in Table 1. The
notation used in the following is:
•Riis a requirement;
•riis the specification driver of the requirement Ri;
•fis an Eiffel feature (a method or an attribute);
•ais an assertion in Eiffel (a pre or postcondition, or an in-
variant)
Table 1: Types of EIS relationships and their semantics.

These semantics can be used in two different ways:
•itshouldleadtoacompleterequirementsvalidation–e.g.,a
requirement R1that contains requirements R2andR3will
bevalidatethankstothissemanticsonlyifbothcontained
requirements are validate;
•bycheckingifthesemanticsoftherelationshipsisrespected,
users can have feedback on the matching of what they in-
tended to express and these relationships.
Thus,byaddingsemanticsonlinksbetweenrequirementsand
artifacts,wegetamorepreciseinformationonthevalidityofthe
system. Besides, we plan to explore the inverse relationships, to
detect patterns that can be used to generate relationships between
requirements. This can also help to detect relationships between
requirements coming from several stakeholders.
3.3 Addressing the Several Stakeholders
Addressing the several stakeholders is a quite difficult problem,
since they used several kinds of representations.

neering(MDE),andmodelstransformationscanbeusedtoover-
comethesegapsbetweenlanguages.Insteadofdefiningone-to-one
transformationsbetweenseverallanguages,weproposetodefinea
modeling language, that can be used as a pivot.
We called this language Requirement Specific Modeling Lan-
guage (RSML)3. It is a DSL with a concrete syntax in a NL style
(such as Stimulus or Relax), semantically defined in Eiffel.
In Fig. 1, is an example of a functional requirement expressed in
RSML.Usingpatternsmentionedinsection3.1,thisrequirement

4 EVALUATIONS
To evaluate the proposed approach, we are currently exploring
different ways of implementation.
First we want to consider different activity domains. So, we
applied the approach on two case studies, one is the embedded
systemoftheLGS([ 25]),andtheotheroneisthereactivesystem
LAS([21]),alreadyseeninthispaper.Weintendtoapplyitalsoon

an Information System, a banking system for example. It will so be
clear that RSML can apply on a large panel of activity domains.
Secondly,throughtheseapplications,wewillconsiderseveral
typesofrequirements(e.g.,timingconstraints,temporalrequire-
ments, ...). For now, the enactment of this approach on the LGS
andtheLASallowedustwicetohighlightissues.Inthefirstcase
we identified it in a set of LTL rules formalizing the LGS’ temporal
requirements ([ 16]). In the second case, the failure of the Auto-
proofsessionwaslinkedtoamisinterpretationofoneofthetiming
LAS requirements. Supporting all these types of requirements, our
approach could prove efficient to express reactive systems require-
ments.
Thirdly,wearecurrentlyimplementingtheapproachonapro-
totypethatwillbetestinthescopeofaprocessinvolvingseveral
stakeholders.Atfirst,weintendtoproposeasubjectofpractical
classestostudents,intheframeworkofREcourse.Themainideais
tosplittheclassinthreegroups.Weshallsupplythreecasestudies.
Each of the groups will have a specific case study to be handledand so a set of requirements, expressed in a MSWord document.
Every group will first supply its own RSML code, then propose the
correspondingEiffelcodewiththetraceabilitylinkstothereference
document and endly run it with Autoproof to check the validity
ofitssystem.Wewillsoprovetheusefulnessoftheapproachfor
both novices and advanced stakeholders alike.
Finally and border line, we would also like to make an experi-
mentation to see if from the RSML code of the LGS we can deduce
avalidsetofLTLconstraints.Actually,webelievethatiffroman
RSML system we can not only deduce Eiffel systems, benefiting
fromitspowerfulenvironment(EIS,Autoproof, ...),butalsoLTL
formulae,therewouldbepossibleto obtainEvent-Bsystems,and
so on. We will so enforce the usefulness of RSML, being able to use
it to exploit others formal verification languages and tools.
5 CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE
Wepresentinthispapersomesolutionstoleadtheuserstoformally
express requirements without any specific knowledge while being
able to validate them.
Weproposeforthispurposeaseamlessapproachofdevelopment.
It will reduce the gap between requirements and system, usinga unique language to express both of them, Eiffel. To ease theanalysis of the whole requirements, we define the semantics of
relationshipsthatexistbetweenrequirementsandotherartifacts.
We also present RSML, a modeling language providing a canvas to
expressrequirementsinasyntaxthatisnearfromnaturallanguage
and so, easy to handle. Since we automatically translate RSMLrequirements in Eiffel code, we are able to use an Eiffel solver to
validate the provided system. This should also help users to detect
errors in requirements or in the system that have to meet theserequirements as early as possible. This is an ongoing work, and
proposed solutions are still to improve – e.g., we are extending the
syntax of RSML and adding new relationships.
The first experiments give us some encouraging results, and we
plantoapplyourapproachtomorecomplexcasestudy(withmore
requirements), coming from diverse domains.
Oneofthemajorremainingworkisthecreationofbridgeswith
other formalisms of requirements’ modeling (e.g., SysML, KAOS,...)toinscribe our approach in a model globalization context. This
