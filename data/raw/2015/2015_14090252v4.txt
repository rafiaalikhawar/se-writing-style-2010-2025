Abstract —Sometimes debates on programming languages are
more religious than scientiﬁc. Questions about which language is
more succinct or efﬁcient, or makes developers more productive
are discussed with fervor, and their answers are too often based
on anecdotes and unsubstantiated beliefs. In this study, we use
the largely untapped research potential of Rosetta Code, a code
repository of solutions to common programming tasks in various
languages, which offers a large data set for analysis. Our study
is based on 7’087 solution programs corresponding to 745 tasks
in 8 widely used languages representing the major programming
paradigms (procedural: C and Go; object-oriented: C# and Java;
functional: F# and Haskell; scripting: Python and Ruby). Our
statistical analysis reveals, most notably, that: functional and
scripting languages are more concise than procedural and object-
oriented languages; C is hard to beat when it comes to raw
speed on large inputs, but performance differences over inputs
of moderate size are less pronounced and allow even interpreted
languages to be competitive; compiled strongly-typed languages,
where more defects can be caught at compile time, are less prone
to runtime failures than interpreted or weakly-typed languages.
We discuss implications of these results for developers, language
designers, and educators.
I. I NTRODUCTION
What is the best programming language for. . .? Questions
about programming languages and the properties of their
programs are asked often but well-founded answers are not
easily available. From an engineering viewpoint, the design
of a programming language is the result of multiple trade-
offs that achieve certain desirable properties (such as speed)
at the expense of others (such as simplicity). Technical aspects
are, however, hardly ever the only relevant concerns when
it comes to choosing a programming language. Factors as
heterogeneous as a strong supporting community, similarity
to other widespread languages, or availability of libraries are
often instrumental in deciding a language’s popularity and how
it is used in the wild [16]. If we want to reliably answer
questions about properties of programming languages, we have
to analyze, empirically, the artifacts programmers write in
those languages. Answers grounded in empirical evidence can
be valuable in helping language users and designers make
informed choices.
To control for the many factors that may affect the prop-
erties of programs, some empirical studies of programming
languages [9], [21], [24], [30] have performed controlled ex-
periments where human subjects (typically students) in highly
controlled environments solve small programming tasks in
different languages. Such controlled experiments provide the
most reliable data about the impact of certain programming
language features such as syntax and typing, but they are also
necessarily limited in scope and generalizability by the numberand types of tasks solved, and by the use of novice program-
mers as subjects. Real-world programming also develops over
far more time than that allotted for short exam-like program-
ming assignments; and produces programs that change features
and improve quality over multiple development iterations.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, empirical studies
based on analyzing programs in public repositories such as
GitHub [2], [22], [25] can count on large amounts of mature
code improved by experienced developers over substantial
time spans. Such set-ups are suitable for studies of defect
proneness and code evolution, but they also greatly complicate
analyses that require directly comparable data across different
languages: projects in code repositories target disparate cate-
gories of software, and even those in the same category (such
as “web browsers”) often differ broadly in features, design,
and style, and hence cannot be considered to be implementing
minor variants of the same task.
The study presented in this paper explores a middle ground
between highly controlled but small programming assignments
and large but incomparable software projects: programs in
Rosetta Code. The Rosetta Code repository [27] collects
solutions, written in hundreds of different languages, to an
open collection of over 700 programming tasks . Most tasks
are quite detailed descriptions of problems that go beyond
simple programming assignments, from sorting algorithms to
pattern matching and from numerical analysis to GUI program-
ming. Solutions to the same task in different languages are
thus signiﬁcant samples of what each programming language
can achieve and are directly comparable. The community of
contributors to Rosetta Code (nearly 25’000 users at the time
of writing) includes programmers that scrutinize, revise, and
improve each other’s solutions.
Our study analyzes 7’087 solution programs to 745 tasks
in 8 widely used languages representing the major program-
ming paradigms (procedural: C and Go; object-oriented: C#
and Java; functional: F# and Haskell; scripting: Python and
Ruby). The study’s research questions target various program
features including conciseness, size of executables, running
time, memory usage, and failure proneness. A quantitative
statistical analysis, cross-checked for consistency against a
careful inspection of plotted data, reveals the following main
ﬁndings about the programming languages we analyzed:
Functional and scripting languages enable writing more
concise code than procedural and object-oriented lan-
guages.
Languages that compile into bytecode produce smaller
executables than those that compile into native machine
code.arXiv:1409.0252v4  [cs.SE]  22 Jan 2015C is hard to beat when it comes to raw speed on large
inputs. Go is the runner-up, also in terms of economical
memory usage.
In contrast, performance differences between languages
shrink over inputs of moderate size, where languages with
a lightweight runtime may be competitive even if they are
interpreted.
Compiled strongly-typed languages, where more defects
can be caught at compile time, are less prone to runtime
failures than interpreted or weakly-typed languages.
Beyond the ﬁndings speciﬁc to the programs and program-
ming languages that we analyzed, our study paves the way
for follow-up research that can beneﬁt from the wealth of
data in Rosetta Code and generalize our ﬁndings to other
domains. To this end, Section IV discusses some practical
implications of these ﬁndings for developers, language de-
signers, and educators, whose choices about programming
languages can increasingly rely on a growing fact base built
on complementary sources.
The bulk of the paper describes the design of our empirical
study (Section II), and its research questions and overall results
(Section III). We refer to a detailed technical report [18] for
the complete ﬁne-grain details of the measures, statistics, and
plots. To support repetition and replication studies, we also
make the complete data available online1, together with the
scripts we wrote to produce and analyze it.
II. M ETHODOLOGY
A. The Rosetta Code repository
Rosetta Code [27] is a code repository with a wiki inter-
face. This study is based on a repository’s snapshot taken on 24
June 20142; henceforth “Rosetta Code” denotes this snapshot.
Rosetta Code is organized in 745 tasks . Each task is a
natural language description of a computational problem or
theme, such as the bubble sort algorithm or reading the JSON
data format. Contributors can provide solutions to tasks in their
favorite programming languages, or revise already available
solutions. Rosetta Code features 379 languages (with at least
one solution per language) for a total of 49’305 solutions
and 3’513’262 lines (total lines of program ﬁles). A solution
consists of a piece of code, which ideally should accurately
follow a task’s description and be self-contained (including
test inputs); that is, the code should compile and execute in a
proper environment without modiﬁcations.
Tasks signiﬁcantly differ in the detail, prescriptiveness, and
generality of their descriptions. The most detailed ones, such
as “Bubble sort”, consist of well-deﬁned algorithms, described
informally and in pseudo-code, and include tests (input/output
pairs) to demonstrate solutions. Other tasks are much vaguer
and only give a general theme, which may be inapplicable
to some languages or admit widely different solutions. For
instance, task “Memory allocation” just asks to “show how to
explicitly allocate and deallocate blocks of memory”.

Whereas even vague task descriptions may prompt well-
written solutions, our study requires comparable solutions to
clearly-deﬁned tasks. To identify them, we categorized tasks,
based on their description, according to whether they are
suitable for lines-of-code analysis ( LOC), compilation ( COMP ),
and execution ( EXEC );TCdenotes the set of tasks in a
category C. Categories are increasingly restrictive: lines-of-
code analysis only includes tasks sufﬁciently well-deﬁned
that their solutions can be considered minor variants of a
unique problem; compilation further requires that tasks de-
mand complete solutions rather than sketches or snippets;
execution further requires that tasks include meaningful inputs
and algorithmic components (typically, as opposed to data-
structure and interface deﬁnitions). As Table 1 shows, many
tasks are too vague to be used in the study, but the differences
between the tasks in the three categories are limited.
ALL LOC COMP EXEC PERF SCAL
#TASKS 745 454 452 436 50 46
Table 1: Classiﬁcation and selection of Rosetta Code tasks.
Most tasks do not describe sufﬁciently precise and varied
inputs to be usable in an analysis of runtime performance. For
instance, some tasks are computationally trivial, and hence
do not determine measurable resource usage when running;
others do not give speciﬁc inputs to be tested, and hence
solutions may run on incomparable inputs; others still are
well-deﬁned but their performance without interactive input
is immaterial, such as in the case of graphic animation tasks.
To identify tasks that can be meaningfully used in analyses of
performance, we introduced two additional categories ( PERF
and SCAL ) of tasks suitable for performance comparisons:
PERF describes “everyday” workloads that are not necessarily
very resource intensive, but whose descriptions include well-
deﬁned inputs that can be consistently used in every solution;
in contrast, SCAL describes “computing-intensive” workloads
with inputs that can easily be scaled up to substantial size and
require well-engineered solutions. For example, sorting algo-
rithms are computing-intensive tasks working on large input
lists; “Cholesky matrix decomposition” is an “everyday” task
working on two test input matrices that can be decomposed
quickly. The corresponding sets TPERF andTSCAL are disjoint
subsets of the execution tasks TEXEC; Table 1 gives their size.
C. Language selection
Rosetta Code includes solutions in 379 languages. Analyz-
ing all of them is not worth the huge effort, given that many
languages are not used in practice or cover only few tasks. To
ﬁnd a representative and signiﬁcant subset, we rank languages
according to a combination of their rankings in Rosetta Code
and in the TIOBE index [32]. A language’s Rosetta Code
ranking is based on the number of tasks for which at least
one solution in that language exists: the larger the number
of tasks the higher the ranking; Table 2 lists the top-20
languages ( LANG ) in the Rosetta Code ranking ( ROSETTA )
with the number of tasks they implement (# TASKS ). The
TIOBE programming community index [32] is a long-standing,
monthly-published language popularity ranking based on hits
2in various search engines; Table 3 lists the top-20 languages
in the TIOBE index with their TIOBE score ( TIOBE ).

Table 3: TIOBE index ranking: top 20.
A language `must satisfy two criteria to be included in
our study:
C1.`ranks in the top-50 positions in the TIOBE index;
C2.`implements at least one third ( 250) of the Rosetta
Code tasks.
Criterion C1 selects widely-used, popular languages. Criterion
C2 selects languages that can be compared on a substantial
number of tasks, conducing to statistically signiﬁcant results.
Languages in Table 2 that fulﬁll criterion C1 are shaded
(the top-20 in TIOBE are in bold); and so are languages in
Table 3 that fulﬁll criterion C2. A comparison of the two tables
indicates that some popular languages are underrepresented
in Rosetta Code, such as Objective-C, (Visual) Basic, and
Transact-SQL; conversely, some languages popular in Rosetta
Code have a low TIOBE ranking, such as Tcl, Racket, and
Perl 6.Twenty-four languages satisfy both criteria. We assign
scores to them, based on the following rules:
R1. A language `receives a TIOBE score t`=1 iff it is in
the top-20 in TIOBE (Table 3); otherwise, t`=2.
R2. A language `receives a Rosetta Code score r`corre-
sponding to its ranking in Rosetta Code (ﬁrst column in
Table 2).
Using these scores, languages are ranked in increasing lexi-
cographic order of (t`;r`). This ranking method sticks to the
same rationale as C1 (prefer popular languages) and C2 (ensure
a statistically signiﬁcant base for analysis), and helps mitigate
the role played by languages that are “hyped” in either the
TIOBE or the Rosetta Code ranking.
To cover the most popular programming paradigms, we
partition languages in four categories: procedural, object-
oriented, functional, scripting. Two languages (R and MAT-
LAB) mainly are special-purpose; hence we drop them. In
each category, we rank languages using our ranking method
and pick the top two languages. Table 4 shows the overall
ranking; the shaded rows contain the eight languages selected
for the study.

Our experiments measure properties of Rosetta Code solu-
tions in various dimensions: source-code features (such as lines
of code), compilation features (such as size of executables),
and runtime features (such as execution time). Correspond-
ingly, we have to perform the following actions for each
solution ﬁle fof every task tin each language `:
Merge: iffdepends on other ﬁles (for example, an
application consisting of two classes in two different
ﬁles), make them available in the same location where
fis;Fdenotes the resulting self-contained collection of
source ﬁles that correspond to one solution of tin`.
3No rank means that the language is not in the top-50 in the TIOBE index.
4Not represented in Rosetta Code.
5Only represented in Rosetta Code in dialect versions.
3Patch: ifFhas errors that prevent correct compilation
or execution (for example, a library is used but not
imported), correct Fas needed.
LOC: measure source-code features of F.
Compile: compile Finto native code (C, Go, and
Haskell) or bytecode (C#, F#, Java, Python); executable
denotes the ﬁles produced by compilation.6Measure
compilation features.
Run: run the executable and measure runtime features.
Actions merge and patch are solution-speciﬁc and are
required for the actions that follow. In contrast, LOC ,compile ,
and run are only language-speciﬁc and produce the actual
experimental data. To automate executing the actions to the
extent possible, we built a system of scripts that we now
describe in some detail.
Merge. We stored the information necessary for this step
in the form of makeﬁles—one for every task that requires
merging, that is such that there is no one-to-one correspon-
dence between source-code ﬁles and solutions. A makeﬁle
has one target for every task solution F, and a default all
target that builds all solution targets for the current task.
Each target’s recipe calls a placeholder script comp , passing
to it the list of input ﬁles that constitute the solution together
with other necessary solution-speciﬁc compilation ﬁles (for
example, library ﬂags for the linker). We wrote the makeﬁles
after attempting a compilation with default options for all
solution ﬁles, each compiled in isolation: we inspected all
failed compilation attempts and provided makeﬁles whenever
necessary.
Patch. We stored the information necessary for this step in
the form of diffs—one for every solution ﬁle that requires cor-
rection. We wrote the diffs after attempting a compilation with
the makeﬁles: we inspected all failed compilation attempts, and
wrote diffs whenever necessary. Some corrections could not be
expressed as diffs because they involved renaming or splitting
ﬁles (for example, some C ﬁles include both declarations and
deﬁnitions, but the former should go in separate header ﬁles);
we implemented these corrections by adding shell commands
directly in the makeﬁles.
An important decision was what to patch . We want to have
as many compiled solutions as possible, but we also do not
want to alter the Rosetta Code data before measuring it. We
did not ﬁx errors that had to do with functional correctness
or very solution-speciﬁc features. We did ﬁx simple errors:
missing library inclusions, omitted variable declarations, and
typos. These guidelines try to replicate the moves of a user
who would like to reuse Rosetta Code solutions but may not
be ﬂuent with the languages. As a result of following this
process, we have a reasonably high conﬁdence that patched
solutions are correct implementations of the tasks.
Diffs play an additional role for tasks for performance
analysis ( TPERF andTSCAL in Section II-B). Solutions to these
tasks must not only be correct but also run on the same inputs
(tasks TPERF) and on the same “large” inputs (tasks TSCAL). We
checked all solutions to tasks TPERF and patched them when
necessary to ensure they work on comparable inputs, but we

replaced by a syntax check of F.did not change the inputs themselves from those suggested in
the task descriptions. In contrast, we inspected all solutions to
tasks TSCAL and patched them by supplying task-speciﬁc inputs
that are computationally demanding. A signiﬁcant example of
computing-intensive tasks were the sorting algorithms, which
we patched to build and sort large integer arrays (generated
on the ﬂy using a linear congruential generator function with
ﬁxed seed). The input size was chosen after a few trials so
as to be feasible for most languages within a timeout of 3
minutes; for example, the sorting algorithms deal with arrays
of size from 3104elements for quadratic-time algorithms to
2106elements for linear-time algorithms.
LOC. For each language `, we wrote a script `_locthat
inputs a list of ﬁles, calls cloc7on them to count the lines of
code, and logs the results.
Compile. For each language `, we wrote a script `_compile
that inputs a list of ﬁles and compilation ﬂags, calls the appro-
priate compiler on them, and logs the results. The following
table shows the compiler versions used for each language,
as well as the optimization ﬂags. We tried to select a stable
compiler version complete with matching standard libraries,
and the best optimization level among those that are not too
aggressive or involve rigid or extreme trade-offs.
LANG COMPILER VERSION FLAGS
C gcc(GNU) 4.6.3 -O2
C# mcs(Mono 3.2.1) 3.2.1.0 -optimize
F# fsharpc (Mono 3.2.1) 3.1 -O
Go go 1.3
Haskell ghc 7.4.1 -O2
Java javac (OracleJDK 8) 1.8.0_11
Python python (CPython) 2.7.3/3.2.3
Ruby ruby 2.1.2 -c
C_compile tries to detect the C dialect ( gnu90 ,C99, . . . )
until compilation succeeds. Java _compile looks for names
of public classes in each source ﬁle and renames the ﬁles
to match the class names (as required by the Java compiler).
Python _compile tries to detect the version of Python (2.x or
3.x) until compilation succeeds. Ruby _compile only performs
a syntax check of the source (ﬂag -c), since Ruby has no
(standard) stand-alone compilation.
Run. For each language `, we wrote a script `_run that
inputs an executable name, executes it, and logs the results.
Native executables are executed directly, whereas bytecode
is executed using the appropriate virtual machines. To have
reliable performance measurements, the scripts: repeat each
execution 6 times; discard the timing of the ﬁrst execution
(to fairly accommodate bytecode languages that load virtual
machines from disk: it is only in the ﬁrst execution that
the virtual machine is loaded from disk, with corresponding
possibly signiﬁcant one-time overhead; in the successive ex-
ecutions the virtual machine is read from cache, with only
limited overhead); check that the 5 remaining execution times
are within one standard deviation of the mean; log the mean
execution time. If an execution does not terminate within a
time-out of 3 minutes it is forcefully terminated.
Overall process. A Python script orchestrates the whole
experiment. For every language `, for every task t, for each
action act2floc;compile ;rung:

41) if patches exist for any solution of tin`, apply them;
2) if no makeﬁle exists for task tin`, call script `_act
directly on each solution ﬁle foft;
3) if a makeﬁle exists, invoke it and pass `_actas command
comp to be used; the makeﬁle deﬁnes the self-contained
collection of source ﬁles Fon which the script works.
Since the command-line interface of the `_loc,`_compile , and
`_runscripts is uniform, the same makeﬁles work as recipes
for all actions act.
E. Experiments
The experiments ran on a Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64bit
GNU/Linux box with Intel Quad Core2 CPU at 2.40 GHz and
4 GB of RAM. At the end of the experiments, we extracted
all logged data for statistical analysis using R.
F . Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis targets pairwise comparisons be-
tween languages. Each comparison uses a different metric M
including lines of code (conciseness), size of the executable
(native or bytecode), CPU time, maximum RAM usage (i.e.,
maximum resident set size), number of page faults, and number
of runtime failures. Metrics are normalized as we detail below.
Let`be a programming language, ta task, and Ma metric.
`M(t)denotes the vector of measures of M, one for each
solution to task tin language `.`M(t)may be empty if there
are no solutions to task tin`. The comparison of languages X
andYbased on Mworks as follows. Consider a subset Tof the
tasks such that, for every t2T, both XandYhave at least one
solution to t.Tmay be further restricted based on a measure-
dependent criterion ; for example, to check conciseness, we
may choose to only consider a task tif both XandYhave at
least one solution that compiles without errors (solutions that
do not satisfy the criterion are discarded).
Following this procedure, each Tdetermines two data vec-
torsxa
Mandya
M, for the two languages XandY, by aggregating
the measures per task using an aggregation function a; as
aggregation functions, we normally consider both minimum
and mean. For each task t2T, the t-th component of the two
vectors xa
Mandya
Mis:
xa
M(t) =a(XM(t))=nM(t;X;Y);
ya
M(t) =a(YM(t))=nM(t;X;Y);
where nM(t;X;Y)is a normalization factor deﬁned as:
nM(t;X;Y) =min(XM(t)YM(t))if min (XM(t)YM(t))>0;
1 otherwise ;
where juxtaposing vectors denotes concatenating them. Thus,
the normalization factor is the smallest value of metric M
measured across all solutions of tinXand in Yif such a
value is positive; otherwise, when the minimum is zero, the
normalization factor is one. This deﬁnition ensures that xa
M(t)
and ya
M(t)are well-deﬁned even when a minimum of zero
occurs due to the limited precision of some measures such
as running time.As statistical test, we normally8use the Wilcoxon signed-
rank test, a paired non-parametric difference test which as-
sesses whether the mean ranks of xa
Mand of ya
Mdiffer. We
display the test results in a table, under column labeled with
language Xat row labeled with language Y, and include
various measures:
1) The p-value, which estimates the probability that chance
can explain the differences between xa
Mand ya
M. Intu-
itively, if pis small it means that there is a high chance
thatXandYexhibit a genuinely different behavior with
respect to metric M.
2) The effect size, computed as Cohen’s d, deﬁned as the
standardized mean difference: d= (xa
M ya
M)=s, where
Vis the mean of a vector V, and sis the pooled
standard deviation of the data. For statistically signiﬁcant
differences, destimates how large the difference is.
3) The signed ratio
R=sgn(fxa
M fya
M)max (fxa
M;fya
M)
min(fxa
M;fya
M)
of the largest median to the smallest median (where eVis
the median of a vector V), which gives an unstandardized
measure of the difference between the two medians.9
Sign and absolute value of Rhave direct interpretations
whenever the difference between XandYis signiﬁcant:
ifMis such that “smaller is better” (for instance, running
time), then a positive sign sgn (fxa
M fya
M)indicates that the
average solution in language Yisbetter (smaller) with
respect to Mthan the average solution in language X; the
absolute value of Rindicates how many times X is larger
than Yon average.
Throughout the paper, we will say that language X:is
signiﬁcantly different from language Y, ifp<0:01; and that it
tends to be different from Yif 0:01p<0:05. We will say that
the effect size is: vanishing ifd<0:05;small if 0:05d<0:3;
medium if 0:3d<0:7; and large ifd0:7.
G. Visualizations of language comparisons
Each results table is accompanied by a language relation-
ship graph , which helps visualize the results of the the pairwise
language relationships. In such graphs, nodes correspond to
programming languages. Two nodes `1and`2are arranged
so that their horizontal distance is roughly proportional to
the absolute value of ratio Rfor the two languages; an exact
proportional display is not possible in general, as the pairwise
ordering of languages may not be a total order. Vertical
distances are chosen only to improve readability and carry no
meaning.
Asolid arrow is drawn from node XtoYif language Y
is signiﬁcantly better than language Xin the given metric,
and a dashed arrow if Ytends to be better than X(using the
terminology from Section II-F). To improve the visual layout,
edges that express an ordered pair that is subsumed by others
are omitted, that is if X!W!Ythe edge from XtoYis

5omitted. The thickness of arrows is proportional to the effect
size; if the effect is vanishing, no arrow is drawn.
III. R ESULTS
RQ1. Which programming languages make for more con-
cise code?
To answer this question, we measure the non-blank non-
comment lines of code of solutions of tasks TLOCmarked for
lines of code count that compile without errors. The require-
ment of successful compilation ensures that only syntactically
correct programs are considered to measure conciseness. To
check the impact of this requirement, we also compared these
results with a measurement including all solutions (whether
they compile or not), obtaining qualitatively similar results.
For all research questions but RQ5, we considered both
minimum and mean as aggregation functions (Section II-F).
For brevity, the presentation describes results for only one
of them (typically the minimum). For lines of code measure-
ments, aggregating by minimum means that we consider, for
each task, the shortest solution available in the language.

Figure 6 shows the corresponding language relationship

languages, thickness denotes larger effects, and horizontal
distances are roughly proportional to average differences.
Languages are clearly divided into two groups: functional
and scripting languages tend to provide the most concise
code, whereas procedural and object-oriented languages are
signiﬁcantly more verbose. The absolute difference between
the two groups is major; for instance, Java programs are onaverage 2.2–2.9 times longer than programs in functional and
scripting languages.
Within the two groups, differences are less pronounced.
Among the scripting languages, and among the functional
languages, no statistically signiﬁcant differences exist. Python
tends to be the most concise, even against functional languages
(1.2–1.6 times shorter on average). Among procedural and
object-oriented languages, Java tends to be slightly more
concise, with small to medium effect sizes.

RQ2. Which programming languages compile into smaller
executables?
To answer this question, we measure the size of the
executables of solutions of tasks TCOMP marked for compilation
that compile without errors. We consider both native-code ex-
ecutables (C, Go, and Haskell) and bytecode executables (C#,
F#, Java, Python). Ruby’s standard programming environment
does not offer compilation to bytecode and Ruby programs are
therefore not included in the measurements for RQ2.

Figure 8: Comparison of size of executables (by minimum).
It is apparent that measuring executable sizes determines
a total order of languages, with Go producing the largest and
Python the smallest executables. Based on this order, three
consecutive groups naturally emerge: Go and Haskell compile
to native and have “large” executables; F#, C#, Java, and
Python compile to bytecode and have “small” executables; C
compiles to native but with size close to bytecode executables.
Size of bytecode does not differ much across languages:
6F#, C#, and Java executables are, on average, only 1.3–2.0
times larger than Python’s. The differences between sizes
of native executables are more spectacular, with Go’s and
Haskell’s being on average 153.3 and 111.2 times larger than
C’s. This is largely a result of Go and Haskell using static
linking by default, as opposed to gcc defaulting to dynamic
linking whenever possible. With dynamic linking, C produces
very compact binaries, which are on average a mere 2.9
times larger than Python’s bytecode. C was compiled with
level -O2optimization, which should be a reasonable middle
ground: binaries tend to be larger under more aggressive speed
optimizations, and smaller under executable size optimizations
(ﬂag -Os).

Languages that compile into bytecode have signiﬁ-
cantly smaller executables than those that compile into
native machine code.
RQ3. Which programming languages have better running-
time performance?
To answer this question, we measure the running time of
solutions of tasks TSCAL marked for running time measurements
on computing-intensive workloads that run without errors or
timeout (set to 3 minutes). As discussed in Section II-B
and Section II-D, we manually patched solutions to tasks
inTSCAL to ensure that they work on the same inputs of
substantial size. This ensures that—as is crucial for running
time measurements—all solutions used in these experiments
run on the very same inputs.

C is unchallenged over the computing-intensive tasks
TSCAL. Go is the runner-up, but signiﬁcantly slower with
medium effect size: the average Go program is 1.6 times slower
than the average C program. Programs in other languages are
much slower than Go programs, with medium to large effect
size (2.4–18.5 times slower than Go on average).


C is king on computing-intensive workloads. Go is the
runner-up. Other languages, with object-oriented or
functional features, incur further performance losses.
The results on the tasks TSCAL clearly identiﬁed the proce-
dural languages—C in particular—as the fastest. However, the
raw speed demonstrated on those tasks represents challenging
conditions that are relatively infrequent in the many classes of
applications that are not algorithmically intensive. To ﬁnd out
performance differences under other conditions, we measure
running time on the tasks TPERF, which are still clearly deﬁned
and run on the same inputs, but are not markedly computa-
tionally intensive and do not naturally scale to large instances.
Examples of such tasks are checksum algorithms (Luhn’s
credit card validation), string manipulation tasks (reversing the
space-separated words in a string), and standard system library
accesses (securing a temporary ﬁle).
The results, which we only discuss in the text for brevity,
are deﬁnitely more mixed than those related to tasks TSCAL,
which is what one could expect given that we are now looking
7into modest running times in absolute value, where every
language has at least decent performance. First of all, C loses
its undisputed supremacy, as it is not signiﬁcantly faster than
Go and Haskell—even though, when differences are statisti-
cally signiﬁcant, C remains ahead of the other languages. The
procedural languages and Haskell collectively emerge as the
fastest in tasks TPERF; none of them sticks out as thefastest
because the differences among them are insigniﬁcant and may
sensitively depend on the tasks that each language implements
in Rosetta Code. Among the other languages (C#, F#, Java,
Python, and Ruby), Python emerges as the fastest. Overall, we
conﬁrm that the distinction between TPERF andTSCAL tasks—
which we dub “everyday” and “computing-intensive”—is quite
important to understand performance differences among lan-
guages. On tasks TPERF, languages with an agile runtime, such
as the scripting languages, or with natively efﬁcient operations
on lists and string, such as Haskell, may turn out to be efﬁcient
in practice.

The distinction between “everyday” and “computing-
intensive” workloads is important when assessing
running-time performance. On “everyday” workloads,
languages may be able to compete successfully regard-
less of their programming paradigm.
RQ4. Which programming languages use memory more
efﬁciently?
To answer this question, we measure the maximum RAM
usage (i.e., maximum resident set size) of solutions of tasks
TSCAL marked for comparison on computing-intensive tasks
that run without errors or timeout; this measure includes
the memory footprint of the runtime environments. Table 12
shows the results of the statistical analysis, and Figure 13 the
corresponding language relationship graph.

Table 12: Comparison of maximum RAM used (by minimum).
C and Go clearly emerge as the languages that make the
most economical usage of RAM. Go’s frugal memory usage
(on average only 1.8 times higher than C) is remarkable,
given that its runtime includes garbage collection. In contrast,
all other languages use considerably more memory (2.5–14.2
times on average over either C or Go), which is justiﬁable
in light of their bulkier runtimes, supporting not only garbage
collection but also features such as dynamic binding (C# andC Go C#F#

Java), lazy evaluation, pattern matching (Haskell and F#),
dynamic typing, and reﬂection (Python and Ruby).
Differences between languages in the same category (pro-
cedural, scripting, and functional) are generally small or in-
signiﬁcant. The exception are object-oriented languages, where
Java uses signiﬁcantly more RAM than C# (on average, 2.4
times more). Among the other languages, Haskell emerges
as the least memory-efﬁcient, although some differences are
insigniﬁcant.
While maximum RAM usage is a major indication of
the efﬁciency of memory usage, modern architectures in-
clude many-layered memory hierarchies whose inﬂuence on
performance is multi-faceted. To complement the data about
maximum RAM and reﬁne our understanding of memory
usage, we also measured average RAM usage and number
ofpage faults . Average RAM tends to be practically zero
in all tasks but very few; correspondingly, the statistics are
inconclusive as they are based on tiny samples. By contrast,
the data about page faults clearly partitions the languages
in two classes: the functional languages trigger signiﬁcantly
more page faults than all other languages; in fact, the only
statistically signiﬁcant differences are those involving F# or
Haskell, whereas programs in other languages hardly ever trig-
ger a single page fault. The difference in page faults between
Haskell programs and F# programs is insigniﬁcant. The page
faults recorded in our experiments indicate that functional
languages exhibit signiﬁcant non-locality of reference. The
overall impact of this phenomenon probably depends on a
machine’s architecture; RQ3, however, showed that functional
languages are generally competitive in terms of running-time
performance, so that their non-local behavior might just denote
a particular instance of the space vs. time trade-off.


Procedural languages use signiﬁcantly less memory
than other languages. Functional languages make
distinctly non-local memory accesses.
RQ5. Which programming languages are less failure
prone?
To answer this question, we measure runtime failures of
solutions of tasks TEXEC marked for execution that compile
without errors or timeout. We exclude programs that time out
because whether a timeout is indicative of failure depends on
the task: for example, interactive applications will time out
in our setup waiting for user input, but this should not be
recorded as failure. Thus, a terminating program fails if it
returns an exit code other than 0 (for example, when throwing
an uncaught exception). The measure of failures is ordinal and
not normalized: `fdenotes a vector of binary values, one for
each solution in language `where we measure runtime failures;
a value in `fis 1 iff the corresponding program fails and it is
80 if it does not fail.
Data about failures differs from that used to answer the
other research questions in that we cannot aggregate it by
task, since failures in different solutions, even for the same
task, are in general unrelated. Therefore, we use the Mann-
Whitney Utest, an unpaired non-parametric ordinal test which
can be applied to compare samples of different size. For two
languages Xand Y, the Utest assesses whether the two
samples XfandYfof binary values representing failures are
likely to come from the same population.

Table 17: Number of solutions considered for compilation, and
their percentage that compiled without errors.
Go clearly sticks out as the least failure prone language.
If we look, in Table 17, at the fraction of solutions that
failed to compile, and hence didn’t contribute data to failure
analysis, Go is not signiﬁcantly different from other compiled
languages. Together, these two elements indicate that the Go
compiler is particularly good at catching sources of failures at
compile time, since only a small fraction of compiled programs
fail at runtime. Go’s restricted type system (no inheritance,
no overloading, no genericity, no pointer arithmetic) mayhelp make compile-time checks effective. By contrast, the
scripting languages tend to be the most failure prone of the lot.
This is a consequence of Python and Ruby being interpreted
languages10: any syntactically correct program is executed, and
hence most errors manifest themselves only at runtime.
There are few major differences among the remaining
compiled languages, where it is useful to distinguish between
weak (C) and strong (the other languages) type systems [8,
Sec. 3.4.2]. F# shows no statistically signiﬁcant differences
with any of C, C#, and Haskell. C tends to be more failure
prone than C# and is signiﬁcantly more failure prone than
Haskell; similarly to the explanation behind the interpreted
languages’ failure proneness, C’s weak type system may be
responsible for fewer failures being caught at compile time
than at runtime. In fact, the association between weak typing
and failure proneness was also found in other studies [25].
Java is unusual in that it has a strong type system and is
compiled, but is signiﬁcantly more error prone than Haskell
and C#, which also are strongly typed and compiled. Future
work will determine if Java’s behavior is spurious or indicative
of concrete issues.

Compiled strongly-typed languages are signiﬁcantly
less prone to runtime failures than interpreted or
weakly-typed languages, since more errors are caught
at compile time. Thanks to its simple static type system,
Go is the least failure-prone language in our study.
IV. D ISCUSSION
The results of our study can help different stakeholders—
developers, language designers, and educators—to make better
informed choices about language usage and design.
The conciseness of functional and scripting programming
languages suggests that the characterizing features of these
languages—such as list comprehensions, type polymorphism,
dynamic typing, and extensive support for reﬂection and list
and map data structures—provide for great expressiveness.
In times where more and more languages combine elements
belonging to different paradigms, language designers can focus
on these features to improve the expressiveness and raise the
level of abstraction. For programmers, using a programming
language that makes for concise code can help write software
with fewer bugs. In fact, some classic research suggests [11],
[14], [15] that bug density is largely constant across pro-
gramming languages—all else being equal [7], [17]; therefore,
shorter programs will tend to have fewer bugs.
The results about executable size are an instance of the
ubiquitous space vs. time trade-off. Languages that compile
to native can perform more aggressive compile-time optimiza-
tions since they produce code that is very close to the actual
hardware it will be executed on. In fact, compilers to native
tend to have several optimization options, which exercise
different trade-offs. GNU’s gcc, for instance, has a -Os ﬂag
that optimizes for executable size instead of speed (but we
didn’t use this highly specialized optimization in our experi-
ments). However, with the ever increasing availability of cheap
and compact memory, differences between languages have
10Even if Python compiles to bytecode, the translation process only per-
forms syntactic checks (and is not invoked separately normally anyway).
9signiﬁcant implications only for applications that run on highly
constrained hardware such as embedded devices(where, in
fact, bytecode languages are becoming increasingly common).
Interpreted languages such as Ruby exercise yet another trade-
off, where there is no visible binary at all and all optimizations
are done at runtime.
No one will be surprised by our results that C dominates
other languages in terms of raw speed and efﬁcient memory
usage. Major progresses in compiler technology notwithstand-
ing, higher-level programming languages do incur a noticeable
performance loss to accommodate features such as automatic
memory management or dynamic typing in their runtimes.
Nevertheless, our results on “everyday” workloads showed that
pretty much any language can be competitive when it comes to
the regular-size inputs that make up the overwhelming majority
of programs. When teaching and developing software, we
should then remember that “most applications do not actually
need better performance than Python offers” [26, p. 337].
Another interesting lesson emerging from our performance
measurements is how Go achieves respectable running times as
well as good results in memory usage, thereby distinguishing
itself from the pack just as C does (in fact, Go’s developers
include prominent ﬁgures—Ken Thompson, most notably—
who were also primarily involved in the development of C).
Go’s design choices may be traced back to a careful selection
of features that differentiates it from most other language de-
signs (which tend to be more feature-prodigal): while it offers
automatic memory management and some dynamic typing, it
deliberately omits genericity and inheritance, and offers only a
limited support for exceptions. In our study, we have seen that
Go features not only good performance but also a compiler
that is quite effective at ﬁnding errors at compile time rather
than leaving them to leak into runtime failures. Besides being
appealing for certain kinds of software development (Go’s
concurrency mechanisms, which we didn’t consider in this
study, may be another feature to consider), Go also shows
to language designers that there still is uncharted territory in
the programming language landscape, and innovative solutions
could be discovered that are germane to requirements in certain
special domains.
Evidence in our, as well as others’ (Section VI), analysis
tends to conﬁrm what advocates of static strong typing have
long claimed: that it makes it possible to catch more errors
earlier, at compile time. But the question remains of which
process leads to overall higher programmer productivity (or,
in a different context, to effective learning): postponing testing
and catching as many errors as possible at compile time, or
running a prototype as soon as possible while frequently going
back to ﬁxing and refactoring? The traditional knowledge that
bugs are more expensive to ﬁx the later they are detected is
not an argument against the “test early” approach, since testing
early may be the quickest way to ﬁnd an error in the ﬁrst place.
This is another area where new trade-offs can be explored by
selectively—or ﬂexibly [1]—combining featuresthat enhance
compilation or execution.
V. T HREATS TO VALIDITY
Threats to construct validity —are we measuring the right
things?—are quite limited given that our research questions,and the measures we take to answer them, target widespread
well-deﬁned features (conciseness, performance, and so on)
with straightforward matching measures (lines of code, running
time, and so on). A partial exception is RQ5, which targets
the multifaceted notion of failure proneness, but the question
and its answer are consistent with related empirical work that
approached the same theme from other angles, which reﬂects
positively on the soundness of our constructs. Regarding
conciseness, lines of code remains a widely used metric, but it
will be interesting to correlate it with other proposed measures
of conciseness.
We took great care in the study’s design and execution to
minimize threats to internal validity —are we measuring things
right? We manually inspected all task descriptions to ensure
that the study only includes well-deﬁned tasks and comparable
solutions. We also manually inspected, and modiﬁed whenever
necessary, all solutions used to measure performance, where
it is of paramount importance that the same inputs be applied
in every case. To ensure reliable runtime measures (running
time, memory usage, and so on), we ran every executable
multiple times, checked that each repeated run’s deviation from
the average is moderate (less than one standard deviation),
and based our statistics on the average (mean) behavior. Data
analysis often showed highly statistically signiﬁcant results,
which also reﬂects favorably on the soundness of the study’s
data. Our experimental setup tried to use standard tools with
default settings; this may limit the scope of our ﬁndings, but
also helps reduce biasdue to different familiarity with different
languages. Exploring different directions, such as pursuing the
best optimizations possible in each language [21]for each task,
is an interesting goal of future work.
A possible threat to external validity —do the ﬁndings
generalize?—has to do with whether the properties of Rosetta
Code programs are representative of real-world software
projects. On one hand, Rosetta Code tasks tend to favor
algorithmic problems, and solutions are quite small on average
compared to any realistic application or library. On the other
hand, every large project is likely to include a small set of
core functionalities whose quality, performance, and reliability
signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the whole system’s; Rosetta Code
programs can be indicative of such core functionalities. In
addition, measures of performance are meaningful only on
comparable implementations of algorithmic tasks, and hence
Rosetta Code’s algorithmic bias helped provide a solid base
for comparison of this aspect (Section II-B and RQ3,4). The
size and level of activity of the Rosetta Code community
mitigates the threat that contributors to Rosetta Code are
not representative of the skills and expertise of real-world
programmers. However, to ensure wider generalizability, we
plan to analyze other characteristics of the Rosetta Code
programming community. To sum up, while some quantitative
details of our results may vary on different codebases and
methodologies, the big, mainly qualitative, picture, is likely
robust.
Another potential threat comes from the choice of pro-
gramming languages. Section II-C describes how we selected
languages representative of real-world popularity among major
paradigms. Classifying programming languages into paradigms
has become harder in recent times, when multi-paradigm
languages are the norm(many programming languages offer
10procedures, some form of object system, and even func-
tional features such as closures and list comprehensions).
11Nonetheless, we maintain that paradigms still signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence the way in which programs are written, and it is
natural to associate major programming languages to a speciﬁc
paradigm based on their Rosetta Code programs. For example,
even though Python offers classes and other object-oriented
features, practically no solutions in Rosetta Code use them.
Extending the study to more languages and new paradigms
belongs to future work.
VI. R ELATED WORK
Controlled experiments are a popular approach to lan-
guage comparisons: study participants program the same tasks
in different languages while researchers measure features such
as code size and execution or development time. Prechelt [24]
compares 7 programming languages on a single task in 80
solutions written by studentsand other volunteers. Measures
include program size, execution time, memory consumption,
and development time. Findings include: the program written
in Perl, Python, REXX, or Tcl is “only half as long” as
written in C, C++, or Java; performance results are more
mixed, but C and C++ are generally faster than Java. The
study asks questions similar to ours but is limited by the
small sample size. Languages and their compilers have evolved
since 2000 (when [24] was published), making the results
difﬁcult to compare; however, some tendencies (conciseness of
scripting languages, performance-dominance of C) are visible
in our study too. Harrison et al. [10] compare the code
quality of C++ against the functional language SML’s on 12
tasks, ﬁnding few signiﬁcant differences. Our study targets
a broader set of research questions (only RQ5 is related to
quality). Hanenberg [9] conducts a study with 49 students over
27 hours of development time comparing static vs. dynamic
type systems, ﬁnding no signiﬁcant differences. In contrast to
controlled experiments, our approach cannot take development
time into account.
Many recent comparative studies have targeted program-
ming languages for concurrency and parallelism. Studying
15 students on a single problem, Szafron and Schaeffer [31]
identify a message-passing library that is somewhat superior
to higher-level parallel programming, even though the latter
is more “usable” overall. This highlights the difﬁculty of
reconciling results of different metrics. We do not attempt
this in our study, as the suitability of a language for certain
projects may depend on external factorsthat assign different
weights to different metrics. Other studies [4], [5], [12],
[13] compare parallel programming approaches (UPC, MPI,
OpenMP, and X10) using mostly small student populations. In
the realm of concurrent programming, a study [28] with 237
undergraduate students implementing one program with locks,
monitors, or transactions suggests that transactions leads to
the fewest errors. In a usability study with 67 students [19],
we ﬁnd advantages of the SCOOP concurrency model over
Java’s monitors. Pankratius et al. [23] compare Scala and
Java using 13 students and one software engineer working
11At the 2012 LASER summer school on “Innovative languages for software
engineering”, Mehdi Jazayeri mentioned the proliferation of multi-paradigm
languages as a disincentive to updating his book on programming language
concepts [8].on three tasks. They conclude that Scala’s functional style
leads to more compact code and comparable performance.
To eschew the limitations of classroom studies—based on
the unrepresentative performance of novice programmers (for
instance, in [5], about a third of the student subjects fail the
parallel programming task in that they cannot achieve any
speedup)—previous work of ours [20], [21] compared Chapel,
Cilk, Go, and TBB on 96 solutions to 6 tasks that were checked
for style and performance by notable language experts. [20],
[21] also introduced language dependency diagrams similar to
those used in the present paper.
A common problem with all the aforementioned studies is
that they often target few tasks and solutions, and therefore
fail to achieve statistical signiﬁcance or generalizability. The
large sample size in our study minimizes these problems.
Surveys can help characterize the perception of program-
ming languages. Meyerovich and Rabkin [16] study the rea-
sons behind language adoption. One key ﬁnding is that the
intrinsic features of a language (such as reliability) are less
important for adoption when compared to extrinsic ones such
as existing code, open-source libraries, and previous experi-
ence. This puts our study into perspective, and shows that some
features we investigate are very important to developers (e.g.,
performanceas second most important attribute). Bissyandé et
al. [3] study similar questions: the popularity, interoperability,
and impact of languages. Their rankings, according to lines
of code or usage in projects, may suggest alternatives to the
TIOBE ranking we usedfor selecting languages.
Repository mining , as we have done in this study, has
become a customary approach to answering a variety of
questions about programming languages. Bhattacharya and
Neamtiu [2] study 4 projects in C and C++ to understand
the impact on software quality, ﬁnding an advantage in C++.
With similar goals, Ray et al. [25] mine 729 projects in 17
languages from GitHub. They ﬁnd that strong typing is mod-
estly better than weak typing, and functional languages have
an advantage over procedural languages. Our study looks at a
broader spectrum of research questions in a more controlled
environment, but our results on failures (RQ5) conﬁrm the
superiority of statically strongly typed languages. Other studies
investigate specialized features of programming languages. For
example, recent studies by us [6] and others [29] investigate
the use of contracts and their interplay with other language
features such as inheritance. Okur and Dig [22] analyze 655
open-source applications with parallel programming to identify
adoption trends and usage problems, addressing questions that
are orthogonal to ours.
VII. C ONCLUSIONS
Programming languages are essential tools for the working
computer scientist, and it is no surprise that what is the “right
tool for the job” can be the subject of intense debates. To put
such debates on strong foundations, we must understand how
features of different languages relate to each other. Our study
revealed differences regarding some of the most frequently dis-
cussed language features—conciseness, performance, failure-
proneness—and is therefore of value to software developers
and language designers. The key to having highly signiﬁcant
statistical results in our study was the use of a large program
11chrestomathy: Rosetta Code. The repository can be a valuable
resource also for future programming language research that
corroborates, or otherwise complements, our ﬁndings. Besides
using Rosetta Code, researchers can also improve it (by
correcting any detected errors) and can increase its research
value (by maintaining easily accessible up-to-date statistics).

VIII. A PPENDIX : PAIRWISE COMPARISONS
Sections VIII-A to VIII-J describe the complete measured, rendered as graphs and tables, for a number of pairwise comparisons
between programming languages; the actual graphs and table appear in the remaining parts of this appendix.
Each comparison targets a different metric M, including lines of code (conciseness), lines of comments per line of code
(comments), binary size (in kilobytes, where binaries may be native or byte code), CPU user time (in seconds, for different sets
ofperformance T PERF—“everyday” in the main paper—and scalability T SCAL—“computing-intensive” in the main paper—tasks),
maximum RAM usage (i.e., maximum resident set size, in kilobytes), number of page faults, time outs (with a timeout limit of 3
minutes), and number of Rosetta Code solutions for the same task. Most metrics are normalized , as we detail in the subsections.
A metric may also be such that smaller is better (such as lines of code: the fewer the more concise a program is) or larger
is better (such as comments per line of code: the more the more comments are available). Indeed, comments per line of code
and number of solutions per task are “larger is better” metrics; all other metrics are “smaller is better”. We discuss below how
this feature inﬂuences how the results should be read.
Let`be a programming language, ta task, and Ma metric. `M(t)denotes the vector of measures of M, one for each solution
to task tin language `.`M(t)may be empty if there are no solutions to task tin`.
Using this notation, the comparison of programming languages XandYbased on Mworks as follows. Consider a subset
Tof the tasks such that, for every t2T, both XandYhave at least one solution to t.Tmay be further restricted based on
a measure-dependent criterion , which we describe in the following subsections; for example, Section VIII-A only considers a
task tif both XandYhave at least one solution that compiles without errors (solutions that do not satisfy the criterion are
discarded). Based on T, we build two data vectors xa
Mandya
Mfor the two languages by aggregating metric Mper task using an
aggregation function a.
To this end, if Mis normalized, the normalization factor nM(t;X;Y)denotes the smallest value of Mfor all solutions of tin
Xand in Y; otherwise it is just one:
nM(t;X;Y) =min(XM(t)YM(t))ifMis normalized and min (XM(t)YM(t))>0;
1 otherwise ;
where juxtaposing vectors denotes concatenating them. Note that the normalization factor is one also if Mis normalized but
the minimum is zero; this is to avoid divisions by zero when normalizing. (A minimum of zero may occur due to the limited
precision of some measures such as running time.)
We are ﬁnally ready to deﬁne vectors xa
Mandya
M. The vectors have the same length jTj=jxa
Mj=jya
Mjand are ordered by
task; thus, xa
M(t)andya
M(t)denote the value in xa
Mand in ya
Mcorresponding to task t, for t2T:
xa
M(t) =a(XM(t)=nM(t;X;Y));
ya
M(t) =a(YM(t)=nM(t;X;Y)):
As aggregation functions, we normally consider both minimum and mean; hence the sets of graphs and tables are often double,
one for each aggregation function. For unstandardized measures, we also deﬁne the vectors xa
Mandya
Mby task tas non-normalized
counterparts to xa
Mandya
M:
xa
M(t) =a(XM(t));
ya
M(t) =a(YM(t)):
The data in xa
Mandya
Mdetermines two graphs and a statistical test.
One graph includes line plots ofxa
Mand of ya
M, with the horizontal axis representing task number and the vertical axis
representing values of M(possibly normalized).
For example, Figure 88 includes a graph with normalized values of lines of code aggregated per task by minimum for C and
Python. There you can see that there are close to 350 tasks with at least one solution in both C and Python that compiles
successfully; and that there is a task whose shortest solution in C is over 50 times larger (in lines of code) than its shortest
solution in Python.
Another graph is a scatter plot ofxa
Mand of ya
M, namely of points with coordinates (xa
M(t);ya
M(t))for all available tasks
t2T. This graph also includes a linear regression line ﬁtted using the least squares approach. Since axes have the same
scales in these graphs, a linear regression line that bisects the graph diagonally at 45would mean that there is no visible
difference in metric Mbetween the two languages. Otherwise, if Mis such that “smaller is better”, the ﬂatter or lower the
regression line, the better language Ytends to be compared against language Xon metric M. In fact, a ﬂatter or lower
24line denotes more points (vX;vY)with vY<vXthan the other way round, or more tasks where Yis better (smaller metric).
Conversely, if Mis such that “larger is better”, the steeper or higher the regression line, the better language Ytends to be
compared against language Xon metric M.
For example, Figure 89 includes a graph with normalized values of lines of code aggregated per task by minimum for C
and Python. There you can see that most tasks are such that the shortest solution in C is larger than the shortest solution
in Python; the regression line is almost horizontal at ordinate 1.
Thestatistical test is a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, a paired non-parametric difference test which assesses whether the mean
ranks of xa
Mand of ya
Mdiffer. The test results appear in a table, under column labeled with language Xat a row labeled
with language Y, and includes various statistics:
1) The p-value estimates the probability that the differences between xa
Mand ya
Mare due to chance; thus, if pis small
(typically at least p<0:1, but preferably p0:01) it means that there is a high chance that XandYexhibit a genuinely
different behavior with respect to metric M. Signiﬁcant p-values are colored: highly signiﬁcant ( p<0:01) and signiﬁcant
but not highly so (“tends to be signiﬁcant”: 0 :01p<0:05).
2) The total sample size Nisjxa
Mj+jxa
Mj, that is twice the number of tasks considered for metric M.
3) The test statistics Wis the absolute value of the sum of the signed ranks (see a description of the test for details).
4) The related test statistics Zis derivable from W.
5) The effect size, computed as Cohen’s d, which, for statistically signiﬁcant differences, gives an idea of how large the
difference is. As a rule of thumb, d<0:3 denotes a small effect size, 0 :3d<0:7 denotes a medium effect size, and
d0:7 denotes a large effect size. Non-negligible effect sizes are colored: large effect size, medium effect size, and
small (but non vanishing, that is >0:05) effect size.
6) The difference D=fxa
M fya
Mof the medians of non-normalized vectors xa
Mandxa
M, which gives an unstandardized measure
and sign of the size of the overall difference. Namely, if Mis such that “smaller is better” and the difference between
XandYis signiﬁcant, a positive Dindicates that language Yis on average better (smaller) on Mthan language X.
Conversely, if Mis such that “larger is better”, a negative Dindicates that language Yis on average better (larger) on M
than language X.
7) The ratio
R = sgn(D)max (fxa
M;fya
M)
min(fxa
M;fya
M)
of the largest median to the smallest median, with the same sign as D. This is another unstandardized measure and sign
of the size of the difference with a more direct interpretation in terms of ratio of average measures. Note that sgn (v) =1
ifv0; otherwise sgn (v) = 1.
For example, Table 19 includes a cell comparing C (column header) against Python (row header) for normalized values
of lines of code aggregated per task by minimum. The p-value is practically zero, and hence the differences are highly
signiﬁcant. The effect size is large ( d>0:9), and hence the magnitude of the differences is considerable. Since the metric
for conciseness is “smaller is better”, a positive Dindicates that Python is the more concise language on average; the value
ofRfurther indicates that the average C solution is over 2 :9 times longer in lines of code than the average Python solution.
These ﬁgures quantitatively conﬁrm what we observed in the line and scatter plots.
We also include a cumulative line plot with all languages at once, which is only meant as a qualitative visualization.
A. Conciseness
The metric for conciseness is non-blank non-comment lines of code, counted using cloc version 1.6.2. The metric is
normalized and smaller is better. As aggregation functions we consider minimum ‘min’ and mean. The criterion only selects
solutions that compile successfully (compilation returns with exit status 0), and only include tasks TLOCwhich we manually
marked for lines of code count.
B. Conciseness (all tasks)
The metric for conciseness on all tasks is non-blank non-comment lines of code, counted using cloc version 1.6.2. The
metric is normalized and smaller is better. As aggregation functions we consider minimum ‘min’ and mean. The criterion only
include tasks TLOCwhich we manually marked for lines of code count (but otherwise includes all solutions, including those that
do not compile correctly).
C. Comments
The metric for comments is comment lines of code per non-blank non-comment lines of code, counted using cloc version
1.6.2. The metric is normalized and larger is better. As aggregation functions we consider minimum ‘min’ and mean. The criterion
only selects tasks TLOCwhich we manually marked for lines of code count (but otherwise includes all solutions, including those
that do not compile correctly).
25D. Binary size
The metric for binary size is size of binary (in kilobytes), measured using GNU duversion 8.13. The metric is normalized
and smaller is better. As aggregation functions we consider minimum ‘min’ and mean. The criterion only selects solutions that
compile successfully (compilation returns with exit status 0 and creates a non-empty binary), and only include tasks TCOMP which
we manually marked for compilation.
The “binary” is either native code or byte code, according to the language. Ruby does not feature in this comparison since
it does not generate byte code, and hence the graphs and tables for this metric do not include Ruby.
E. Performance
The metric for performance is CPU user time (in seconds), measured using GNU time version 1.7. The metric is normalized
and smaller is better. As aggregation functions we consider minimum ‘min’ and mean. The criterion only selects solutions
that execute successfully (execution returns with exit status 0), and only include tasks TPERF which we manually marked for
performance comparison.
We selected the performance tasks based on whether they represent well-deﬁned comparable tasks were measuring performance
makes sense, and we ascertained that all solutions used in the analysis indeed implement the task correctly (and the solutions
are comparable, that is interpret the task consistently and run on comparable inputs).
F . Scalability
The metric for scalability is CPU user time (in seconds), measured using GNU time version 1.7. The metric is normalized
and smaller is better. As aggregation functions we consider minimum ‘min’ and mean. The criterion only selects solutions that
execute successfully (execution returns with exit status 0), and only include tasks TSCAL which we manually marked for scalability
comparison. Table 18 lists the scalability tasks and describes the size nof their inputs in the experiments.
We selected the scalability tasks based on whether they represent well-deﬁned comparable tasks were measuring scalability
makes sense. We ascertained that all solutions used in the analysis indeed implement the task correctly (and the solutions are
comparable, that is interpret the task consistently); and we modiﬁed the input to all solutions so that they are uniform across
languages and represent challenging (or at least non-trivial) input sizes.
G. Memory usage
The metric for memory (RAM) usage is maximum resident set size (in kilobytes), measured using GNU time version 1.7.
The metric is normalized and smaller is better. As aggregation functions we consider minimum ‘min’ and mean. The criterion
only selects solutions that execute successfully (execution returns with exit status 0), and only include tasks TSCAL which we
manually marked for scalability comparison.
H. Page faults
The metric for page faults is number of page faults in an execution, measured using GNU time version 1.7. The metric is
normalized and smaller is better. As aggregation functions we consider minimum ‘min’ and mean. The criterion only selects
solutions that execute successfully (execution returns with exit status 0), and only include tasks TSCAL which we manually marked
for scalability comparison.
A number of tests could not be performed due to languages not generating any page faults (all pairs are ties). In those cases,
the metric is immaterial.
I. Timeouts
The metric for timeouts is ordinal and two-valued: a solution receives a value of one if it times out within the allotted time;
otherwise it receives a value of zero. Time outs were detected using GNU timeout version 8.13. The metric is notnormalized and
smaller is better. As aggregation function we consider maximum ‘max’, corresponding to letting `(t) =1 iff all selected solutions
to task tin language `time out. The criterion only selects solutions that either execute successfully (execution terminates and
returns with exit status 0) or are still running at the timeout limit, and only include tasks TSCAL which we manually marked for
scalability comparison.
The line plots for this metric are actually point plots for better readability. Also for readability, the majority of tasks with
the same value in the languages under comparison correspond to a different color (marked “all” in the legends).

J. Solutions per task
The metric for timeouts is a counting metric: each solution receives a value of one. The metric is notnormalized and larger is
better. As aggregation function we consider the sum; hence each task receives a value corresponding to the number of solutions
in Rosetta Code for that task in each language. The criterion only selects tasks TCOMP which we manually marked for compilation
(but otherwise includes all solutions, including those that do not compile correctly).
The line plots for this metric are actually point plots for better readability. Also for readability, the majority of tasks with
the same value in the languages under comparison correspond to a different color (marked “all” in the legends).
K. Other comparisons
Table 77, Table 79, Table 85, and Table 86 display the results of additional statistics comparing programming languages.
L. Compilation
Table 77 and Table 85 give more details about the compilation process.
Table 77 is similar to the previous tables, but it is based on unpaired tests, namely the Mann-Whitney Utest—a non-
parametric ordinal test that can be applied to two samples of different size. We ﬁrst consider all solutions to tasks TCOMP marked
for compilation (regardless of compilation outcome). We then assign an ordinal value to each solution :
0: if the solution compiles without errors (the compiler returns with exit status 0 and, if applicable, creates a non-empty binary)
with the default compilation options;
1: if the solution compiles without errors (the compiler returns with exit status 0 and, if applicable, creates a non-empty binary),
but it requires to set a compilation ﬂag to specify where to ﬁnd libraries ;
272: if the solution compiles without errors (the compiler returns with exit status 0 and, if applicable, creates a non-empty binary),
but it requires to specify how to merge or otherwise process multiple input ﬁles;
3: if the solution compiles without errors (the compiler returns with exit status 0 and, if applicable, creates a non-empty binary),
but only after applying a patch , which deploys some settings (such as include directives);
4: if the solution compiles without errors (the compiler returns with exit status 0 and, if applicable, creates a non-empty binary),
but only after ﬁxing some simple error (such as a type error, or a missing variable declaration);
5: if the solution does not compile or compiles with errors (the compiler returns with exit status other than 1 or, if applicable,
creates no non-empty binary), even after applying possible patches or ﬁxing.
To make the categories disjoint, we assign the highest possible value in each case, reﬂecting the fact that the lower the ordinal
value the better. For example, if a solution requires a patch and a merge, we classify it as a patch, which characterizes the most
effort involved in making it compile.
The distinction between patch and ﬁxing is somewhat subjective; it tries to reﬂect whether the error that had to be rectiﬁed
was a trivial omission (patch) or a genuine error (ﬁxing). However, we stopped ﬁxing at simple errors, dropping all programs that
misinterpreted a task description, referenced obviously missing pieces of code, or required substantial structural modiﬁcations
to work. All solutions suffering from these problems these received an ordinal value of 5.
For each pair of languages XandY, a Mann-Whitney Utest assessed whether the two samples (ordinal values for language
Xvs. ordinal values for language Y) come from the same population. The test results appear in Table 77, under column labeled
with language Xat a row labeled with language Y, and includes various statistics:
1) The p-value is the probability that the two samples come from the same population.
2) The total sample size Nis the total number of solutions in language XandYthat received an ordinal value.
3) The test statistics U(see a description of the test for details).
4) The related test statistics Z, derivable from U.
5) The effect size—Cohen’s d.
6) The difference Dof the means, which gives a sign to the difference between the samples. Namely, if pis small, a positive
Dindicates that language Yis on average “better” (fewer compilation problems) than language X.
Table 85 reports, for each language, the number of tasks andsolutions considered for compilation; in column make ok , the
percentage of solutions that eventually compiled correctly (ordinal values in the range 0–4); in column make ko , the percentage
of solutions that did not compile correctly (ordinal value 5); in columns none through ﬁx, the percentage of solutions that
eventually compiled correctly for each category corresponding to ordinal values in the range 0–4.
M. Execution
Table 79 and Table 86 give more details about the running process; they are the counterparts to Table 77 and Table 85.
We ﬁrst consider all solutions to tasks TEXEC marked for execution that we could run. We then assign an ordinal value to
each solution :
0: if the solution runs without errors (it runs and terminates within the timeout, returns with exit status 0, and does not write
anything to standard error);
1: if the solution runs with possible errors but terminates successfully (it runs and terminates within the timeout, returns with
exit status 0, but writes some messages to standard error);
2: if the solution times out (it runs without errors, and it is still running when the time out elapses);
3: if the solution runs with visible error (it runs and terminates within the timeout, returns with exit status other than 0, and
writes some messages to standard error);
4: if the solution crashes (it runs and terminates within the timeout, returns with exit status other than 0, and writes nothing to
standard error, such as a Segfault ).
The categories are disjoint and try to reﬂect increasing levels of problems. We consider terminating without printing error
(a crash) worse than printing some information. Similarly, we consider nontermination without manifest error better than abrupt
termination with error. (In fact, many solutions in this categories were either from correct solutions working on very large
inputs, typically in the scalability tasks, or to correct solutions to interactive tasks were termination is not to be expected.) The
distinctions are somewhat subjective; they try to reﬂect the difﬁculty of understanding and possibly debugging an error.
For each pair of languages XandY, a Mann-Whitney Utest assessed whether the two samples (ordinal values for language
Xvs. ordinal values for language Y) come from the same population. The test results appear in Table 79, under column labeled
with language Xat a row labeled with language Y, and includes the same statistics as Table 77.
Table 86 reports, for each language, the number of tasks andsolutions considered for execution; in columns run ok through
crash , the percentage of solutions for each category corresponding to ordinal values in the range 0–4.
28N. Overall code quality (compilation + execution)
Table 81 compares the sum of ordinal values assigned to each solution as described in Section VIII-L and Section VIII-M,
for all tasks TEXEC marked for execution (and compilation). The overall score gives an idea of the code quality of Rosetta Code
solutions based on how much we had to do for compilation and for execution.
O. Fault proneness
Table 83 and Table 87 give an idea of the number of defects manifesting themselves as runtime failures; they draw on data
similar to those presented in Section VIII-L and Section VIII-M.
We ﬁrst consider all solutions to tasks TEXEC marked for execution that we could compile without errors and that ran without
timing out. We then assign an ordinal value to each solution :
0: if the solution runs without errors (it runs and terminates within the timeout with exit status 0);
1: if the solution runs with errors (it runs and terminates within the timeout with exit status other than 0).
The categories are disjoint and do not include solutions that timed out.
For each pair of languages XandY, a Mann-Whitney Utest assessed whether the two samples (ordinal values for language
Xvs. ordinal values for language Y) come from the same population. The test results appear in Table 83, under column labeled
with language Xat a row labeled with language Y, and includes the same statistics as Table 77.
Table 87 reports, for each language, the number of tasks andsolutions that compiled correctly and ran without timing out;
in columns error andrun ok , the percentage of solutions for each category corresponding to ordinal values 1 ( error ) and 0
(run ok ).
Visualizations of language comparisons
To help visualize the results, a graph accompanies each table with the results of statistical signiﬁcance tests between pairs of
languages. In such graphs, nodes correspond to programming languages. Two nodes `1and`2are arranged so that their horizontal
distance is roughly proportional to how `1and`2compare according to the statistical test. In contrast, vertical distances are
chosen only to improve readability and carry not meaning.
Precisely, there are two graphs for each measure: unnormalized and normalized. In the unnormalized graph, let pM(`1;`2),
eM(`1;`2), and DM(`1;`2)be the p-value, effect size ( dorraccording to the metric), and difference of medians for the test that
compares `1to`2on metric M. IfpM(`1;`2)>0:05 or eM(`1;`2)<0:05, then the horizontal distance between node `1and node
`2is zero or very small (it may still be non-zero to improve the visual layout while satisfying the constraints as well as possible),
and there is no edge between them. Otherwise, their horizontal distance is proportional top
eM(`1;`2)(1 pM(`1;`2)), and
there is a directed edge to the node corresponding to the “better” language according to Mfrom the other node. To improve
the visual layout, edges that express an ordered pair that is subsumed by others are omitted, that is if `a!`b!`cthe edge
from`ato`cis omitted. Paths on the graph following edges in the direction of the arrow list languages in approximate order
from “worse” to “better”. Edges are dotted if they correspond to large signiﬁcant p-values (0 :01p<0:05); they have a color
corresponding to the color assigned to the effect size in the table: large effect size, medium effect size, and small but non
vanishing effect size.
In the normalized companion graphs (called with “normalized horizontal distances” in the captions), arrows and vertical
distances are assigned as in the unnormalized graphs, whereas the horizontal distance are proportional to the mean `a
Mfor each
language `over all common tasks (that is where each language has at least one solution). Namely, the language with the “worst”
average measure (consistent with whether Mis such that “smaller” or “larger” is better) will be farthest on the left, the language
with the “best” average measure will be farthest on the right, with other languages in between proportionally to their rank. Since,
to have a unique baseline, normalized average measures only refer to tasks common to all languages, the normalized horizontal
distances may be inconsistent with the pairwise tests because they refer to a much smaller set of values (sensitive to noise). This
is only visible in the case of performance and scalability tasks, which are often sufﬁciently many for pairwise comparisons, but
become too few (for example, less than 10) when we only look at the tasks that have implementations in all languages. In these
cases, the unnormalized graphs may be more indicative (and, in any case, the data in the tables is the hard one).
For comparisons based on ordinal values, there is only one kind of graph whose horizontal distances do not have a signiﬁcant
quantitative meaning but mainly represent an ordering.
Remind that all graphs use approximations and heuristics to build their layout; hence they are mainly meant as qualitative
visualization aids that cannot substitute a detailed analytical reading of the data.
