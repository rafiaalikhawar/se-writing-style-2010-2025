Exceptionhandlingmechanismsallowdeveloperstostructuretheir
programs to deal with abnormal or unexpected conditions that
occuratruntime[ 5].Despiteexceptionhandlingbeingaimedatim-
provingsoftwarerobustness,recurringfailuresinsoftwaresystems
occur due to faults in exception handling code [2, 4].
In previous studies [2, 3], we observed most faults in exception

were caused by violations related to global exceptions.
Despiteofeffortindetectingexceptionhandlingviolations[ 1],
there is still no solution aimed at assisting developers in repairing
these violations. In fact, repairing violations in exception handling

Developers are required to know the correct place where the ex-

Inthiscontext,weproposedRAVEN,arecommenderheuristic

is a sequence of modifications to be performed in the call-chain of
a method in order to repair a given violation. The RAVEN strategy
comprises three steps. In the first step, the solution space where
RAVENsearchesitsrecommendationsisbuilt.Thissolutionspaceis
builtwithinformationextractedfromthesourcecodeofthesystemandfromitsexceptionhandlingpolicyspecification.Itisworthnot-
ingthattheavailabilityofapolicyspecificationisnotmandatory
for the proper functioning of the RAVEN strategy. In the second

are ranked and presented for developers.
WeimplementedRAVENforJavaprogramsandassesseditseffec-
tiveness in the context of three open-source projects. Effectiveness
was assessed in terms of RAVEN’s ability to produce recommenda-
tionsabletoactuallyrepairviolationsinexceptionhandling.The
results show RAVEN is effective even when no explicit policy spec-
ification is available: it provides recommendations able to repair
violationsin69%ofthecases.ResultsalsoshowRAVEN’seffective-

97%ofthecases.Moreover,resultsshowitispossibletoimprove
