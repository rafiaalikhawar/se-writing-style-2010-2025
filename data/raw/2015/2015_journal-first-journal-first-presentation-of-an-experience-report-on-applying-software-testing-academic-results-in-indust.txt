ABSTRACT
What is the impact of software engineering research on current
practices in industry? In this paper, I report on my direct experi-
ence as a PhD/post-doc working in software engineering research
projects, and then spending the following five years as an engineer
in twodifferentcompanies (thefirst onebeing thesame Iworked
in collaboration with during my post-doc). Given a background in
software engineering research, what cutting-edge techniques and
toolsfromacademiadidIuseinmydailyworkwhendeveloping
andtestingthesystems ofthesecompanies?Regardingvalidation
and verification (my mainarea of research), the answer israther
short:asfarasIcantell,onlyFindBugs.Inthispaper,Ireporton
whythiswasthecase,anddiscussallthechallenging,complexopen
problems we face in industry and which somehow are ‘‘neglected’’
intheacademiccircles.Inparticular,Iwillfirstdiscusswhatactual
toolsIcoulduseinmydailywork,suchasJaCoCoandSelenium.
Then, I will discuss the main open problems I faced, particularly
relatedtoenvironmentsimulators,unitandwebtesting.Afterthat,
popular topics in academia are presented, such as UML, regression
and mutation testing. Their lack of impact on the type of projects I
workedoninindustryisthendiscussed.Finally,fromthisindustrial
experience, I provide my opinions about how this situation can be
improved, in particular related to how academics are evaluated,
and advocate for a greater involvement into open-source projects.
