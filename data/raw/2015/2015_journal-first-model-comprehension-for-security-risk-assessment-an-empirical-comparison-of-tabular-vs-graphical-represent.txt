ABSTRACT
Context: Tabularandgraphicalrepresentationsareusedtocom-
municate security risk assessments for IT systems. However, there
isnoconsensusonwhichtypeofrepresentationbettersupportsthe
comprehension of risks (such as the relationships between threats,
vulnerabilities and security controls). Vessey’s cognitive fit theory
predicts that graphs should be better because they capture spatial
relationships. Method: We report the results of two studies per-
formedintwocountrieswith69and83participantsrespectively,in
which we assessed the effectiveness of tabular and graphical repre-
sentations concerning the extraction of correct information about
security risks. Results: Participants who applied tabular risk mod-
els gave more precise and complete answers to the comprehension
questions when requested to find simple and complex information
about threats, vulnerabilities, or other elements of the risk models.
Conclusions: OurfindingscanbeexplainedbyVessey’scognitive

tialrelationships. Interest for ICSE: Itisalmosttakenforgranted

https://doi.org/10.1145/3180155.3182511RQ1Which risk modeling notation, tabular or graphical, is more
effectiveinextractingcorrectinformationaboutsecurityrisks?
RQ2What is the effect of task complexity on participants’ actual
comprehension of information presented in risk models?
Toanswer the research questions, we design special comprehen-
sibility tasks to measure the participant’s ability to extract correct
informationaboutsecurityrisksusingtabularandgraphicalmodels.
We considered comprehension questions of different complexity
(simplevs.complex)inlinewithWood’stheoryoftaskcomplex-
ity [4]. See Labunets et al. [1] for more details.
Weselectedscenariosfromthehealthcareandonlinebanking
domains, modeled the security risks of the scenario in the two
notations,andaskedtheparticipantstoanswerseveralquestionsof
different complexity. By using precision and recall of participants’
responses, we compared the effect of the modeling notation on
thecomprehensibilityofthe riskmodels.Theresultsofourstudy
showthattabularriskmodelsaremoreeffectivethanthegraphical
ones w.r.t. simple comprehension tasks and in some cases are more
effective for complex ones.
2 A NATURAL FOLLOW-UP QUESTION
Oneofthereviewersofthepaperaskedwhetherour“tasksacci-
dentally favor the tabular representation (beyond any advantage it
mighthavebyitself)?”Toaddressthisissue,weconductedanexper-
imentwithprofessionalstostudyiftheavailabilityoftextuallabels
and terse UML-style notation could improve comprehensibility.
In [2] we reported the results of an online comprehensibility
experimentinvolving61professionalswithanaverageof9years
of working experience. We compared the ability to comprehend
securityriskassessmentsrepresentedintabular,UML-stylewith
textual labels, and iconic graphical modeling notations. The experi-
mentconfirmedpreviousfindings:thetabularnotationisstillthe
most comprehensible in both recall and precision. However, the
presence of textual labels does improve the precision and recall of
participants over iconic graphical models.
