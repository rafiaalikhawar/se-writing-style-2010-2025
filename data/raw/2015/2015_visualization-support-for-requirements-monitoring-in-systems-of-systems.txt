Abstract —Industrial software systems are often systems of
systems (SoS) whose full behavior only emerges at runtime. The
systems and their interactions thus need to be continuously mon-
itored and checked during operation to determine compliance
with requirements. Many requirements monitoring approaches
have been proposed. However, only few of these come with
tools that present and visualize monitoring results and details on
requirements violations to end users such as industrial engineers.
In this tool demo paper we present visualization capabilities we
have been developing motivated by industrial scenarios. Our tool
complements R EMINDS , an existing requirements monitoring
framework, which supports collecting, aggregating, and analyzing
events and event data in architecturally heterogeneous SoS. Our
visualizations support a ‘drill-down’ scenario for monitoring
and diagnosis: starting from a graphical status overview of
the monitored systems and their relations, engineers can view
trends and statistics about performed analyses and diagnose
the root cause of problems by inspecting the events and event
data that led to a speciﬁc violation. Initial industry feedback we
received conﬁrms the usefulness of our tool support. Demo video:

I. I NTRODUCTION
Today’s software systems are often developed as systems
of systems comprising heterogeneous yet interrelated architec-
tural elements. Common properties of SoS are decentralized
control; support for multiple platforms; inherently volatile and
conﬂicting requirements; continuous evolution and deploy-
ment; as well as heterogeneous, inconsistent, and changing
elements [1]. As the full behavior of SoS emerges during
operation only, system testing is insufﬁcient to determine
the systems’ compliance with their requirements. Thus, the
involved systems and their interactions need to be continuously
monitored during operation to discover unexpected behavior.
Many monitoring approaches exist for this purpose as sum-
marized in recent surveys [2], [3].
Robinson’s four-layer architecture of requirements monitor-
ing [4] covers support for instrumenting systems, collecting
and aggregating events and data, deﬁning and checking behav-
ior (e. g., using temporal logic), and visualizing requirements
violations indicating deviations from the expected behavior.
The presentation and visualization of monitoring results, how-
ever, is often insufﬁcient in existing approaches. For instance,
only 14 of 37 requirements monitoring frameworks identiﬁedin a recent systematic literature review [2] provide support for
presenting the monitored events and event data to end users.
While not all these frameworks have been developed with
this goal, 38% is still a rather low number, particularly when
considering that “most approaches do not provide a proper
validation” with real-world systems and users, who would
need or at least beneﬁt from visualizations [3].
As part of our earlier research we have developed the
tool-supported R EMINDS framework [5], [6] for require-
ments monitoring in SoS. The main use case of R EMINDS
is continuous monitoring, i.e., checking and presenting the
behavior of an SoS during its operation. An assessment of
the usefulness of R EMINDS for collecting, aggregating, and
analyzing events and event data at runtime in a study with
industrial engineers [7] and further feedback from our industry
partner suggested more advanced tool support for analyzing
and visualizing monitoring results in real-world scenarios. For
instance, the study showed that engineers from industry fre-
quently require details on the monitored events and associated
event data that led to requirements violations when diagnosing
problems [8]. Furthermore, trends and statistics need to be
computed allowing practitioners to understand which (kind of)
requirements are violated during a particular time period, or
if the frequency of violations is changing for speciﬁc systems.
Particularly in systems of systems, visualizations need to exist
for different levels of granularity, e. g., to depict the status and
trends or details about speciﬁc violations for the overall SoS
as well as individual systems.
In this tool demo paper, we present such visualization
capabilities, developed in cooperation with industrial engineers
in an ongoing research project on requirements monitoring in
SoS. The new visualization features considerably complement
and extend the existing R EMINDS tool suite [9].
II. B ACKGROUND
REMINDS [5] is based on a Requirements Monitoring
Model (RMM) comprising the following key elements as
deﬁned in a meta-model [10]: the Requirements to be mon-
itored are represented as Constraints, which can be deﬁned
using a domain-speciﬁc language (DSL) [6]. Constraint checks
are triggered as soon as corresponding Events happen at
runtime. The approach can check constraints on the occur-
rence, order, and timing of events and on the associated event

the monitored software. The RMM also comprises Scopes
deﬁning the provenance of events in the SoS. Scopes can be
arranged hierarchically, thus representing the SoS architecture:
for instance, a scope may represent a particular system, one or
more components, or a connector (such as interfaces or APIs)
between different parts of an SoS.
The RMM links requirements and scopes for diagnosing the
violated constraints and tracing violations to their originating
elements in the SoS architecture. Also, each constraint in the
RMM is related with one or more events, e. g., the events
involved in a particular sequence checked by the constraint.
Further, for each event that led to a constraint violation,
the related scope elements of the SoS architecture can be
determined based on the probes when diagnosing violations.
The R EMINDS framework [9] provides tools to deﬁne
constraints using the DSL and to instrument an SoS using
probes, e. g., using Aspect-Oriented Programming or direct
code instrumentation [5]. Engineers can deﬁne scopes, types
of events, and relations between the elements of the RMM.
Probes send events and data from the monitored software to
the R EMINDS monitoring server, which aggregates and stores
them. Applications can subscribe to this server to receive
events and data. One application is the constraint checker [6],
which continuously analyzes the stream of events to inform
users about requirements violations. An end-user application
is the monitoring client [9] providing a basic representation of
scopes, probes, events and data, and requirements violations.
Our tool demonstration paper describes the visualization ca-
pabilities we developed to complement and extend this tool to
make it more suitable for industrial monitoring scenarios.
III. I NDUSTRIAL MONITORING SCENARIO
Primetals Technologies is a leading engineering and plant-
building company in the iron, steel, and aluminum industries.
Its plant automation SoS (PAS) tracks and optimizes different
stages of the metallurgical production process. It comprises
systems for process automation of melting iron ore and raw
materials, reﬁning liquid iron to produce steel, and casting
liquid steel. The correct interplay between these independently
developed software and hardware systems is crucial to guar-
antee continuous, uninterrupted production and high-quality
products.
Engineers at Primetals Technologies thus monitor if and
how the PAS meets its requirements at runtime. Even though
the basic capabilities essential for running the PAS and en-
suring its safety are checked and guaranteed already on the
machine automation layer, the full behavior of the process
optimization and automation systems only can be checked
at runtime when they interact with each other, the hardware,
and third-party systems. For instance, engineers need to check
the components’ correct timing or measure performance and
resource consumption. For example, the Optimizer system
optimizes the cutting of steel slabs to minimize scrap and max-
imize the resulting quality of the slabs. A key requirement for
theOptimizer regards it correct operation and performance,
Fig. 1: Monitoring a plant automation system of systems: drill-down
scenario.
i. e., after being triggered by another system or the user, it must
perform the correct sequence of events (read tracking data,
calculate optimizations, provide calculation results to other
systems) within a certain time period. When a monitoring tool
detects a violation of such a PAS requirement at runtime an
engineer needs to investigate the cause of the violation (cf.
Fig. 1):
(1) The engineer checks the status of the overall plant
automation SoS to determine for which systems or components
violations have been detected. For this purpose she needs an
overview of the monitored SoS and the violations that have
occurred. Our tool provides such a status overview visualizing
the monitored scopes and their relations in tree and high-
lighting scopes with violations as described in Section IV-A.
For example, the status view may highlight the Optimizer
system to indicate its error-state.
(2) The engineer then also investigates how many violations
already occurred for the different requirements. For instance,
a pie chart could depict that the Optimizer requirement
was checked X times and violated Y times (cf. Section IV-A).
The engineer may require further details about the time period
and the change rate of the detected violations. A monitoring
tool must thus compute and visualize trends and statistics on
violations. We provide views with area chart diagrams and
line diagrams for this purpose (cf. Section IV-B). For example,
these views can depict that the relative number of violations
of the Optimizer requirement increase after a certain point
in time.
(3) The engineer then analyzes the requirements violation
in detail, e. g., by reviewing details on the event time and
event data recorded when the violation occurred. We provide a
visualization for this purpose (cf. Section IV-C), which allows
users to view the events related to a violation and inspect the
data associated with these events, e. g., the events monitored
when the Optimizer violation occurred.
(4) The engineer then investigates the context of the viola-
tion by analyzing events and timing behavior. For example, the

violation of the Optimizer requirement could be the result
of missing events or caused by delays in executing the required
sequence of events. For this analysis the engineer needs details
on the order of events preceding the violation to discover
behavioral patterns, as provided by our Event Statechart view
described in Section IV-C.
Eventually, to investigate the root cause of (missing) events
that led to the violation, the engineer will inspect related
source code or other artifacts. For this purpose, the engineer
will use other engineering tools such IDEs, debugging tools,
or issue trackers [8].
IV. V ISUALIZATION SUPPORT
The industrial scenario and the study we conducted with
engineers [7] motivated us to extend R EMINDS with differ-
ent tool views. Speciﬁcally, we developed six visualizations:
(i) two status visualizations provide an overview of the mon-
itored SoS and the detected constraint violations, (ii) two
trending and statistics visualizations show details about each
constraint (e. g., the number of violations in different time
periods and the change rate of the violations), and (iii) two
event visualizations provide details on the monitored events,
including relations to other events and constraint violations.
We integrated the different views into the R EMINDS moni-
toring tool. We also guide users who need to switch between
views during diagnosis. Such guidance is essential in com-
plex tools with multiple views to reduce the high cognitive
load caused by many hidden dependencies not obvious for
users unfamiliar with the details of the underlying approach.
Hidden dependencies and hard mental operations are also two
important dimensions in the cognitive dimensions of notations
framework [11], a well-known method in the HCI community
to analyze usability trade-offs we had also used earlier to
assess the R EMINDS tool [7].
The starting point to begin a drill down in the R EMINDS
tool is a status view from which the user can choose oneparticular system component. Using context menus she can
activate the different trending, statistics and event views in
the suggested order. Furthermore, a toolbar allows users to
select an arbitrary view at any time. We use the Optimizer
scenario as a running example throughout this section.
A. System Status Views
The R EMINDS tool provides a tree-based view of the
monitored SoS allowing the engineer to start investigating
violations. Monitored components are depicted using icons
differing by scope type [10]. Relations between scopes –
e. g., the Caster system is part of the PAS SoS and the
Optimizer is part of the Caster system – are depicted
using edges with arrows. Components with violated constraints
are highlighted by adding an error symbol to the corresponding
node (cf. Fig. 2-(1)) when a violation is detected.
More detailed information about the status of the monitored
SoS is provided via pie charts (cf. Fig. 2-(2)) for all active
constraints, grouped by scope. Each pie chart shows the
percentage of violations detected for one constraint among
all checks performed for the constraint. Colors are used to
indicate the status and severity: green (consistent: constraint
checked but no violation detected), yellow (warning: violation
with low severity), orange (failure: check went wrong, e. g.,
due to missing data), and red (error: critical violation). In
the example depicted in Fig. 2-(2) the pie charts show that
a constraint checking the RunID of the Optimizer (Run
ID valid) has failed in all 28 cases and another constraint
checking the correct order and timing of Optimizer events
(Optimizer Cycle) was violated in 8 of 28 cases.
B. Trending and Statistics Views
For a more detailed analysis of the system status we provide
diagrams for each constraint in Trending and Statistics views,
using the same colors as the pie charts to indicate constraint
status/violation severity. As depicted in Fig. 3a, area chart
891

 (b) Status/Interval diagrams.
Fig. 3: Trending and Statistics Views.
diagrams in the Trending view depict for each constraint the
percentage of violations detected among the performed checks
(y-axis) for a certain point in time (x-axis). The diagram is
regularly updated with current values.
Through this view, it is easy for the user to identify a
time range in which system behavior deviated from the usual
behavior. In the example, we can see that in the last third
of the monitored period, constraint checks started to lead to
violations, which can be seen in the growing red area. The user
can select a particular time range (cf. the black rectangle in the
right half of Fig. 3a), e. g., the range with changing behavior.
This time range is then used by all other visualizations until
changed again, e. g., via the settings menu.
The Status/Interval view (cf. Fig. 3b) provides another
visualization of the status of constraints. It depicts the absolute
number of constraint checks and their status/severity for a
certain interval as stacked bars. The bars’ height refers to the
values shown on the right y-axis, i. e., the absolute number of
performed checks which resulted in an error, failure, warning
or consistent state in the time interval (x-axis). In the same di-
agram additional line plots depict the percentage of violations
detected among the checks performed in the same intervals.
The percentage is shown on the left y-axis. The information
of the x-axis remains the same as for the stacked bar chart
plot (time interval). The Status/Interval view is also regularly
updated and shows the latest ten entries. A slider allows to
move the time interval to the past (if not currently focused on
a particular time range already).
C. Live Event/Violation Views
Besides the constraints’ status, it is also useful to observe the
behavior of the monitored events and the constraint checks and
violations they trigger. For this purpose two views exist, both
referring to the currently selected monitored SoS component.
The Event Trending view (cf. Fig. 4a) shows a stacked bar
per ten second interval. Again, selecting a certain time range
is possible. The behavior of this diagram equals the behavior
(a) Event Trending.
 (b) Event Statechart.
Fig. 4: Live Event/Violation Views.
of the Interval/Status diagrams, i. e., per default the latest ten
entries (bars) are displayed and a slider allows to move the
view to the past.
Whenever an event occurs (i. e., an Optimizer event),
the stacked bar element is updated. Events are represented
by colored rectangles added to the stack. Different colors
represent different event types. Details such as event name,
timestamp, and related event data can be displayed on demand
when selecting a stacked bar element. Whenever a violation
occurs, it is added as a dot in the associated bar with respect to
the time the violation was detected. This relates the violation
with the ‘event stack’ monitored when the violation occurred.
Upon selecting a violation, the events involved in the violation
are highlighted using darker variants of the same colors. In
Fig. 4a, for example, the third stack (highlighted with a red
border) is selected. This stack contains four events that led
to a violation of the Optimizer Cycle constraint because
the wrong event type occurred in the checked sequence of
events. In particular, the constraint is triggered whenever
the event type Optimizer.feedCyclicData_START
occurs. Optimizer.feedCyclicData_FINISH is ex-
pected afterwards, but in the shown sequence Cut-
ting.feedOptimizationResult did occur instead
meaning that recent tracking data needed for the optimizations
might not have been available. The user can display details
about the violation in a separate dialog, e. g., the original
constraint deﬁnition and an explanation.
The Event Statechart view (cf. Fig. 4b) shows the standard
sequence of the occurrence of events as a graph (in this case
the events monitored from the Optimizer). This graph does
not depict every single event but the different event types. It
is automatically generated based on the events monitored by
REMINDS : when an event of a new type occurs, a new node
and a connection from the previous event type (if any) are
added to the graph. In case the event type already exists, either
892
Authorized licensed use limited to: LAHORE UNIV OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCES. Downloaded on August 07,2025 at 15:29:58 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. a new connection is generated (if no connection existed before)
or the connection line weight is updated, if the connection
already existed.
The current event (type) is displayed with a white back-
ground (i. e., Optimizer.getOptimizationResult),
while all others have a gray or red background. The current
connection (from Optimizer.optimize_FINISHED to
Optimizer.getOptimizationResult) is colored in
black, all others in gray. When a violation occurs, the trigger
event is highlighted using a red border (i. e., Cutting.-
feedOptimizationResult andOptimizer.feed-
CyclicData_START). It is also possible to show all
events related with a certain violation by selecting the ra-
dio button at the top right of the trigger event node. For
instance, Cutting.feedOptimizationResult is the
trigger event of the constraint RunId valid. It led to a vi-
olation because the expected data could not be found. Opti-
mizer.feedCyclicData_START as the trigger event of
theOptimizer Cycle constraint led to a violation because
the wrong event type occurred in the checked sequence of
events as described above.
The weight of the connection lines provides information
on how often this connection has occurred compared to all
other connections, i. e., how often a particular event (type)
was followed by a particular other event (type). This makes
the normal ﬂow of events and alternative courses visible to the
user. As depicted in Fig. 4b, for instance, some ‘transitions’
between events in our Optimizer example occurred more often
than others, i. e., 23 times (the thicker lines) vs. 1 time (the
thinner lines). The absolute number can be shown using the
tooltips of the connections.
It is also possible to ‘replay’ a past time period by visu-
alizing recorded events and violations. The user can replay
the event ﬂow of a speciﬁc time period either step by step
or by re-playing an entire time period at once. In both cases,
the user can pause the event-ﬂow at any time, for example, to
investigate violations. The user can also deﬁne ﬁlters, e. g., to
only show events of certain types.
D. Application to the Industrial Scenario
The drill-down scenario described in Section III is supported
by interrelating the previously described views. The tree-based
system status view (Fig. 2-(1)) provides an overview of the
monitored system (cf. scenario step (1)) as the starting point.
The user can either display trends and statistics for the overall
system (cf. scenario step (2)) or use the context menu of a
node of the tree-based status view to directly navigate to the
violated constraints of that particular system component (cf.
scenario step (3)), e. g., the Optimizer.
From each pie chart diagram, again using the context menu,
the user can open the Trending view (the area chart of the
same constraint; cf. Fig. 3a) to analyze trends regarding a
speciﬁc violation (cf. scenario steps (2) and (3)). As already
mentioned, it is possible to choose a speciﬁc time range in
this view, e. g., the period with the most violations. If the user
selects such a period, the view automatically switches to theStatus/Interval view (Fig. 3b), depicting the bar chart and line
plot diagram providing details for the selected time period.
The user can navigate to the Event Trending view (Fig. 4a)
from both the Trending as well as the Status/Interval view
using the context menu. If a time range was selected before,
it is also used in the Event Trending view. The engineer can
then investigate which events have occurred in this time range
and which have led to violations (cf. scenario step (4)). Further
details regarding the events can be investigated by switching
to the Event Statechart view. The user can either replay the
entire event-ﬂow of the time range or walk through step by
step (i. e., event by event). In our example, using the Event
Statechart view the user can check the typical event-ﬂow of
theOptimizer and then check the Optimizer Cycle
violation and its relation to particular events.
V. R ELATED WORK
Even though most monitoring tools lack support for pre-
senting monitoring results to end users [2], there are still some
tools providing visualizations.
Several tools support monitoring and visualization of
service-oriented systems. For example, the ECoWare [12]
dashboard supports on-line and off-line violation drill-down
analyses when monitoring service-based systems. RuMoR [13]
supports monitoring and recovery of Web service applications,
directly integrated in the IBM WebSphere environment. A
violation reporter generates a web page with information
about detected violations, as well as a form for selecting a
recovery plan. The SOA4All framework [14] provides three
different views: the Process View shows key performance
indicators of monitored processes and services, the Resource
View shows human or mechanized resources required for
executing processes, and the Object View visualizes business
objects such as inquiries, orders or claims. These views are
supplemented with basic descriptive statistics. In contrast to
these tools, we are not limited to service-based systems. We
also offer visualizations providing details about monitored
events and violations (cf. Section IV-C) in addition to logs,
trends, and statistics.
Some monitoring tools particularly focus on visualization
support of the architecture of the monitored systems. For
example, ARAMIS [15] focuses on real-time visualization
of software architectures. A web-based tool builds and vi-
sualizes sequence diagrams in real-time. Similarly, the MO-
SAICO [16] approach to monitoring architectural properties
allows to deﬁne and visualize property sequence charts using
a UML-based notation. The ExplorViz [17] approach offers
hierarchical visualization and multi-layer monitoring from
landscape level to application level, e. g., for cloud-based
applications. Our visualization of scopes and their relations
also provides a higher-level visualization of the architecture
of a monitored SoS as a starting point. Unlike the other tools,
our visualizations allow to ‘dig deeper’ and investigate events
and violations in detail.
Monere [18], an approach to monitor BPEL processes,
comes with a resource tree view providing a hierarchical
893
Authorized licensed use limited to: LAHORE UNIV OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCES. Downloaded on August 07,2025 at 15:29:58 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. overview of all monitored components and a dependency
view displaying dependencies of a selected component. There
are panels to display activities, log messages and metrics of
monitored BPEL processes. Values are updated in real-time.
Other views show charts of historical data, which supports
users in identifying trends and anomalies. In contrast to
tools like Monere, we are not focusing on (business) process
monitoring and provide more details on constraint violations.
The requirements monitoring framework ReqMon [4] pro-
vides real-time feedback on requirement satisfaction using a
digital dashboard for monitoring results presenting information
on the status of requirements at runtime as well as historical
data. The ReqMon presenter uses UML diagrams, such as
message sequence diagrams and activity diagrams, for visu-
alization. Our tool, apart from its different focus (systems
of systems), also visualizes the relations of events and the
violations they caused in more detail allowing to observe the
event ﬂow and visually recognize deviations from the normal
course.
(Application) performance monitoring tools, such as
Kieker [19] or Dynatrace (http://www.dynatrace.com) provide
diverse sophisticated visualizations of a monitored system’s
performance, but do not focus on monitoring requirements.
Similar to our tool, they support a drill down from higher-
level visualizations (performance or system health) to details
about monitored components.
VI. C ONCLUSION
In this tool demo paper we presented different visualizations
we developed based on an industrial scenario and integrated
into the R EMINDS requirements monitoring tool for systems
of systems. Speciﬁcally, different views in the tool depict
the system status, detected requirements violations, violation
trends and statistics, and the events leading to violations.
REMINDS is currently used by our industry partner Primetals
Technologies to capture and analyze events and data from
particular systems in their plant automation SoS at runtime.
Initial feedback we received from them conﬁrms the usefulness
of our tool support.
In our future work we plan to integrate further statistics
views and want to implement warnings informing users about
trends such as an increase of violations for a particular
constraint. We also will evaluate the usefulness of our visual-
izations in detail, e. g., by performing a user study with our
industry partner providing empirical data on the usability as
well as utility of our tool.
