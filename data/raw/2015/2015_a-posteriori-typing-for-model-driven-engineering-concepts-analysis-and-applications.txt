ABSTRACT
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a software engineering par-
adigm where models are actively used to specify, test, simulate,analyse and maintain the systems to be built, among other ac-tivities. Models can be defined using general-purpose modellinglanguages like the UML, but for particular domains, the use of
domain-specificlanguagesispervasive.Eitherway,modelsmust
conform to a meta-model which defines their abstract syntax.
InMDE,thedefinitionofmodelmanagementoperations–often
typedoverproject-specificmeta-models–isrecurrent.However,
even if two operations are similar, they must be developed from
scratchwhenevertheyareappliedtoinstancesofdifferentmeta-
models. This is so as operations defined (i.e., typed) over a meta-
model cannot be directly reused for another. Part of this difficulty
ofreuseisbecauseclassesinmeta-modelsareusedintwoways:as
templates to create objects and as static classifiers for them. These
twoaspectsareinherentlytiedinmostmeta-modellingapproaches,

A posteriori typing enhances flexibility because it allows models
to be retyped with respect to other meta-models. Hence, we distin-
guish between creationmeta-models used to construct models, and

creation meta-model, once such models are reclassified. Moreover,

transformations by reclassification. The transformations definedas reclassifications have better performance than the equivalentones defined with traditional transformation languages, because
reclassification does not require creating new objects.

transformations expressed as retypings, and retypings bridging
recurring meta-model heterogeneities, are available at http://miso.
