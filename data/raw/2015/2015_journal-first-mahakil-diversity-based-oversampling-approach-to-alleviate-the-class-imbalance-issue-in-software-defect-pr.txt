ABSTRACT
ThisstudypresentsMAHAKIL,anovelandefficientsyntheticover-
samplingapproachforsoftwaredefectdatasetsthatisbasedonthe
chromosomal theory of inheritance. Exploiting this theory, MA-
HAKIL interprets two distinct sub-classes as parents and generates
anewinstancethatinheritsdifferenttraitsfromeachparentand
contributes to the diversity within the data distribution. We exten-
sively compare MAHAKIL with five other sampling approaches
using20releasesofdefectdatasetsfromthePROMISErepository
and five prediction models. Our experiments indicate that MA-
HAKIL improves the prediction performance for all the models
and achieves better and moresignificant pfvalues than the other
oversampling approaches, based on robust statistical tests.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3180155.3182520oversampling techniques address this concern by creating new mi-
noritydefectivemodulestobalancetheminorityandmajorityclass
distribution. Notwithstanding the successes attained by these tech-
niques,theysometimesgenerateerroneousdatainstances,which
lead to high false positives. They also tend to generate less diverse
data points and data points very similar to existing samples be-
cause they consider only nearest neighbor samples. We proposea novel oversampling technique that generates diverse synthetic
data restricted within the minority class region.
2 APPROACH AND UNIQUENESS
Ourproposedoversamplingapproachtakesinspirationfromthe
fieldofbiologybyconsideringhowdiversepopulationsofliving
organismsdifferalthoughtheyareofthesamespecies.Thisphe-
nomenon,explainedbytheChromosomalTheoryofInheritance
[1],justifieshowanoffspringinheritstraitsfromtheirparentsby
obtaining chromosomes from each parent in equal quantity. The
proposed approach named MAHAKIL (oversampling based on the
theory of inheritance and the Mahalanobis distance), increases the
diversitywithintheminorityclassbyuniquelycreatingnewsyn-
thetic minority instances based on a "typical" case (having a small
diversity measure distance value) and an "atypical" case (havingalargediversitymeasuredistancevalue)sothattheresultantin-
stance becomes not too typical and not too atypical. New samples
are generated by computing the average between two instances
merged together based on the Mahalanobis distance disparity.
For empirical validations, twenty imbalanced defect datasets
from the PROMISE repository and five classification algorithms
(C4.5,NNET,KNN,RF,SVM)areconsideredandevaluatedwiththe
