ABSTRACT
WebView is a widely used Android component that augments a
native app with web browser capabilities. It eases the interactions
between an app’s native code and web code. However, the interac-
tionmechanismofWebViewinducesnewtypesofbugsinAndroid
apps. Understanding the characteristics and manifestation of these
WebView-induced bugs ( ωBugs for short) facilitates the correct
usagesofWebViewsinAndroidapps.Thismotivatesustoconduct
thefirstempiricalstudyon ωBugsbasedonthosefoundinpopular
open-source Android apps. Our study identified the major root
causesand consequencesof ωBugsand madeinteresting observa-
tions that can be leveraged for detecting and diagnosing ωBugs.
Basedontheempiricalstudy,wefurtherproposeanautomatedtest-ingtechnique

In our experiments, ωDroid successfully discovered 30 unique and
previously-unknown ωBugs when applied to 146 open-source An-
droid apps. We reported the 30 ωBugs to the corresponding app
developers. Out of these 30 ωBugs, 14 were confirmed and 7 of
them were fixed. This shows that ωDroid can effectively detect
ωBugs that are of the developers’ concern.

Despiteitsusefulness,theinteractionmechanismofWebViewis

performance[ 33]andvulnerabletosecurityattacks[ 28].Existing
studiesfocusmainlyonthesecurityissuesinducedbyWebView[ 68,
77,78,81,82,87,91,93,95,97]. There is also an earlier study on
detectingbugsintheWebViewbridgesbetweenJavaandJavaScriptcode in Android apps [
77]. Nonetheless, these existing studies only
explored a small fraction of WebView-induced bugs ( ωBugs for
short) from limited perspectives. They did not aim to provide a
systematic examination of such bugs. In fact, little is known about
how WebView induces bugs to real-world Android apps.

caused by common JavaScript errors [ 88,89,92] are excluded from
our scope. Our study aims to understand ωBugs from a wide range
of perspectives by answering three research questions:
•RQ1(BugCause): What are the common root causes of ωBugs in
Android apps? Can they be categorized?
•RQ2 (Bug Consequence): What are the common consequences
ofωBugs in Android apps? How do ωBugs affect user experience?

WebViewlifecyclemisalignmentsofteninduceresourceleakages
and UI inconsistencies. This inspired us to design test oracles to
facilitate the testing of ωBugs.

A WebView’s lifecycle differs from that of its enclosing activ-
ity/fragment. It only has three states: Resumed, Paused, and De-
stroyed,asshowninthegreypartofFigure 1.AWebViewbecomes

The resources loaded by a WebView such as video/audio, anima-
tion, geolocation are paused when WebView enters the Paused
state. A WebView will be destroyed after entering the Destroyed
state. Unlike an activity/fragment whose state transitions are man-
agedbytheAndroidOS,aWebView’sstatetransitionsshouldbe
explicitly managed by appdevelopersvia invoking specific Web-
ViewAPIs.Forexample,aWebViewentersthe Pausedstateafter

3 EMPIRICAL STUDY METHODOLOGY
Wefollowedtheprocessadoptedbyexistingwork[ 71,79,80,98]to
preparethedatasetforourempiricalstudy.Specifically,weselected
open-sourceAndroidappsasourstudysubjectsbecauseweneed
to dig into the apps’ documented bugs and corresponding code
revisions to answer RQ1–3. We searched for suitable subjects by
scanning all apps on F-Droid [ 20], a popular open-source Android
apphostingsitethatiswidelyusedbyearlierstudies[ 75,96,98].
We also included a set of open-source Android apps that were
studied by previous work [ 67,70,72,75,90,99] but not hosted
on F-Droid. We considered an app to be a suitable subject if its
sourcecodecontainsatleastoneinstanceofthestatement“ import
android.webkit.WebView; ”,whichindicatestheuseofWebViews.
In total, we obtained 293 open-source Android apps for our study.
To locate ωBugs in the 293 apps, we searched for code revi-
sions and closed bug reports that contain keywords “webview”or “javascript” (case insensitive). 952 revisions and 1028 bug re-
portswerereturnedbysearchingthekeyword“webview”;257revi-sions and 347 bug reports were returned by searching the keyword
“javascript”.Thereturnedrevisionsandbugreportsmayoverlapas
acoderevisionandabugreportmaycontainbothkeywords.We
took the following steps to filter out noises from the search results:
•We first excluded the code revisions and bug reports that are not
related to valid ωBugs. For example, some bug reports may be
featurerequestsfromusers.Somecoderevisionsandbugreports
may accidentally contain our search keywords.
•For the bug reports that remained after the first step, we tried to
recoverthebug-fixingrevision(s).Abugreportwaskeptinour
dataset only if we successfully found the bug-fixing revision(s).
•For the code revisions that remained after the first step, we only
keptthosethatsatisfythefollowingconstraints:(1)wefoundthebug report(s) for the issues addressed in the code revisions, or (2)
the commit logs or comments in code diff explicitly indicate that
the code revisions are bug-fixing revisions.Table1:ωBugsrootcausecategoriesandtheirdistributions.

Four of the co-authors were involved in the process for data col-

tisticsoftheseapps.Informationincludingthenumberofstars,app
size(inKLOC),numberofrevisionsandissuesarecollectedfrom
theapps’projecthostingsitesuchasGitHub[ 26].Otherinforma-
tion including the app rating, category, and number of downloads
are collected from Google Play store [ 27] (10 of the 51 apps are not
availableonGooglePlaystore).Suchdatashowthatoursubjectsare
(1) large in size (around 10 KLOC on average), (2) well-maintained
(containing thousandsof revisionsand hundredsof issueson av-
erage), (3) popular (90% of them received over 10K downloads),and (4) diversified (covering 14 categories). We carefully studiedthese
ωBugs by analyzing their bug reports, code revisions, and
relateddiscussionsfromonlineforumssuchasStackOverflow[ 52]
to answer RQ1–3. This took many rounds of investigations and
discussions. In the end, the four co-authors reached consensus on
the root cause, consequence, and manifestation for every ωBug in
the dataset.
4 EMPIRICAL STUDY RESULTS
4.1 RQ1: Bug Cause
We studied the patches and bug reports of the 124 ωBugs in our
dataset to understand their root causes. We identified six major
categoriesofrootcausesfromthese ωBugs.Table 1liststhecate-
goriesandthenumberofbugsineachcategory.Inthefollowing,
we discuss the common root causes with examples.
4.1.1 Misaligned WebView Lifecycles. 35 of the 124 ωBugs are
causedbythemisalignmentbetweenaWebView’slifecyclestate
and that of its enclosing activity/fragment. We call this phenom-
enonlifecyclemisalignment.Whentheenclosingcomponentofa
WebView enters a certain lifecycle state, it expects the enclosed
WebViewtoenteracorrespondinglifecyclestate.However,since
the lifecycle of a WebView and that of its enclosing component are
separatelymaintainedbyappdevelopersandAndroidOS,lifecy-
clemisalignmentscaneasilyarise,inducing ωBugs.Forexample,
WordPress contained a bug (issue 484 [ 64]) that caused users to
keep hearing video sounds after they left an activity enclosing
a video-playing WebView. The bug occurred because developers
did not properly make the WebView enter Pausedstate when its
enclosing activity is paused. To fix this bug, developers aligned
thelifecycleoftheWebViewwiththatofitsenclosingactivity,as

shown in Figure 3, by explicitly calling mWebView.onPause() (line
5) in the onPause() callback of WebViewActivity.
4.1.2 WebViewEvolution&DeviceCustomization. ωBugscanex-
pose severe compatibility problems. These bugs occurred because
WebViewisfastevolvingandnon-uniformlysupportedondifferent
device models, causing a WebView to behave inconsistently across
WebView versions and devices. We identified 40 such ωBugs .
In Android ecosystem, the WebView package is maintained and
upgraded separately from Android OS since Android 5 [ 6]. This
aggravates the situation of compatibility problems [ 74,98] because
ωBugs can occur not only when the Android OS upgrades but also
when WebView itself is upgraded. We observed 33 such bugs in
our dataset.For example,Gadgetbridge issue758 [ 24]was caused
byanupgradeofWebViewtoversion60thatstoppedsupporting
top-framenavigationstodataURLsbecausesuchnavigationswere
widely used in spoofing and phishing attacks [ 43]. App developers
have to modify their code to adapt to the change.
Besides,WebViewisnotsupporteduniformlyacrossdevicemod-
els.Asa result, ωBugscanbedevice-specific. Weobserved7such
bugs in our dataset. For example, Aard Dictionary suffered from
a bug (issue 28 [ 3]) that caused the page scrolling in a WebView
on e-ink devices to create a lot of screen refreshing and annoy-
ingflickers.Thebugoccurredbecausethehighdisplaylatencyof
e-inkdevicesmakesithardtoguaranteethesmoothnessofpage
scrolling [1].
4.1.3 Misconfiguration. ManywebpagesrequirecustomizedWe-
bView settings to function properly. For example, displaying a
webpage with JavaScript content requires JavaScript to be enabled
in WebView settings. Misconfigured WebView settings can prevent
a webpage from being loaded and displayed correctly. However,properly configuring WebViews is non-trivial because there are
over50configurableparametersin WebSettings [61],andinmany
casesthewebpagestobeloadedatruntimemaynotbeknownin
advancewhenanappisdeveloped.21ofthe124 ωBugsoccurred
duetothemisconfigurationofWebViewsettings.Forinstance,four
bugreportsinNextcloudNewsReader[ 34]mentionedthatarticles
aredisplayedusingdesktopconfigurationwithlargescreenwidths
(Figure6a). This would significantly reduce the readability as users
have to frequently scroll their screens from left to right to read
an article. The problem occurred because the WebView in the app
failedtoredirecttherequeststomobilesites.Suchredirectionrelies
on the web storage capability that needs to be explicitly enabled
in WebView settings. The developers of the app fixed the bug byproperly configuring the WebView, i.e., enabling web storage by
invoking WebSettings.setDomStorageEnabled(true).( 1

4.1.4 API Misuse. 16 of the 124 ωBugs were caused by the mis-
usesofWebViewAPIs.WhileWebViewprovidespowerfulAPIsfor
bi-directional interactions between an app’s web end and native
end, the protocols of these APIs are complex. Without good under-
standing of the constraints imposed by these protocols, developers
can easily make mistakes when using WebView APIs. An example
of such constraints is that WebView APIs must be called on an
app’sUIthread.AccordingtoWebViewdocumentation[ 31]:"ifyou
call methodson WebView from anythread other thanyour app’s UI
thread, it can cause unexpected results". However, we observed 7
cases where this protocol is violated. For instance, Figure 4shows
the patch for WordPress issue 1057 [ 64]. In the buggy version, We-
bViewAPIsweremistakenlycalledonanon-UIthread(lines8–11).
DevelopersfixedthebugbyrelocatingtheAPIcallstotheUIthread
(lines 1–4). Another example of the constraints is the timeliness
of WebView API invocation. Invocation of some WebView APIs is
subjecttotimeconstraints.Violationsoftheseconstraintscanre-
sultinruntimeerrors.Forinstance,theAPI getUrl() willreturn
nullifwebpageloadinghasnotyetfinished.Thiscaneasilylead
toNullPointerException . Slide suffered from app crashes (issue
2540 [49]) due to the premature invocation of getUrl().
4.1.5 Bridge Communication. Previous work [ 77] has shown that
the bridge communication between Java and JavaScript is error-
prone. We observed four bugs related to bridge communications in
our dataset. For example, two performance bugs in Wikipedia [ 63]
occurredduetoheavytransactionsacrossthebridge.Thisforced
the system to allocate a huge amount of memory for data com-
municationsacrossthebridge,therebyincreasingthechancesof
stackoverflowandoutofmemoryerrors.Theothertwobugsoc-
curredbecauseofobfuscation.Whenthebridgeobjectmethodsare
obfuscated, they cannot be called by name from JavaScript.
4.1.6 WebView Limitation. Although WebView is a powerful com-
ponent, it has limitations. Due to security concerns, WebView can-
not support all web browsing features. As a result, developers may
encounter problems when they implement features that WebView
cannotsupport.Weobservedfivesuch ωBugs.Forexample,several
bug reports in WordPress [ 64] and RedReader [ 42] mentioned that
WebViews showed a blank page when opening file download links
(e.g.,pdf),whichisnotsupportedbyWebView.Developersfixed
these bugs by launching web browsers to handle the links.

Answer to RQ1: We identified six categories of common root
causes for ωBugs in Android apps, where misaligned WebView
lifecyclesand WebViewevolution&device customizationare
twodominantones.Onlyafewofourstudied ωBugsarecaused
by bi-directional interactions across WebView bridge objects.
4.2 RQ2: Bug Consequence
Tounderstandthecommon consequences of ωBugs,we analyzed
thebugreports,follow-updiscussions,commitlogs,andcorrelated
codecommentsofthe ωBugsinourdataset.For ωBugsthatwecan-
not identify consequences from their textual descriptions, we man-
ually reproduced them in emulators to observe its consequences at
runtime.Intotal,wesuccessfullyidentifiedtheconsequencesof114
ωBugs.Wefailedtoreproducetheremaining10bugsduetolack
ofconfigurationdetailsornecessaryenvironments.Weobserved
the following common types of consequences caused by ωBugs.
4.2.1 Performance Degradation. 31 of the 124 ωBugs induced per-
formance degradations. These bugs demonstrate similar conse-
quences of conventional performance bugs [ 79]. They can cause
resource leakages, battery drains, app slowdowns, etc. For exam-
ple,AntennaPodrevision77647cc[ 9](Figure 5)fixedaWebView-
induced memory leakage. The bug occurred due to the lifecycle
misalignment problem (Section 4.1.1): when destroying the enclos-
ingactivityofaWebView,developersforgottodestroytheenclosed

leakage.ThebugwasfixedbyaddinganexplicitcalltotheWeb-
View’s destroy() API (line 7) in the onDestroy() callback of the
enclosing AboutActivity.
4.2.2 ProblematicUIDisplay. 29ofthe124 ωBugsresultedinprob-
lematicUI displaysinWebViews. SinceWebViews areintensively
used to display webpages in Android apps, such problems cansignificantly affect app usability such as the example (Figure 6a)
discussed in Section 4.1.3. WebView may also display web content
incorrectly.Forexample,Figure 6bshowsaWebViewdisplaying
garbled characters (PocketHub issue 427 [ 38]), which was induced
by WebView API evolution.
4.2.3 UI Inconsistency. Another 17 of the 124 ωBugs exhibit UI
inconsistencies after a restart of the WebView’s enclosing activ-ity/fragment. For example, in Wikipedia bug report T63512 [
63],
(a)NextcloundNewsReader
 (b) PocketHub
Figure 6: Problematic UI displays of WebView
users complained about the inconsistent display of webpages: If
theenclosingactivityofaWebViewisrestartedafterusersscroll
downawebpage,thewebpagewillbereloadedandtheusers’scroll
position will get lost. Such problems are common since events that
inducerestartofactivity/fragment(e.g.,devicerotation,exitingand
re-entering an app, etc) are commonly triggered by app users.
For the remaining 37 bugs, 15 of them induce crashes (e.g., Slide
issue 2540 [ 49]) and the rest 22 bugs are app-specific functional
issues.Wecanobservefromtheabovediscussionsthatthemajority
of our studied ωBugs cause performance or UI issues. Generally, it
is non-trivial to define test oracles to detect performance and UIbugsviatesting[
79,86].However,studyingtheconsequencesof
ωBugsenablesustoproposemechanismstogeneratetestoracles
for common ωBugs, which will be elaborated in the next section.
AnswertoRQ2: Majorconsequencescausedby ωBugsinclude
performance degradation, UI issues, and app crashes. These
consequences can lead to poor user experience.
4.3 RQ3: Bug Manifestation
Understanding the manifestation of ωBugs can help us design and
select effective tests to detect ωBugs. In RQ3, we aim to investigate
common inputs required to trigger ωBugs so as to design effective
WebView testing techniques. We studied the bug reports, code
revisions and related discussions of the ωBugs in our dataset to
learn how these bugs were triggered and noted by app developers.
Similar to what we did when studying ωBugs consequences, we
manually reproduced the ωBugs, for which we fail to learn the
manifestationfromtextualdatasources.Intotal,wesuccessfully
understoodthemanifestationof97ofthe127 ωBugs.Theremaining

demonstrate common challenges in testing ωBugs.
4.3.1 Manifestation of ωBugs Can be Content-sensitive. The man-
ifestation of 30 ωBugs requires webpages with specific content
such as images (e.g., AnkiDroid issue 2824 [ 8]), animations (e.g.,
NextcloudNewsReaderissue331[ 34]),video/audio(e.g.,WordPress
issue484[ 64],seeSection 4.1),andvariouscharacterencodings(e.g.,
PocketHub issue 427 [ 38]). For example, WordPress issue 484 [ 64]

tent.However,w ebpagecontentscanbehighlydiversifiedwhile
anωBugcanonlybetriggeredbyspecificcontents.Therefore,how
toselectwebpageswiththespecificcontenttoeffectivelyexpose
ωBugs is a critical challenge for WebView testing.
4.3.2 LifecycleEventsareRequiredtoTriggerCommon ωBugs.In
our dataset, 27 ωBugs require specific sequence of lifecycle events
to trigger. For example, WordPress issue 484 (Figure 3) can only
be triggered when the enclosing activity of the WebView is cre-ated and paused. The bug in AntennaPod (Figure 5) can only be
triggeredwhentheenclosingactivityoftheWebViewentersthe De-
stroyedstate.Thisobservationindicatesthatgeneratingsequence
of lifecycle events is often needed when testing ωBugs.
4.3.3 EffectiveOraclesCanbeProposedforAutomatedDetectionof
ωBugs.TheωBugs in our dataset were confirmed mainly based on
developers’ manual judgement. We carefully studied the measures
developers took to determine the existence of these ωBugs and
examined if the measures can be generalized as test oracles for
ωBugs. As a result, we made two observations.
First, 25 of the 124 ωBugs can be identified by comparing app
UI displays or resource usages before and after triggering lifecycle
events.AsdiscussedinSection 4.1,ωBugsarecommonlycausedby
themisalignmentbetweenthelifecyclestateofaWebViewandthat
ofitsenclosingactivity/fragment.Weobservedthatthemajority
(23/35)ofsuchbugscanbeidentifiedbycomparingappUIdisplays
or resource usages before and after triggering lifecycle events. For
example, Wikipedia issue T63512 discussed in Section 4.2.3can be
detected via comparing the app UI displays before and after recre-
ating the WebView’s enclosing activity (no matter which part of a
webpagewasoriginallydisplayedbytheWebViewonthescreen,
thetopofthewedpagewouldbedisplayedafteractivityrecreation).
WordPress issue 484 discussed in Section 4.1is an another typical
example that can be detected by comparing the video resource
usagesbeforeandafterpausingtheWebView’senclosingactivity
(thevideowouldcontinuetoplayevenwhentheactivityispaused).This observation motivates us to leverage such comparisons as test
oracles to detect ωBugs that are caused by misaligned WebView
lifecycles (Section 5).Second,another12ofthe124 ωBugscanbeidentifiedbycom-
paring the behaviors of WebViews and web browsers. Some appdevelopers took web browsers’ behaviors (e.g., Chrome and Fire-
Fox) as an oracle to identify abnormal webpage display issues. For
example, an ωBug in Save for Offline [ 45] that displays overlapped
contentcanbeidentifiedby comparingthepagedisplayedbythe
WebView and that displayed by the Android default browser, as
showninFigure 7.Thissuggeststhepossibilityofleveragingdif-
ferential testing to detect ωBugs.
4.3.4 Conventional Test Coverage Criteria May Not Apply to ωBug
Testing.Unlike a native app, the program logic of an app using
WebViews spans across its web code and native code. For example,
a popular game 2048 [ 2] only contains one activity and 136 lines
of Java code. Its complex game functionalities are implemented in
JavaScript.Asaresult,conventionaltestcoveragecriteria(e.g.,code
coverageoractivitycoverage)leveragedbyexistingtestgenerationtechniques[
66,84,85,96]maynotbeeffectivefortesting ωBugs.In
particular, JavaScript code coverage may not be applicable because
(1)themanifestationofmany ωBugsdoesnotrequiretheexecution
of JavaScript code and (2) it is hard to measure the total number of
JavaScript code since a WebView can display an unlimited number
of webpages. To effectively test ωBugs, new criteria measuring the
coverage of different WebView states and WebView’s interactions
withappnativecomponentsaredesirable.Futureresearchcanfocus
on designing such coverage criteria to aid ωBugs testing.
Answer to RQ3: ωBugs’s manifestation highly depends on
the content of the loaded webpages and often requires the inter-ventionoflifecycleevents.Automatedoraclesandnewcoverage
criteria are needed to effectively test apps using WebViews.
5 TESTING ωBUGS
Drivenbyourempiricalfindings,weproposeanautomatedtesting
technique ωDroid to detect common types of ωBugs in real-world
Androidapps.Thetechniqueisdesignedbasedontwomajorob-
servations(section 4.3):(1)lifecycleeventsarerequiredtotrigger
common ωBugs, and (2) ωBugs can be identified by comparing UI
displaysandresourceusagesbeforeandaftertriggeringlifecycle
events. Inspired by the first observation, ωDroid generates test
cases by injectingpredefined lifecycle event sequences on-the-fly
when the execution of an app reaches a screen containing Web-
View components. ωDroid then leverages the second observation
to compare app UI displays and resource usages before and after
the app handles the injected events to identify ωBugs.
Figure8presentsahigh-leveloverviewof ωDroid,whichcon-
sists of three modules: Test Event Generator, Lifecycle Event Injector,

Figure 8: Overview of ωDroid
5.1 Test Event Generator
TheTest EventGenerator module generatestest eventsfor agiven
AUT. It exercises the AUT using existing test generation tech-
niques for Android apps and builds UI models of WebViews for
furtheranalysis.Weimplemented ωDroidontopofMonkey[ 7]
while it can be adapted to work with other test generation ap-
proaches [ 66,69,73,76,83–85,96]. To detect the existence of Web-
Views,TestEventGenerator analyzestheUIhierarchyofthescreen
right after the AUT handles each triggered event. If WebViews
exist in the current screen, it builds a UI model for the loaded page.
The UI model will be used later by the Lifecycle Misalignment Ora-
clemodule to detect ωBugs. The UI model of a webpageis a DOM
tree (illustrated in Figure 9) extracted using UiAutomation [ 57]. In
the UI model, leaf nodes represent elements in the webpage that
aredisplayedtouserandnon-leafnodesindicatehowleafnodes
are organized in the WebView. Each node has a set of attributes:
classname,contentdescription,checkable,checked,clickable,enabled,
focusable, focused, scrollable, long-clickable, password, and selected.
Challenge: A key challenge in Test Event Generator is to deter-
minethetimetobuildtheUImodelwhenawebpageisloaded.The
model should be built after the page is fully rendered; otherwise
thebuiltmodelwouldbeincompleteandcauseimprecisioninlater
steps. However, the loading time of a page is non-deterministic,
depending on the page content and network speed.
Solution: Weaddressedthechallengebyleveragingtwocom-
monscenariosinwhichapage’sDOMstructurechangeswhenit
isbeingloaded.Inthefirstscenario,aWebViewdisplayseithera
blankpage ora simple“loading”message untilit hasfullyloaded
the page. In this case, we have a trivial DOM structure for a while
inthebeginning,followedbyasteadynon-trivialDOMstructure
after the page has been loaded. In the second scenario, a WebView
rendersapageprogressivelywithlightcontent(e.g.,text)displayed
beforeheavycontent(e.g.imagesandvideos).Inthiscase,wehavean evolving DOM structure that gradually becomes non-trivial and
steady after the page has been loaded. With these observations,
ωDroiddelaysthebuildingofaUImodelforapageuntilitdetects
the existence of a steady non-trivial DOM structure or timeout.If such DOM structure is detected, the current DOM tree will be
treatedastheUImodelfortheloadedpage.Notethat ωDroidmon-
itorsthechangesofDOMstructureinsteadofthechangesofDOM
contents as the loaded contents may be dynamic (e.g., animations).

containingWebViews.Theseeventsequencescancauseanactivity
to go through the following state changes: (1) paused and then
resumed,(2)stoppedandthenrestarted,and(3)destroyedandthen
recreated. By injecting such event sequences, ωDroid can explore
all thelifecycle states ofa WebView’s enclosingactivity/fragment
and simulate common user interactions on the app such as turning
screen off and on, pressing home button and re-entering the AUT,
and rotating devices. After the AUT handles each injected lifecycle
eventsequence, ωDroidrebuildsaUImodelforthewebpagebe-
ingdisplayedintheWebViewusingthemechanismdiscussedin
Section5.1.Themodelisthenfedintothe LifecycleMisalignment
Oraclemodule to detect ωBugs.
5.3 Lifecycle Misalignment Oracle
TheLifecycle Misalignment Oracle module relies on two rules to
detectωBugs. The rule for detecting UI inconsistencies is based on
acommon senseexpectation[ 100]that thedisplayedcontent ofa
WebViewafteractivityrestartshouldbeconsistentwiththatbefore
therestart.Therulefordetectingunpausedresourcesisbasedonthe
expectationthatwhentheenclosingactivityispaused,resources
loadedbyWebViewsshouldbepausedaswell.Thecurrentversion
ofωDroid only detects unpaused video resources. We leave the
detectionofotherkindsofresourcesasfuturework. ωDroidreports
anωBug if any of the two rules is violated.
Challenge: Whilethedetectionofunpausedvideoresourcescan
beimplemented bytestingsoundfrom videoaftertheWebView’s
enclosingactivityispaused,itisnon-trivialtodefineanoracleto
detect UI inconsistencies of WebViews. Checking the differences of
screenshots [ 100] is inadequate. As explained in Section 5.1, many
webpages contain elements with dynamic effects such as anima-
tionsorvideos.Suchelementscanresultindifferentscreenshots
even when the webpage contents are the same. Furthermore, some
appsmayhandleactivityrestartsbysavingandrestoringthescroll
positions ofthe displayed webpages.The restored scrollpositions
can beslightly different fromthe original onesbefore the activity
restarts. Such differences are usually tolerable by users but screen-
shotsaresensitivetosubtlechanges.Asaresult,simplycomparing
screenshots may lead to false positives in ωBugs detection.

Solution: To precisely detect ωBugs,Lifecycle Misalignment Or-
aclemodule compares the webpages’ tree-based UI models before
and after the AUT handles the injected lifecycle events. Such UI
modelsignorethedynamiceffectsofwebpageelementsandthus
helpreducefalsepositivesinbugdetection.Thecomparisonoracle
is designed based on the intuition that all the previously-displayed
contentinaWebViewshouldbefoundinthepageaftertheWebView’s
enclosingactivityrestarts,andatleastpartofthepreviously-displayed
content should still be displayed after the activity restarts.
Mapping UI nodes. Figure9illustrates how to compare the tree-
based UI models. The models with label A and B represent the
UI models ofthe webpages before and after theenclosing activity
restarts. To compare the UI models, Lifecycle Misalignment Ora-
clefirst maps the visible nodes in A with nodes in B. This is neces-
sary because the elements in the displayed webpages do not have
uniqueidentifiers.Themappingisbasedonthetreestructureofthe
UImodelsandtheattributescontainedineachnode.Ifthestruc-
ture of a loaded webpage does not change, a node nin A is first

6 EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate the ability of ωDroid in detecting
real-world ωBugs by answering two research questions:
•RQ4(EffectivenessandPracticalityof ωDroid):CanωDroid
effectivelydetect ωBugsinreal-worldAndroidappsofconcern to
app developers?
•RQ5(UsefulnessofLifecycleEventsandTestOracles): Are
the lifecycle events injected by ωDroid and the test oracles adopted
byωDroid useful to identify anomalous app behaviors induced by
ωBugs?
6.1 Experimental Subjects and Setup
Weconductedevaluationbasedonthe293appsselectedinSection 3.
Amongthem,weexcludedthe51appswhichwereusedtoformour
empirical study dataset. We further filtered out those apps that do
not have any code revisions within the past six months for evalua-
tion. This is because we are only interested in actively-maintained
appssinceansweringRQ4requiresdevelopers’feedback.Asare-
sult, we obtained 146 apps for the experiments. We ran ωDroid on
the latest version of these apps to check if ωDroid can detect new
ωBugs in them. We followed the practice adopted by an existing
study [85] to set up our experiments and ran ωDroid for one hour
to test each subject. The tests were executed on Android emulatorsrunning Android 6.0(Marshmallow), which wasthe most popular
Android system version [5] at the time of our experiments.
To answer RQ5, we built two baseline methods for comparisons:
•Baseline I: Test Event Generator : This baseline leverages Test
Event Generator to trigger events and detect ωBugs based on
software crashes (a common test oracle used in existing stud-
ies [85,96]).
•BaselineII: TestEventGenerator +LifecycleEventInjector :Com-
paringtoBaselineI,BaselineIIadditionallyleverages Lifecycle
Event Injector to inject lifecycle events when app subjects are
being executed. It alsodetects ωBugs based onsoftware crashes.
For these two baselines, we reported the number of unique

multiple failures can be induced by the same ωBug. We consider
two failures as duplicates (caused by the same ωBug) if they are
manifested on the same WebView of the same activity/fragment
withthesameconsequences.Forexample, ωDroidreportedtwo

same consequences that the webpage reloads without restoring its
previous states after recreating the enclosing activity.
In total,ωDroid reported 36 unique bugs and 30 of them are

To evaluate the practicality of ωDroid, we reported the 30 TPs
found by ωDroid to the app developers for their feedback. In each
bugreport,weprovidedthereproductionsteps,screenshots,and
possible solutions. So far, we have received developers’ replies for
18 of the reported bugs. Developers confirmed 14 of the 18 bugs
and quickly fixed seven of them. They also provided positive feed-
backtoourreportedbugs.Forexample,developersofKimai[ 29]
responded “Good catch! Having always rotation lock on so didn’t
quite get that yet. Happy about PRs (pull requests);) ". The comment
shows the developers’ interest on the reported bug but they failed
toidentifyitastheydidnotinjectlifecycleeventswhentestingthe
app. This shows that ωDroid can detect unknown ωBugs that are
ofdevelopers’concern.Fortheotherfourbugs,threeofthemwere
considered not harmful by the developers and therefore there is no
needtofixthem.Oneofthem(MTGFamiliar[ 32])wasacknowl-
edgedbydevelopersbuttheywouldnotfixitbecauseWebViews
will be replaced in their app. Note that our oracle is based on com-
mon expectations of app responses to lifecycle events [ 100]. There
may be exceptional cases that app developers consider violating
such expectations is tolerable. However, this is not common in our
evaluation as we only observed three cases.
AnswertoRQ4: ωDroidcaneffectivelydetect ωBugsinAn-
droid apps with highprecision. ωDroid is practically useful
and can find ωBugs that are of developers’ concern.6.3 Results for RQ5
To show the usefulness of the injected lifecycle events and our
proposed oracles, we compared the results of ωDroid and the
two baseline methods. Since crash is a general oracle that can help
identifybugsbeyond ωBugs,whenevaluatingthebaselinemethods
we only counted the crashes related to WebView. We consider a
crashrelatedtoWebViewifthecrashnotificationmessagementions
WebView or there are WebView APIs in the crash stack.
Weobservedthat ωDroidoutperformedthebaselinemethods
bydetectingsignificantlymore ωBugs.Asdiscussedintheprevi-
oussection, ωDroiddetected30truebugs.Incontrast,baselineI
failed to detect any WebView-related crash, while baseline II only
detected one WebView-related crash for the app Shortyz [ 48]. The
crashoccurredafterdestroyingandrecreatingactivities.Itisworth
mentioning that the crash can also be detected by ωDroid since
crashes also cause UI display inconsistencies. Such results indicate
that injecting lifecycle events can help expose WebView-relatedcrashyetsuchcrashesarenotcommonasweonlyobservedonecase in our evaluation. Specific oracles are thus needed to detect
commontypesof ωBugs.Bycombining LifecycleEventInjector and
LifecycleMisalignmentOracle, ωDroidcandetect ωBugseffectively.
Answer to RQ5: ωDroid significantly outperformed the
baseline methods, which confirms that our proposed oracles
areusefulinidentifyinganomalousappbehaviorsinducedby
commonωBugs. Without effective oracles, injecting lifecycle
events alone has limited effect on exposing ωBugs.

Keywords for ωBug Collection. When collecting code com-
mitsandbugreportsrelatedto ωBugs,weonlyusedgeneralkey-
words “webview” and “javascript” while different projects may use
different keywords to refer to WebView components. For exam-
ple, in WordPress [ 64], WebViews are often called “posts” since
WordPress uses WebViews to display blog posts. However, such
app-specific keywords are hard to collect. Using them as search
keywordscanalsoleadtomanyirrelevantresults.Therefore,we
only used two general keywords, which already helped collect a
considerable number of ωBugs.
Errors in Manual Inspections. Our manual inspection may
be subject to errors. To reduce human mistakes, four co-authors
independentlyperformedmanualinspectionsandcross-checked
each other’s results for consistency.

Handling Multiple WebView Instances. If one screen con-
tainsmultipleWebViewinstances, ωDroidassumesthattheirorder
remains unchanged during the testing process. This may induce
false positives if the order of the WebView instances changes after
ωDroid injects lifecycle events. However, in our experiments, we
did not observe any false positives caused by this limitation.
8 RELATED WORK
8.1 WebView Security
WebViews have posed various threats to an app’s security. At-
tacks on WebViews in Android system were first studied by Luo
etal.[81,82].Sincethen,researchershavefoundmoreandmore
typesofattacksonWebViewsandproposedvariousdefendingtech-
niques.Forexample,topreventuserprivatedatafrombeingleakedthroughJavaScriptInterface,manytechniqueshavebeenproposed
to aid the detection and monitoring of cross-language information
flow. Typical ones are BavelView [ 91], Spartan Jester [ 93], and Hy-
briDroid [ 77]. Existing work [ 68] has also shown that malicious
JavaScript code can invoke native methods and gain access to local
resources such asfiles through JavaScript Interface. Most recently,Liet al.[78]uncoveredCross-App WebView Infection (XAWI), a
new attack that allows a remote adversary to spread malicious
web content across different apps’ WebView instances and acquire
stealthy control of these apps. Our work differs from these exist-ing studies since we do not limit our scope in security issues but
conduct a more comprehensive study on real-world ωBugs.
8.2 Android Lifecycle Errors
Android app developers can easily make mistakes in managing
appcomponentlifecycles.Tohelpimproveappquality,Zaeemel
al. [100] proposed a model-based testing technique QUANTUM to
testuser-interactionfeaturesofAndroidapps.QUANTUMgener-
atestestoraclesbasedonthecommonsenseexpectationsofapp
responsesagainstuserinteractions.QUANTUMrequiresusersto
manuallybuildanactivitytransitionmodelforanappundertest
and it leverages trivial oracles such as screenshot differences for
finding bugs. Our technique ωDroid differs from QUANTUM as
it is fully automated and leverages the comparison of tree-based
UImodelsforbugdetection.Adamsenetal.[ 65]proposedThor,
which injects neutral event sequences (including lifecycle event
sequences) into existing test cases based on the intuition that neu-
tral event sequences should not affect the outcome of a test case.
However,Thorreliesonmanually-writtenassertionstoidentify
bugs. This is different from ωDroid, which is equipped with au-
tomatedoracles.Shanetal.[ 94]proposedKREfindertostatically
detect data lost when lifecycle events are triggered. This approach
may not be applicable to WebView because the “data” of WebView
usually reside in the loaded webpages but their approach does not
support across-language data flow analysis.
9 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Inthispaper,weconductedanempiricalstudyon124 ωBugscol-
lectedfrompopularopen-sourceAndroidapps.Ourstudyidentified
the common root causes and consequences of ωBugs, and inves-
tigated different factors that are needed to manifest ωBugs. Our
empirical study provides important insights that canguide future
research on ωBug testing and diagnosis. Based on our empirical
findings, we proposed an automated testing technique ωDroid to
detect common types of ωBugs in Android apps. The evaluation of
ωDroidon146subjectsshowedthat ωDroidcaneffectivelydetect
previously-unknown ωBugs in real-world Android apps that are of
developers’ concern. In future, we plan to collect more ωBugs to
perform a larger-scale empirical study. We also plan to study how
to effectively generate user/system events and appropriate webcontent to thoroughly exercise WebView instances and leverage
differential testing to expose more ωBugs.
