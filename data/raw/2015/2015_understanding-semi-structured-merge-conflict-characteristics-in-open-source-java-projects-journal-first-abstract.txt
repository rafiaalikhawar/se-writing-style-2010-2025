ABSTRACT
In a collaborative development environment, tasks are commonly
assigned to developers working independent from each other. As a
result,whentryingtointegratethesecontributions,onemighthave
todealwithconflictingchanges.Suchconflictsmightbedetected
whenmergingcontributions(merge conflicts),whenbuildingthe
system (build conflicts), or when running tests (semantic conflicts).
Regardingsuchconflicts,previousstudiesshowthattheyoccurfre-
quently,and impairdevelopers’ productivity, asunderstanding and
solvingthem isademandingand tedioustaskthat mightintroduce
defects.
However, despite the existing evidence in the literature, the
structure of changes that lead to conflicts has not been studied
yet.Understandingtheunderlyingstructureofconflicts,andtheinvolved syntactic language elements, might shed light on howto better avoid them. For example, awareness tools that informusers about ongoing parallel changes such as Syde and Palantírcan benefit from knowing the most common conflict patterns tobecome more efficient. With that aim, in this paper we focus on
understanding the underlying structure of mergeconflicts.
