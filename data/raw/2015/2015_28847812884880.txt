ABSTRACT  
Many software engineering problems are multi -objective in 
nature, which has been largely recognized by the Search -based 
Software Engineering (SBSE) community. In this regard, Pareto -
based search algorithms, e.g., Non -dominated Sorting Genetic 
Algorithm II,  have already shown good performance for solving 
multi -objective optimization problems. These algorithms produce 
Pareto fronts, where each Pareto front c onsists of a set of non -
dominated  solutions. Eventually, a user selects one or more of the 
solutions fr om a Pareto front for their specific problems . A key 
challenge of applying Pareto -based search algorithms is to select 
appropriate quality indicators , e.g., hypervolume , to assess the 
quality of Pareto fronts. Based on the results of an extended 
literature  review, we found that the current literature and practice 
in SBSE lacks a practical guide for selecting quality indicators despite a large number of published SBSE works. In this direction, 
the paper presents a practical guide for the SBSE community  to 
select quality indicators for assess ing Pareto -based search 
algorithms  in different software engineering  contexts . The 
practical guide is derived from the following complementary theoretical and empirical methods: 1) key theoretical foundations 
of quality indicators; 2) evidence from an extended literature 
review; and 3) evidence collected from an extensive experiment 
that was conducted to evaluate eight quality indicators from four different categories with six Pareto -based search algorithms using 
three re al industrial problems from two diverse domains .

1 INTRODUCTION 
Many software engineering problems are  multi -objective in 
nature and  can be formulated as multi -objective optimization 
problems (MOPs) [1, 2, 4, 5, 8 ]. A substantial number of works in 
Search -Based Software Engineering ( SBSE ) has shown  the 
capability to solve  MOPs using Pareto -based search algorithms that are based on Pareto optimality theory  [4, 6, 7, 40 -60]. A 
Pareto -based search algorithm produces a Pareto front consisting 
of a set of non -dominated solutions (i.e., solutions with equivalent 
quality) from which users can select one or more solutions for their specific needs. It is therefore important to assess the quality of Pareto fronts produced by these algorithms to determine the 
applicability of SBSE for solving MOPs [ 2, 7, 28 ].  
To evaluate the quality of Pareto fronts, the existing works in 
SBSE have applied several quality indicators, e.g., hypervolume 
(HV), Epsilon ( 𝜖), Generalized Spread (GS), Generational 
Distance (GD) , and Pareto Front Size (PFS) . These quality 
indicators are further classified into different categories, e.g., 𝜖 
and GD are defined to measure  the Convergence  between 
solutions produced by search algorithms and optimal solutions , 
and GS is defined to measure  the Diversity  of solutions in a Pareto 
front  [7, 9, 26, 6 5]. However, based on the improved  literature 
review that we conducted  by extending the one reported in [13], 
we discovered that the current literature of SBSE lacks a practical 
guide to select quality indicators for different software 
engineering applications . More specifically , the current literature 
lacks the evidence for selecting quality indicators for the 
following three cases. First, there is no evidence to show whether 
it matters to select a particular quality indicator within the same 
category (e.g.,  Convergence ). For example, if the Pareto front 
produced by Non -dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II 
(NSGA -II) has a better value of GD ( Convergence ) than the one 
produced by Improved Strength P areto Evolutionary Algorithm 
(SPEA2), there is no evidence that we can observe the same 
phenomenon for 𝜖 (Convergence ). Second, there is no evidence 
whether it matters to select a particular quality indicator from different categories. For example, using GD from Convergence  
and GS from Diversity , there is no evidence to show that the same 
trend of performance can be observed for NSGA -II and SPEA2. 
Finally, there is no evidence whether computation time can be used as a criterion for selecting quality indica tors. It is important 
to note that the existing works usually chose a subset of the existing quality indicators without proper justification and in most 
cases, HV was selected because of its popularity [ 48, 49, 51 -56]. 
In this paper, we propose a practical  guide to select quality 
indicators for assessing Pareto -based search algorithms in SBSE 
using the following  theoretical  and empirical  methods : 1) 
Theoretical foundations of quality indicators, 2) The extended 
literature review, and 3) An extensive experim ent. An overview of 
the approach that we used to derive the guide is shown in Figure 1. 
As shown in Figure 1, first, we  studied the theoretical  
foundations of the quality indicators and conducted an extended 
literature review based on [13] from the existing literature ( Step 1). 
In the second step ( Step 2 in Figure 1), we conducted  an extensive 
experiment  with eight quality indicators that have been applied in Permissi on to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for

the existing works [ 7, 12, 40 -60]. These quality indicators are  
classified into four different categories, i.e., Convergence : GD, 
Euclidean Distance (ED), 𝜖; Diversity : PFS and GS; Combination 
of convergence and diversity  (Combination ): Inverted  
Generational Distance (IGD), HV and Coverage : Coverage (C) 
[9]. We evaluate these  quality indicators together with six 
commonly- used Pareto -based search algorithms ( e.g., NSGA -II) 
by employing three industrial software engineering MOPs based 
on our long -term collaboration  from communication and subsea 
oil&gas domains. From the communication domain, we selected 
two problems on testing Video Conferencing Systems (VCSs)  [10] 
including: test suite minimization problem (TM ) with four 
objectives and test case prioritization problem ( TP) with four 
objectives. From the subsea oil&gas domain , we selected one 
requiremen ts allocation problem ( RA) with three objectives [11].

2 THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS 
This section presents  theoretical foundations for  Pareto 
optimality theory (Section  2.1), six Pareto -based search 
algorithms  (Section 2.2) and  eight quality indicators (Section 2.3).  
2.1 Pareto Optimality Theory 
Multi -objective optimization is usually based on the Pareto 
optimality theory [9, 12, 13, 24, 26 ], which aims to balance 
several trade -off objectives and produces a number of solutions 
with equal quality. Pareto optimality defines  dominance  to 
compare solutions, i.e., a solution A is said to dominate another 
solution B, if for all objectives, A is no  worse than B at the same 
time at least one objective exists that A  is better than B .  
Formally speaking, suppose there are 𝑚 objectives 𝑂=
{𝑜!,𝑜!,… ,𝑜!} to be optimized (let’s say minimization), which  
can be defined as a set of object ive functions 𝐹={𝑓!,𝑓!,… ,𝑓!}. 
Solution A dominates solution B (i.e., 𝐴≻𝐵) if and only if 
∀𝑖∈1,2,… ,𝑚 ,𝑓!𝐴≤𝑓!𝐵   𝑎𝑛𝑑   ∃𝑗∈1,2,… ,𝑚 ,𝑓!𝐴<
𝑓!𝐵. The set of solutions that cannot be dominated by others are 
considered as equally viable, which is named as Pareto front. An 
optimal Pareto front  (also called true Pareto front ) includes all 
non-dominated solutions that exist in a given search space for a 
problem, while a Pareto front obtained by a particular search 
algorithm is usually named as a computed Pareto Front  [9, 26 ].  
Thus, multi -objective search algorithms based on the Pareto 
optima lity theory  aim at exploring a g iven search space and 
outputs a  Pareto front with the aim to provide users with a number 
of alternative solutions, from which, users can choos e the most 
appropriate  solution based on their specific requirements.  2.2 Six Pareto-based Search Algorithms 
Search algorithms aim at mimicking natural phenomenon (e.g., 
bird flocking) to search optimal solutions for optimization problems [17]. To apply search algorithms, fitness functions  
should be defined to assess the quality of obtained solutions. This 
paper selects six Pareto -based search algori thms , which are  
classified into three categories (Table 1) [17]. Notice that our goal 
is to cover a representative set of existing search algorithms rather than limiting to commonly used ones (e.g., NSGA -II and SPEA2). 
To achieve this, the six algorithms  were chosen  systematically for 
covering at least one algorithm per category  [17].

NSGA- II sorts t he population into several non -dominated fronts 
using a ranking algorithm  followed by selecting  individuals from 
these non -dominated fron ts and generates new population  by 
applying selection, crossover and mutation operators  [4, 5, 18 ]. 
Moreover, NSGA -II defines a  metric  called crowd ing distance  to 
measure the distance between an individual solution  and the 
others. If two individual solutions are in the same non -dominated 
front, the solution with a higher value of the crowd ing distance is 
selected. The aim for crowd ing distance indicator is to maximize 
the diversity of the outputted non -dominated solutions.  
Multi -objective Cellular (MOCell) is based on the cellular 
model of GAs (cGAs)  with an assumption that an individual only 
interacts with its neighbours  during the search process  [19]. 
Moreover, MOCell stores a set of obtained non -dominated 
individual solutions in an external archive. After each generation, 
MOCell replaces a fixed number of solutions randomly chosen from the population by selecting the same nu mber of solutions 
from the archive until the termination conditions are met. Such replacement only takes place when newly generated solutions 
from the population are worse than the ones in the archive.  
Improved Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2) 
calculates t he fitness value for each solution by summing up a 
strength raw fitness based on the objective functions and density 
estimation [20]. The density estimation measures the distance 
between a solution and its nearest neighbours  for maximizing the 
diversity. SPEA2  stores a fixed number of best solutions into an 
archive by applying selection, crossover an d mutation operators. 
Then, a new population is created by combining solutions from the archive and the non -dominated solutions of the original 
population. If the combined non -dominated solutions are greater 
than the maximum size of the population, the sol ution with the 
minimum distance to any other solution is selected by applying a truncation operator to calculate the distances to its neighbourhood . 
Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES)  applies  the 
dynamic mutation operator  for exploring the search space and 
manages to find optimal solutions  [21]. PAES  also stores the 
obtained non -dominated solutions into an archive and newly 
generated solutions can be added into the archive if they are better 
than existing solutions by calculating objective functions.  
The Speed -constrained Multi -objective Particle Swarm 
Optimization (SMPSO) is a biological metaheuristic inspired by 
the social foraging behaviour  of animals such as bird flocking [17, 
22]. SMPSO selects the best solutions by calculating the crowding 
distance and stores the selected individual solutions in an ar chive. 
SMPSO takes advantage of mutation operators to accelerate the

632speed of convergence and adapts the velocity constriction 
mechanism to avoid the explosion of swarms [22]. 
The Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is considered as 
another kind of EA, which generates solutions by a pplying 
recombination, mutation  and selection operators [17]. DE 
calculates the weighted difference between two randomly selected 
parent solutions and integrates obtained weighted different parts into a third parent solution for generating an offspring . CellDE is 
a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm using MOCell as a search engine 
and replacing the typical selection, crossover and mutation 
operators for GAs with the recombination mechanism of DE [23]. 
CellDE takes the advantage of cellular GA and DE with good 
diversity and convergence [23]. 
2.3 Quality Indicators 
To assess the qua lity of Pareto fronts  produced by algorithms , a 
certain number of quality indicators has been proposed and applied by the existing work s, e.g., Generational Distance (GD) 
[29], Inverted  Generation Distance (IGD) [9], Hypervolume (HV) 
[28], Epsilon ( 𝜖) [26], Generalized Spread (GS) [27]. Based on 
the existing literature [ 7, 9, 13, 26 ], we selected the most 
commonly used eight quality indicators and classified them into 
four categories based on their definitions, convergence, diversity , 
combination of convergence and diversity  (combination) , and 
coverage (shown in  Table 2).  
As discussed in Section 2.1, 
the optimal Pareto front and a 
computed Pareto front obtained by an algorithm are referred as 𝑃𝐹! 
and 𝑃𝐹!, respectively. It is worth  mention ing that obtaining 𝑃𝐹! for 
an optimizatio n problem is infeasible in practice due to the limited 
time or resources [ 9, 27 ]. Thus, when applying quality indicators 
to evaluate Pareto -based search algorithms, a reference Pareto 
front ( 𝑃𝐹!"#) is often computed to represent the optimal Pareto 
front ( 𝑃𝐹!). Suppose 𝑛 number of search algorithms produce 𝑛 
computed Pareto fronts: 𝑃𝐹!!, 𝑃𝐹!!,…,   𝑃𝐹!", 𝑃𝐹!"# is then a 
union of all the non- dominated solutions from these 𝑛 computed 
Pareto fronts , which  can be calculated as: 
𝑃𝐹!"!= (∄!!∈ !"!"!
!!!𝑠!∈ 𝑃𝐹!"!
!!! )(𝑠!  ≻𝑠!). Table 2 also 
denotes whether calculating a particular quality indicator requires 
a reference Pareto front  (Require  column) . We detail ea ch quality 
indicator as follows.  
Table 2. Categories of  quality indicators

Convergence . 1) Generational Distance (GD)  is defined to 
measure how far are the solutions that exist in 𝑃𝐹! from the nearest 
solutions in 𝑃𝐹! [29], which can be calculated using the formula: 
𝐺𝐷=!(!!,!"!)! |!"!|
!!!
|!"!|, where | 𝑃𝐹!| is the cardinality of 𝑃𝐹! (i.e., the 
number of solutions included in 𝑃𝐹!) and 𝑑(𝑠!,𝑃𝐹!) refers to the 
minimum Euclidean distance from the solution 𝑠! in  𝑃𝐹! to 𝑃𝐹 !, i.e., 
the Euclidean distance between 𝑠! in  𝑃𝐹! and the nearest solution in 
𝑃𝐹!. A value of 0 for GD indicates that 𝑃𝐹 ! and 𝑃𝐹! are the same, i.e.,  
all the obtained solutions by a search algorithm are optimal.  2) Euclidean Distance from the Ideal Solution (ED)  measures the 
Euclidean distance between the ideal solution and the closest solution 
in 𝑃𝐹 ! [32]. The ideal solution 𝑠!"#$% is created by including all the 
optimal values for each objective (e.g., minimum values for a minimization problem) obtained from all the non -dominated solutions 
in 𝑃𝐹
!. ED can be calculated as 𝐸𝐷=𝑑(𝑠!"#$% ,𝑃𝐹!) (i.e., the shortest 
Euclidean Distance from 𝑠!"#$%  to 𝑃𝐹!) and a value of 0 for ED 
indicates that the computed Pareto front includes the ideal solution.  
Notice that the  main  difference between ED and GD is that ED 
focuses on the shortest Euclidean distance between the computed 
Pareto front and the ideal solution, while GD aims at measuring the 
average Euclidean distance between solutions in the computed Pareto 
front and the optimal Pareto front.  
3) Epsilon ( 𝝐) measure s the shortest  distance  used to transform 
every  solution in 𝑃𝐹 ! to dominate 𝑃𝐹! [33, 34] . Suppose a solution 𝑠 
can be represented as 𝑠=(𝑓!,𝑓!,… ,𝑓!) where 𝑚 is the number of 
objectives and 𝑓! is the function value for the objective 𝑖. Thus, 𝜖 can 
be calculated  as:𝜖𝑃𝐹!=𝑖𝑛𝑓!∈ℝ∀(𝑠!∈𝑃𝐹!   ∃𝑠∈𝑃𝐹!:𝑠≺!𝑠!} 
where 𝑖𝑛𝑓!∈ℝ refers to the infimum for 𝜖 and 𝑠≺!𝑠! means the 
solution 𝑠! in 𝑃𝐹 ! dominates the solution 𝑠 in 𝑃𝐹 ! with a distance of  𝜖, 
i.e., 𝑠≺!𝑠! if and only if ∀1≤𝑖≤𝑚 :𝑓!!≺𝜖+𝑓!!!. Notice that a 
lower value of 𝜖 denotes that the computed Pareto front is closer to 
the optimal Pareto front.  
Diversity . 4) Generated Spread (GS)  is defined to extend the 
quality indicator Spread (which only works for two -objective 
problems) and measure  the extent of spread for the solutions in 𝑃𝐹! [9, 
35, 36]. GS can be computed using the formula: 
𝐺𝑆=!!!,!"!! |!!,!"!!!| !∈!"!!
!!!
!!!,!"!!
!!!!!"!∗!, where ( 𝑒!,𝑒!,… ,𝑒!) refers to 𝑚 
extreme solutions for each objective in 𝑃𝐹! (𝑚 is the number of 
objectives). An extreme solution for a particular objective means a 
solution from 𝑃𝐹 ! that achieves the optimal  value for the objective on 
the basis of sacrificing other objectives. 𝑑𝑒!,𝑃𝐹! refers to  the 
shortest Euclidean distance between the extreme solution 𝑒! and 𝑃𝐹!. 
𝑑𝑠,𝑃𝐹! means  the shortest Euclidean distance between the 
solution   𝑠 in 𝑃𝐹 ! and the other solutions in 𝑃𝐹!, while 𝑑  is the mean 
value of 𝑑𝑠,𝑃𝐹! for all the solutions in 𝑃𝐹!.  A lower value of GS 
shows that the solutions have a better distribution in 𝑃𝐹!. 
5) Pareto front size (PFS)  measures the number of solutions that 
are included in 𝑃𝐹!, i.e., | 𝑃𝐹!| [7]. It is used to reflect diversity on the 
basis that users can have more options to choose and thus a higher 
value of PFS shows a more diverse computed Pareto front.  
Combination. 6) Inverted  Generational Distance (IGD)  measures 
the shortest Euclidean distance from each solution in 𝑃𝐹! to the 
closest solution in 𝑃𝐹![29]. IGD can be calculated as: 𝐼𝐺𝐷=
!(!!,!"!)! |!"!|
!!!
|!"!|, where | 𝑃𝐹!| refers to the number of solutions in the 
optimal Pareto front and 𝑑(𝑠!,𝑃𝐹!) refers to the minimum Euclidean 
distance from the solution 𝑠! in 𝑃𝐹! to the computed Pareto front. 
Notice a lower value of IGD means the computed Pareto front is 
closer to the optimal Pareto front.  
7) Hypervolume (HV)  is defined to measure the volume in the 
objective space that is covered by 𝑃𝐹! [9]. HV can be calculated 
by 𝐻𝑉=𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒   ( 𝑣!𝑃𝐹𝑐
!!!) and for each solution 𝑠!∈𝑃𝐹!, 𝑣! 
means the diagonal corners of the hypercube between the solution 
𝑠! and a reference point that is a vector of worst objective function 
values. The reference point is created by including all the worst 
values for each objective, which can be obta ined from all the non -
dominated solutions in 𝑃𝐹!(e.g., maximum value for a 
minimization problem). Notice that a higher value of HV demonstrates a better performance of the computed Pareto front.
 
Coverage . 8) Coverage (C)  measures the dominance between 𝑃𝐹! 
and 𝑃𝐹! [37, 38], i.e., the number of solutions in 𝑃𝐹! that are covered 
by 𝑃𝐹!. It can be calculated using 𝐶 =| !∈!"! !∈!"!|
|!"!|. Notice that C 
633ranges from 0 to 1 and a higher value of C is preferable, as it signifies 
that the com puted Pareto front consists of more optimal solutions.  
3 EXTENDED LITERATURE REVIEW 
Search algorithms are increasingly becoming an efficient means 
for solving complex optimization problems in all phases of 
software development life cycle. This area of resear ch is termed 
as Search- Based Software Engineering (SBSE) [ 1, 3, 5, 44]. In the 
last two decades, research in SBSE has been significantly 
increased, e.g., the SBSE repository hosted by the CREST centre 
[14] contains 1389 published papers as of August 18th, 2015.  
Initially, SBSE was mainly focused on solving single -objective 
optimization problems (SOPs) using search algorithms, e.g., 
Genetic Algorithms. However, many  SE problems are multi -
objective by nature [2, 4, 7, 8, 13 ] and thus it is becoming critical 
for SBSE to deal with multi -objective optimization problems  
(MOPs), e.g., selecting a subset of test cases from a large number 
of test cases without significantly decreasing fault detection 
capability and at the same time achieving high coverage (three -
objective test case selection problem) [4]. One approach in SBSE 
try to  solve MOPs  by converting them into SOPs by assigning 
weights to each objective [16]. Such an approach has two key 
problems: 1) it is not possible to select precise and accurate 
weights for each objective; 2) several solutions with equivalent 
quality may be lost due to the conversion. To overcome these problems, Pareto -based search algorithms (e.g., NSGA -II) are 
increasingly being used to solve MOPs. These algorithms p roduce 
Pareto fronts, where each Pareto front contains a set of non -
dominated solutions and eventually a user can select one or more 
solutions [ 2, 4, 7, 13 ] for their problems based on their specific 
requirements. To evaluate the performance of various Par eto-
based search algorithms, a number of quality indicators have been 
proposed, e.g., Hypervolume (HV) for assessing the quality of Pareto fronts produced by search algorithms [26]. 
A literature review  has been conducted in [13] to review the 
existing works on applying Pareto -based search algorithms for 
solving SE problems coined as Pareto -optimal SBSE (POSBSE)  
from the following perspectives: 1) algorithms used; 2) number of 
objectives to optimize; 3) framework to implement algorithms, and 4) quality indicators for evaluating Pareto fronts. The results 
show that only 51 out of 1101 papers (as of April 2013) have 
focused on MOPs suggesting that it is still a new area of research 
in SBSE. In addition, we also observed that only 15 out of these 51 papers have applied standard quality indicators (e.g., HV) to assess the quality of Pareto fronts, which is commonly used in the optimization community [9, 26, 39, 65]. Even for these 15 papers, 
there is  no clear justification for selecting quality indicators. For 
most of these works, HV was selected as a quality indicator 
because it was commonly used and it combines convergence and diversity as discussed in Section 2.3  [13].   
Since this work focuses on providing a practical guide  on how 
to choose quality indicators, we have followed the same template 
and extended the review  work in [13] by selecting and reviewing 
the papers from the SBSE repository related with  POSBSE  from 
April 2013 to August 2015. The goal for this extended literature 
review  is to study which quality indicators have been used and 
how the quality indicators were chosen in the recent SBSE works. 
In addition, we also report the number of objectives for optimization, which can be used for proposing the practical guide . 
Notice that we do  not report the applied multi -objective 
algorithms and the tool for algorithm implementat ion (as reported 
in [13]) since they are out of scope of this paper.  
From our extended literature review , we observe papers on 
POSBSE  have  increased from 51 to 73 until August 2015 and Table 3 lists all these incremental works (in total 22). We can see 
that the works applying the standard quality indica tors has 
increased from 15  reported in [13] ( by April 2013) to 28 (August 
2015). However, similarly as discussed  in [13], our extended 
literature review  also shows that there is still no clear justification 
or explanation on the selection criteria for choosing quality 
indicators in various SE applications. For instance, all the works applying HV [ 40, 43, 48, 49, 51 -53] simply  justified  that HV was 
selected either because of its definition based on convergence and diversity or just because of its popularity . Furthermore , since 
quality indicators can be classified  into different categories 
(Section 2.3), there is no evidence to show whether applying a 
subset of quality indicators (e.g., ED and HV were used in [43] 
while HV and GD were applied in [48]) is sufficient to evaluate 
Pareto fronts produced by search algorithms. There are  also no 
practical  guide s in t he existing SBSE literature for choosing 
quality indicators in different SE applications.   
Based on the extended literature review, this paper is the first 
work in the SBSE community that aims at providing a practical guide for selecting quality indicators  when assessing Pareto -based 
search algorithms.  Notice  that the eight quality indicators chosen 
in this paper cover all the quality indicators  that have been  applied 
in the recent SBSE works ( Table 3).

4 EXPERIMENT 
This section presents the extensive experiment we co nducted for 
empirically evaluating  the eight quality indicators  together with 
the six Pareto -based search algorithms, which  includ es: 1) 
description  of the industrial problems  (Section  4.1); 2) experiment 
design (Section 4.2 ); 3) experiment results  (Section 4.3); 4) 
discussion  based on the results (Section  4.4); and 5) discussion 
related with threats to validity  (Section 4.5 ). 
4.1 Description of the Industrial Problems  
This section presents three industrial problems from two 
distinct domains: communication (Section 4.1.1 ) and subsea 
oil&gas (Section 4.1.2 ), as shown in  Table 4.  
4.1.1 Communication Case Studies  
Since 2007, we have established a close collaboration with 
Cisco, Norway,  focusing on improving the cost and effectiveness 
of testing a variety of Videoconferencing Systems (VCSs) 
developed by Cisco  [10]. The core functionality of a VCS is to 
establish a videoconference among participants at various 
physical locations. There is also a possibility of transmitting 
634presentations in parallel to a videoconference using VCSs. 
Generally speaking, VCSs aim at offering efficient means to 
organize high -quality, face -to-face meetings, without requiring 
physically gathering of participants from dif ferent geographic 
locations. Each VCS has on average three million lines of 
embedded C code. Notice that for testing Saturn (a product line of 
VCSs focused in this paper) , a test case repository has been 
constructed by Cisco’s test engineers with more than  2000 test 
cases. New test cases are continuously added to  this repository.

For testing a new VCS, we learned  that two industrial problems 
are required to be addressed, i.e., 1) Cost-effective Test Suite 
Minimization : eliminating redundant test cases without 
significantly reducing the effectiveness (e.g., feature pairwise 
coverage) at the same time minimizing the  cost (execution time)  
[6, 16] ; 2) Cost-effective Test Case Prioritization : prioritizing test 
cases into an optimal order within a limited test resource b udget 
with the aim to maximize  the effectiveness (e.g., fault detection 
capability) and minimize  the c ost (e.g., execution time)  [15]. 
Considering the number of test cases is large (i.e., search space is 
huge) for both industrial problems, each of the two problems  can 
be formulated as a multi -objective optimization problem and 
applying search algorithms shows promising results as we previously studied [6, 15, 16 ]. 
4.1.1.1  Test Suite Minimization Problem  
Test suite minimization aims  at eliminating  redundant test cases, 
while maximizing the effectiveness and minimizing the cost. To deal with this problem , four cost/effectiveness objectives ( Table 4) 
were defined together with test engineers at Cisco.  
a) Test M inimization Percentage ( TMP)  measures the number 
of test cases that can be minimized as compared with the original 
test suite; TMP can be measured as 𝑇𝑀𝑃=
1−!"!"#"!"$%&
!"!"#$#%&'∗
100% ), where 𝑛𝑡 !"#"!"$%&  is the number of minimized test cases 
and 𝑛𝑡!"#$#%&'  is the number of original test cases;  
b) Feature Pairwise Coverage ( FPC)  measures how many 
pairs of features (testing functionalities) can be covered by the 
minimized test cases; FPC  is measured as 𝐹𝑃𝐶 =!"!"#!"#"!"$%&
!"#$% !!, 
where 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝐹𝑃 !"#"!"$%&  refers to the number of feature pairs 
covered by the minimized test cases, while 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝐹𝑃 !! is the 
number of feature pairs that should be covered by VCS product 
𝑝!;  
c) Fault Detection Capability ( FDC)  measures how many test 
cases can manage to find faults within a specified time period 
(e.g., one week in the past); FDC  can be measured as 𝐹𝐷𝐶=
!"#$ !"!!"!"#"!"$%&
!!!
!"!"#"!"$%&, where 𝑆𝑢𝑐𝑅 !"!refers to the success rate that a 
test case 𝑡𝑐 !  can manage to  detect  faults in a given time;  
d) Overall Execution Time ( OET ) measures how long it take s 
for executing the minimized test cases. OET  can be measured as 
𝑂𝐸𝑇=    𝐴𝐸𝑇 !"!!"!"#"!"$%&
!!!, where 𝐴𝐸𝑇 !"!refers to the average 
historical execution time for test case 𝑡𝑐!.  More details about the object ive functions can be found in [6]. 
4.1.1.2  Test Case Prioritization Problem  
Test case prioritization aims to cost -effectively prioritize a set 
of test cases within a limited budget of available test resources [15]. In our case, test resources refer to correct software versions 
deployed on hardware since te st cases aim  at testing different 
software versions. Notice that it may take different time to 
allocate particular test resources for a specific test case. Similarly, 
to address such  a test prioritization problem, we defined four cost -
effectiveness measures as below (shown in Table 4). 
 a) Prioritized Extent ( PE) measures the number of test cases 
that can be prioritized within the test resource budget; PE can be 
measure d as𝑃𝐸=!"!"#$"#%#&'(
!", where 𝑛𝑡!"#$"#%#&'(  refers to the 
number of prioritized test cases within available test resources while 𝑛𝑡 is the total number of test cases to be prioritized;   
b) Feature Pairwise Coverage ( FPC)  measures how many 
pairs of features can be covered by the prioritized test c ases; FPC  
can be measured as 𝐹𝑃𝐶
!!  =!"!"# !"#$"#%#&'(
!"#$%   , where 
𝑁𝑢𝑚𝐹𝑃 !"#$"#%#&'(  is the number of feature pairs covered by the 
prioritized test cases and 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝐹𝑃  refers to the total number of 
feature pairs that should be tested;  
c) Fault Detection Capability ( FDC)  measures the fault 
detection capability of the prioritized test cases. It is measured as 
𝐹𝐷𝐶=!"#$ !"!!"!"#$"#%#&'(
!!!
!"!"#$"#%#&'(, where 𝑆𝑢𝑐𝑅 !"!refers to the success rate 
that a test case 𝑡𝑐 !  can manage to find faults in a given time ;  
d) Overall Execution Cost ( OEC ) measures how long it take s 
to setup the required test resources and execute the prioritized test 
cases. It can be calculated as 𝑂𝐸𝐶=    (𝐴𝐸𝑇 !"!+!"!"#$"#%#&'(
!!!
𝑇𝑇𝑅 !"!), where 𝐴𝐸𝑇 !"! refers to the average historical execution 
time for test case 𝑡𝑐 ! and 𝑇𝑇𝑅 !"! is the total time for allocating 
relevant test resources for 𝑡𝑐!. More d etails can be found in [15]. 
4.1.2 Subsea Oil&Gas Case Study  
Subsea production  systems (SPSs) are large -scale, 
heterogeneous and highly- hierarchical  Cyber -Physical Systems 
(CPSs) that control and monitor physical processes such as oil and 
gas production platforms [30, 31] . SPSs manag e the exploitation 
of oil and gas production ﬁelds  by integrating hundreds of 
hardware  components and software.  
At the early phase of developing such a large scale CPS, a large 
number of requirements are required to be inspected by  different 
stakeholders from different organizations or departments of the 
same organization. These requirements have different 
characteristics such as various extents of importance to an 
organization, complexity, and dependencies between each other, 
thereby requiring different effort (workload) to inspect [25]. 
Therefore , one practical  challenge has been identified, i.e., 
requirements allocation  that aims to maximize stakeholders’ 
familiarities to the assigned requirements and at the same time balance the overall workload of each stakeholder. The problem 
has been formulated as a multi -objective optimization problem  in 
our previous work s [11, 25]. 
4.1.2.1  Requirement s Allocation Problem  
To address this problem, three cost -effectiveness measures  have 
been defined in [25]. 
a) ASSIGN  represents the extent of assigning all the 
requirements to stakeholders. It can be measured as ASSIGN 
=!!"!!!"
!!!
!!, where  𝑛!" ! returns the number of requirements 
assigned to the 𝑖!! stakeholder, 𝑛! is the total number of 
635requirements and 𝑛!" is the total number of stakeholders;  
b) FAM  denotes the overall familiarity of the stakeholders to 
requirements allocated to them. It can be measured as FAM = 
!"!"!!"!"#
(!"!"#!!"!"#)!!"!
!!!!!"
!!!
!!"!!!"
!!!, where 𝐹𝑀 !" represents the familiarity 
value of stakeholder 𝑆! for requirement 𝑅! and all familiarity 
values range from 𝐹𝑀!"# to 𝐹𝑀 !"#;  
c) OWL  represents the overall differences of workloads of the 
stakeholders and it can be measured as OWL =  
  !"#!" !!!"!!!"
!!!!!!!"!!
!!!
!!"∗(!!"!!) , where 𝑊𝐿 ! computes the workload for 
all the requirements assigned to 𝑖!! stakeholder based on their 
complexity, dependency index, and importance: 𝑊𝐿 ! = 
((!"!!!"!"#
(!"!"#!!"!"#)!!"!!!"!"#
(!"!"#!!"!"#)!!"!!!"!"#
(!"!"#!!"!"#))!!"!
!!!/!)
!!"!, in which, 𝐶𝑀 !, 
𝐷𝑃! and 𝐼𝑀! represent  the complexity, dependency and 
importance of the requirement 𝑗!! respectively.    
4.2 Experiment Design 
In this section, we present the exp eriment design from these 
aspect s: 1) Research questions (Section 4.2.1 ); 2) Case studies  of 
the three industrial problem s (Section  4.2.2 ); 3) Experiment t asks 
performed and statistical tests (Section  4.2.3 ); 4) Evaluation 
metric  and algorithm  parameter settings (Section 4.2.4 ). 
4.2.1 Research Questions  
Our goal is to provide a practical guide for  the SBSE 
community to select quality indicators for SE applications. T o 
meet our objective, we define  the following research questions:  
RQ1: Does it matter to select a particular quality indicator 
within each category?  
Answering this research question help s us to define a guide for 
selecting quality indicators within  the same category for assessing 
Pareto -based search algorithms in different SE contexts.  
RQ2: Does it matter to select quality indicators from 
different categories?  
Answering this researc h question help s to define  a guide for 
selecting quality indicators from different categories for assessing 
Pareto -based search algorithms in different SE context s.  
RQ3: Does it matter to take calculation time into account 
when selecting quality indicators ?  
Answering this research question help s us to study whether 
calculation time  can be an additional layer to define a guide for  
selecting  quality indicators.   
4.2.2 Case Studies  
In Section 4.1, we introduced three industrial problems: 1) test 
suite minimization problem (TM), 2) test case prioritization 
problem (TP), and 3) requirement s allocation problem (RA). We detail the case st udies used for each problem as below .  
 TM:  We chose four VCSs from Saturn : C20, C40, C60 and 
C90 (Table 5). There are 169 features (testing functionalities) in 
Saturn and each VCS includes a subset of these features. 
Moreover, C20, C40, C60 and C90 include 17, 25, 32 and 43 
features respectively and 138, 167, 192 and 230 test cases relevant 
for testing these VCSs, respectively [6]. Notice that each feature 
can be tested by at least one test case and each test case can be 
used to test at least one feature. Each test case 𝑡𝑐!  has a success 
rate for execution ( 𝑆𝑢𝑐𝑅 !"!) for calculating FDC , an average 
execution time ( 𝐴𝐸𝑇 !"!) for measuring OET . In general, for 
Saturn , each feature is associated with 5-10 test cases and each 
test case 𝑡𝑐 !  is associated with 1 -5 features with 𝑆𝑢𝑐𝑅 !"! ranging 
from 50% to 100%, and 𝐴𝐸𝑇 !"!ranging from 2 to 60 minutes.  
TP: We chose a testing cycle that includes 257 test cases for 
testing 53 functionalities (features)  (Table 5). Each feature can be 
tested by at least one test case and one tes t case can be executed 
for testing one or more features. Each test case 𝑡𝑐! has a success 
rate for execution ( 𝑆𝑢𝑐𝑅 !"!) ranging from 50% to 100% , an 
average execution time 𝐴𝐸𝑇 !"! ranging from 2 to 60 minutes, and 
time for allocating relevant test resources ( 𝑇𝑇𝑅 !"!) ranging from 1 
to 30 minutes.  Moreover, there are 59 available test resources 
used to setup the test environment (e.g., correct software) for 
executing such 257 te st cases. Notice that  each test resource can 
be allocated for executing one or more  test cases and execution of  
each test case requires o ne or more test resources.  
RA: We selected a  real-world  case study (i.e., a large -scale CPS) 
including 287 requirements  and identified 10 stakeholders who 
are responsible for reviewing and checking these requirements  
(Table 5). Each requirement 𝑅! has three attribute s that include: 
complexity 𝐶𝑀 ranging from 0 to 9, dependency index 𝐷𝑃 from 0 
to 𝑛!−1 (𝑛! is the number of requirements) and importance 𝐼𝑀 
ranging from 0 to 9. Each stakeholder 𝑆! has one attribute, i.e., 
familiarity for a specific requirement 𝑅! (𝐹𝑀 !") ranging from 0 to 
9 in our case.  
 It is worth mentioning that all the three industrial problems are 
complex based on our previous works [ 6, 11, 15, 16, 25 ] since 
random search (a baseline) has been compared with search 
algorithms and results consistentl y show that search algorithms 
significantly outperform random search.   
4.2.3 Experiment Tasks and Statistical Tests  
Experiment Tasks:   We first perform a task by running the six 
algorithms for the case studies in each industrial problem (as shown in Figure 2). Thus, for each case study in an industrial 
problem, 100 values are obtained for each quality  indicator in 
terms of each search algorithm.

       For  each case study:

                 certain number of  times (100 in our case); 
               For  each time of run:  
                      2: Obtain a reference Pareto front by combining     
                          Pareto fronts produced by the six algorithms;  
                      3: Calculate  the values for the eight quality   
                          indicator  so that each algorithm has eight  
                          values associated with each quality indicator;  
                End;  
              4: Obtain the 100 values for each quality indicator for  
                  each algorithm;  
        End;  
End.    
Figure 2 Pseudo code for obtaining quality i ndicator values  
We defined a corresponding task as shown in Table 5 to answer 
each research question based on the obtained quality indicator 
values. The 𝑇! task is divided into 𝑇!! and 𝑇!", where  𝑇!! 
compares each pair of t he search algorithms using each quality 
indicator within the same category for each case study.  The 𝑇!" 
task answers RQ1 from another perspective, where we study the 
correlations of two quality indicators within category by ignoring the differences of the  search algorithms.  𝑇
! is also divided into 
two tasks. 𝑇 !" compares each pair of the algorithms by analyzing 
the values of quality indicators across categories. 𝑇 !! studies the 
correlations between the quality indicators across categories.  Last, 
in 𝑇!, we compare the quality indicators based on their calculation 
time to answer RQ3 . 
Statistical Tests:  For 𝑇!! and 𝑇!", the Vargha and Delaney 
statistics and Mann -Whitney U test are used by following the 
guides reported in [61] to compare the results of the search 
algorithms based on the quality indicators within or across 
categories ( Table 5). The Vargha and Delaney statistics is used to 
calculate 𝐴!", which is a non -parametric effect size measure. In 
our context, 𝐴!" is used to compare the probability of yielding 
higher values of each quality indicator for two algorithms A and 
B. Each pair of algorithms is further compared using the Mann -
Whitney U test ( p-value) to determine the significance of the 
results with the significance level of 0.05, i.e., there is a 
significant difference if p-value is less than 0.05. For the qual ity 
indicators HV, PFS, C  (higher value, better performance), A 
significantly outperforms B if 𝐴!" is greater than 0.5 and the p-
value is less than 0.05 while A performs  significantly worse than 
B if 𝐴!" is less than 0.5 and the p-value is less than 0.05 . There is 
no significant difference between A and B if the p-value is greater 
than 0.05. For the other quality indicators (i.e., GD, ED, epsilon, IGD and GS),  vice versa .  
To study the correlation between each pair of quality indicators 
(𝑇
!" and 𝑇!!), we choose the Kendall rank correlation coefficient 
(𝜏) as shown in Table 5 [64]. The 𝜏  value ranges from -1 to 1, i.e., 
there is a positive correlation if 𝜏 is equal to 1 and a negative 
correlation when 𝜏 is -1. A 𝜏 close to 0 shows that there is no 
correlation between two sets of data. Moreover, we also report significance of correlation using Prob>| 𝜏 |; a value lower than 
0.05 means that the correlation is statistically significant. Notice that the test does not require the monotonic ity of two data sets, 
which suits our case . In addition, the Mann -Whitney U test is 
applied to determine whether there are significant differences for the time to calculate each quality indicator ( 𝑇
!).  
4.2.4 Metric and Parameter Settings  
Evaluation Metric: To address RQ1 and RQ2, we define a metric 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠  to measure whether two quality indicators can 
demonstrate the same  trend of  performance when evaluating the 
algorithms: 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠   (𝑄𝐼!,𝑄𝐼!)= 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟 !(𝑄𝐼!,𝑄𝐼!)!(!,!)
!!!, 
where 𝑛 is the number of the algorithms and 𝐶(𝑛,2) refers to the 
number of the algorithm pairs. For instance, there are 𝐶6,2=
15 pairs for the selected six Pareto -based search algori thms in our 
case. The 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟 !𝑄𝐼!,𝑄𝐼! function denotes whether it matters 
to choose one of  the quality indicators 𝑄𝐼!and 𝑄𝐼! when 
comparing the 𝑖!! algorithm pair. In other words, 
𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟 !𝑄𝐼!,𝑄𝐼! is 1 if both 𝑄𝐼! and 𝑄𝐼! revea l the sam e trend 
of performance for the 𝑖!! algorithm pair, i.e., it doesn’t matter 
which quality indicator to choose; otherwise, 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟 !𝑄𝐼!,𝑄𝐼! is 
0. For example, suppose that HV and IGD are used to compare NSGA- II and SPEA2. If both H V and IGD consistently indicate  
one of the three cases: 1) NSGA -II performs significantly better 
than SPEA2; 2) NSGA -II performs significantly worse than 
SPEA2; and 3) there is no significant difference between NSGA -
II and SPEA2, 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟
!𝐻𝑉 ,𝐼𝐺𝐷  will be  1. Otherwise, if HV and 
IGD demonstrate different  trend s of performance for NGSA -II 
and SPEA2, 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟 !𝐻𝑉 ,𝐼𝐺𝐷  will be  0. Using 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 , RQ1 
and RQ2 can be answered in a precise and compact manner. In conclusion, we can say that it does n ot matter if we choose 𝑄𝐼
! or 
𝑄𝐼! for assessing the algorithms if 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠   𝑄𝐼!,𝑄𝐼!=1 for all 
pairs of the search algorithms (e.g., 15 pairs for the six search algorithms in our case); otherwise it matters and therefore both 
𝑄𝐼
! and 𝑄𝐼! should be applied together if 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠   𝑄𝐼!,𝑄𝐼!=0 
since there is at least one algorithm pair that the two quality 
indicators show the different trend s of performance.  
Parameter Settings:  We employ jMetal [9] to encode the 
three industrial problems together with the implementation of the 
six selected Pareto -based search algorithms. A ll the parameters 
that are used for configuring these algorithms are shown in  Table 
6, which are suggested as default parameters from the jMetal 
library [9]. In addition, we set the ma ximum number of fitness 
evaluations as 25000, i.e., the search is terminated if the fitness function has been evaluated for 25000 times. Notice that tuning 
parameters may lead to different performance of search 
algorithms, but standard parameter settings a re usually 
recommended [61]. Furthermore, all the eight quality indicators mentioned in Section 2.3 are implemented based on jMetal [9]. A s 
suggested in [61], each algorithm was run 100 times to account 
for random variations.

4.3 Experiment Results 
This section presents the results for each research question1.  
RQ1: RQ1 focuses on empirically evaluating the quality 
indicators within the same category.  Table 7 lists the values of 
----------------------------------------------------------- 
1 For reproducibility, we make all the data related with the experiment publicly 
available  at:  http://zen -tools.com/ICSE2015.html  
637𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠  for the quality indicators within each category  by 
applying the six Pareto -based search algorithms in the four VCS 
product s (case studies) for solving the TM and TP problems and 
one CPS for solving the RA problem . From Table 7, we can 
observe that the three quality indicators within Convergence  (i.e., 
GD, ED and 𝜖) show the same trend of  performance when 
comparing the 15 pairs of the six algorithms in the three industrial 
problems since all the values for 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠  are equal to 1. 
Similarly, the two quality indicators (i.e., IGD and HV) within Combination  also demonstrate the same trend of  performance 
when comparing the 15 pairs of the six algorithms. However, we 
observe that in Diversity , GS and PFS show different trends of  
performance since all the values of 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠  are 0. This 
observation shows that when using GS and PFS  for measuring 
diversity , we may observe different performance of search 
algorithms for the same problem. Notice that we only have one 
quality indicator in Coverage  (Table 5) and thus we cannot 
calculate 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠  within Coverage .

Moreover, we apply the Kendall rank correlation coefficient 
test (𝜏 ) for studying the correlations between quality indicators 
within the same category. Table 8 summaries the key results for 
pairs of quality indicators using the 𝜏 test. From Table 8, one can 
observe that the three quality indicators (ED, GD and 𝜖) of 
Convergence  have significantly positive correlations for all the 
case studies of the three industrial problems since all the values of 
τ are greater than 0 (close to 1) and the  p-values for Prob>| 𝜏| are 
all less than 0.05 (due to the limited space, we do not report the 
individual values for 𝜏 and Prob>| 𝜏|). Therefore, we can conclude 
that for Convergence , all the three quality indicators show the 
same  trend of  performance when comparing different algorithms 
and it therefore does not matter which one to choose.

𝑝<0.05 
 As for Diversity , the results in Table 8 show that there is no 
significant correlation between GS and PFS since the p-values for 
Prob>|   𝜏 | are greater than 0.05 and thus GS and PFS have to be 
selected together when evaluating the diversity of a Pareto front. 
For Combination  (i.e., HV and IGD), Table 8 show s that a 
significantly negative correlation exist s between HV and IGD . 
The correlation is negative since  a higher value of HV shows a 
better Pareto front , which is represented by a lower value of IGD. 
Thus, for this category, it also does not matter which indicator to 
choose when assessing the performance of the search algorithms.  
Based on the above results, RQ1 can be answered as follow s. 
For Convergence  and Combination , it doesn’t matter which 
quality indicato r within the same category to choose; however, it 
does matter for Diversity , i.e., both GS and PFS should be used 
together  when assessing Pareto fronts.   
RQ2: RQ2 aims at empirically evaluating the quality indicators 
across categories. Based on the result s of RQ1 (i.e., GD, ED and 𝜖 
have significant correlations, and IGD and HV also have a significant correlation ), we chose 𝜖 and HV for representing the 
categories of Convergence  and Combination , respectively  since  
the results of GD and ED are consistent with 𝜖 for Convergence  
and the results of IGD are consistent with HV for Combination . 
Therefore , the five quality indicators from the four different 
categories (i.e., 𝜖, HV, PFS, GS and C) are compared in the three 
industrial problems (i.e., TM, TP and R A). Table 9 summarizes 
the key results of 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠  when comparing each pair of the five 
quality indicators in the three industrial problems.  
Table 9. Matte rs of the  quality indicators across categories

Diversity and Combination  GS and HV  
0 0 0 PFS and HV  
Diversity and Coverage GS and C  
PFS and C  
Combination and Coverage  HV and C 
From Table 9, we observe that two quality indicators from 
different categories can result in different  trends of  performance 
of the search algorithms except for 𝜖 and C. In other words, it 
does not matter which quality indicators to choose in terms of 
Convergence  and Coverage , but it does matter for the quality 
indicators from other categories since all values for 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 =0.    
Table 10 summarizes the key findings by studying correlations 
between each pair of quality indicators across categories using the 
Kendall rank correlation coefficient test ( 𝜏). We can see that th ere 
is no significant correlation for all the pairs of the quality indicators except for 𝜖 and C since the p-values for Prob>|   𝜏 | are 
greater than 0.05. As for 𝜖 and C, there is a significantly negative 
correlation since all the values for 𝜏 are less than 0 ( close to -1) 
and the p-values for Prob>|   𝜏 | are all less than 0.05. Such a 
significant correlation is negative since a lower value of 𝜖 denotes 
a better Pareto front , which is represented by a higher value of C .

Based on the above results, RQ2 can be answered as follows. It 
does matter to choose quality indicators across categories except 
for Convergence  and Coverage  when assessing Pareto -based 
search algorithms  in different SE contexts .  
RQ3:  This research questi on is designed to compare time to 
calculate each indicator. Notice that each algorithm is run for 100 times in our case and each run provides a data point for the time. Since six algorithms are selected and three industrial problems are 
involved including 9 case studies ( Table 5), 5400 data points of 
time can be obtained in total for calculating each quality indicator. We report the average value of these 5400 time data  points for 
each quality indicator ( Table 11) and perform the Mann -Whitney 
U test to determine whether there are significant differences in terms of calculation time for each pair of quality indicators.   
Results show that for all the eight quality indicators, PFS takes 
significantly less time than all the others since all the p-values are 
less than 0.05, which are not reported to save space. Within 
Convergence  and Coverage , calculating C takes significantly less 
638time than the others (i.e., GD, ED and 𝜖). Within Combination , 
there is no significant difference for calculating HV and IGD. 
Thus, we can answer RQ3 as follows: there are significant 
differences in terms o f time for calculating quality indicators and 
thus calculation time can be used as additional  criterion in our 
guide for selecting quality indicators. However, the practical 
differences for calculating these quality indicators may not be 
huge since all of them are in a few seconds  (Table 11).

4.4 Discussion on Results 
For RQ1, we observe that within Convergence , all the three 
quality indicators (i.e., GD, ED and 𝜖) show the same trend of  
performance when comparing Pareto -based search algorithms at 
the same time there are significantly positive correlations among 
them. This can be explained from the fact that GD, ED and 𝜖 are 
defined to measure the distance of solu tions in a computed Pareto 
front to the optimal solutions (in the optimal Pareto front) though 
different mathematical formulas are applied (Section 2.3 ). It is 
worth mentioning that calculating ED only requires an ideal set of 
objective values, i.e., the optimal value that each objective can 
achieve (Section 2.3), while GD and 𝜖 require  obtaining a 
reference Pareto front (simulating the optimal Pareto front) [ 39, 
65]. In the context of our case studies, we were not aware of ideal 
objective set beforehand (which is obtained from the reference Pareto front) and the results show that GD, ED and 𝜖 are 
equivalent in terms of Convergence . However, for certain SE 
problems, if the ideal set of objective values is known beforehand 
(e.g., for testing, the maximum value of feature pairwise coverage 
is 1), ED should be a more accurate quality indicator as compared with GD and 𝜖, since these two indicators r equire a reference 
Pareto front  for representing the optimal Pareto front [39, 65 ].  
As for Combination , both HV and IGD are defined to measure: 
1) how obtained solutions are close to optimal solutions, and 2) how obtained solutions are distributed in a computed front. Based 
on the results of  the experiment, HV and IGD indicate the same  
trend of  performance when comparing the algorithms. 
Furthermore, calculating HV requires a reference point (the worst objective set) instead of a reference Pareto front requ ired by IGD 
(Section 2.3). Therefore, HV is considered as a more accurate 
quality indicator when such a reference point is known 
beforehand for certain SE problems, e.g., the minimum number of test cases  to be elimin ated is 0 for test suite minimization. 
However, within Diversity , the two quality indicators (i.e., GS 
and PFS) do not demonstrate the same trend of  performance when 
comparing the search algorithms and the correlation between them 
is not significant. This can be explained based on the fact that PFS is defined based on the assumption that more solutions included into a Pareto front, more options a user can choose from and thus 
it reflects a more diverse Pareto front. However, when all the 
solutions are close to each other in the front, even higher values of PFS cannot necessarily demonstrate a Pareto front with a higher diversity. As compared with PFS, GS is defined to measure how well solutions are distributed in a computed Pareto front (Section 
2.3). Thus, GS and PFS provide two different perspectives of 
measuring diversity, which should be a pplied together. When calculating GS, it requires calculating a reference Pareto front 
(Section 2.3 ) while PFS does not require anything.  
As for RQ2, the results show that the quality indicators of 
Convergence  show the same trend of  performance as the quality 
indicator of Coverage . Such interesting finding can be explained 
that when a computed Pareto front shares more common solutions 
with the optimal Pareto front (i.e., the value of C is higher), the 
computed Pareto front and the optimal solutions should be closer 
(i.e., the values for GD, ED and 𝜖 are lower). Meanwhile, 
significant correlations were observed among these four quality 
indicators, which provide furt her evidence for the observation. As 
for other quality indicators across categories, no such 
phenomenon were found that denotes that quality indicators can 
not replace others that belongs to different categories except for 
the above -mentioned ones (i.e., G D, ED, 𝜖 and C).  
In terms of computation effort (RQ3), the results demonstrate 
that calculating quality indicators can take significantly different 
time, e.g., the calculation time for PFS is significantly less than the others (Section 4.3). Based on the theoretical foundations [39, 
65], we observe that the computation effort for PFS is linear, 
whereas the others except HV are in quadratic. As fo r HV, the 
calculation time will be increased exponentially with the increase in the number of objectives. When the number of objectives is less (e.g., three and four objectives in our cases), the practical 
differences are not very huge when looking into th e average 
calculation time for each indicator , e.g., 0.35 seconds for PFS and 
4.86 seconds for 𝜖 (Table 11). Notice that when the number of 
objectives is greater than  10 (15 as reported in [50]), HV is not 
applicable since it becomes very expensive to calculate. Based on 
these observations, calculation time can be an additional criterion 
for selecting quality indicators.  
4.5 Threats to Validity 
A threat to internal validity  is that we have experimented with 
only one -default configuration setting for algorithm parameters. 
However, these settings are in accordance with the common 
guides in the literature [61, 63 ]. The conclusion validity  threat in 
experiments involving algorithms is due to random variations. To address it, we repeated experiments 100 times to reduce the possibility that the results were obtained by chance. We also 
reported the results using the Vargha and Delaney statistics  (to 
measure the effect size), Mann -Whitney U test (to determine the 
statistical significance)  and the Kendall rank correlation 
coefficient (to measure the correlations among the indicators ). 
The observed construct validity  threat is that the measures used 
are not comparable across the algorithms. In our context, we used the same stopping criteria for all the algorithms, i.e., the number 
of fitness evaluations (i.e., 25000).  As for  external validity  threat 
related with  gene ralization of results , three industrial problems 
were chosen from two different domains (i.e., communication and 
subsea oil&gas), which cover two different phases of software 
lifecycle, i.e., requirements and testing. For  the test suite 
minimization problem and test case prioritization problem, four 
different VCS products with varying complexity were selected for 
the experiment. For the requirement s allocation problem, one 
large -scale CPS was chosen. Notice  that such threat to external 
validity is common to all empirical studies [3, 62 ]. 
5 PRACTICAL GUIDE  
 This section  provide s a practical guide ( Figure 3) for selecting 
quality indicators, when assessing Pareto -based search algorithms. 
As mentioned before, the guide is derived based on : a) the 
theoretical foundations ( TF); b) the extended literature review 
(LR); and c)  the extensive experiment ( EE). In Figure 3, we 
639explicitly show this information inside the brackets when 
recommending a quality indicato r to apply .   
As shown in Figure 3, a category of quality indicators should be 
first selected ( A1): 
1) Select Convergence  or Coverage  if a user only cares whether 
obtained solutions are optimal or not. In particular, for some SE 
problems (e.g., RA in our case), only one optimal solution is 
required regardless of the diversity of solutions. In this case, a 
dedicated quality indicator for  Convergence is recommended. 
Moreover, if an ideal set of objective values (i.e., optimal objective values) is unknown for a specific SE problem (e.g., RA 
in our case), any of GD, ED, 𝜖 and C can be selected ( A3) based 
on EE, i.e., the results showed that all of them indicate the same 
trend of performance when comparing algorithms. Otherwise, if an ideal objective set is known before, ED should be selected (A2 ) 
since it only requires an ideal objective set instead of a whole reference Pareto front based on TF. 
2) Select Combination if a user prefers more diverse solutions 
to choose from in addition to Convergence . For example, a user 
can choose solutions based on the preference of objectives. In this case, the first selection criterion is based on the number of objectives to be optim ized since the computation effort of HV 
increases exponentially with the number of objectives [39, 6 5]. 
From our experiment with three and four objectives (TM, TP and 
RA problems), there is no significant time difference for 
calculating HV and IGD , and from the extended literature review 
(Section 3), we observed that the number of objectives is always 
less than or equal to six for all the existing works that applied  HV. 
Thus, according to LR, we set the threshold of the number of 
objectives as six for the guide, i.e., when the number of objectives 
for a problem are more than six, IGD should be selected ( A4) 
since the computation effort of IGD is only in quadratic bas ed on 
TF. When the number of objectives is less than or equal to six, 
HV should be selected ( A5) if an accurate reference point is 
known, i.e., the worst values for all the objectives. That is because 
calculating HV only requires a reference point rather t han an 
entire reference Pareto front ( TF). Otherwise, if a reference point 
is not known before (e.g., the RA problem in our case), either HV or IGD can be chosen ( A6) based on EE since HV and IGD 
indicates the same trend of performance for comparing algorithms.  
3) Select Convergence  or Coverage  together with Diversity . It is also possible to 
evaluate Convergence 
(Coverage ) and  
Diversity of Pareto 
fronts produced by 
search algorithms 
separately since 
dedicated quality indicators for 
Convergence 
(Coverage ) and 
Diversity may be 
more accurate than a 
combined quality 
indicator  (e.g., HV) 
[39, 6 5]. Notice that 
quality indicators of 
Diversity  cannot be 
applied separately 
since it does not make 
sense in realistic 
situations that users 
only care about the 
diversity of solutions without considering they are optimal or not. In this case, we need to learn whether the ideal objective set is known for a  SE problem. If the ideal objective set is known, ED 
from Convergence  should be applied together with PFS and GS 
(Diversity ) (A7 ) based on TF and EE, i.e., PFS and GS indicate 
different trends of perfor mance when comparing algorithms . 
Otherwise, any quality indicator from Convergence  or Coverage  
can be chosen together with PFS and GS ( A8) based on EE. 
Notice that PFS and GS should be selected together since they reflect the diversity from two different perspectives, i.e., the number o f obtained solutions and distribution of solutions. It is 
worth mentioning that the quality indicators from Convergence 
and Diversity may demonstrate completely different performance 
of algorithms and thus making it impossible to obtain a definite answer w hich algorithm is better. In this case, we recommend 
selecting the quality indicators from Combination (A9) since 
applying HV or IGD can tell us which algorithm is better by 
combining both Convergence  and Diversity . 
6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper  provides a practical guide for the Search -based 
Software Engineering (SBSE ) community to select proper quality 
indicators when assessing Pare to-based search algorithms in 
different software engineering  applications. The guide is derived 
from: 1) theoretical foundations of quality indicators; 2) an 
extended literature review; and 3 ) an extensive experiment  to 
evaluate eight quality indicators along with six Pareto- based 
search algorithms using  three industrial problems . 
In the future, we plan to in volve more quality indicators into the 
guide , which  have not been investigated by the SBSE community, 
e.g., purity [26], dominance ranking [39]. We also plan to employ 
more industrial problems from  other domains with th e aim to 
further improve the proposed practical guide .
