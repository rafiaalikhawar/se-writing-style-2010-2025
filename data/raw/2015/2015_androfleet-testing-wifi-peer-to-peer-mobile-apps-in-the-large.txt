Abstract —WiFi P2P allows mobile apps to connect to each
other via WiFi without an intermediate access point. This
communication mode is widely used by mobile apps to support
interactions with one or more devices simultaneously. However,
testing such P2P apps remains a challenge for app developers asi)existing testing frameworks lack support for WiFi P2P, and ii)
WiFi P2P testing fails to scale when considering a deploymenton more than two devices.
In this paper, we therefore propose an acceptance test-
ing framework, named A
NDROFLEET , to automate testing of
WiFi P2P mobile apps at scale. Beyond the capability of test-ing point-to-point interactions under various conditions, A
N-
DROFLEET supports the deployment and the emulation of a ﬂeet
of mobile devices as part of an alpha testing phase in order toassess the robustness of a WiFi P2P app once deployed in the
ﬁeld. To validate A
NDROFLEET , we demonstrate the detection
of failing black-box acceptance tests for WiFi P2P apps andwe capture the conditions under which such a mobile app can
correctly work in the ﬁeld. The demo video of A
NDROFLEET is
made available from https://youtu.be/gJ5 Ed7XL04.
I. I NTRODUCTION
Mobile apps have brought the capability to deploy context-
aware software systems, that go beyond desktop software, by
adjusting their behavior to end-users’ surrounding environ-ment. In particular, WiFi peer-to-peer (WiFi P2P, also known
as WiFi Direct) enables mobile devices to discover, connect,and transfer data to nearby devices via WiFi; without anintermediate access point as long as they comply with the WiFiAlliance’s WiFi Direct certiﬁcation [34]. This communication
mode is now widely adopted by mobile apps with more than 1
billion of Wi-Fi Direct-enabled devices in 2014, and 3 billionsexpected by 2018
1Some popular examples of WiFi P2P apps
are multiplayer games, messaging, and social apps.
However, testing WiFi P2P apps remains a challenge for
app developers [31] because current testing solutions lack
support for the distributed nature of WiFi P2P interactions.In addition, current device emulators lack of an implemen-
tation for WiFi P2P communication stacks, thus developersare forced to use physical devices to test their WiFi P2Pmobile apps. Testing scenarios typically involve more thantwo mobile devices, thus it is hard to scale to hundreds of
mobile devices. Furthermore, reproducing behaviors becomes

-provide-convenient-high-speed-network-services-direct-to-customersparticularly difﬁcult when evaluating stability, data integrity,
peer failure and fault tolerance [33].
Developers then resort to alternative solutions to assess
the expected behavior of their WiFi P2P mobile apps. Forexample, log-based testing [10] instruments apps and mines
execution logs to detect unexpected behaviors. Given the po-tentially large number of mobile devices involved in WiFi P2Pscenarios, log-based testing becomes unfeasible for developerswho need to manually explore logs and assess a distributedbehavior.
As existing automated testing methods are falling short
on solutions to test WiFi P2P at large, we introduce A
N-
DROFLEET , an acceptance testing framework for WiFi P2P
Android apps. A NDROFLEET contributes the following fea-
tures:
1) A NDROFLEET builds on a standard acceptance testing
framework (i.e., Cucumber2) to provide new primitives
for describing contextual and distributed scenarios;
2) A NDROFLEET implements an emulated WiFi P2P com-
munication stack to control the P2P interactions of
mobile apps through emulated devices;
3) Finally, A NDROFLEET provides a large-scale deploy-
ment platform that can be used to assess the robustness
of a WiFi P2P app prior to its deployment in theﬁeld, along an alpha testing phase. This feature collectsinsightful metrics on the execution and behavior ofWiFi P2P apps.
A
NDROFLEET is open-source and publicly available: https:

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion II describes the A NDROFLEET testing framework. Sec-
tion III details the implementation of the different parts thatcompose the A
NDROFLEET framework. Section IV reports on
a case study that illustrates how A NDROFLEET supports de-
velopers to automate the testing of WiFi P2P apps. Section VIdiscusses the related work in this domain. Finally, Section VII
concludes the paper.

to ensure the correct behavior (e.g. absence of bugs and
unexpected behavior) of WiFi P2P apps before deployment.
The conception of peer-to-peer applications is complex as thecommunication scenarios between peers need to be speciﬁedand tested. To test such scenarios, there is therefore a need fora runtime environment, which is representative of a productiondeployment.
The goal of A
NDROFLEET is to automate WiFi P2P User
Acceptance Testing.A NDROFLEET enables developers to cre-
ate and execute common WiFi P2P test scenarios. In particular,
the framework provides two main features:
1) A DSL (Domain-Speciﬁc Language) to describe
WiFi P2P testing scenarios, such as peer discovery andpeer interactions;
2) A large-scale emulation platform that supports parallel
testing on multiple devices as well as the WiFi P2P
communications among them.
A. Describing Test Scenarios
To describe testing scenarios, A
NDROFLEET provides a
DSL to developers. Previous research have extended Calabashframework
3to add some context-based testing [17], [18]. A N-
DROFLEET adopts a similar approach by extending Calabash to
introduce a WiFi P2P speciﬁc vocabulary. We chose Calabash
because it is multi-platform and delivers a rich and extensiblesyntax, based on Cucumber.
Figure 1 depicts the different A
NDROFLEET testing di-
rectives that can be used to describe typical communication
scenarios among peers in WiFi P2P apps.
In P2P systems different unexpected context events can
happen, such as peer discovery, peer not in range or connection
lost. However, some of these events can lead to failures ofapps. A
NDROFLEET lets developers simulate these contextual
events that can emerge along an execution. Listing 1 describesan example of a test scenario, created with A
NDROFLEET ,t o
simulate P2P unexpected contextual events.

Fig. 1. Example of a communication scenario with WiFi-Direct
Node 0 toNode 1) in a WiFi P2P File Sharing App. First,
the developer has to specify the running conditions of the
scenario using the peer_discovery.feature ﬁle, these
conditions include:
•Number of participant nodes (i.e., emulators)
–Example: Given the list of devices: {A, B, C}
•Discovery conﬁguration
–Example: Given devices {A, B} are in range for 5s
•Apps installed on each node
–Example: MyApp.apk is installed on all devices
Later, for each single node, the developer speciﬁes the
behavior to test. Figure 2 (cf. bottom rectangles) shows two
examples of test scenarios in two nodes for the File Sharingapp.
1) Discovery Extension to Calabash: The apps asking
for the list of nearby peers from the WiFi P2P hard-
ware component will get this list from the P eerDiscovery .
The list of available peers is conﬁgured using thepeer_discovery.feature ﬁle.
2) Opportunistic Peer Discovery: Some of the WiFi Direct
Apps (emergency apps) use WiFi Direct to create a commu-nication infrastructure [5], [6], [8], [11], [12], [14], [15], [21],

Fig. 2. Overview of the A NDROFLEET framework
[26], [28], [29]. To prove the ability to support a communica-
tion infrastructure based on WiFi Direct, developers have tobe able to use multiple GPS datasets that will help the Peer
Discovery to emulate real-life nearby peers. Therefore, the
developers can validate the scalability and the efﬁciency of
the opportunistic communications for these communicationsinfrastructures.
C. Running Test Scenarios
To run the speciﬁed test scenarios, the developer has to
provide: (i)test script scenarios for each single node; (ii)
device proﬁles (e.g., OS version, hardware speciﬁcation) to
test the app; and (iii)Peer_Discovery.features as
explained in Section II-B.
The scenarios are executed in parallel in multiple devices
using Calabash-Android. After the execution of the scenarios,
the developer can gather the test results, and improve theapp accordingly and test all the scenarios again using A
N-
DROFLEET .
III. I MPLEMENTATION DETAILS
The A NDROFLEET testing framework implements an ex-
tension of the Calabash testing framework to create testscenarios and execute them. A
NDROFLEET is released as a
Gradle plugin, which developers can add to run the testsinside Android Studio IDE. The A
NDROFLEET gradle plugin
executes the Calabash tests in parallel (in multiple devices)and collects the test results from all devices.
A
NDROFLEET contains three parts: Device Emulator
Nodes,aPeer Discovery Node, and a Host Machine.W e
describe the implementation of these three parts, respectively.
Device Nodes.A NDROFLEET uses Docker containers to de-
ploy Android emulator nodes. We use the Docker technology
to provide a lightweight and scalable testing environment.The different nodes communicate among them via Weave
network.4
Peer Discovery. The Peer Discovery node is responsible for
emulating WiFi Direct behavior in the Android emulator nodesand notify them about nearby devices. The communications
between Device Emulator Nodes and the Peer Discovery
node is achieved using the Akka framework, which supports
large-scale deployment. In addition, the Peer Discovery node
can use a GPS mobility dataset to compute the distancesbetween devices and inform the devices when they are in
range.
Host Machine. Finally, developers use a Host Machine
to deﬁne and run testing scenarios. The Android emulators
connect to the developer’s machine via ADB (Android DebugBridge).
5
Peer-to-peer mobile apps are complex in nature, since they
are based on a distributed environment. Thus, many aspects ofthe system need to be veriﬁed to ensure the correct behaviorof the system under multiple circumstances (peer fails, peerrefuses connexion, peer disappears, etc.).
A
NDROFLEET implements an emulated version of the An-
droid WiFi P2P API that can be deployed within an emulator(e.g., GenyMotion) and controlled by the testing environment
(e.g., Calabash) to simulate the discovery of a nearby device
and assess the user acceptance testing scenarios.

ASE STUDY
In this section, we present a case study to illustrate how
ANDROFLEET assists developers to automate the testing of
WiFi P2P Android apps. As Application Under Test (AUT)we use Wi Fi Di re c t

TESTING SCENARIOS FOR THE WIFIDIRECT APP
# Scenario Expected behavior Pass?
1 A simple image transferring scenario Image is transferred Yes
2 Transferring the image from the group Owner Image is transferred No
3 Deactivating WiFi P2P before transfer Ask user to switch on WiFi P2P Yes
4 Selecting a ﬁle instead of image Open as dialog appears Yes
5 Sending a second ﬁle in the same connection The ﬁle is sent No
6 Disconnect the second peer before starting the ﬁle transfer Ask user to switch on WiFi P2P No
7 Connecting to peer without launching discover request on it The ﬁle is sent Yes
between Android devices using WiFi Direct connection. The
AUT has more than 10,000installs on the Google Play Store
and its source code is available7.
First of all, the developer needs to set up A NDROFLEET in
the development IDE (i.e., Android Studio). To do this, s/he
uses the provided Gradle P lugin which automatically mocks
the Android WiFi P2P API used in the app.
Table I presents 7 relevant testing scenarios for the AUT.
The developer describes the scenarios using the A NDROFLEET
framework. Figure 3 shows the description of scenario #1,
a simple image transferring from one device to another. In
particular, listing 3a presents the sending scenario in onedevice; while 3b displays the receiving scenario in a different
device.
Next, the developer runs the scenarios in the A
NDROFLEET
emulators. After execution, A NDROFLEET presents the test-
ing results, i.e., passing and failing tests. Figure 4 shows a
screenshot of the testing results of the described case study.
The screen displays the set of tests executed. Green and readcolors mean passing and failing scenarios respectively. In theexample, Scenario 1 passed, while Scenario 2 failed. Each
scenario shows the sequential actions that were executed. Ifan action fails, A
NDROFLEET shows error information and
the reason of the failure. For example, in Scenario 2, theaction 13 (”Then I should see ’Connecting to’ ”) fails. The
reminder actions of the test are printed in blue, meaning that
they were not executed since the test execution failed before.After analyzing the testing results, the developer can ﬁx theapp and re-run the tests until all scenarios successfully pass.
V. D
ISCUSSION
Although the general idea of emulating hardware capabili-
ties (e.g. GPS, sensors) for testing is not new, the novelty of
ANDROFLEET resides in providing an emulated WiFi Direct
environment for testing. Given the increasing popularity ofP2P mobile apps, this feature is crucial because none of currenttesting frameworks support WiFi P2P.
A
NDROFLEET reports the following advantages to the mo-
bile development and testing communities:
1) Extend the capability of an Android testing framework
to enable the control of peer-to-peer interactions among
mobile apps via WiFi Direct.
2) Provide enriched vocabulary for testing mobile apps
using WiFi Direct.
7https://github.com/anuj7sharma/WiFiDIrectDemo3) Automate parallel testing on multiple emulated devices
as well as WiFi Direct communications among them.
4) Reproduce behaviors on failing test scenarios to help
developers to ﬁx the apps.
ANDROFLEET is specially practical for developers who lack
access to a farm of real devices to test. But even when a crowdof real devices is available, current testing frameworks lack
primitives to assess distributed behavior.
VI. R
ELATED WORK
We summarize related work in the main research areas con-
nected to this research: testing mobile apps and testing peer-
to-peer systems.A NDROFLEET aims to ﬁll the gap between
these two areas.
A. Testing Mobile Apps
Mendez-porras et. al. [27] presented a systematic literature
review on existing testing approaches for mobile apps. First,
there is a bunch of approaches [1], [2], [19], [23], [35],[36] providing GUI testing of mobile apps. Similar to theseapproaches, A
NDROFLEET also supports GUI testing. While
the goal of previous approaches is to provide explorationstrategies to maximize test coverage, A
NDROFLEET provides
additional primitives for testing properties speciﬁc to peer-to-
peer systems (e.g. , connections, data interchange).
Another family of approaches have proposed cloud-based
frameworks to test mobile apps [13], [22], [32]. A NDROFLEET
also provides a cloud-based framework. In addition, A N-
DROFLEET provides multiple emulators, which can interact
among them in order to test the behavior of a P2P system
as a whole.
ANDROFLEET provides black-box testing to test WiFi P2P
apps without requiring access to the source code. Previousapproaches [20], [24], [37] propose also automatic black boxtesting of mobile apps.
Similar to A
NDROFLEET , other approaches have extended
the Calabash framework to support the testing of additional
features, such as touch gestures [18] and sensors (i.e., ac-
celerometer, GPS, etc.) [17]. Similarly, A NDROFLEET extends
Calabash with a different purpose: to support testing of peer-
to-peer communications.
Despite the proliﬁc research in this area, current testing
frameworks for mobile apps lack support for peer-to-peerinteractions.

Almeida et al. [7] present a framework and a methodology
for testing P2P applications. The framework is based on
controlling nodes individually, allowing test cases to preciselycontrol the volatility of nodes during their execution. Similarly,
A
NDROFLEET gives developers the ability to control the
volatility of nodes during the execution of test scenarios.
Zhou et al. [38] propose a framework to test peer-to-peer
multi-player games. In [30], the authors propose a model-based testing for large-scale distributed systems and peer-to-peer communications. Charaf et al. [9] propose an agent-
based architecture for distributed system testing. Marroquin
et al. [25] propose a testing approach based on test cases
dependencies for communications protocols. Later, the same
authors extend their approach to test distributed systems withtest cases dependency architecture.
Butnaru et al. [4] propose a tool for measuring peer-to-peer
platform performance using log messages to get feedback fromdifferent peers. Boldman et al. [3] explain in a patent a system
and methods for testing peer-to-peer network application, byorchestrating unit testing between peers. Gorodetsky et al. [16]
propose peer-to-peer emulation environment for testing mobileP2P agent applications.
Although testing P2P systems has been extensively studied
by the research community, the testing of mobile P2P appsremains unexplored.
