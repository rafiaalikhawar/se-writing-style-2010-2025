ABSTRACT
Multi-criteria test-suite minimization aims to remove redundant
test cases from a test suite based on some criteria such as code
coverage,while trying tooptimallymaintainthecapability ofthe
reducedsuite basedon othercriteriasuch asfault-detection effec-
tiveness. Existing techniques addressing this problem with integer
linear programming claim to produce optimal solutions. However,
the multi-criteria test-suite minimization problem is inherentlynonlinear, due to the fact that test cases are often dependent on
eachotherintermsoftest-casecriteria.Inthispaper,weproposea
frameworkthatformulatesthemulti-criteriatest-suiteminimiza-
tion problem as an integer nonlinear programming problem. To
solve thisproblem optimally, we programmaticallytransform this
nonlinear problem into a linear one and then solve the problem
using modern linear solvers. We have implemented our framework
as a tool, called Nemo, that supports a number of modern linear
and nonlinear solvers. We have evaluated Nemo with a publicly
available dataset and minimization problems involving multiplecriteria including statement coverage, fault-revealing capability,
and test execution time. The experimental results show that Nemo
can be used to efficiently find an optimal solution for multi-criteria
test-suite minimization problems with modern solvers, and the op-
timalsolutionsoutperformthesuboptimalonesbyupto164.29%
in terms of the criteria considered in the problem.

Softwaretestingplaysanessentialroleinsoftwaredevelopment,
providing a means to determine automatically whether a program
behavesasexpected.Toensurethecorrectnessofaprogramasit
evolves, engineers should perform regression testing on it to ensure
that modified or introduced code does not break the program’s
originalfunctionality.Toexercisenewbehaviorsordetectnewly
discoveredfaultsinsoftware,testsuitesforregressiontestingare
continuously expanded, and hence may become too large to exe-
cute in their entirety [ 29]. For example, a test suite for a system
with about 20,000 source lines of code may require seven weeks
torun[40].Moreover,duringthedevelopmentofMicrosoftWin-
dows 8.1, more than 30 million test executions were performed
[22]. Consequently, large test suites can make regression testing
impractical.
To address this problem, several approaches for test-suite main-
tenance such as test-suite minimization, test-case selection, and
test-caseprioritizationhavebeenproposed[ 50].Specifically,test-
suite minimization aims to find the minimal subset of the original
test suite which satisfies the same testing requirements [ 20]. Al-
though an existing minimization technique may work well with
respecttoasinglecriterion,thecapabilityofaminimizedtestsuite
may be severely compromised in terms of other criteria, such asfault-revealing power [
39,49]. As a result, a tester may consider
multiple criteria when performing the reduction. For instance, she
may want to generate a reduced suite with the same statement
coverage and maximal fault-detection capability.
Toaccommodatemulti-criteriatest-suiteminimization(MCTSM)
problems, existing techniques [ 5,23] model the problems as binary
integer linear programming (ILP) problems. A binary ILP problem
optimizes a linear objective function consisting of binary variables
under a set of linear constraints [ 47]. By encoding test-case cri-
teria(e.g.,faultsorstatementscoveredbytests)asconstraintsor
objective functions of a binary ILP problem, existing techniquesclaim that the computed solutions are optimal for the minimiza-
tion problem [
23]. However, an ILP formulation actually results
insub-optimal solutions,since theMCTSM problemis inherently
nonlinear. The nonlinearity arises due to the fact that test casesare often dependent on each other in terms of test-case criteria.
For example, consider the case where the goal of the test-suite
minimization is to select test cases in a suite that (1) maximize the
fault-detectioneffectivenessofthereducedsuiteand(2)maintain
thesamecodecoverageastheoriginalunminimizedtestsuite.In
this example, simply selecting test cases that reveal morefaults
ignores the possibility of the same fault being revealed by multi-
pletestcases,which ourresultsindicateactuallyoccursoften. To

ensure that test cases cover a diversenumber of faults, a nonlinear
formulation of the test-suite optimization problem is required.
To deal with dependencies among test cases in a MCTSM prob-
lem, we formulate the problem as an integer nonlinear program-
ming problem. To solve this problem optimally, we present a novel
approachthatprogrammaticallytransformsthisnonlinearproblem
into a linear problem and then solves the problem using modern
ILPsolvers.Weevaluateourproposedapproachusingapublicly
available dataset of open-source projects [ 21]. Our experiments for
bi-criteria test-suite minimization problems show that modeling
the objective functions nonlinearly results in minimized test suites
that, on average, cover more faults. For our experiments involving

We model the problem based on state-of-the-art formulations
provided in previous work [ 5,23]. First, we let a binary decision
variabletirepresent whether the ith test case is included in the
reduced suite, i.e., each titakes a 1 if the corresponding test case is
selected,and0otherwise.Next,wemodelconstraintcriterion c1,
asfollows,toensurethateverystatementcoveredbytheoriginal

The formulated problem can then be solved by using an ILP solver.

solvesitwithalinearsolver.Thisistheapproachthathasbeenfol-
lowedinpriorwork[ 5,19,23],includingageneraltoolfortest-suite
minimization by Hsu and Orso, called MINTS [23].
The optimal solution for this binary ILP problem is {t2,t3}with
a minimal value1
2under the constraints. However, from Table 1,
we can see that {t2,t3}detects only three of the four faults (i.e.,
it misses fault f4)—and hence is not the optimal solution for the
minimization problem, which is actually {t1,t2}. Note that {t1,t2}
obtains a value of 1 for equation 4. The correct solution can not be
computed by LF_LS, because the linear objective function tends to
selecttestcasesrevealing morefaultsbutnotnecessarily distinct
faults.Forexample,once t2isselected,nofurtherdistinctfaultscan
berevealedby t3,butt3wouldstillbeselectedbecauseitreveals
more faults than t1(i.e., three faults instead of just one). In fact,
t1should be selected for the minimization problem instead of t3
becauset1reveals a fault distinct from the faults in t2andt3.
Suchdependenciesamongtestcasescannotbeencodedwitha
linearobjectivefunction;theymustbeencodedusinganonlinear
objective function. Specifically, the test cases currently selected
are dependent on the test cases previously selected. To model such
dependencies among test cases, the optimization problem must be
formulated in a manner such that the decision variables (i.e., tis
inthepreviousequations)aremultipliedwitheachother,making
them inherently nonlinear. In the next section, we describe this
formulation.
3 NONLINEAR PROBLEM FORMULATION
TononlinearlymodeltheMCTSMproblem,wedescribetheproblem
more formally, illustrate how our nonlinear formulation models
test-casedependenciesandmultipleobjectivecriteria,anddescribe
the manner in which we utilize linear solvers to optimally solve
the nonlinear formulation of the problem.
3.1 Problem definition
To clarify our proposed idea, we formally define the MCTSM prob-
lem as follows:
Given:
(1) A test suite T={t1,t2, ...,tn}
(2)A set of constraint criteria C={c1,c2, ...,ck}which must
be satisfied by T
(3)A set of optimization criteria O={o1,o2, ...,ol}, i.e., the
criteria to be optimized by an objective function
(4)Anon-negativefunction ϵ(t)thatrepresentsthesignificance
of a test case t∈Twith respect to the optimization criteria.
ϵ(t)is a weighted sum of functions indicating the capability
oftwith respect to each of the optimization criteria. For
example,iftheoptimizationcriteriaare( o1)maximizingfault
detection effectiveness and ( o2) minimizing test execution
time,wecandefine ϵ(t)asϵ(t)=α1ϵ1(t)+α2ϵ2(t).Here,ϵ1(t)
representsthefault-detectioncapabilityof t;ϵ2(t)represents
theexecutiontimeof t.Eachfactor αisaweightprioritizing
a criterion.
Problem: Find a minimum test suite T/prime⊆Tsuch that

ti∈T/primeϵ(ti)≥/summationtext.1
tk∈T/prime/primeϵ(tk)
This minimization problem is NP-complete, because it is in NP
and can be reduced from the minimum set-covering problem in
polynomial time [16].
Todeal withdependenciesamongtests overmultipleoptimiza-
tion criteria, we must formulate the criteria in a nonlinear fashion.
Specifically, when our new formulation computes the capability of
atestwithrespecttoeachoptimizationcriterion,theformulation
needs to consider if the criterion is satisfied by other selected tests.
Tothatend,wealterequations2-3toaccountfor(1)multipleop-
timization criteria and (2) dependencies among test cases over a
specific optimization criterion using the following equation:

the formulation nonlinear (more details in Section 3.2). ˜wo(ti)is
a function computing the problem-specific significance of a test
caseand,thus,canbedefinedasneededfordifferentcriteriaand
minimizationproblems.Forexample, ˜wo(ti)canmodelwhethertest
casetiidentifies faults distinct from previously selected test cases.
Asanotherexample, ˜wo(ti)canmodelwhether testcase ticovers

We next illustrate an instantiation of ˜wo(ti)for the fault-detection
criterion from the example of Section 2.
3.2 Modeling test-case dependencies
In this subsection, we illustrate an instantiation of the proposed
formulation for an MCTSM problem involving the two criteria
from our motivating example: a constraint criterion ( c1) that main-
tains the same statement coverage as the original test suite, and an
optimization criterion ( o1) that maximizes the fault-detection effec-
tiveness of the reduced suite. Note that this instantiation involves
a single constraint criterion and a single optimization criterion—
eventhoughourformulationcanhandlemultipleconstraintand
optimization criteria—due to space limitations and to maximizereadability of our nonlinear formulation. First, for optimizationcriterion
o1,wesettheweightasone(i.e., α1=1)andassignthe
objective function using equation 5 as follows:

Furthermore,tomodeldependenciesamongtestsover o1,i.e.,fault-
detectioneffectiveness,whencalculatinghowmanyfaultsarere-

test case t3
(14)
In the above formulation, test case t1reveals fault f4, andf4is not
revealed by any other test case. As a result, the set of test cases
revealing f4(i.e.,T4)is{t1},andthecoefficientfor t1inequation

The above equation expresses t1as independent of other test cases,
since it reveals a fault that no other test case in the suite reveals.
Recallthattestcases t2andt3revealthesamesetoffaults,i.e.,
{f1,f2,f3}. As a result, the set of test cases revealing each of those

the coefficient of t2in equation 14 is expanded as follows:

For constraint criterion c1, we adopt constraints similar to those

|c1|is the size of constraint criterion c1;σijis a binary variable

With the above objective function andconstraints, the proposed
formulation for Table 1 results in the following assignment for the
optimization problem:

Withthisnonlinearformulation,theoptimalsolutionforinteger
nonlinear programming (INP) problem is {t1,t2}with a minimal

imization problem. Note that the solution selected by the linear
objectivefunctioninequation3,i.e., {t2,t3},obtainsavalue2using
the nonlinear objective function; thereby it will not be selected as
the final solution.
The above nonlinear formulation can be supplied directly to
a nonlinear solver, which is an approach for solving an MCTSM
problem that we refer to as NF_NS (NonlinearFormulation_ Nonlin-
earSolver). However, utilizing nonlinear solvers does not guarantee
optimalsolutions [ 48],leading usto proposeadifferentapproach
to solving the nonlinear formulation, as described in the next sub-
section.

3.3 Transformation to linear programming

for problems with non-convex functions (such as MCTSM), non-
linearsolversarenotguaranteedtofindanoptimalsolution[ 48],

transform the nonlinear formulation into a linear one. A linear

ILP solver technology [ 48]. We refer to this approach of solving
the nonlinear formulation using linear solvers as NF_LS (Nonlin-
earFormulation_LinearSolver) and describe it in the remainder of
this section.
ToallowtheuseoflinearsolversforNF_LS,wetransformthe
nonlinearMCTSMproblemintoalinearonebyintroducingnew
“auxiliary”variables[ 7].Wedemonstratetheapproachusingthe
instantiation of the MCTSM problem in Section 3.2. We introduce
up to|F|×|T|new decision variables ¯vijdefined as follows:
¯vij=vijdijti
¯vijis a binary variable indicating whether a fault fjis revealed
bytior any other previously selected test case: ¯viji s1i ftireveals

otherwise.Usingthenewlyintroducedvariables,equation8canbe
rewritten as follows:

j=1¯vij) (15)
Noticethatinthisformulation,decisionvariables tarenolonger
multiplied. However, the transformation has resulted inthe intro-
duction of new decision variables ¯v. We add an additional set of
constraints to the model to avoid having an unselected test case

5 EMPIRICAL EVALUATION
WeassessthreeapproachesforsolvingtheMCTSMproblem:LF_LS
(see Section 2), NF_NS (see Section 3.2), and NF_LS (see Section
3.3). For LF_LS, we reimplemented the technique in a tool called
MINTSproposedbyHsuandOrso[ 23].Wecouldnotusetheorigi-
nalimplementationofMINTSbecausethesolversitsupportsare
outdated and not scalable for our dataset. Using these approaches,
we investigate the following research questions:
RQ1. How does NF_LScompare against LF_LSwith respect
toeffectivenessandruntimeperformance? Toassessthisre-
search question, we use the size of the reduced test suite and the
satisfaction of the minimization criteria to characterize effective-
nessofeachapproach.Forperformance,wemeasurethetimeit

5.1 Experimental Setup
Subject programs : Our experimental subjects include the follow-
ing five open-source C projects: Grep, Flex, Sed, Make, and Gzip,
collectedfromapubliclyavailabledataset[ 21].Theseprogramsare
well-knownGNUsoftwareandwidelyusedinsoftwaretestinganddebugging research [ 6,11,21,27,38]. Each subject program in the
original dataset has five versions; we selected the latest version of
each program for our experiments. Table 2 depicts the following
detailed pieces of information about our subject programs: these-
lected version, a description of the program, its size (LOC ), and the
number of tests and faults available with each version.
Test suites : Each subject program in [ 21] comes with a test
suiteanda setoffaults.Weaugmentedavailabletest suiteswith
additional tests, since their coverage of the subject apps’ core func-
tions were low (i.e., average coverage was below 48%), and can
result in test suites that do not comprehensively test the subject
programs.Tothatend,weused KLEE[8]toensurethatsubjecttest
suites achieve a coverage higher than 60% on average for the core
functions.Tomeasurestatementcoverageoftestsuites,weused
gcov[17].
Faults:Theoriginaldataset[ 21]includesasetoffaultsforeach

purifiedbyremovingequivalentandduplicatemutantsusingTrivialCompilerEquivalence[
37](TCE),ascalableandeffectiveapproach
tofindequivalentandduplicatemutantsthatcomparesthemachine
code of compiled mutants. We followed the same technique to
generate additional unique mutants for the newly generated tests
added to the dataset.
Minimization problems : We compare the minimization tech-
niques using the following three minimization problems: classic
bi-criteria, variant bi-criteria, and tri-criteria. A classicalbi-criteria
test-suite minimization problem minimizes the test suite such that
statementcoverageoftheoriginaltestsuiteismaintained,while
maximizingitsfault-detectionability.The variantbi-criteria prob-
lem is a classic bi-criteria problem whose segments of code (e.g.,
specific API calls, methods, or classes) are more important than
others,andtherebyneedtobecoveredmultipletimes.Examplesof
scenarioswherecoveringthesamecodesegmentmultipletimesare
importantincludeenergytesting[ 24],performancetesting,orfield-
failurereproduction[ 27].Thetri-criteria problemisamulti-criteria
minimization problem where the minimized test suite needs to sat-
isfy a budget constraint, while maximizing the statement coverage
and fault-detection ability of the test suite. Since available time
for regressiontesting isoften an importantconstraint [ 35,46,51],

that for these two optimization criteria, i.e., statement coverage
and fault detection, NF_NS and NF_LS model dependencies among
testcases,whileLF_LSdoesnot.Theweightsforbothoptimization
criteria are the same in our experiments.
Solvers: We used CPLEX [ 13] and Couenne [ 12] as linear and
nonlinear solvers, respectively. For a fair performance comparison
ofdifferentsolvers,weusedthesesolversonNEOS[ 14],afreeweb
service for solving numerical optimization problems.

Table3 shows the effectiveness of different minimization tech-
niques for solving the classic bi-criteria problem. These results
demonstratethatNF_LSachievesanequalorgreaterfault-detection
abilitycomparedtoLF_LSandthesametest-suitesize.Morespecif-
ically, the minimized suites of NF_LS detected 13% more faults on
average than those of LF_LS without compromising test-suite size.
We observed that the improvements achieved by NF_LS vary
among different subject programs. Intuitively, for an MCTSM prob-
lem, NF_LS works better than LF_LS if test cases for the same
constraintcriterion(e.g.,coveringthesamestatement)satisfyan
optimizationcriterioninadifferentway(e.g.,revealingdifferent
faults). For instance, in the example of Table 1, t1andt3both cover
stmt1,butrevealdifferentfaults( f4fort1;f1,f2,andf3fort3).Asa
result, this difference in fault-revealing ability can be identified by
thenonlinearformulationwhenitselectsatestcaseforcovering
stmt1in the minimization process.
To investigate the aforementioned property in our experimental
dataset, we clustered test cases by the statements they covered for
each subject program. Then, we calculated average similarity of
faultsrevealedamongthetestsinthesamecluster,usingtheJaccard
similarity metric [ 25]. Jaccard formulates the similarity between
two sets, A and B, as follows:
J(A,B)=|A∩B|
|A∪B|
In our experiments, A and B are two sets of faults covered by
two tests within the same cluster. For example, suppose tests t1
andt2cover the same set of statements, causing the tests to be
clustered together. If execution of t1revealsA={f1,f2}, andt2
revealsB={f2,f3}, theJaccard similarityfor these twotests are
computed as J(A,B)=1
3.
For a given a program, effectiveness of the nonlinear formula-
tion will degrade as the average similarity among all clusters inTable4:AverageJaccardSimilarityofthefaultsetsrevealed

that program approaches 1. This effect occurs since tests cover-
ingthesamestatementsalsocoverincreasinglysimilarfaults.As
that average similarity approaches 0, the nonlinear formulation
performs more effectively, i.e., tests covering the same statements
cover increasingly different faults.

However,inthecaseofGrep,theaveragesimilarityamongallclus-

the total number of existing test cases is a sensible testing strategy.
The results for this experiment are depicted in Table 6. Our
resultsdemonstratethatNF_LSconsistentlyoutperformsLF_LSfor
allsubjectappsandsizeconstraints.Particularly,testsuitesreduced
by NF_LS executed 45% more statements and 73% more faults than
thesuitesbyLF_LSon average.Wecanseethattheimprovement
achieved by NF_LS in this problem is larger than the previous two
problems. This could be attributed to the looser constraints in this
problem and hence the larger solution space for all the techniques.
For instance, given that the constraint is to reduce the test suite
of Grep to 5%, the size of the solution space for this problem is/parenleftbig746
37/parenrightbig≈5.73×1062.Iftherearemoreconstraints,e.g.,constraints
forstatementssuchasthoseincludedinthepreviousproblems,the
solution space would be further limited, because some solutions in
it do not satisfy the additional constraints. As the solution space
grows larger, the effectiveness gap between the solutions returned
by NF_LS and LF_LS is expected to increase.
Performance .Tables7and8showcasetheexecutiontimesthat

foundbyNF_LSforthis tri-criteria problem,asshowninTable6,
vastly outperforms the solution found by LF_LS. For Gzip under

inthecaseofLF_LS,buttheyobtainasolutionthatrevealsmuch
more faults with fewer tests which, in turn, can save engineers’
time and effort from having to examine and run more tests.
5.3 RQ2: NF_LS vs. NF_NS
Similar to the previous RQ, we compared NF_LS and NF_NS in
terms of effectiveness and performance. We further discuss the
advantages or disadvantages of selecting among the two nonlinear
approaches, based on our empirical results.
Effectiveness .Table3showsthat,forthe classicbi-criteria prob-
lem, NF_NSwas able to findthe optimal solutionsfor only three
subject programs—Flex, Sed, and Make. The solver timed out af-
ter eight hours for Grep, and returned a suboptimal solution for
Gzip.Table5furthershowsthat,forthe variantbi-criteria problem,
NF_NS only found the optimal solution for Make, and the solver
timedout aftereight hoursfor othersubject programs.We donot
reporttheeffectivenessofNF_NSforthe tri-criteria problem,be-
cause we were not able to use NEOS to solve it due to the size
limitation of NEOS for uploaded files. The reported results indicate
that, as expected, the nonlinear solver is not guaranteed to find
anoptimalsolutionforthenonlinearformulationiftheobjective
function is non-convex [ 48]. However, NF_LS can optimally solve
MCTSM problems formulated nonlinearly.
Performance . For theclassic bi-criteria problem, Table 7 shows
NF_NStakesmuchlongertimetosolvetheproblemthanNF_LS.
While NF_LS solved the problem within a second for all subject
apps, the solver used by NF_NS timed out for Grep, and took from
20secondstosixhourstofinish.Forthe variantbi-criteria problem,
Table 8 indicates that NF_NS was able to finish only for Make, and
the solver timed out for other subjects. The results indicate that,
off-the-shelf nonlinear solvers cannot solve MCTSM problems in a
timelymanner,whichconfirmstheneedtotransformthenonlinear
problem formulation toa linear one. Overall,NF_LS is superior to
NF_NS in terms of both effectiveness and performance.
5.4 RQ3: Scalability
Given NF_LS’s superior performance over NF_NS, we focus on
studyingthescalabilityofNF_LS.Specifically,weinvestigatethe
mannerinwhichNF_LSscaleswithrespecttothesizeofsubject
programsandtestsuites.Intuitively,thetimeNF_LStakestosolvea

Thiscomplexityisdeterminedbythecharacteristicsoftheproblem
(e.g., number of test cases, requirements, and criterion entities).
WeconductedasensitivityanalysisofNF_LSonthe tri-criteria

each program, starting from the size of 20% of the test suite, we
gradually increased the size of test suites to 100%, and reported (1)

Figure 2 depicts the relation between the size of a test suite and
the number of variables used in the problem formulation. While
the number of variables range in the hundreds of thousands for
each problem, the number grows linearly, as does the size of the
test suite.
Figure 3 depicts the relation between the size of a test suite and
solver execution time. As the size of a test suite grows linearly, the

Leitneret al.[ 28]propose atechnique combiningprogram slicing
anddeltadebuggingtominimizefailingtestcasesinrandomized
unittestgeneration,whichisfocusedonreducingindividualtest
cases rather than the sizes of test suites. All of these approaches
focus on a single criterion and generate approximate solutions.
Multi-criteriatest-suiteminimizationproblem. Whilepre-
vious approaches can be adopted to efficiently find a solution, a
majorconcern ofsingle-criterion minimizationisthat minimizing
a test suite could severely compromise its ability to reveal faults
[39,49]. Toaccount foradditional criteria, such as fault-detection
capability,severalapproacheshavebeendevelopedthatconsider
additional information including hybrid combinations of different
coveragecriteria[ 41]intheminimizationprocessandgeneratinga
reducedsuitewhichhasbettereffectivenesswithrespecttovariouscriteria,suchasfaultdetection[
4,5,15,18,19,26,31,33,34,42–44]
and energy consumption [24, 30].
With respect to improving fault-detection effectiveness of the
reduced suite, a few techniques are heuristics-based. Jeffery and
Gupta[26]proposeaheuristicthatselectivelypicksredundanttest
casesforthereducedsuitebyusingadditionalcoverageinforma-
tion.Aheuristic byLinandHuang [ 31]usesan additionaltesting
criterion to break ties in the minimization process.
Inadditiontotheheuristics,ILPisadoptedtocomputesolutions
for the problem. Black et al. [ 5] formulate the problem as a binary
ILPmodel.Theydirectlytake thefault-rev ealingabilityoftestcases
into account, encodeit into the objective function, andcompute a
solution for the problem using an ILP solver. Hao et al. [ 19] collect
statistics on fault-detection loss at the statement level, and encode
theinformationintotheconstraintsoftheformulatedILPmodel
to control the fault-detection loss of the reduced suite.
Anothersetofpreviousworkconsidersotheraspectsofminimiz-
ingatestsuitewhilemaximizingitsfault-detectioncapability.This
workincludesusingdifferentcoveragecriteriasuchascall-stack
coverage [ 33], adopting different reduction algorithms [ 42,44]—or
applyingtechniquessuchasdelta-debugging[ 18],non-adequate
reduction[ 4](i.e.,onlyacertainpercentageoftheoriginalcover-
age is retained), or a combination of test reduction and selection
[43]. Other work also addresses the trade-offs specific for reused
software [34] and an industrial system [15].
With respect to criteria other than fault-revealing capability, Li
etal.[30]takeenergyconsumptionoftestcasesintoconsideration,
andadoptanintegerprogrammingapproachtogenerateminimized
testsuiteswhichareenergy-efficientforpost-deploymenttesting
on embedded systems. Similarly, Jabbarvand et al. [ 24] propose an
integer programming approach as well as a greedy algorithm to
minimize test suites while trying to maintain the capability of the
reduced suites to reveal energy bugs.Unlike Nemo, all of these MCTSM approaches focus on specific
bi-criteriaproblemsanddonotallowtesterstospecifyawiderange
ofMCTSMproblems,cannotcomputeoptimalsolutionsforthem,
and cannot deal with dependencies between test cases over any
testing criteria.
Hsu andOrso [ 23] proposedMINTS, aframework for MCTSM,
that is able to accommodate an arbitrary number of objectives and
provides flexibility for testers to combine, weight, and prioritize
theirobjectives.RecallthatLF_LSisare-implementationofMINTS,
sincetheoriginalimplementationusesoutdatedsolversanddoes
notscaletoourexperimentaldataset(seeSection5).Theirapproach
formulates the problem as one or more ILP problems, in which the
testrequirementsareencodedasconstraints,andtheobjectivescanbeeitherassociatedasweightsinobjectivefunctions,orprioritized
as invocation orders of ILP problems. While their work focuses on
ageneralized approachfor MCTSM,their problemformulationis
linear, which, as shown both in theory (Section 2) and empirically
(Section5)inthispaper,producessub-optimalsolutions,duetothe
inability to model dependencies among test cases over specified
criteria, which must be modeled nonlinearly.
7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Multi-criteriatest-suiteminimizationtechniqueshelpreducethe
cost of regression testing by removing redundant tests based on
somecriteria,whiletryingtooptimallykeepthecapabilityofthere-
ducedsuiteintermsofothercriteria.Alloftheexistingapproaches
sufferfromatleastoneofthetwoshortcomingsdiscussedinthis
paper:(1)theyeitheruseheuristicalgorithmsorignoretest-case
dependencies among minimization criteria, and hence generate
approximateorsuboptimalsolutions;and(2)theyhandleminimiza-
tion problems involving only limited and pre-specified criteria.
In this paper, we proposed a general framework for the multi-
criteriatest-suiteminimizationproblem.Ourapproachtakesinto
account the inherent nonlinearity of the problem, and models it
usingintegernonlinearprogramming.Tosolvethenonlinearformu-
lation optimally, we developed a technique that programmatically
transforms it to a linear form, so that modern ILP solvers can be
leveraged. We have implemented our approach as a tool, called
Nemo, and empirically evaluated it. Our experimental results show
that Nemo can be used to find optimal solutions for several min-imization problems within a reasonable time. Nemo was able to
produce reduced test suites that could execute up to 159% more
statements and detect 124% more faults than those produced using
prior work.
Aninterestingdirectionforfutureworkistoinvestigateappli-
cability of our approach in other test maintenance activities, such
as test selection and prioritization. We also plan to conduct experi-
mentsinvolvingmorecomplexcriteria,suchasMC/DC,toassess
theeffectivenessof anonlinearapproachinsatisfying suchcriteria
in test-suite minimization. Finally, we plan to empirically evaluate
the fault-detection ability of the reduced test suites when executed
on previously unseen faults.
