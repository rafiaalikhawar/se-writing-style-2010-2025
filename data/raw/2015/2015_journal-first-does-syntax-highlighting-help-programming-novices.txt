BACKGROUND
Programcomprehensionisanimportantskillforprogrammers–

routine. Syntax highlighting is one of the most common tools used
to support developers in understandingalgorithms. However, most
research on code highlighting is more than 20 years old, when
programmers used a completely different tool chain. Newer results
ontheeffectofsyntaxhighlightingasusedinmodernIntegrated
Development Environments (IDEs) are inconclusive.
OBJECTIVE
Weexaminedtheinfluenceofsyntaxhighlightingonnovices’ability
tocomprehendsourcecode.Additionalanalysescovertheinfluence
of task type and programming experience on the code comprehen-
sion ability itself and its relation to syntax highlighting.
METHOD
We conducted a controlled experiment with 390 undergraduate

RESULTS
Thedataprovidednoevidencethatsyntaxhighlightingimproves
novices’ ability to comprehend source code. The differences in cor-
rectness between tasks with syntax highlighting and the same task
without syntaxhighlighting have notbeen statistically significant.
Furthermore,we calculatedthe differencein proportionsbetween

sensitivity to syntax highlighting. The results show with 95 % con-
fidence that the influence of syntax highlighting on the difference
in proportions is within the interval [−0.022;0 .033]. This shows
thatthepositiveornegativeeffectofsyntaxhighlightingasused

CONCLUSION
The results suggest that syntax highlighting squanders a feedback
channel from the IDE to the programmer that can be used more
effectively.
