ABSTRACT
Differential program analysismeans to identify the behavioraldi-
vergences in one or multiple programs, and it can be classified into
twocategories:identifythebehavioraldivergences(1)betweentwo
program versions for the same input (aka regression analysis ), and
(2)forthesameprogramwithtwodifferentinputs(e.g, side-channel
analysis).Mostoftheexistentapproachesforbothsubproblemstry
tosolveitwithsingletechniques,whichsufferfromitsweaknesses
like scalability issues or imprecision. This research proposes to
combine two very strong techniques, namely fuzzingandsymbolic
execution totackletheseproblemsandprovidescalablesolutions
forreal-worldapplications.Theproposedapproacheswillbeim-
plementedontopofstate-of-the-arttoolslikeAFLandSymbolic

1 INTRODUCTION
Differentialanalysisaimstofinddifferentbehaviorsinprograms.
This includes the identification of divergences between two pro-
gram versions for the same input (regression analysis ), but also
the identification of divergent behaviors for different inputs for
the same program. Whereas regression analysis is interested in
verifying software patches for unintended behavioral changes, the
second problem can be used in security analysis to identify long

exposesecretinformation(side-channelanalysis ).Therefore,having
effective and scalable techniques to perform a differential analysis
of programs is crucial for testing real-world software.
Fuzzing has become one of the most promising testing tech-
niques for finding bugs and security vulnerabilities in software
[10,26]. Even though a large amount of invalid inputs get gener-
ated, fuzzing can be more effective in practice than more complex
testing techniques due to its low computation overhead. Although,
fuzzers are known to be good at identifying shallowbugs, they
may fail to execute deep program paths [ 24], i.e. paths that are
guarded by specific conditions. On the other hand, symbolic ex-ecution techniques [
9,23] are particularly well suited to explore
various branches including paths that require these specific condi-
tions.However,symbolicexecutionisusuallymuchmoreexpensive
in terms of computational resources used during exploration.
Worst-casecomplexityanalysisismostlyperformedonsymbolic
execution based approaches [ 5,14] or pure fuzzing approaches
[13,20], and both variants suffer from its weaknesses like scalabil-
ityissuesforsymbolicexecutionbasedapproachesandimprecision
for fuzzing based approaches. Existent techniques for side-channel
analysis, e.g., [ 2,4,7], are too inaccurate and too imprecise for
real-worldapplications.Stateoftheartapproachesforregression

mightmissimportantdivergencesdueto,e.g.,impreciseconstrainthandling.AsPalikarevaetal.[

ingsoftwareisadifficultproblem,whichisunlikelytobesolved

There are approaches on how to combine fuzzing with symbolic
execution for test case generation [ 6,8,11], above all Driller [ 24]

However, neither of them focus on the problem of differential pro-gram analysis, but mainly on generating high-coverage test suites.

the secret data can not be inferred by the side-channel measure-ments that an attacker can make of the systems. This intuitive
property is called non-interference, which can be checked with, e.g.,

based on a static analysis, which might lead to false alarms and

symbolic execution and constraint solving (in addition with model

they can not yet scale to large applications, due to the expensive
constraint manipulation. An efficient technique based on dynamicanalysis could provide concrete inputs to reproduce bugs and over-
come the imprecision, which is necessary for the application on
complex, real-world problems.
State-of-the-art regressionanalysis techniques aimat covering
the changed program statements by applying dynamic symbolic
execution.DirectedIncrementalSymbolicExecution(DiSE)[ 19,27]
leverages static analysis to guide symbolic execution to changedprogram locations only. Due to the fact that it executes only thenew version of the program, DiSE might lead to imprecise pathconditions, which can miss divergences between the old and the
newversion.Shadowsymbolicexecution byPalikarevaetal.[ 17]
applies on a changed-annotated program version, which combines
the old and the new program. Thus it can use the information
from both versions. They introduce a dynamic analysis technique,

they can retrieve tests that touch the changed portion of the code.
Shadow symbolic execution might miss divergences that could ex-

that eliminate certain future program paths.
Several existent approaches try to combine fuzzing with sym-
bolic execution for test case generation. EvoSuite [ 8] is a test-case
generation tool for Java, based on evolutionary algorithms and
dynamicsymbolicexecution.SAGE(ScalableAutomatedGuided
Execution) [ 10] extends dynamic symbolic execution with a gener-
ational search that, instead of negating only the final condition of a
complete symbolic execution, negates all conditions on the path.Mayhem [
6], a symbolic execution engine with special focus on
security vulnerabilities in binaries, was combined with the Mur-
phy fuzzer and won the 2016 DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge [ 25].
Driller[ 24]isanotherpromisingtoolthatcombinestheAFLfuzzer
with the angr symbolic execution engine and that has achieved
similar results to Mayhem.
3 PROPOSED SOLUTIONS
3.1 Worst-Case Complexity Analysis
Figure1shows the overview of the technique Badger [ 15], which
was presentedatthe ISSTA’2018.Badgeruses thecombinationof
the cost-guided fuzzer KelinicWCA and concolic execution based
on SPF (named SymExe). By running both techniques in parallel
whiletheyexchangetheirresultswitheachother,itispossibleto
leveragebothstrengthsandovercometheirsinglelimitations.Ke-
linicWCA prioritizes costly paths by allowing AFL to not only
use inputs that increase coverage, but also inputs that lead to an
increasedcostvalue(intime,memoryoruser-definedcost). SymExe

symbolic execution tree driven by the concrete values. Based onheuristics it picks the nmost promising nodes for further explo-
ration and generates inputs that then can be exported to the fuzzer
to further push it into deeper paths.
ThemostrelatedworktothisapproachisSlowFuzz[ 20],which
is a fuzzer similar to KelinicWCA. Unfortunately, the approaches
cannotbedirectlycomparedbecauseofdifferenttargetprogramlan-
guages. Therefore, the evaluation for Badger uses similar subjects
as SlowFuzz and shows how all components (symbolic execution,
fuzzing, and the combination) perform in terms of the quality of

3.2 Side-Channel Analysis
Side-channel vulnerabilities can be detected by maximizing the dif-
ferenceinobservationbetweentwoprogramexecutions,forwhich
onlythesecretvaluesaredifferentandthe publicvalueremainsthe
same.Acost-guidedfuzzerthatcanhandleuser-definedcosts,simi-lartoKelinicWCA[
15],canbeusedtoimplementthisideabyusing
thedifferenceinobservedcostbetweentwoprogramexecutions
as user-defined value. As a first step, this idea was implemented in
aprototypeandtheevaluation,whichincludescomparisonwith
Blazer[2]and Themis[7],showed thatit effectivelycanidentify
side-channel vulnerabilities in real-world applications like Apache
FtpServer [ 1]. As next step this research plans to combine this
fuzzing approach with a similar symbolic execution approach usedin Badger. In contrast to Badger, which uses fixed input sizes, dif-ferentialfuzzinghandlesarbitraryinputsizesuptoaspecifiedlimit
because it depends on the fuzzing step and the dynamic fuzzing
drivertodeterminethecurrentinputsize,whichmakesitnecessary
to apply a more sophisticated symbolic execution approach. The
constructedsymbolicexecutiontreehastohandlemultipleinput
sizes at the same time, which can be realized by using a virtual
decision on the top, which determines the current size of the input.
3.3 Regression Analysis
For the worst-case complexity analysis it seems to be logical tofollow or search next to costly paths to find even more costly
paths. Unfortunately, the approach which works for WCA and
side-channel analysis does not need to work as well for regression
analysis.Regressionanalysistriestofinddivergencesintermsof
taking different branches in two program versions for the same
input.Quantifyingthesedivergencesisnotasstraightforwardas
quantifying cost differences like execution time.
As fuzzing cost metrics this research proposes to investigate
two alternatives: (a) using cost defined by number of executed
statements (similar to the previous work on worst-case complexity
analysis and side-channel detection), for which a cost difference is
clearindicatorforaregression,althoughitmightmissregression
cases,and(b)usingthedifferenceindecisionsequences,i.e.how
similar have been the decision made in both program versions.
As symbolic execution counterpart this work identified two op-
tions:(i)applyingshadowsymbolicexecution[ 17]drivenbythe
concreteinputsimportedfromthefuzzerside,or(ii)applying(stan-
dard)symbolicexecutionsimilartotheside-channelanalysiswhere
the difference is measured by applying metric (b), the differencein decision sequences. Variant (i) would be based on a recent im-
plementationofshadowsymbolicexecutionon topof SPF,called
ShadowJPF[16].Shadowsymbolicexecution[ 17]needsconcrete
values,whichcouldbeobtainedfromthefuzzingside.Inadditionto
be driven by concrete values, the symbolic execution in variant (i)
shouldalsoapplyafullfour-wayforkingtofindthemostpromising
nodes for exploration and guide the fuzzing in deeper paths.
TheoverallworkflowlookssimilartotheonebyBadger[ 15]
(cf. Figure 1), although the analysis part needs to be replaced by
appropriate metrics to identify regressions.
4 PROGRESS IN RESEARCH
Thework onworst-case complexityanalysisis finishedwiththe
publication of Badger [ 15] at the ISSTA’2018. The work on side-
channelanalysiswasstarteddevelopingafuzzingapproachforthe
identification of side-channel vulnerabilities. Additional work is
requiredtomakeusageofthefullpotentialoffuzzingandsymbolic
execution in this area. Furthermore, it is necessary to work on the
generationofconcreteattacksbasedonaprioranalysisbasedon

with fuzzing and symbolic execution was started by providing
