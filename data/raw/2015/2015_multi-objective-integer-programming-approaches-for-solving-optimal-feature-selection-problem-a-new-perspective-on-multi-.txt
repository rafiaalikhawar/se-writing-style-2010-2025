SPLE isfeature-oriented, as itadopts feature-orienteddomain

select features that meet the requirements of customers, avoid pos-
sible feature conflicts, and meanwhile optimize design goals in

on selecting optimal features.
In practice, as real-world SPLs contain thousands of features,
manual feature selection for product configuration according to
the given requirements and constraints is extremely difficult if not
impossible.Forexample,LinuxX86kernelcontains6888features,
and 343944 constraints, as reported in [ 43]. Further, features are

In literatures, the optimal feature selection problem has been
studied byseveral researchers. Twoearlier studiesadopted Filtered
Cartesian Flattening (FCF) [ 48] or Genetic Algorithm (GA) [ 15]. In
2013, MOEAs were applied to solve this problem and IBEA was
reportedtobethebestMOEA[ 42].Alongthisline,studiesofim-
provementsonIBEA[ 41][45]andintegrationofIBEAwithother
techniques (e.g., constraint solving [ 18] and Differential Evolution
(DE) [50]) are the latest progress. Among them, IBED [ 50] adopts a
dual-populationdesign(onepopulationforIBEAandanotherfor
DE).Meanwhile,atrendistocombineIBEAwithconstraintsolvers
(e.g., SATIBEA [ 18] and SMTIBEA [ 14]) to improve the repair ope-
rator in the population evolution. Hence, MOEAs (especially IBEA)
become the indispensable parts of the state-of-the-art approaches.

based approaches at least face the following four drawbacks:

(2)Even on small problems, non-guarantee of solution set com-
pleteness.
(3)Non-guarantee of finding the true Pareto-optimal solutions.

(4) Non-guarantee of finding evenly-distributed solutions [27],
whileretainingthecorrectnessofsolutions(e.g.,Diversity-
preferred NSGA-II cannot achieve correctness [42]).
All these drawbacks are inherent in the nature of heuristic al-
gorithms. To circumvent them, is it feasible to solve the optimal
feature selection problem from a different perspective? Let us revi-
sit the nature of this SBSE problem — decision variables are binary
andallconstraintsandobjectivesarelinear(see§2.2and§3).Hence,
integerprogramming(IP),morespecificallyintegerlinearprogram-
ming,isapplicableforthisproblemaslongasmultipleobjectives
can be reduced to one.
Inepsilon-constraint ( ϵ-constraint) method [ 17], the straight-
forwardideaistoconverttheobjectives1to k−1intotherange
constraintsand usethe k-thobjective asthe objectivefunction of
IP. The operation procedure has several iterations,each increases
(ordecreases)theright-handsideoftheconstrained-objectiveby
a step and runs IP method. The ϵ-constraint method and its im-
provement CWMOIP (Constraint Weighted Multi-objective Integer
Programming) [ 37] are elaborated in §4. During the evaluation, we
find that the brute-force iteration of all objectives’ ranges will call
IP too many times, make solving running forever. This indicates:
“Existing MOIP methods ( ϵ-constraint and CWMOIP) are capable on
small systems from SPLOT [31], but not on large ones”
Technical Innovation. For large problem, it is practical and
meaningfultogenerateagoodrepresentationoftheParetofront.
Therefore, we propose to combine the hit-and-run (H&R) method
[44]withnormalconstraints(NC)method[ 32].NCmethod,was
originally proposed for generating Pareto front representation for
continuous optimization problem. H&R is efficient in randomly
generatinguniformly-distributedpointsinsideanyboundedregion.Due to the high dimensionality and complex boundaries of the uto-
pia plane (see definition in §5), we propose to improve NC method
by using H&R. The essential idea is to use uniformly-distributedreference points on the utopia plane to generate representativePareto-optimalsolutions(§5).Theadvantagesofourmethodarethree-fold: 1). guarantee the true optimal solution; 2). guarantee
thespreadofthePareto-front;3).computationallyefficient.Wecall

Wecomparethestate-of-the-artMOEAforoptimalfeaturese-

LVAT[1]repositories.Resultsshowthat,inmostcases,SolRepfinds
significantlymorenon-dominatedsolutionsthanIBEDinsimilarorlesstime(§6).Thus,wemake thefirstattempt todevelopandapply
MOIP on large systems (e.g., Linux X86). A take-home message is
“The improved IP method (NC+H&R) can scale up to large systems
(e.g., Linux X86 from LVAT), being better than IBEA and IBED.”
Our main contributions are summarized below.
(1)Byconvertinglogicalformulaeintoinequalities,weformu-
late this problem as a multiple-objective IP model.

MOIP to find complete solutions on small systems.

2 OPTIMAL FEATURE SELECTION PROBLEM
IN SPL
Inthissection,webrieflyintroducetheoptimalfeatureselection
problem and its formulation as a MOO problem.
2.1 Feature Model and the Constraints inside
In SE,featureis defined as “A distinguishing characteristic of a
software item (e.g., performance or functionality, etc.)” in IEEE
Std829-1998. In SPL, featurefurther refers to the requirements
and implementations of such a characteristic [ 24].Feature model
is a hierarchy of features within a product family as well as the
structural andsemantic constraints in between [10].
Featuremodelorganizesthefeaturesinsideinatree-likestruc-
ture.Givenaparent(orcompound)feature f/primeanditschildfeatures
(orsubfeatures){ f1,...,fn},fourtypesof tree-structure constraints
(TCs) exist and are defined as follow [4]:
•fiis amandatory subfeature — fi⇔f/prime,
•fiis anoptionalsubfeature — fi⇒f/prime,
•{f1,...,fn}i sa nor subfeature group — f1∨...∨fn⇔f/prime,
•{f1,...,fn}isanalternative subfeaturegroup— (f1∨f2∨...∨fn⇔
f/prime)∧/logicalandtext.1
1≤i<j≤n(¬(fi∧fj)).
Given two features f1andf2that hold no TCs, three types of
cross-tree semantic constraints (CTCs) may exist, i.e.,iff, requires
andexcludes[4]:
•f1ifff2—f1⇔f2,
•f1requiresf2—f1⇒f2,
•f1excludesf2—¬(f1∧f2).
The feature model of a Java Chat System ( JCS) is illustrated
in Fig. 1 and the constraints of that model are listed in Table 1.
Constraintsc(1)–c(12)areTCs,astheyareconstraintsonstructural
relation of features. The root (compulsory) feature of the featuremodel is Chat, which has a mandatory subfeature (Output ) and
several optional subfeatures (e.g., Encryption ) — constraints c(1)
– c(7). Since the feature Outputis mandatory, exactly one of its
subfeatures(GUI, CMD,and GUI2)mustbeselected—constraints
c(8) – c(11). In addition, if feature Encryption is selected, at least
oneofitssubfeatures(Caesar andReverse)needstobeselected—
constraints c(12). There is only one CTC for JCS, which is of the
formf1ifff2,Encryption_OR is selected if and only if Caesaror
Reverseis selected — constraints c(13).

Given a feature model M, we refer TCs and CTCs of Mas the
conjunction of constraints of M, denoted by conj(M). LetFea(M)
denote the feature set of M. Thus, for the features in JCS, we have
Fea(JCS)={Chat,Output,Logging,Authorization ,Color,Encryption ,
Encryption _OR,GUI,CMD,GUI2,Caesar,Reverse}.
Definition 1 (Correct Solution). Given a feature model M,a
correct solution forMrefers to a non-empty feature set F⊆Fea(M)
that satisfies the constraints of M.
TakeJCSas an example, F={Chat,Output,GUI}is a correct
solution of feature selection for JCS.
2.2 Multi-objective Optimization for SPL
2.2.1 Software Development Model and the Objectives. As the
correct selection of a non-empty feature set Fon feature model M
is essentially a boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem [ 29][5]. Gra-
dually, this problem evolves into a MOO problem — more than
havingacorrectselection,multiplequalityattributesoftheproduct
according to Fneed to be optimized .
According to [ 2], goals in software development have a positive
impact for the products. Project managers control the software
development according to four objective scores: project risk; deve-
lopmentcost,developmentdefects;andmanpower(totalmonths
ofdevelopment)[ 2].Accordingto[ 42],eachfeatureisassociated
with three attributes, i.e., COST, DEFECT and USED_BEFORE. The
optimalfeatureselectionproblemcanbeideallymodeledasaMOO
problem, which requires trade-off among multiple design goals.
2.2.2 FormalizationoftheMOOProblem. Givenanon-empty
feature set Fand the entire feature set Fea(M)forM(Fea(M)=
{f1...fn}. For∀fi∈Fea(M), the binary value represented by the
selectionof fi(denotedas |fi|)is1iffi∈F,else|fi|is0.Givena
solution/vecx(an encoded binary-value vector for Fea(M)), according
to [42], five objective functions are defined as follows:
Obj1. Correctness meanstheextentofthecomplianceto conj(M).
We want to minimize the number of violated constraints:
F1(/vecx)=Viol(F),whereViol(F)returnsthenumberofcon-
straints violated by Famongconj(M). Note that Viol(F)=0
means a correct selection.
Obj2. Richness of features means the richness of the functio-
nalityoftheproduct.Wewanttominimizethenumberof
deselectedfeatures: F2(/vecx)=/summationtext.1n
i=1(1−|fi|),where|fi|returns
1i ffi∈F, otherwise returns 0.
Obj3. Featureusedbefore meansthereliabilityofproduct,asfe-
atures never used are more prone to have unknown defects.We want to minimize this: F3(/vecx)=/summationtext.1ni=1(Used(fi)·|fi|),
whereUsed(fi)returns a boolean value of the attribute
USED_BEFORE of feature fi.
Obj4. Defects meanstheknownbugsorerrorscontainedinthe
product.Wewanttominimizethis: F4(/vecx)=/summationtext.1ni=1(Defect(fi)·
|fi|), whereDefect(fi)returns the value of attribute DE-
FECT of feature fi.
Obj5. Cost meanstheexpenseandeffortsindevelopingthepro-
duct.Wewanttominimizethis: F5(/vecx)=/summationtext.1ni=1(Cost(fi)·|fi|),
whereCost(fi)returns the value of the attribute COST of
featurefi.
Ratherthanencodealltheobjectivesintoonemagicweighted
fitnessfunction,alltheobjectivesareequallytreatedandsolvedby
MOO using the Pareto dominance relation [22].
Ak-objectiveoptimizationproblemcouldbewritteninthefol-
lowing form (in our case, k=5):
Minimize /vecF=(F1(/vecx),F2(/vecx),...,Fk(/vecx)) (1)
where/vecFis ak-dimensional objective vector and Fi(/vecx)is the value
of/vecFfori-th objective.
Definition 2. Given two correct solutions /vecx,/vecy∈Bnand an
objective vector /vecF:Bn→Rk,/vecxdominates /vecy(/vecx≺/vecy)i f
∀i∈{1,...,k}Fi(/vecx)≤Fi(/vecy) (2)

natedby any other correct solutions. All Pareto-optimal solutions
are called as the true Pareto front.
2.2.3 ProblemStatement. ExistingMOEAs(e.g.,IBEA[ 52],NSGA-
II[11],ssNSGA-II[ 12],MOCell[ 35],SPEA2[ 53])areusedtofinda
setofnon-dominatedsolutionsthatapproximatetheParetofront
for solving the MOO problems. As pointed by Sayyad et.alin [42],
IBEAproducesthesolutionswiththehighestcorrectnessrate.After
that, more studies improve IBEA to search for correct solutions
[40][45][18][19][50].
AstheseMOEA-basedapproachessufferfromthecorrectness,
whynotweuseamethodnaturallyassuringthesolutioncorrect-
ness? As all constraints in conj(M)and all objectives are linear
(convertible to linear inequalities, see §3), Binary Integer Program-
ming (BIP) can be applied. In theory, we can reduce the multiple
objectivesintoone.TheBIP-basedanalyticmethodisfreefromthe
drawbacks of MOEAs (see §1), but suffer from the scalability issue.

3.1 Theory of Converting Logical Formulae to
Inequalities
Convertinglogicalformulae(LF)intoinequalitiesisatypicalpro-
blem of OR. By BIP upon the inequalities, it can be rapidly decided
whether the original given LFs can be satisfied and how to be satis-
fiedifso.In[ 20],Hookerproposed andproved thatthesatisfiability
problem of a conjunctive normal form (CNF) can be directly redu-
cedtoaBIPproblem.Thoughdetailedstepsarenotformalizedin
[20], the basic idea of conversion was explained. Generally, two
ways can convert an arbitrary LF as a CNF. Except for each atomic
proposition, if no extra variables are introduced for operations on
several atomic propositions, the running time and length of the re-
sulting CNF can increase exponentially with the number of atomic
propositions in the original formula in the worse case [7].
3.2 Fast Converting Logical Formulae from the
SPL Models
As different types of TCs and CTCs are not arbitrary LFs, the con-
versioncanbedoneinlineartimewithoutintroducingintermediate
CNFsandextravariables.Let |fi|denotewhether the i-thfeature
(fi) is selected in a solution (see §2.2). We deduce these lemmas:
Lemma 3.1. If feature fis an Optional subfeature of feature f/prime,
the linear inequality for the Optional relationship is
|f/prime|−|f|≥0 (5)
Proof.f⇒f/primeistrueaccording to the optional relationship.
Thus we can infer ¬f∨f/primeistrue. As a CNF, it can be converted to
the inequality (1−|f|)+|f/prime|≥1, that is |f/prime|−|f|≥0. /square
Lemma3.2. Iffeature fisaMandatorysubfeatureoffeature f/prime,
the linear equality for the Mandatory relationship is
|f/prime|−|f|=0 (6)
Proof.f⇔f/primeistrueaccording to the mandatory relationship.
ThusweinfertheCNF (¬f∨f/prime)∧(¬f/prime∨f)istrue.Twoinequalities
arededuced: (1−|f|)+|f/prime|≥1and(1−|f/prime|)+|f|≥1.Byunifying
them, we infer |f/prime|−|f|=0. /square
Lemma3.3. Iffeatures f1...fnaretheOr-subfeatureoffeature f/prime,
the linear inequalities for this relationship are
∀i∈{1,...,n},|fi|−|f/prime|≤0 (7)
/summationdisplay.1n
i=1|fi|−|f/prime|≥0 (8)
Proof./logicalortext.1n
i=1(fi)⇔f/primeistrueaccording to the Or relations-
hip. Here,/logicalortext.1ni=1(fi)notatesf1∨f2∨...∨fn. Thus, the formulae/logicalortext.1ni=1(fi)⇒f/primeandf/prime⇒/logicalortext.1ni=1(fi)need to be true. For the first
formula,wecanrepresentitastheCNFandgettheresultingfor-
mula/logicalandtext.1ni=1(¬fi∨f/prime)to betrue. Note that for an indexed set of
propositions P={p1,...,pn},/logicalandtext.1ni=1(pi)means that each propo-
sition in Pn e e d st ob etrue. Thus, we can get nderived linear
inequalities that are listed in the inequality (7). For the second
formulaf/prime⇒/logicalortext.1n
i=1(fi),w eg e t¬f/prime∨/logicalortext.1ni=1(fi)to betrue, that is
¬f/prime∨f1∨...∨fnto be true. So the inequality (8) can be deduced
from the second formula. /squareLemma3.4. Iffeatures f1...fnaretheAlternativesubfeatureof
featuref/prime, the linear inequalities for this relationship are
∀i∈{1,...,n},|fi|−|f/prime|≤0 (9)
/summationdisplay.1n
i=1|fi|−|f/prime|≥0 (10)
/summationdisplay.1n
i=1|fi|≤1 (11)
Proof.Essentially, alternative subfeatures are a special type of
orfeatures. In the subfeatures of an orrelationship, at least one
subfeature needs to be selected. Whereas, only and exactly one
needs to be selected in the alternative subfeatures. Instead of using
inequalitiesc(9)–c(11)inTable1,theconciseinequality(11)isused
to assure the exclusiveness of all subfeatures. /square
Except the above 4 types of TCs, there are 3 types of CTCs. The
requirement off/primeforfcanbeformulated as f⇒f/prime,andwe can
deduce|f/prime|−|f|≥0 according to Lemma 3.1. Similarly, the iff
relationship between f/primeandfis formulated as f⇔f/prime, and we
can deduce |f/prime|−|f|=0 according to Lemma 3.2. Last, we have
the last type of CTCs:
Lemma 3.5. If feature fExcludes feature f/prime, the linear equality
for the Exclusion relationship is
|f/prime|+|f|≤1 (12)
Proof.f⇒¬f/primeistrueaccording to the exclusion relationship.
Thus we can infer ¬f∨¬f/primeistrue. As a CNF, it can be converted
to(1−|f|)+(1−|f/prime|) ≥1, that is |f/prime|+|f|≤1. /square
3.3 The MOIP Model of Our Example
Let/vecxbe a solution, a binary variable vector /vecx∈{0,1}nwhere
variablexidenotes|fi|.Foreachfeature fi,wedenoteitsattribu-
tesUsed(fi),Defect(fi)andCost(fi)as coefficient ai,biandci,
respectively. We denote the objective function for objjasFj(/vecx),
j∈{1,...,k}. Subject to the converted linear inequalities, the ex-
ample is formulated as a multi-objective BIP (MOBIP) problem:
MinF2(/vecx)=/summationtext.1n
i=1(1−xi)
MinF3(/vecx)=/summationtext.1ni=1(ai·xi)
MinF4(/vecx)=/summationtext.1ni=1(bi·xi)
MinF5(/vecx)=/summationtext.1ni=1(ci·xi)
s.t. the inequalities for conj(M)hold(13)
4ϵ-CONSTRAINT METHOD AND CWMOIP
When the problem size is relatively small, the ϵ-constraint method
andCWMOIParetwofeasiblemethodstofindthecompletenon-
dominated solutions (a.k.a., true Pareto front).
4.1ϵ-constraint Method
Theidea istomake k−1objectivesas therangeconstraints and
use thek-th one as the objective function in BIP [ 17]. Asobj1is
correctness,inBIP,alltheconstraintsaresatisfied, obj1isalways
0 in theory and thus F1(/vecx)is not needed. So F2(/vecx),F3(/vecx),F4(/vecx)
can be converted to range constraints. Each range constraint’s
upper bound will be iterated from 0 to the upper bound of the
corresponding objective, by step size 1.
The detailed procedures are shown in Algorithm 1. Note that
дetObjTheoBound (M,F2)at line 2 finds the theoretic upper bound

Algorithm 1 is of the time complexity of O(n3), if considering
BIP solving function bintproд()takes constant time — a time limit
is set in its practical usage. Solving the MOBIP problem in formula
(13) is reduced to solving the BIP problem in formula (14) by many
times — a number of (n+1)(/summationtext.1n
i=1ai+1)(/summationtext.1ni=1bi+1)times.
4.2 CWMOIP
CWMOIP,proposedbyÖzlen etal.[37],isanobjective-reduction
technique for MOIP. CWMOIPis for generating allnon-dominated
solutions. It improves the ϵ-constraint method by two steps: (1) for
eachobjective,thelowerboundisnot0andtheupperboundisnot
thesumoffeatureattributesrevelenttothatobjective.Tobeprecise,
BIP is applied to get the true lower and upper bounds for eachobjective (i.e.,
F2toF5) separately, subject to the conjunction of
constraints conj(M). (2) objective-reduction is implemented via the
constraintweightmethod,toavoidgeneratingdominatedsolutions.
Thek-objective problem isfirst reduced to that of k−1, thenk−2,
iteratively, until the last objective.Examplefor(1).

Figure 2: An example of applying CWMOIP for a bi-obj problem
Examplefor (2). Fig. 2 shows an example for objective-reduction.
Solving the bi-objective problem in formula (15) isreduced to sol-
vingthe1-objectiveprobleminformula(16)by l2times.Itisnamed
"constraint weighted" because of the weight w2and the constraint
f2(x)≤l2. Variable l2iterates from the lower bound fLB
2to the
upper bound fUB
2off2(x).
In Algorithm 2, we show the general steps of finding all non-
dominatedsolutionsforanygiven k-objectiveBIPproblem[ 37](not
limitedtothemodelofourproblem).TheinitialinvocationofAl-
gorithm 2 is calling CWMOIP (k,fUB
k,X), and then CWMOIP (k−
1,lk,X)at line 11, recursively, until calling CWMOIP (1,l2,X). Ini-
tially, lines 2 to 4 calculate the true upper and lower bounds ofthe 2-nd objective to the
k-th, subject to the constraint set X(In
practice, this can be done once and results are cached for reuse).
Thenwkis calculated for the k-th objective at line 5. In the loop at
line 8, the k-objective problem is reduced to a new (k-1)-objective
problem(line11),whichhasthenewsuffix wk·fk(/vecx)fortheob-

5 OUR SOLUTION — SOLREP
Theoptimalfeatureselectionproblemisessentiallyacombinato-
rialproblem.Moreoftenthannot,thenumberofnon-dominated
solutions grows exponentially along the number of features and
objectives. Given its NP-hardness, it is neither practical nor neces-
sarytofindtheentiretrueParetofront[ 25].Instead,obtaininga
set of solutions that evenly distributed over the true Pareto front is
representative, pragmatic and computationally referrable.
The normal constraint (NC) method [ 32] is an effective method
intheliteraturethatguaranteesgeneratingevenlydistributedsolu-
tionsovertheentireParetofront.ThemainideaofNCmethodis
tousethe utopiaplane toapproximatethetrueParetofrontsuch
that a set of evenly distributed reference points on utopia plane
wouldresulttoasetofevenlydistributedsolutionsonParetofront,
after theprojection alongthe normalvector of utopia plane. Here,
utopia plane refers to the hyper plane determined by all the anchor
points, each of which individually optimizes a single objective (e.g.
y∗
1fory1-axisand y∗
2fory2-axisinFig3.a).However,theoriginal
NC method was developed on continuous solution space. In the
case of IP, it can generate dominated solutions (see Fig 3.a) where
point A is a solution generated by NC, but there exists a point B
outsidetheshadedfeasibleregion,dominatingA.So,weproposeto
combine the idea of utopia plane and theϵ-constraint method such
that all solutions are guaranteed to be non-dominated (see Fig 3.c).
Our proposed method consists of four main steps: 1) determine
theutopiaplane;2)generateuniformlydistributedreferencepoints
on the utopia plane; 3) for each reference point, use its (k−1)
coordinates to constrain the (k−1)objectives; 4) optimize the k-th
objectivewithinthereducedsolutionspace.Repeatsteps2)to4)to
achieve the representative Pareto front. In step 2), we resort to the
hit-and-run (H&R) method [ 44] to sample the reference points. Its
principle is straightforward: let ptdenote the current point then
pt+1=pt+λ∗disthenextpoint,where disarandomdirection
vector and λis therandom lengthof thejump. Asa random-walkAlgorithm 3: Function SolRep()fork-objective IP

algorithm, H&R is proven to generate uniformly distributed points
inside any polyhedron after a sufficient number of runs [44].
Note that anobvious alternative is to equally dividethe Pareto
front along each objective direction and then traverse each grid.
However,itmightnotevenlycuttheParetofrontandthecomputa-
tional efforts grow exponentially along the number of objectives.

sourcetoolofIBED[ 50].WeimplementtheseMOIPmethodsinthe

dominated solutions?
RQ4.Onmedium-to-largesystems,canSolRepfindnon-dominated
solutions that are evenly-distributed ?
RQ5.On large industrial systems, is SolRep scalable?
6.1 Setup
6.1.1 Baseline Tools. Sayyadet.al[40,42] reported that IBEA
implemented in jMetal shows best results for the optimal feature
selection.Recently,accordingto[ 50],onmostsystems(except eCos),
IBED finds more non-dominated solutions than IBEA in similar
time.IBEAandIBEDrepresentthe-state-of-artapproachesandthey
are publicly available. So, we choose them as the baseline tools.
6.1.2 Baseline Tools Configurations. We adopt the version of
IBEA and IBED that produce the best results according to [ 45][50]
— actually the same enhancement for them, namely IBEDF+
PandIBEAF+P. HereF+Prefers to the configuration that
enablesfeedback-directedmechanism[ 45]andpreprocessingfor
core feature encoding [19].
6.1.3 ParameterSettings. FortheF+PversionofEAs,according
to [45][50], the best setting of error mutation probability, mutation
probability, and crossover probability are 1.0, 0.0000001, and 0.1
respectively. For SPLOT systems in Table 2, 25000 evaluations are
used for IBEA and IBED. For larger LVAT systems, 100000 evalu-
ationsareusedforbothEAs.Foranymodel,wegenerate10sets
of attributes. For each set, we run each EA repeatedly for 30 times
and use their union to compare with SolRep. Besides, the medium
execution (the medium values of metrics) is compared with Sol-
Rep using 50 reference points. All other parameter settings for EAs
are default settings of jMetal (e.g., population size is set to 100)
are same as those used in [42][40][45][50].
In MOIP methods, one common parameter is needed — time
limitedforfunction bintproд.Wesetitas0.1sforallsystemexcept
forLinuxX86 (10sforthissystemduetoitshugenumberofcon-
straints). The setting for reference point number in SolRep is 1000
for SPLOT systems and 1500 for LVAT.
The experiments were performed on an Intel Core I7 4710HQ
CPU with 8 GB RAM, running on Windows 8.1.
6.1.4 QualityIndicators. TomeasurethequalityofParetofront,
we adopt four indicators in this work: percentage of correctness,
hypervolume[ 54],spread[ 11]andParetodominance.Weareusing
the same parameter setting (including objectives, cost values, etc.)
and indicators as those in the earliest paper [ 42] on this topic.
Currently,wearecomparingHV,spreadandtime,andusingthe
median value of 30 runs.
a)Percentage of Correctness (%Cor):ForMOEAs,notallso-
lutions are correct, as correctness is an objective evolving

solutions inside indicates its quality.
b)Hypervolume (HV) : Hypervolume of the solution set Sis
the volume of the region that is dominated by Sin the ob-
jective space. In jMetal, the Pareto front with a higher HV
is preferred.
c)Spread (SP) :Spreadisusedtomeasuretheextendofspread

d)Num. of Pareto non-dominance : On the same set of fea-
ture attribute values, we can approximate the true Pareto

front, we count the non-dominated solutions.
6.2 Evaluation Systems
6.2.1 System Selection. Feature models of different systems are
used in experiments. Table 2 shows repository name (Repo.), the
model’ssystemname(Sys.),numberoffeatures(Fea.),numberof
constraints (Cons.), and relevant literatures (Ref.).
ThreemodelsarefromSPLOT,arepositoryusedbymanyresear-
chersasabenchmark[ 31].JCSmodelistherunningexampleofthe
paper.Web Portal model captures the configurations of Web portal
productline,and E-ShopmodelcapturesaB2Csystemwithfixed
pricedproducts.Industrialsystems’modelsfromtheLinuxVariabi-
lity Analysis Tools (LVAT) repository [ 1] are used. LVAT’s models
(e.g.,LinuxX86 )havemuchmorefeaturesandconstraints.Allthese
models are chosen to facilitate the comparison with [42][45][50].
6.2.2 Feature Attribute. Each feature in each model has the
following attributes, which are identical to attributes used in [42]:
1.Cost∈R,records thepriceincurredtoinclude thefeature.For
eachfeature,the Costvalueisassignedwitharealnumber
that is normally distributed between 5.0 and 15.0.
2.Used_Before ∈{true,false}, records whether this feature was
usedbefore— truefor“yes”and falsefor“no”.Used_Before
values are uniformly distributed for features.
3.Defects∈Z, records the number of defects in the feature. For
each feature, the Defectsvalue is assigned with an integer
value normally distributed between 0 and 10.

6.3.1 RQ1—Solution Set Completeness on Small Systems. As

del,wecanalwaysfind |A|=|B|=|NA∪NB|,whichmeanstheyfound
exactlysamesolutions.Asthecompletenessofthe ϵ-constraintand
CWMOIPhasbeenprovenin[ 17][37],weconfirmthisbytheexpe-
riments. Comparing CWMOIP with IBED in Table 4, we see IBED
cannotfindallnon-dominatedsolutionswith30executionsin most cases
(exceptJCS2that has only 9 non-dominated solu-
tions). In most cases, IBED’s results are unsatisfactory, covering
averagelyabout70%ofthetrueParetofronton4attributesetsof
JCS,andabout20%ofthetrueParetofronton WebPortal.Also,we
find|NA∪NB|=|A|, which proves the completeness of |A|.
6.3.2 RQ2—PerformanceonSmallSystems. InTable4,wecan
see that it takes averagely about 5s for ϵ-constraint method and
1.5sforCWMOIPon4attributesetsof JCS,andaveragelyabout
613s forϵ-constraint method and 218s for CWMOIP on 4 attribute
sets ofWeb Portal. In contrast, one medium execution of IBED (i.e.,
the one with the medium size of |A|in 30 executions) on JCS 1
takes about 4.5s to find 17 correct solutions. Actually, on JCS 1,3 0
executions just brings several more solutions than 1 executions, as
the search space is small and EAs can converge fast. Similarly, one
medium execution of IBED on Web Portal 1 takes about 5.4s to find
35correctsolutions,while30executionsjustproduce232correct
solutions, as many executions also share solutions.
In theory, the ϵ-constraint and CWMOIP both have exponential
timecomplexity(§4).InTable3and4,experimentalresultsconfirmthat —
from12 features(JCS )to 43features (Web Portal ),the
time ofϵ-constraint and CWMOIP increases by at least 100-
fold,respectively .WerunCWMOIPonanyattributesetof E-Shop
(290 features), and in 6 hours it cannot finish.
To make MOIP methods scalable and effective, we propose Sol-
Rep and evaluate this method in the following subsections.
6.3.3 RQ3—Richness and Non-dominance Solutions Found by
SolRep.In Table 5 and 6, the richness of solutions refers to the
number of unique solutions found only by one method, namely|NU
A|or|NU
B|. The larger |NU
A|is than|NU
B|, solution set Ahave
better richness than B. In Table 5, we observe in most cases, Sol-
Repfindssignificantlymorenon-dominatedsolutionsthanIBED, except on JCS 2andE-Shop 2
.OnJCS2,IBEDfindsall9
non-dominatedsolutionsbecauseofthesmallsearchspace,butSol-
Rep fails to find all based on reference points method. On E-Shop 2,
SolRepfindslesssolutionsthanIBED,asonly742feasiblesolutions
are found among 1000 reference points of the solution space — the
trueParetoFrontisnotcontinuous,andon258pointsnofeasible
solutionsarefoundbyIP. If relaxing the number of reference
points to 1500, still on E-Shop 2, SolRep takes 123s to find
1099non-dominatedsolutions , more than IBED’s 825 solutions
in 201s. In Table 6, only results on system eCosare reported, where
IBEAshowedbetter resultsthanIBED[ 50].AsPareto-dominance
relationistransitive,andcaseswhereIBEAfindslessthanIBEDarenot necessary to be shown. SolRep also finds more non-dominated
solutionsthanIBEAon eCos.Hence,richnessofsolutionsfoundby
SolRep is better than IBED and IBEA.
Regardingthenon-dominanceofsolutionsfoundbySolRep,we
observethat |A|=|A∩B|+|NU
A|for all cases in Table 5 and 6 .
Therationaleisthatifsolutionsin Aareallnon-dominated,after
dominance-sorting for AandB, its solutions in Awill be inside the

onLinux X86, most solutions of IBED are dominated by SolRep’s.

no worse than IBED in terms of even-distribution. From E-Shop
onwards, the two methods share no commonly-found solutions.
OnE-Shop, eCosanduClinux,SolRep’sHV,SPand#unique
non-dominated solutions are all clearly better than IBED’s.
OnLinuxX86,wefindthat:SolRephasmuchbetterHV(0.33)
than IBED’s HV (0.09 on average for two attribute sets), most of
IBEDsolutionsaredominatedbySolRep( |B|/greatermuch|NU

IBED’sSP(above1.0)isevenhigherthanSolRep’s(0.7-0.8)—im-
plying the distance between IBED’s solutions is wider than that of
SolRep’s solutions. Considering the quite few number of IBED’s
solutions ( |NU
B|is only 28 and 11), it is reasonable. If IBED could
findmorenon-dominatedsolutionsnearthecurrentones,SPwould
decrease.HighSP(wide-distance)ofIBEDsolutionsisattributed
to DE operators used in the dual-population evolution [50].
6.3.5 RQ5—Scalability of SolRep. As shown in Table 5, Sol-
Repisfastonmostsystems,except LinuxX86.Wefindbothfeature
number and constraint number (more important) affect the execu-
tiontimeof SolRep.OnthreesystemsfromSPLOT,atmost72s(on
E-Shop 2) is needed with 1000 reference points (RPs). On LVAT mo-
delsusing 1500RPs, theexecution timeis within131s for uClinux
andwithin310sfor eCos.Moretimeisneededfor eCosthanuClinux,
aseCoshas3146constraintsand uClinuxhas2468. InTable5and
6,SolReptakeslesstimethanexecutingIBED30times,butfind more non-dominated solutions in most cases.
We study how the number of RPs affects the execution time.
ForLinux X86 1 ,calculatingutopiaplatetakes550sandsolvingthe
1500RFstakes49864s.InFig.4,itshows thetimecomplexityand
the solution number increase linearly with the number of RPs. The
timeforcalculatinganon-dominatedsolution(accordingtoaRP)
isfixedonacertainsystem.Thereasonisthetimecomplexityof
Algorithm 3 is O(n), if time limit for IP solving is set.
As 30 executions of EAs may share common solutions, we com-
pareSolRepusing50RPswiththemediumexecutionofIBED,in
terms of time and solution number. On Linux X86 1, SolRep using
50 RPs finds 50 non-dominated solutions in 2150s. It is better than
themediumexecutionofIBEDwith3seeds(among30executions),which takes 2534s to find 24 correct solutions (only 4 are non-
dominated). On uClinux 1, SolRep using 50 RPs finds 49 solutions
in 6s, while IBED (the medium execution) finds 67 non-dominated
solutionsin43s.On eCos1,SolRepusing50RPsfind48solutions
in11s, andIBED (themedium execution)finds42 non-dominated
solutions in 48s. Hence, on LVAT systems, SolRep using 50
RPs finds more non-dominated solutions than the mediumexecution of IBED, using similar or less time.
Summary.
Onsmallsystems,CWMOIPcanfindallnon-dominated
solutions — assuring the solution completeness. On medium-to-
large systems, SolRep is scalable — no matter compared with EA’s
30-executions union or only the medium execution, in most cases
SolRep finds more non-dominated solutions than IBED and IBEA,
withsimilarorlesstime.Hence,MOIPmethodsareeffectiveand
provide a new perspective on solving linear-constrained linear-
objective MOO problems.

of attributes for each model. Due to the page limit, we just report 2
or 4 representative attribute sets in the evaluation. According to
[50] and our observation, impact of attribute values is minor to the
results — if on two sets of attributes a method is better; then in
general(likeontensets)thismethodisbetter.Thesecondthreat
is about the systems chosen. In future, the EC2feature model [ 13]
and theDrupalmodel [39] needto beevaluated. The lastthreat is
about the parameters of the EAs used as baseline tools. The best
parameter setting of IBED (and also IBEA) reported by [ 50] is used.
MOIP or IBEA with Constraint Solving, or Others? In this
study, we discuss the general theme — whether methods other
than MOEAs could be applied to this SBSE problem. As illustra-ted in §6, we show that SolRep, the IP method, has been proven
tobecapableforthisoptimalfeatureselectionproblem.Onlarge
systems, SolRep takes similar time and finds significantly more
non-dominated solutions than IBEA or IBED alone.
The next step is to conduct the detailed comparison on Sol-
RepandtheIBEAwithconstraintsolving(i.e.,SATIBEA[ 18]and
SMTIBEA [ 14]). However, as IP-methods and IBEA with constraint
solvingaredesignedfordifferentpurposes,weneedtobecarefulin
selecting the evaluation metrics — IP-methods are designed for fin-
ding more non-dominated solutions that are as evenly-distributed
as possible, while IBEAwith constraint solving is designed touse
SAT-orSMT-basedrepairingoperatortofindmorevalidsolutions.
Valid solutions are not necessary (in most case, they are not) to
be global optimal (i.e., non-dominated by any other solutions insolution space). Now, we are working on finding proper metrics
and setting up the benchmark to compare them fairly.
Actually,apartfromMOEA-basedandIP-basedapproaches,ot-
her attempts have been made to resolve the MOO problems in the
SBSE.Inrecenttwoyears,therearethreepioneerstudiesonthis
directions. Zuluaga et al.[55] proposed the ϵ-Pareto Active Lear-
ning (ϵ-PAL). Krall et al.[26] propose GALE which is a near-linear
timeMOEA.Chen etal.[34]proposeSWAY(SamplyingWAY)to
finds(near)optimalsolutionsbysampling.Noneoftheabovethree
systems have received much attention from SE community. To our
best knowledge, none of these approaches have been applied to
thisoptimalfeatureselectionproblem.Hence,themessageofusingapproaches other than MOEAs is still unheard in SE. It will be inte-
restingtoconductathroughoutempiricalstudyoninvestigating
eachapproach’smeritsanddrawbacksinsolvingtheSBSEproblem.
TheTheoreticLimitationofSolRep. Asexplainedin§1,MOEA-
basedapproaches,asaheuristicandnon-deterministicalgorithm,
face the four drawbacks on algorithm convergence, solution set
completeness,theglobaloptimalityofsolutions,andthesolution
set diversity (or evenly-distributiveness). In contrast, SolRep, as a
analytic and mostly-deterministic algorithm, in theory, does nothave the problem of algorithm convergence, and the global opti-mality of solutions. For solution set completeness, SolRep is not
designed for solution set completeness ( ϵ-constraint and CWMOIP
are designed for this goal on small systems). Currently, the solu-tion set diversity of SolRep is guaranteed by random sampling
and random-walkmechanisms. Thetime complexityof SolRep is
O(n)(see Algorithm 3, Fig. 4 and §6.3.5), as long as the time for
one time IP solving in Cplex has a constant upper-limit. Hence,
SolRep is a mostly-deterministic algorithm, as it resorts to random
sampling.Thetheoreticlimitof SolRepisthatitmayfailifmostnon-dominated solutions are gathered in a small zone and H&R
method cannot hit that zone. However, we did not find this case in
our evaluated systems.Generalityof SolRep.
TheimportantassumptionofapplyingSol-
Repisthatalltheconstraintsandobjectivesneedtobelinear.This
assumption might narrow the application of SolRep in SBSE dom-
ain,sincemanyreal-worldMOOproblemsinSBSEhavenon-linearobjectives, e.g., the optimal refactoring step problem [
33]. Still, one
directapplicationof SolRepisfeasible.Previously,Zhang etal.[51]
propose a novel approach to time-aware test-case prioritizationusing IP. As in [
51], the total time for selected test cases is the
constraint, and the objective is to maximize the number of covered
statementsofselectedtestcases.Essentially, theoptimaltestcase
priorityproblemcanbereducedtoaproblemsimilartotheoptimal
feature selection — one linear objective to minimize the number of
selected test cases, one linear objective to minimizethe total time
for selected test cases, and one linear objective to maximize the
number of covered statements of selected test cases.
8 RELATED WORK
The Optimal Feature Selection Problem. Whiteet al.[48] first
modeledthefeatureselectionproblemasaMultidimensionalMulti-
Choice Knapsack Problem (MMKP), and applied Filtered Cartesian
Flattening (FCF) to derive an optimal feature configuration subject
to resource constraints. Guo et al.[15] first proposed a genetic
algorithm (GA) approach to tackle this problem. In [ 15], a repair
operator is used to fix each candidate solution, and make it comply
withthefeaturemodelduringevolution.Onelimitationof[ 15]is
aggregating all objectives into a single objective by weight.
To address the objective aggregation issue, Sayyad et al.[40,42]
first proposed to apply various MOEAs, and a range of optimal so-
lutions (a.k.a., a Pareto front) is returned to the user as a result. As
reported, IBEA [ 52] yields the best results among the seven tested
EAs in terms of time, correctness and satisfaction to user preferen-
ces.In[41],theyfurtherusedstaticmethodtoprunefeaturesbefore
execution of IBEA for reducing search space. They also introduced
a “seeding method” by pre-computing a correct solution, which
was later implanted the initial population of IBEA. Along this line,
Tanet al.[45] improved these previous studies by using a novel
feedback-directedmechanismtoexistingEAs.Similarly,toimprove
the correctness, Hierons et al.[19] proposed the 1 +napproach
thatprioritizesthenumberoffailedconstraintsandconsidersthe
correctness objective first.
Recently,IBEA(includingitsvariants)isintegratedwithother
techniquesforachievingbetterresults.Henard etal.[18]integrated
IBEAwithconstraintsolving.TheypermuteddifferentSATpara-
meters to maximize thediversity of SAT solutions in a cheap waybycallingSATsolver hundredsoftimes.Similarly,alongthisline,
Guoetal.[14]proposedtocombine(IBEA)withthesatisfiability
modulo theories (SMT) solving. Xue et al.[50] integrated IBEA
with differential evolution (DE) for achieving both correctness and
diversity of solutions.
In comparison, many non-dominated solutions found by Sol-
Repcanbeusefulinpractice,asonenon-dominatedsolutioncan
dominate many solutions found by other approaches. Furthermore,
SolRep allows exploration of the entire solution space, which is
difficult to realize by MOEAs.
