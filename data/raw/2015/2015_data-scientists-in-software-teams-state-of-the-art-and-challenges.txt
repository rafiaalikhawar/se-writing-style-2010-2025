itydataisrapidlyincreasinginsoftwareindustry.Datascientists
are becoming popular within software teams. For example, Face-
book, LinkedIn and Microsoft are creating a new career path for
datascientists.Inthispaper,wepresentalarge-scalesurveywith
793 professional data scientists at Microsoft to understand their
educational background, problem topics that they work on, tool
usages, and activities. We cluster these data scientists based on the

data scientists and their corresponding characteristics. We also dis-
cuss the challenges that they face and the best practices they share

Software teams increasingly analyze data to inform their engineer-
ing and business decisions andto build data solutions that deploy
data in software products. The people behind the data gathering
and analysis are called data scientists, a term coined by DJ Patiland Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008 to define their jobs at LinkedIn
andFacebook.Themissionofadatascientististotransformdata
into insights that guide the teams actions. Previous studies on datascientists in software teams are based on a relatively small number
of people, and therefore do not provide a broader perspective on
data science work.

with793professionaldatascientistsatMicrosoft.Thesurveycovers
theirskills, toolusage, challenges,and bestpractices. Therespon-
dents include both people who work as a full-time data scientist
(38%), as well as those who do data science while working as soft-
ware engineers (24%), program managers (18%), and other job roles
(20%). Our research questions cover the following in the context of
Microsoft data scientists:
RQ1.Whatisthedemographicandeducationalback-ground
of data scientists at Microsoft?
RQ2.How do data scientists work? What tasks do they work
on,howdotheyspendthetime,andwhattoolsdotheyuse?
RQ3.Whatchallengesdodatascientistsface?Whatarebest
practices and advice to overcome the challenges?
RQ4.How do data scientists increase confidence about the
quality of their work?

Data scientists spend a significant amount of time querying
data; building platforms for instrumentation; cleaning, merging,
andshapingdata;andanalyzingdatawithstatisticsandmachine
learning.Duringtheseactivities,poordataquality,missingorde-

rectness of their work, more structured processes and tool support
are needed for validating data science work.
