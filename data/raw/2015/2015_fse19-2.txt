ABSTRACT
Engineering modern large-scale software requires software devel-
opers to not solely focus on writing code, but also to continuously
examine monitoring data to reason about the dynamic behavior
oftheirsystems.Theseadditionalmonitoringresponsibilitiesfor
developers have only emerged recently, in the light of DevOps cul-
ture. Interestingly, software development activities happen mainly
in the IDE, while reasoning about production monitoring happens
in separate monitoring tools. We propose an approach that inte-
gratesmonitoringsignalsintothedevelopmentenvironmentand
worklow.WeconjecturethatanIDEwithsuchcapabilityimproves
the performance of developers as time spent continuously context
switchingfromdevelopmenttomonitoringwouldbeeliminated.
This paper takes a irst step towards understanding the beneits of
a possible Monitoring-Aware IDE. We implemented a prototype
ofaMonitoring-Aware IDE,connectedtothe monitoringsystems
of Adyen, a large-scale payment company that performs intense
monitoring in their software systems. Given our results, we irmly
believethatMonitoring-AwareIDEscanplayanessentialrolein
improvinghowdevelopers perform monitoring.

Monitoring provides information about the runtime behavior of
software in the form of logs and has been used to understand
large-scale systems in production. The analysis of logs is a wide-
spread practice that has been studied in many diferent contexts.
By leveraging log data, researchers were able to help develop-
ment teams with process mining [ 15,29,53], anomaly detection
[9,24,28,60,61],passivelearning[ 57],faultlocalization[ 58,65],
invariant inference [ 10], performance diagnosis [ 33,40,49,50,64],
onlinetrace checking [ 5], andbehavioural analysis[ 4,43,62].
However, understanding runtime behavior of deployed software
isanactivitythathasbeenclassicallyassociatedwithoperations
engineers. In recent years, practices and culture of development
andoperationshaveevolvedtounifytheirresponsibilities(often
referred to as DevOps). Teams no longer solely focus on either
development or operations; rather, these responsibilities are more
and more intertwined and uniied [ 6,21,46]. Monitoring is one
fundamentalactivityinthiscongregationthatenablesarealuni-
ication of both sides. Developers see the analysis of monitoring
information aspart oftheir primary responsibilities, and perform
itseamlesslywiththeirdevelopmenttasks.
Interestingly, monitoring mainly happens in monitoring tools
(e.g.,Kibana),whereassoftwaredevelopmentmainlyhappensinan
Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The current situation
leadstoincreasedcontext-switching[ 18]andsplitattentionefects
that increase cognitive load [ 13]. If developers have to leave the
IDE to do some other development-related task, then, one might
say that the integrateddevelopmentenvironment has failed.
Monitoring-Aware IDEs. We propose to integrate operational
aspects into the worklow and context of software development
tasksbydevelopingtheconceptofMonitoring-AwareIDEs.IfIDEs
were to provide seamless support for monitoring activities, we
hypothesize that developers would better perform development
tasks, such as understanding the reason of a bug, or how a new
deployedversionbehaves inproduction.
To validate the proposal, we implemented a prototype for a
Monitoring-AwareIDEand integrateditintotheworklow of12
developers from 7 diferent teams, and evaluated it in a one-month
ieldexperimentatAdyen,alarge-scalepaymentcompanywhich
produces around 40 billion lines of log data per month. Adyen

Our results indicate that Monitoring-Aware IDEs can provide
essential beneits in modern large-scale software development. De-
velopersmaderepeateduseof themonitoringfeaturestoperform

Monitoring tools in industry. Thereareavastamountofmon-
itoring tools that have originated in industry. Most tools display
metrics (often extracted from information in logs) in dashboards
that are customizable in diferent dimensions ( e.g., visualization,
groupings, alerts) and are searchable. Probably the most promi-
nentopen-sourcetoolchaininthecontextofmonitoringistheELK
stack1(ElasticSearch,Logstash,Kibana)wherelogsfromdistributed
services are collected by Logstash, stored on ElasticSearch, and vi-
sualized in Kibana. Another well-known open-source dashboard
is Grafana2, that is mostly used to display time series for infras-
tructure and application metrics with an extensible plugin system.
Commercial counterparts to these services include, for instance,
Splunk3,Loggly4,DataDog5,andmanymore.Thecritiquetothe
commondashboardsolutionsincurrentpracticeisthattheamount
of diferent, seemingly unrelated, graphs is overwhelming and it is
hardto come to actionableinsights[ 16].
Logginganalysisandvisualization. Log data is vastly rich, and
thus,severalanalysis techniques have been proposed.Aiming at
failuredetection,Reidemeisteretal.[ 44],basedonpreviouslogs,
trainadecisiontreetodetectrecurrentfailures.Similarly,Fronzaet
al.[23]usesSVM,Linetal.[ 36]useclusteringalgorithms,andBose
andvanderAalst[ 12]exploitassociativeruleminingtodiscover
failure patterns in event logs. While the above techniques are good
indetectingpreviouslyknownfailures,othersfocusondetecting
anomalies (i.e., failures not seen before). Clustering algorithms are
commonly usedfor such [ 34,36].
Logs are also used to build models of the software system. Tools
suchasSynoptic[ 10]andDFASAT[ 30,57]deviseinitestatema-
chines thatrepresenta software, basedon itslogs.And giventhat
logs are often ordered in a timely manner, related work also has
exploredtemporal invariantinference [ 10,41].
Finally, given that logs are often not easy to be understood as
theyare,visualizationsthataimtosupportreasoningofruntime

2.2 Monitoring andDevOps

provides services for more than 4,500 companies all around the
world. Adyen had a transaction volume of $120 billion dollars in
2017.
Thedistributedsoftware systemsthatruntheir entirebusiness
produced around 40 billion log lines solely in July 2018. Due to
their scale and sensitive business market, monitoring is a vital
activity at Adyen. Adyen follows DevOps practices as part of their
culture, and the barriers between development and production
havebeengettingsmallerandsmallerovertheyears.Developers
of all teams are responsible for the monitoring of their systems
and are supported by a dedicated monitoring application, whose
focusistobuildanycustomizationateammightneedtoconduct
better monitoring. Thus, at Adyen, monitoring is a vital task for all
developers.
Due to their eforts on monitoring over the last years, we irmly
believe that Adyen ofers an exemplary place for software engi-
neering researchers to study (and evolve) monitoring and DevOps
practices. And for this research, more speciically, to study the
beneitsofMonitoring-Aware IDEs.

3 MONITORING-AWARE IDES
In modern teams following a DevOps model, developers goback
and forth between monitoring data and the source code to
reason about their software systems . Even with the current
state-of-the-art monitoring and IDE/development tools, developers
still struggle with connecting the two worlds. The current situa-
tionleadstoincreasedcontext-switching[ 18]andsplitattention
efects[13]that increasecognitive load.
We theorize that, for developers to be better equipped to deal
withmonitoringandDevOpspractices, IDEsand monitoringsys-
temsshouldbeconnected(givingrisetowhatwewillcall, Monitoring-
Aware IDEs ). A Monitoring-Aware IDE provides developers with
an integrated view of both the implementation of their software
systemsandmonitoringinformation.
Developers need not to go out of their IDEs to know whether
anexceptionthattheyjustdecidedtothrowhappenedtentimes
inthelastweek,orthatthetimebetweentwologstatementshas
beenincreasing continually.Basedon whatweobserve atAdyen,
we conjecture that such an IDE would:
(1)Assistdevelopersinmonitoringtheirnewfeaturesandre-
leasedeploymentsand,asaconsequence,providethemwith
enoughinformationtoidentifybugsandperformanceissues,
(2)Assistdevelopersinusinglogdatatounderstandthebusi-
nessprocessofsoftware systems,and
(3)Assistdevelopersinmaintainingloggingcode,suchasex-
tending orremovinglogstatements from the sourcecode.
Toachievethisgoal,weproposethataMonitoring-AwareIDE
musthave the following characteristics:
(1)Timely Integrated Feedback: Monitoring data, e.g., how
oftenalogstatementoranexceptionhappensinproduction,
should be timely available at the Monitoring-Aware IDE, so
that developers can make data-driven decisions based on
themostrecentdata(andwithouttheneedofopeningthe
monitoringsystemfor that),
(2)Traceability: Thereshouldbeadirectconnection/linkbe-
tweenthemonitoringinformationandthesourcecode,in
caseonetooldoesnotcontaintherequiredinformationat
that moment. The source ofmonitoring information ( e.g.,a
log statement or an exception) can be found based on moni-
toringinformation,andmonitoringinformationcanbefound
basedonits source.
(3)SearchCapability: Monitoringinformationshouldbesearch-
able inthe IDE, e.g., the classes with the highest number of
exceptions.
void  method() {
  // ...
  log.error("error occurred " + var);

4 MONITORING-AWARE IDEPROTOTYPE
Toempiricallystudyourproposal,webuiltaprototypeofaMonitoring-
Aware IDE. We setthe following goalsfor the prototype:
(1)it should deliver enough value to Adyen developers, so that
they wouldbeneitfrom this study,
(2)tobeasnon-obtrusiveaspossibletoAdyendevelopers,so
that theywouldnot feel the burden ofusing an łunknownž
tool,
(3)todeliverenough features sothat we,asresearchers, could
empirically validate our Monitoring-Aware IDEs proposal.
We highlight the fact that this tool was also developed inside
in partnership withAdyen, incorporating iterative feedback (from
FebruarytoJune2018).Throughoutitsivemonthsofdevelopment,
our prototype received feedback from several Adyen developers
afterbetaversions.Theirstthreeauthorsofthepaperdiscussed
all their suggestions and whether they were useful or essential
fortheprototype.Inthispaper,wereporttheinalversionofthe
prototype.
Ourtoolcollectsmonitoringdatathatiscurrentlyavailablein

whichgivesnearreal-timeinformation.Wetracebacktheorigin
of a log message to its original log statement in the source code
usingheuristics(Adyendoesnotlogclassnameandlinenumber
that originates the message due to performance reasons). More
speciically, we generate regular expressions based on every log
statement of the source code and matched them against the log
message that comes from the monitoring system, following Xu’s et
al. work [ 61]. We observed that the link, asalsoreported byXu et
al., indeed happens with high accuracy (97% after an evaluation in
100klogmessages),whichimpliesthatourtoolisaccuratelyableto

themonitoringinformationinsideIntelliJ,theJavaIDEthatisusedMonitoring-Aware IDEs ESEC/FSE ’19, August 26–30, 2019,Tallinn,Estonia

5 FIELD EXPERIMENT
Intheremainderofthispaper,wetaketheirststeptowards empiri-
callyunderstandingthevalueofMonitoring-AwareIDEs we
posed in the previous section. To that aim, we propose three re-
searchquestions:
RQ1.HowdodevelopersinteractwithaMonitoring-Aware
IDE?
RQ2.What impact does a Monitoring-Aware IDE bring to
software developmentteams?
RQ3.What are the developers’ perceptions about the useful-
nessofaMonitoring-AwareIDEtosupporttheirmonitoring
practices?
Giventhecomplexityofsimulatinganenvironmentthatrequires

some properties in the research setting with the goal of observing

natural study setting is realistic, but subject to confounding factors
that can limit the precision ofmeasurement.
To that aim, we make use of quantitative and qualitative data
that we collected after providing 12 developers from Adyen with a
Monitoring-Aware IDE prototype for four weeks. In summary, our
ield experiment happenedas follows:

developers opt to navigate to the real monitoringsystem.
TounderstandwhetherandhowtheIDEimpacteddevelopers
in their development tasks (RQ 2), we surveyed the participants
weekly,askingabouttheirspeciicinteractionswiththetooland
what actions they took.
We created surveys tailored for each developer. Based on all
theusage datacollected fromour prototypeduringthat week,we
showed a list of all classes in which participants observed any
monitoringinformationduringthatweek.Foreachoftheseclasses,
participantshadtoanswerquestionsaboutinwhatwaythetool

Weprovidedparticipantswithalistofpossiblefollowupactions
that one could have taken after having analyzed the monitoring
information.Wedevisedthislistofconsequencesincollaboration
withAdyendevelopers(usingtheirmonitoringandDevOpsprac-
ticesasabasis,seeSection 2.2andFigure 1).Wealsogivedevelopers
a free box where they can provide any other action. We iteratively
monitoredtheiropenanswerstoimproveourlist.Wealsoprovided
ałdidnotperformanyactionžoption,sothatparticipantswould
not feel obligedto choose any consequence.
The inallistcanbedivided intothreecategories:observations,
code changes,andlogging code improvements.
•Observations: Insightsintothebehavioroftheirsystems,based
on monitoring data: (O1) Identiied a bug, (O2) Identiied per-
formanceissue, (O3)Identiiedsecurityissue,(O4)Identiiedan

(O6)Understoodthe stability of the implementation.

(I5) Implementednewfunctionality.
•Logging code improvements: Improvements to the log code based

logseverity,(L3)Removedlogline,and(L4)Addedlogline.
Althoughparticipantsmayhaveworkedinthesameclassand
asked for its detailed monitoring information (maybe for diferent
purposes) multiple times during the week, that class appeared only
once in that week’s survey. We made this decision for two reasons:
1)wedonotbelieveparticipantswouldhaveanaccurateperception
andmemoryforsuchaine-grainedsurvey,2)thesurveywouldbe
too extensive as we conjectured that participants would interact
with a large number of classes a week. Nevertheless, we allowed

taken inthat class duringthat entire week.
Inaddition,someofthepossibleinteractionswithourtoolcannot
be automaticallycollected by our prototype ( e.g., we have no data
to infer whether participants looked at the number we show in
front of any logstatement). Thus, atthe end of the survey, we ask
themwhetherthetoolhelped(ornothelped)inanywaythatwe
didnot ask before.
Post-questionnaire. Finally, with the goal of augmenting and ex-
plainingthedataweobtainedemployingtheweeklysurveysand
theprototype,weaskedparticipantstoansweranopenquestion-
naire at the end of the four weeks (P1, P6, and P7 were unavailable
for the questionnaire).7Questions were based on the results we
hadobtaineduntil that moment.
The questionnaire contained open questions about both their
usageofthetoolaswellastheimpactthetoolhadontheirdaily
jobs.More speciically,aboutthe toolusage,we asked:
(1)Didyoulookatthemonitoringdataweprovideattheleft
bar of your IDE? In your opinion, how important and/or
useful are they?
(2)We noticed that you went to the external monitoring while
using our tool.Whydidyou gothere?
Concerningtheimpactofthetool,weaskedthefollowingtwo
questions for each of the ive most perceived beneits (represented
by<X>inthe following questions):
(1) Howdoes the toolhelpyou indoing <X>?
(2)Howdidyouperform <X>beforehavingaMonitoring-Aware
IDE? Whatare the diferences?
Note that we use this post-questionnaire also as a way to collect
perceptions on the comparison between using and not using a
Monitoring-AwareIDE,giventhatestablishingacontrolgroupis
not possible inthe context of our study. We use thequestionnaire
as a way to mitigate the possible threat, which we discuss in detail
inSection 7.2.
Data analysis. We applied descriptive statistics to all quantitative
datawecollected( i.e.,usagedatacomingfromtheprototypeand
survey answers). We analyzed the post-questionnaire data using
the following procedure:
(1)Toeachofthequestionsinthequestionnaire,wegrouped
similar answers inhigh-level themes.
(2)Whenever a new theme was created, we revisited all the
previous answers to that question, and evaluated whether it
wouldbetteritthe newtheme,
(3)We stoppedthe process when there were nomore themes
to create.

We invited 12 developers (from 7 diferent teams) to use our pro-
totype for four weeks. We applied convenience sampling to ind
the 12 participants of our study. We made a general announcement
at Adyen’s internal chat application explaining our study and pro-
totypeandaskedforparticipants.Allparticipantshadtopassthe

We asked participants to perform their regular development
tasks using our prototype. Before the ield experiment, we gave
participants some time to try out the tool and learn how to use
it. We highlight that, during thesefour weeks,we didnot forceor

Inthefourweeks,developersopened1,249ilesthatcontained

played data about 4,465 log statements. According to our post-

ment(i.e.,thenumberofoccurrencesofthatlogstatementinthe

there was any unexpected activity in that part of the system (P2,
P12)andwhethertheseproblemswereurgent(P3,P4,P5,P8,P9,
P11).We observed that developers mostly focused on whetherthe
numbers displayed were łout of expected rangesž, e.g., near zero or
very high numbers.
P2:łWhat matters to me is mostly if the number is zero or not. If
it’s not zero and very high ( e.g., 30K), I can tend to ignore it as it
soundslikean‘acceptable’warning.Ifit’salownumberhigher
than0(e.g.,40)Iwouldimmediatelyliketocheckwhat’sgoing
on. In this case, the actual number was not really important, I
wasjustchecking whether thecountwashigherthan0ž
.
In 109 occasions, developers asked for more detailedmonitoring
information ( i.e., the periodic distribution of times that log state-
mentappearedinthelogdata),eitherdirectlyintheMonitoring-
Aware IDE itself (67 times) or visiting the monitoring tool using
thelinkweprovide(42times).Accordingtothepost-questionnaire,
developers also visited the actual monitoring tool to retrieve ad-
ditional,moredetailedinformationabouttheproblemtheywere
investigating, e.g., the stack trace of the problem (P4, P11), the val-
uesofcertainvariables(P3,P5,P12),andtogetthelogmessages
that happenedbefore the errorunderinvestigation (P9).
Interestingly, we observed that, at Adyen, developers have own-
ership of the features they build. Speciic teams are responsible for
theirfeatures,includingtheirmonitoring.Thisbehaviorcanalso
be observedinour data.
P12:łI myself go back to things I worked on from time to time as
well.ž
Weobservedthatmonitoringthesameclassovertimeisarecur-
renttask.50.46%ofallinteractionsarepartofaseriesofinteractions

monitoring is common due to the size of their systems, and to the
sizeofthefeaturestheycommonlybuild(P3,P5,P12),andthatdue
to weekly deployments, they often go back to see whether their
features are stillworking.
6.2 RQ 2:WhatimpactdoesaMonitoring-Aware
IDEbringto softwaredevelopmentteams?
Together,participantscompleted29weeklysurveys(outof48possi-
ble). Developers informed us that, in 45 opportunities, the usage of
our Monitoring-Aware IDE had a positive impact on their software
systems,whichwe showinFigure 4.
We observe that developers took meaningful actions after ob-
serving monitoring data. 9 out ofthe 12 participants (P1-P9)had a
positive consequence of using a Monitoring-Aware IDE. We notice
that the three participants whodid not observe any positive efects
(P10-P12) were the ones with the least number of interactions with
ourtool(Figure 3b). Thereisastrongcorrelationbetween asking
for detailed information and being positively impacted by our tool
(Pearsoncorrelation =0.85, p-value=0.001).
Understanding the business process through monitoring was
the most common consequence of using our Monitoring-Aware
IDE(15timesoutof45,or33%).Moreover,understandingperfor-
mance issues (5 times, 11%), as well as the stability of implementa-
tion(9times,20%)werealsocommonconsequencesofusingour
Monitoring-Aware IDE. Developers accredited a few identiication
andbugixingactivitiesintheirsoftwaresystems(3and2times,re-
spectively)toourMonitoring-AwareIDE.Althoughidentifyingand
ixing bugs did not happen as often as the understanding, we state
that Adyen already has a mature software and, thus, we would not
expect developers to identify and ind severalbugs that often, and
any bug found has signiicant positive impact on their software. Fi-

times,4%),changingtheseverityofalogstatement(2times,4%),
orremovingan existing logstatement(1time,2%).
Interestingly, developers did not identify any security issues
using our tool. When asked about it in the post-questionnaire,
developers airmed that they would not expect to ind security
issues with our tool given that their logs do not focus on it (P2, P4,
P5, P11). P11, speciically, said that they would need to write log
statements whose solepurposeis tomonitor security,whichthen
our tool would help monitor. Finally, P2, P3, P8, and P11 pointed
out the fact that Adyen has already a secure software and security
issuesdonotoftenhappen(andthusthelikelihoodofsuchanissue
tohappenduringourieldexperimentwastoosmall).Weindeed
conjecturethatprovidingdeveloperswithtraditionalmonitoring
data only is not enough for them to observe security issues. A
follow-upstepforthisworkwouldbetostudyhowsecurity-related
aspectswoulditinaMonitoring-Aware IDE.
6.3 RQ 3:Whatarethedevelopers’ perceptions
abouttheusefulnessofaMonitoring-Aware
IDEto support their monitoringpractices?
We observed that developers spent a signiicant amount of time
goingbackandforthbetweentheirmonitoringtoolsandtheirIDEs.
Our overall perception was that this context switching was not
productive.
Theseobservationswerecorroboratedinourpost-questionnaire.
DevelopersairmedthatourMonitoring-AwareIDEdidnotreplace
their monitoring systems, but it helped them in saving time and
reducing cognitive load when compared to the way they use to
perform the same monitoring tasks before our tool. Several of our
participants airmed to spending less time querying their monitor-
ingsystems(P2,P3,P4,P8).P2:łIstilluseKibanaasmuchasIuseditbefore.Idolikehowever
theeasynavigationfrom alog statement in Intellijto Kibana.ž
P3:ł[Kibana] Requires a lot ofmanual work (writingquery) for
theothertoolstoactuallynoticeerrorsthathappeninaclassthat
you workin.ž
Automaticallyestablishingtraceabilitybyperformingthelink
between the log message and the actual log statement as well as
nothavingtoquerythemonitoringtoolalsohelpsdevelopersin
following the lowofthe sourcecode more productively.
P8:łInstead of having to follow the low of the code by changing
parameters on a Kibana search, the faster interaction with the
pluginmakesnavigationsmoother.ž
P5:łNow I don’t have to select a constant string from the log
statement and hope to ind it in the logs. Also I know earlier
whether it is worthinvestigating further ornot.ž
Finally, P8 also adds that the tool reduces his amount of context
switchingandthatthetoolalsosavestimewhencommunicating
aboutan error.
P8:łIfsomeonetellsmeaboutanerror,Icaninditincodeeasily
[and]thenindall related log instancesž
In the post-questionnaire, developers also perceived other bene-
its in Monitoring-Aware IDEs that go beyond saving time (corrob-
oratingtheresultsofRQ 2).Theinstant(near)real-timefeedback
and the timely observations that our IDE ofer enables develop-
erstoquicklyidentify possiblebugsorbottlenecks (P3, P4,P5,P9,
P11, P12). As we stated before, developers pay a lot of attention
to the frequency of a log statement. Developers seem to implicitly
formulate hypotheses on behavior in production. The frequency al-
lowsthemtoimmediatelymakejudgmentsabouttheirhypotheses,
i.e., whether this number seems to be łout of placež ( e.g., near 0, or
very large).
P5:łAn error or warning on its own doesn’t indicate a bug, but
the number of time it gets triggered might. That’s why the tool is
useful,to identify them.ž
P5 also provided us witha concrete exampleof howhe was able
to track aperformance bug.
P5:łIt helped me ind a situation where data had to be loaded
explicitly,while it shouldhave beenpreloaded.ž
Developers also see a positive impact in having monitoring data
andlogging code together(P2,P3,P5,P8).
P2:łSofaritstimulatedmetoimproveloggingwheretheamount
ofwarningswasveryhigh( e.g.,100K).ž
Other participants mentioned that thanks to the real-time feed-
back,theyarebetterabletodecidewhichlogleveltouseinalog

isrequired(P5), andremove less useful logstatements (P8).Monitoring-Aware IDEs ESEC/FSE ’19, August 26–30, 2019,Tallinn,Estonia

P5:łI wouldn’t say the tool helps me to improve log messages
directly, but it helps me ind interesting situations, which may
require better logging. In that case it indirectly helps I suppose.ž
P8:łYoucanseewhichlogmessagesareuseless,andalsogiven

Indeed,developersnoticedthataMonitoring-AwareIDEdoes
not entirely replace their existing tooling, but rather complements
it.P11,forexample,saysthathestillusesthe ELKstacktofollow
the low of a transaction (as the monitoring tool allows him to
see all messagesrelated to a speciic transaction ID). P11also uses
anotherinternal toolto helpinidentifying performance issues.
P2:łDon’t thinkthetoolcovers theneedofmonitoring viaother
means and it can’treplace them.It gives extra insights onlyinto
the code/class that we are working on. Monitoring via automated
patch monitoring or Kibana gives better functionalities on aggre-
gating log datafrom multipleplaces.ž
Finally, the developers provided us with some insightful sugges-
tions on the next steps of our tool. Most of their suggestions are
related to either adding more information (P2, P3, P4, P5, P9) or
adding ilters (P11). Showing monitoring data at package-level and
not only at class-level as is now (P4), personally coniguring the

7 DISCUSSION
In the following, we discuss the several challenges of building a
Monitoring-AwareIDEs,andhowwemitigatepossiblethreatsto
the validity ofthis study.
7.1 Building Monitoring-AwareIDEs
TheArchitectureofaMonitoring-AwareIDE. Designingsuch
an IDE, from an architectural point of view, is worth discussing.
Monitoring data can be extensively large (as with our industry
partner)andany(local)dataanalysismighttaketoomuch,oreven
crashtheIDE.Thus,Monitoring-AwareIDEsshouldbedesignedwith scalability in mind. Our prototype has been shown to be scal-
able, and thus, we dedicate the next paragraphs to describe our
architectural decisions.
AsweshowinFigure 5,themonitoringdataaggregator isalarge
processthatrunsinaseparateserver.Itiswheremostoftheexpen-
sivecomputationalcalculations(e.g.,parselogdataandgenerate
templates, match the log data with its original log statement, up-
datecounters,pullup-to-datesourcecodeandrefreshtemplates)
happen. The Monitoring-Aware IDE is implemented as a plugin on
topofanexistingIDE,suchasIntelliJ.Thepluginmostlyqueries
datafromthe aggregatorandshowsit tothedeveloper.No heavy
calculations happen in the IDE, which means developers do not
sufer from possible slowliness.
Ontheotherhand,westillseeperformanceimprovementstobe
done.OurcurrentprototypequeriesAdyen’smonitoringsystems
every 15seconds fornew log data. Dueto Adyen’s weeklyrelease
cycles,wealsore-generatetheregularexpressionsfromtheirsource
code every week(and not at everynewcommit, asthe generation
process currently takes 35 minutes). We refresh the monitoring
information in the developers’ IDEs whenever they open a class.
While this currently gives near real-time up-to-date information
to developers, we see the following steps as required to build a
state-of-the-artreal-timeMonitoring-Aware IDE:
(1)Astreamingsysteminplacethatwouldstreamlogdataas
theycomewouldbeneeded.Currentindustrysolutions,like
the ELKstack, ofer such streaming.
(2)The monitoring data aggregator would have to be able to
handle the vast amount of regular expression matching that
would happen for each log message. Matching regular ex-
pressionsisneitheracheaporfastoperation,particularlyin
languageslikeJava,whichimplementsaNondeterministic
Finite Automaton (NFA) backtracking algorithm [ 19]. We
see parallelizationas afuture requirement.
(3)Themonitoringdataaggregatorwouldhavetogeneratenew
regularexpressionsfromthesourcecodeeverytimeanew
deploys happens. Our current regular expression generator
takes around 35 minutes to run in a codebase with a few
million lines of code8, and can take even longer in larger
codebases.
(4)The IDEandthemonitoring aggregatorserverwouldhave
to periodically communicate with each other, so that the
IDE always has up-to-date data. The communication should
happeninawaythat developersdo not notice anydelaysin
theirIDEs.
TheImportanceofLoggingCode. Itisinterestingtonoticehow
important the quality of the log code is, and how much develop-
ersmonitoredandimprovedtheirquality.Throughoutourstudy,
developers ixedissues,added,andremovedlogcode.
The quality of log lines is indeed important, and researchers
have been working on log code best practices. Fu et al.[25], for
example, studied common logging practices especially focusing
on where in the source code developers log. They conclude that
common logging practices can be used to automate the logging
processpartially.Zhu etal.[64]implementedatoolwhichlearns

beimprovedbyaddingalogstatement.ChenandJiang[ 14]studied
anti-patterns,whicharedeinedasrecurringmistakesinlogging
code, which may hinder the understanding and maintainability of
logstatements.Therefore,giventhatdevelopersarenowquiteused
tousestaticanalysistools(orlinters)tospotbugsandmaintenance
issues [8,51,52], we suggest tool makers to start incorporating
such logcode qualitymeasures intheirlinters.
As an orthogonal aspect, Adyen uses Log4J, the most popular
Java logging framework. Given their scale and the number of re-
quests per second their servers receive, Adyen developers can not
store the line number of the log statement that originates a log
line that one sees in the monitoring tool. This is why we use Xu
etal.’sheuristic [ 61]to linkthelog lineback toitsoriginating log
statement. However, although the heuristic has worked well in
our settings, our developers had a good amount of implementation
work to adapt it to Adyen’s code style. From the practical point
ofview,we see,asfuture work,loggingframeworksbeing ableto
logmeta-information ( e.g.,class name,linenumber)withreduced
computationalcosts.
Custom-madeMonitoring-AwareIDEs. AdyenusesElasticsearch

tionsthataregoingoninproductionaswellashowthe(new)code
they wrote is behaving. The features of the Monitoring-Aware IDE
prototypewe studyinthispaperwerebasedonthese observations.
However,developersofadiferentcompanymayusemonitoring
systemsinadiferentway, e.g.,customizedmetrics oranalysis.
Monitoring-aware IDEsshouldalso providetheextensive lexi-
bilitythatcurrentmonitoringtoolsofertodevelopers.Thismeans
thattheperfectIDEforoneteammightbediferentthantheone
for another team. This raises interesting points for IDE makers:
how to make a monitoring feature that is generic enough for most
developers to use, but customizable enough so that developers can
obtain all the beneits that their current monitoring systems ofer?
Connected IDEs. We bringto attention the fact that we are used
to seeing IDEs as standalone tools. After installation, they tend not
to require any connections with the external world and developers
can use it even without a network connection. In a world where
IDEsarestronglyconnectedwith monitoring,bothworldsshould
talkto eachother.IDEs should not be standalone toolsanymore.
Researchers indeed have been studying cloud-based IDEs [ 2,27,
54,56,59],andcompanieshavebeendevelopingthem( e.g.,Ama-
zon’s Cloud9). Cloud-based IDEs eliminate any need for speciic
hardware or operational systems, and try to increase collaboration
and coding among developers. We argue that the ideas of cloud-
basedIDEsare inlinewithMonitoring-AwareIDEs.We conjecture
thatthefactthatcloud-basedIDEsnaturallyexistinacloudenviron-
mentwouldfacilitatethedevelopmentofthemonitoringfeatures
we suggestinthis paper.
Fylaktopoulos et al.[26] noticed that runtime monitoring (or
auditing, as authors call in their paper) is still an area not yet ex-
plored in such IDEs. Authors discuss how developers are currently
requiredtobuildtheirowndebuggingandauditingtoolsoutside

sensitive data, produces large amounts of logdata, and sees moni-
toring as a fundamental activity. Although we diversiied our ield
experiment with developers from seven diferent teams that rep-
resent various kinds of development contexts, we can not claim
any generalization. However, given the size, scale, and importance
of the software built by Adyen, we believe this idea is worthy of
further investigation.
8 CONCLUSIONS
Software developers reason about the behaviorof large-scale soft-
waresystemsinproductionbyexamininglogdatainexternalmon-
itoringtools.However,mostoftheirsoftwaredevelopmentactivity
happens in the source code view in the IDE. Leaving their devel-
opment worklow in the IDE to understand production software
behaviorleadstoincreasedcontext-switchingandsplitattention
efectsthat increasecognitive load.
Weproposetounifybothdevelopmentandmonitoringcontexts
by developing a new concept of Monitoring-Aware IDEs. We inte-
gratemonitoringaspectsintotheworklowandcontextofsoftware

statements into the source code view of an IDE. We implement
this concept as an IntelliJ plugin and conduct a one-month ield

opers using our approach in the ield experiment reported that
they were able to better understand business processes, identify
performance issues and functional bugs, improve code quality, and
