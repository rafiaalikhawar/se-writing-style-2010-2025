ABSTRACT  
Technical debt, defined as the maintenance obligations arising 
from shortcuts taken during the design, development, and 
deployment of software systems, has been shown to significantly 
impact the reliability and long-term evolution of software systems [1], [2]. Although academic res earch has moved beyond using 
technical debt only as a metaphor,
 and has begun compiling 
strong empirical evidence on the economic implications of technical debt, industry practitioners continue to find managing technical debt a challenging balancing act [3]. Despite the 
increasing awareness of the importance of managing technical 
debt in software product development, systematic processes for implementing technical debt management in software production have not been readily available.  
To address this gap, we developed and field tested a normative 
process framework that systematically incorporates steps for 
managing technical debt in commercial software production. The 
framework integrates processes required for technical debt 
management with existing software quality management 
processes prescribed by the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK) [4], and organizes the different processes for technical debt management under three steps: (1) make technical debt visible, (2) p
erform cost -benefit analysis, and (3) 
control technical debt. To implement the processes, we introduce a new artifact, called the technical debt register , which stores, for 
each software asset, the outstanding principal and the associated interest estimated for the technical debt embedded in the asset. The technical debt register also stores the desired control target for each software asset’s technical debt, which is populated and 
used 
during the cost -benefit analysis and control target 
calculations. There are three main benefits from this integrated approach. 
First, it enables the uncovering of hidden technical debt embedded in systems. Established quality assurance and control practices 
can be utilized to effectively associate software defects with 
specific design and deployment decisions made by programmers. 
Such associations make technical debt visible to the team and 
thereby facilitate the quantification of debt-related principal and interest. Second, it helps to bridge the gaps that exist between the technical and economic assessments of technical debt, and aid in formulating actionable policies related to technical debt management. Finally, integrating technical debt management processes with established quality frameworks aids the wider adoption 
of emerging prescriptions for managing technical debt.  
We partnered with three commercial software product 
development organizations to implement the framework in real-world software production settings. All three organizations, irrespective of their varying software process maturity levels, were able to adopt the proposed framework and integrate the 
prescribed technical debt management processes with their 
existing software quality management processes. Our longitudinal data and case-study interviews indicate that the organizations 
were able to accrue economic benefits from the adoption and use 
of the integrated framework. And, based on our field study observations, we also identified a set of best practices that support the implementation and use of our framework: facilitating engagement between business and engineering stakeholders, adoption of policies based on a probabilistic analysis framework, and limiting process overheads.
