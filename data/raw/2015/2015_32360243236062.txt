ABSTRACT
Open-source projects do not exist in a vacuum. They benefit from
reusing other projects and themselves are being reused by oth-
ers, creating complex networks of interdependencies, i.e., software
ecosystems. Therefore, the sustainability of projects comprising
ecosystemsmaynolongerbydeterminedsolelybyfactorsinternal
to the project,but ratherbythe ecosystem contextas well.
In thispaperwereport ona mixed-methodsstudyofecosystem-
level factors affecting the sustainability of open-source Python
projects. Quantitatively, using historical data from 46,547 projects
in the PyPI ecosystem, we modeled the chances of project develop-
ment entering a period of dormancy (limited activity) as a function
oftheprojects’positionintheirdependencynetworks,organiza-
tional support, and other factors. Qualitatively, we triangulated
therevealedeffectsandfurtherexpandedonourmodelsthrough
interviews with project maintainers. Results show that the number
of project ties and the relative position in the dependency network
have significant impact on sustained project activity, with nuanced
effectsearly inaproject’s lifecycleandlateron.

tructure today is ubiquitous,1powering applications in virtually
everydomain.EconomistsrefertoOSSasłdigitaldarkmatterž[ 34],
to signify both its invisibility and importance. They also report val-

of the economy, one might expect that it is adequately staffed and
maintained, i.e., sustainable. Yet, this is often not the case. As a re-
centFordFoundationreportinvestigatingthesustainabilityofOSS
łdigital infrastructurež [ 26] notes, most users of OSS infrastructure
takeitforgranted,andsocietyatlargeisunawareoftherisks.A
vivid example is OpenSSL, the OSS project critical to the secure
operation of the majority of websites, recently in the spotlight for
thełheartbleedžsecuritybug[ 24];atthattime,OpenSSLwasse-
verely understaffed. Another notable example is leftpad [ 1], the
trivial 11-LOC JavaScript package that, when deleted by its author
from the npm2registry, caused cascading disruption in thousands
ofotherprojectsthat reliedonitbeing accessible onnpm.
Besides emphasizing the importance of OSS sustainability is-
sues, both examples illustrate a challenge with modern code reuse.
Indeed,withvastamountsofhigh-qualityOSScodeavailablefor
reuse, one can declare dependencies on others’ code instead of
copying it into their own, taking advantage of the functionality
without assuming the burden of maintenance. This leadsto the for-
mationoflargecodeinterdependencynetworks.However,thisalso
meansthatlocalsustainabilityissuesaroundindividualprojectscan
have widespread network effects. For example, breaking changesÐ

of instability, causing negative consequences for dependents down-
stream[5].Anotherexampleisdeveloperturnover.Contributors
toandmaintainersofOSSareoftenoverworkedvolunteers,who
can decide to stop contributing at any time [ 58,74]. Consequently,
OSS projects risk knowledge loss [ 52,57], quality degradation [ 27],
oreven extinction[ 10], again withreverberations downstream.
These challenges are particularly visible in OSS package ecosys-
temslikenpm,PyPI,3andCRAN,4wherepackagesformcomplex
andoftenbrittledependencychains[ 21,41].Withreusesoentic-
ing andso much OSS code available, howcan one make informed
decisions about which packages to use? While OSS projects can be
long-lived( e.g.,Linux,Apache,andEclipse),relativelyfewreach
a mature state [ 7,12] and many that are active for a period of

2 DEVELOPMENTOFHYPOTHESES
Aswithnaturalsystems,thesustainabilityofOSSprojects(much
like the success of OSS projects [ 17]) is also clearly a multi-faceted
concept;e.g.,projectsmaybeconsideredsustainablefromacode
maintainabilityperspectiveiftheyconformtomodularandextensi-
blearchitectures,fromacommunityperspectiveiftheysuccessfully

if they ensure low total cost of ownership and high added value.
Ourperspectiveinthispaperisthatof OSSsupplychains [4]:Given
the choice, should one depend on some OSS package? Will it be
activelymaintainedinayear orwillitshownosignsoflife?
To develop our hypotheses, we start by reviewing the literature
on factors impacting the survival of OSS projects, defined here
asthestateofbeingactivelymaintained.Wedistinguishbetween
project-level factors, of which having an appropriate supply of
contributor effort is arguably most important, and ecosystem-level
factors,inducedbyprojects’positioninanecosystemandtheirrela-
tionship with other projects up and downstream. The project-levelfactorsarerelativelywellstudied,thereforeweusetheliterature
review to identify relevant control variables in our regression mod-
els.Theecosystem-levelfactorsconstituteourmaincontribution.
For thesewe derive,andlatertest, explicit hypotheses.
Project-levelFactors. Inordertosurviveandthrive,OSSprojects
typically require a steady supply of contributor effort, and projects
with more contributors tend to have higher survival rates [ 59]. But

activity is driven by a few core contributors , who have commit ( i.e.,

terstatus involves socializing withthe core group [ 23,30,64]and

Finally,theoutermostlayerconsistsof externalusers ofthesoftware,

inOSSprojectstypicallyfollowstheParetoprinciple[ 31,50,73],by
which 20% of contributors are responsible for 80% of all activity; to
capture this phenomenon, different measures of risk of knowledge
loss due to developer turnover have been proposed [ 57,69], includ-
ing the popular łtruck factorž [ 2,14]. Other contributors and users
arealsoimportant:futuremaintainersarefrequentlygroomedor

software wouldquicklybecome obsolete.
Whencontributionscomeisalsoimportant.OSSprojects,aswith
projectsgenerally,havealifecycle,frominceptiontoabandonment.
The motivations for contributing to a project, the amount of effort
a project may need, and the chances of attracting contributors will
likelyvarywiththestageinthelifecycle.Thecodegrowthcurveof
OSSprojectsoftenfollowsthetypicalpatternofrapidgrowthslow-
ing and flattening as projects reach maturity and require less effort
foraddingfeatures,asshown, e.g.,inGNOME[ 42]andLinuxstable

andevenonce-popularprojectscangetabandoned, i.e.,nolonger

activitycanbedifferentinearly-stageprojectscomparedtolater
on[60,71]. For example,Comino et al.[12]foundthat fewer than
2% of a sample of SourceForge projectsreached maturity,and that
early-stage projects risked abandonment due to restrictive licenses
and smaller communities. In contrast, Coelho and Valente [ 10]
found that common reasons why mature and once-popular OSS
projectsareabandonedincludelosingouttoacompetitor,having
become obsolete,andlackof time andinterestfrom contributors.

Ecosystem-level Factors. OSS ecosystems have been an active
researchtopic (for a review,see Franco-Bedoya et al.[28])anddif-
ferentdefinitionsexist[ 6,36,45,47].HerewefollowLungu’sbroad
definition[ 46]ofOSSecosystemsascollectionsofrelatedsoftware
projects that co-evolve in the same environment. Python pack-
agespublishedonPyPIfitthisdefinition:theycoexistinthePyPI
environmentand,asweshowbelow,theyareofteninterdependent.
WithinanOSSecosystem,developersfrequentlycontributeto
multiple projects [ 68], often at the same time [ 66]. In addition to
building social capital, bridging sub-communities also creates con-
nections between projects, which can impact project sustainability.
For example, Casalnuovo et al.[8] found thatGitHub contributors
aremorelikelytojoinprojectswithwhichtheyhavepriorsocial
connections. Singh et al.[61] showed, usinga longitudinal panel
of 2,378 SourceForge projects, that social network ties between de-
velopers impactOSSproject survival.Finally, Wang[ 71]analyzed
2,220 SourceForge projects to model survival factors at various
project lifecycle stages. The author found that member social con-
nectionswithotherprojectsandactiveengagementofcontributors
present survival advantages at any stage, while permissive licenses
andlarge contributor baseshelpespeciallyearly on.
A significant missing puzzle piece in prior research on OSS sus-
tainabilityis theimpactofaproject’sposition independencynet-
works on survival or extinction, though the heartbleed and leftpad
incidents discussed above suggest this might be significant. Indeed,
ecosystemconnectionsbetweenprojectsextendwellbeyondthe
social, with complex dependency networks being formed, i.e., one
projectreusingfunctionalityfrom another[ 1,3,21,41].
WearguethatthesurvivalofanOSSprojectinanecosystem,in
addition to all the factors reviewed above, depends also on the sur-
vival of its dependencies upstream ( i.e., other packages the current
package depends on) and downstream ( i.e., packages depending on
thecurrent package).Specifically,whilethebenefitsofdepending
on others’ code in an ecosystemÐreusing functionality without as-
sumingtheresponsibilityofmaintenanceÐareclear,weexpectthat
ingeneralhavingmoreupstreamdependenciesmaycreatemore
pointsoffailure,becauseofthecostsassociatedwithresponding
to breaking ( i.e., backward incompatible) changes. Indeed, while
different OSS ecosystem communities have different practices in
planning and deploying breaking changes [ 5], it is clear that in all
ecosystems developers must constantly make dependency manage-
mentdecisions. We expectthat:
H1.The number of upstream dependencies is related to a lower prob-
abilityofprojectsurvival.
However,dependingonanupstreampackagemayalsocreatean
incentivetostepuptomakechangesthatbenefityouasauseror
to help more generally, because an ill maintained upstream project
couldincreasemaintenanceeffortdownstream.Therefore,themore
downstreams,thelargerthepoolofpotentialresourcesavailable
upstream if needed. This may help explain how the original issues
were resolvedwithin hoursfor leftpad anddays for OpenSSL:
H2.Thenumberofdownstreamdependenciesisrelatedtoagreater
probability ofprojectsurvival.
Inaddition,inbothincidents,acatalysttothemassivedisruption
isalsothefactthatamongimmediatelyaffecteddependencieswere
importantnetworkactors.ForOpenSSLthesewerepopularwebservers while leftpad was used by Babel, a core JavaScript package.
The number of direct dependents may not fully reflect a package’s
importance.Consequently,we posit:

Incontrast,thereareupstreampracticesthatcanhelpmitigate
these downstream costs. Asconcrete evidence of expending effort

mayindicatemore intense involvementwith other projects in the

Thereisalsoasocialorganizationalperspectivetothrivinginan

verseintermsofbackground,demographics[ 67],andemployment;
they can be a mixture of volunteers, academics, and paid contribu-
tors [9,76], with different motivations [ 22,35,43]. In particular, as

design [25]. We collected both quantitative and qualitative data
concurrentlyandusedfindingsfromonesourceascross-validation
for findings from the other. Quantitatively, we collected a panel

model the factors that explain projects becoming dormant. Qualita-

interviews,whichisaparticular strength of this design[ 16].
3.1 Data Set
Weassembledalargepaneldataset5ofOSSpackagespartofthe
PyPI(PythonPackageIndex)ecosystem.Adistinctivefeatureofour
datasetisthatit accuratelyrepresentsthenetworkofdependencies
betweenmember packages (details below).
We chose Python as it is a popular general purpose language;
it is the second most popular on Github by number of pull re-
quests.6PyPI is the official registry of Python packages, forming an
ecosystem comprising over 130,000 packages (as of March 2018),
withdeclarative-styledependencies.Unlikeotherlanguages( e.g.,
Haskell),Pythonhasonlyonepackagerepository;asFigure 1,based
onour data (details below), shows, PyPIisincreasingly popular.
Initial Filtering. Assembling our data set involved integrating
data from two sources: metadata from the PyPI registry and the
packages’developmenthistory from their GitHubrepositories.

Next,foreachpackage,wecheckedifits homepage fieldinthePyPI

bitbucket.org, gitlab.com). If this failed, we extended the lookup
toallother metadatafields.IfnoURLwas found,wedownloaded
thelastpackagereleaseandlookedformentionsofcodehosting
platform URLs acrossallpackage files, withthe repository name, if
any, matching the package name on PyPI. This approach revealed
91,728package repositoriesoverall,89% (or81,802)of whichwere
hostedonGitHub;forsimplicity,wesubsequentlyonlyminedpack-
ages with GitHub repositories. These repositories were checked
for existence and uniqueness to filter out project foundries ( i.e.,
repositories hosting hundreds of projects,8since these all point to
thesamePyPIpackageandthemetadatawouldbeimpossibleto
disentangle), leaving 71,903 code repositories (packages) total. We
further filtered out packages created before 2012, when GitHub
became popular, as the data pre-2012 is sparse, and packages with
less than a year of observable history, i.e., created after January
2017, since we could not confidently label them as dormant or still
maintained(see ğ 3.2). Our final sample contains 46,547packages.
DependencyNetwork. Byłdependencyž,wemeana declaredtech-
nical dependency on another PyPI package . That is, we do not count
requiredsystemlibrariesnorPythonpackagescopiedtothesource
treeofapackage.Wealsoexcludeoptionalextrasandtestdepen-

apackage,wecallłupstreamsžthosepackagesusedbythispackage,
i.e.,packagesthatthefocalpackagedependson;conversely,wecall
łdownstreamsžthosepackages dependent onthe focal one.
To extract dependencies, we mined the package metadata when-
ever possible, and used a sandbox installation as a fallback. PyPI
supportsseveralpackagingformats,twoofwhich(.eggand.whl)
storemachine-readabledependencies.Forotherformats, e.g.,source
archives, we executed a package installation in a sandbox environ-
mentwithaninstrumentedversionofthepackageinstaller,logging
the requesteddependencies.
Tocapturenetworkdynamicsweextracteddependencyinfor-
mationfrom allreleasesofallPyPIpackages .Then,wegenerated
historical snapshots of the network, using the latest non-testing,
non-backportedreleaseateachtime.Testingreleaseswereinferred
fromversion numbers, usingsemantic versioningassumptions ( i.e.,

3.2 OperationalizationsofConcepts
Inpreparationforthequantitativesurvivalanalysisbelow(detailsin
ğ3.3),weintroducethefollowingoperationalizationsofthedifferent
project- andecosystem-level factors discussedinğ 2above.
Dormant projects. We consider project as dormant if it is no
longerbeingmaintained, i.e.,whenit stopsdevelopment (commit)
activity,inlinewithpriorwork[ 10,61,71].Thissuggestsastraight-
forwardapproachtodetectdormantprojects:lookforalongperiod
ofinactivityinthegithistory,andconsiderthetimestampofthe
latest commit as the dormant date. However, this is not always ac-
curate:e.g., there are instances when a seemingly dormant project,
with an activity gap of one year or more, is łrevivedž by (a few)
commits to officially indicate that the project has been deprecated;
dormant projects may have also had little activity to begin with
(thus long gaps are not unusual), changed owner, or were not as
much abandoned as they were łcompletedž [ 10] (i.e., they continue
todelivertheintendedvaluewithoutactivemaintenance;11%of
developers interviewedbyCoelho andValente [ 10]reportedthis).
To increase robustness to residual development activity ( i.e.,
fewer false positives), we instead only label a project as dormant if
ithadlessthanonecommitpermonthonaverageinthe12months
prior to its most recent commit. This fits well with our manual
inspections of small samples of the data (tens of packages), though
we do acknowledgethis definitionas apotentialthreatto validity.

Project-level Control Variables. As indicated in our literature
review, severalfactors are known toimpactsurvivalrates,and we
use the following variables to include thesefactors inour models:
Projectage :thenumberofmonths sincethefirstcommitinthe

Numberofcommits :obtainedviatheGitHubAPIandaggregated

incomplete,we exclude itfrom further analysis.
Number of contributors : counted as the number of GitHub users
havingauthoredcommits within agiven calendar month.
Sizeofthecoreteam :thenumberofpeopleresponsiblefor90%
of contributions in a given month. This threshold was selected
empiricallyasatypicalłelbowžpointindistributionofOSSactivity,
muchlike inotherOSS projects( e.g.,Apache [ 50]).
Numberofissues :obtainedviatheGitHubAPI,withpullrequests
filtered out, aggregated per calendar month. We distinguish be-
tweendeveloper-reportedissues,likelyoccurringinternallyduring
development,andnon-developer-reportedissues,likelyreported
byexternalusers,asthelatteraremoreindicativeofthesizeofthe
user base; we call łdevelopersž those contributors who authored
prior commits andłnon-developersž the rest.
Number of non-developer issue reporters : the number of non-
developerGitHubusersreportingissuesinagivencalendarmonth;
mayhelpdistinguishcommunitieswithhigheruserengagement
from thosewhere fewusersdomostissuereporting.
License type : extracted from PyPI package metadata; categorical
variable, indicating whether a project is distributed under a strong
copy-left license (GPL, Affero etc.), weak copy-left (LGPL, MPL,
OPL, etc.) ornon-copy-left license(Apache,BSD etc.), cf.[ 71].
Socialties :thetotalnumberofPyPIpackagesthatcontributors
to the focal package also contributed to this month, as a proxy for
theamountofOSSembeddednessofthecontributors.Projectswith
more łseasonedž contributors maybe more sustainable.
VariablesforEcosystem-levelHypotheses.
Numberofupstreams (out-degreecentrality):numberofupstream
dependencies usedbythe project( H1).
Dormantupstreams :binaryvariableindicatingwhetheranyof
the upstream dependencies isitself dormantat the time ( H1).
Numberofdownstreams (in-degreecentrality):numberofprojects
directly dependenton thefocal project( H2). Bothhere andin the
upstreamscase,wedonotdifferentiatebetweenversionsofade-
pendency, so even dependencieson old and unsupported versions
of the package are counted. This is because more potential contrib-
utors dependent on this package and having a vested interest in its
sustainabilitymaypositivelyaffectsurvival.
Katz centrality : as a proxy for the importance of a package’s
position in the network structure ( H3). Katz centrality [ 39] for
nodeiis defined as: CKatz(i)=α/summationtext.1
j∈JCKatz(j)+β,whereJis
the set of adjacent nodes to i. Parameter βis an initial centrality
(usually 1), and αis a discriminating factor applied at each step to
down-weighfarthernodes(0.1inthisstudy).Developersfurther
downstreaminthedependencychainmaybelesslikelytostepinifneeded than people from immediately dependent projects. We use
Katzcentralitytocapturethisanddown-weighfartherdownstream
projectsdependingontheir dependencies.
Backporting : binary variable indicating whether the project pro-
ducedabackportingrelease inthe last 12 months ( H4).
Organizationalaccount :binaryvariableindicatingthattheproject
is hosted under an organizational (rather than personal) GitHub
account;organizations,eveninformal,maypossessmoreresources

3.3 SurvivalAnalysis (Quantitative)
We use survival analysis to model the effects of the different fac-
tors above on packages becoming dormant. Survival analysis, also
knownaseventhistoryanalysis,isabranchofstatisticsthatspecial-
izes in modeling of time to eventdata [ 49]. Typically only asingle
event occurs for each subject; in our case, the event is the package
suspending itsdevelopmentactivity. Survivalanalysis techniques
aredesignedtodealwithso-calledright-censoredobservations:the
timeoftheoccurrenceoftheeventofinterestcanonlyberecorded
reliablyformembersofthepopulationthatalreadyexperiencedthe
event; forothers,allwe know forcertain isthatthe eventhasn’t
happenedyet;forsome,itmayneverhappen(hencethetermright-
censorship). In software engineering, survival analysis has been
usedtomodel, e.g.,defectsurvivalinEclipse(timetobugfixes)[ 72]
andcontributor survivalinOSS projects[ 13,44,53].
Cox Proportional-Hazards Model. Different survival analysis
techniques exist. The most common regression modeling frame-
workforsurvivalanalysisistheCoxproportional-hazardsmodel[ 15],
whichallowstoestimatetheeffectofanyoneindependentvariable
on the outcome, while holding other covariates fixed . This allows us
to precisely isolate the effectsof any given factor onsurvival.

ModelingConsiderations. Recallthatourdatasetislongitudinal,
organizedinmonthlywindows.MeasuresderivedfromOSSdata
(e.g.,numberofcommits)tendtobequitenoisy,withhighvariation
from one observation ( e.g., month) to the next. To increase the
robustnessofourmodelstopotentiallyhighwindow-to-window
variance, we first smoothed out all numerical variables using a
six-months sliding window, where each value was replaced by the
averageoftheprevioussix.11Then,wesplitprojectdataintosix-
month periods,taking only the last observationfrom eachperiod.
As expected (ğ 2), we also observed during initial exploration of
ourdatathatmanypackagesbecomedormantearly;seeFigure 2,
which shows the probability of survival ( i.e., non-dormant) over
time, across all PyPI packages in our sample. To model how the
different factors contribute to explaining the variability in package
survival rates differently early-stage compared to later on, we split
the data set into two parts: early-stage shutdowns ( i.e., stopping or
nearlystoppingdevelopmentinthefirstsixmonths,whichmatches
well our sliding-windowsmoothing approach)andthe rest.
The early-stage shutdowns,bydefinitiongivenour smoothing,
only contribute one observation each, while the other packages
contribute more. Therefore, we model this group using logistic re-
gression( glminR),withtheresponsevariablebeingthelikelihood
of a project becoming dormant. For the remaining packages, the
data contains monthly observations. A package’s dormant vari-
able isTruein the last month, if we labeled the package as having
stopped activity (see above), and Falseotherwise; surviving pack-
ages have, therefore, dormant=Falsein all windows. To model
these, we estimate a Cox proportional-hazards model ( coxphin R).

diagnostics.First,forpredictorswithhighlyskeweddistributions,
weconservativelyremovedthetop1%ofvaluesashigh-leverage
outliers, in line with statistical best practice [ 54]; high-leverage
points would disproportionally affect regression slopes and reduce
the model’s robustness. Second, we log-transformed variables with
skewed distributions, as needed, to reduce heteroscedasticity [ 29];
thishelpsstabilizethevarianceandcanimprovemodelfit.Third,
we test for multicollinearity between the explanatory variables
usingthevarianceinflationfactor(VIF),andremovevariables,if
any,withVIFscoresabovetherecommendedmaximumof5[ 11].

Cox model, to account for the non-independence of repeated ob-
servations per package, we explored different options, all of which

3.4 Maintainer Interviews(Qualitative)
To triangulate and enhance our modeling results we conducted 10
semistructured interviewswithpackagemaintainers.Recruitment
was done by soliciting via email, using addresses collected from
GitHub profiles or personal websites. We used stratified sampling
to identify potential interviewees: 3 packages with extreme feature
values(largesize),2projectsthatrecentlybecameinactive,4ran-
domlyselectedtostratifythesamplebyprojectsize,and1highly
productive individual contributing to many projects of different
sizes. For each project, the most active person in the last two years
wassolicitedviaemail.Wesent32emails,received12responses,
and conducted 10 interviews; we reached theoretical saturation,
meaning roughlythat subsequentdataallfitwithin thecategories
derivedfrom the previous interviews, around the sixthinterview.
The interview protocol was centered around the model features,
asking about the predictive power of these features, their expected
effect, and comments on the effects discovered by the model. In-
terviews also included several open ended questions about the
definition of sustainability in OSS, project context, and missing
factors that should be incorporatedintothe model.
Interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated (two cases),
andcoded.Forthreeinterviews,interviewrecordingswerepartially

4.1 SurvivalModels andInterviewInsights
Project-level Effects. Thenumber of commits is associated
with higher chances to become dormant in the next time period
in both groups (early- and late-stage), i.e., packages with higher
commitactivityaremorelikelytobecomedormant,othervariables
held constant. Interviewees pointed out that commit squashing
(merginglargecontributionsintoasinglecommit),whichwould
reduce the number of commits, may help explain this effect: ma-
tureprojectsmayusethispracticemoreoften,butarelesslikely
to become dormant; at the same time, a contributor with direct
commit access can contribute many small commits, which often
happensinsmaller projects, whichare more likelyto become dor-
mant. Three interviewees indicated using recency of commits as
themainindicatorofsustainability.Futureworkshouldconsider
counting commit message lines instead (squashed commits tend tocontainalloriginalmessages),andreplacingtheabsolutenumber
with commit dynamics, such as stability of monthly contributions.
Twoparticipantsalsosuggestedadjustingthenumberofcommitsto
the project size, since bigger projects may need more maintenance.
Thenumber ofcontributors has a negative effect on chances
of becoming dormant in both groups, i.e., packages with more con-
tributorsarelesslikelytobecomedormant.Sixintervieweesagreed
unconditionallythathavingmorecontributorsimprovessustain-
ability. Explanations included, in decreasing order of popularity:
larger recruitment pool for the core team, better code reviews, and
anindicationofhealthyonboardingpractices.Animportantaddi-
tiontothenumberofcommittersasasustainabilitymetric,pointed
outbythreeinterviewees(allaremaintainersofbigprojects)isthat
it does not capture non-code contributions. For example, people
contributingcodereviews,issuetriaging,andevenevangelismand
securing fundingare essentialfor projectsustainability.
Thesize ofthecore team is collinear with the number of con-
tributors in our models, hence not included. Our interviewees also
perceiveitsimilarly.Itwasunanimouslyviewedasapositivefactor
by maintainers of big projects. All explanations of the effect either
directly referred to the łbus factorž or closely resembled its defi-
nition. For small projects, this metric waseither equivalent to the
total number of contributors and still considered positive, or did
not apply because the projectwasconsideredfeature-complete.
Thenumberofissuereporters wasnotincludedinourmodels
duetomulticollinearity.Forourinterviewees,thiswasperceived
as anotherwayto measure userbase.
Thenumberofissues wasexpectedtobeapositiveindicatorof

firstsixmonths( i.e., theearly-stage model),while still decreasing

thechancesofbecomingdormantinthelater-stagesurvivalmodel.
In the interviews, the discussion revealed several layers of inter-
pretationforthismetric.First,reportedissueswereunanimously
considered to be a positive sign of an active user community. Two
smallprojectmaintainersalsonotedthatnoissuesinasmallproject
couldbeanindicatorofaprojectwithoutqualityissuesratherthan
low usage. Four participants suggested looking into issue handling
and discussions. Average response time, number of responses, and
numberof closed issueswere proposedas indicators of activeness
for the projectteam.
Anotherinterpretation forissues, comingfromthree maintain-
ersofbigprojects,suggestedthatissue triaging,although helpful
for end users, takes resources and sometimes slows down develop-
mentactivities.Someprojectswereknowntostoprespondingto
issues completely to conserve developers’ effort.12Based on this
discussion, in the third model we introduce an interaction between
the number of commits and number of contributors . The interaction
effect was significant, rendering number of issues as a positive fac-
torinprojectswithhighvolumeofcommits.Controllingforthis
interaction, the number ofreportedissuesitself isnot significant.
H1. Upstreams. Upstream dependencies were expected to in-
crease the chances of projects becoming dormant. The modeling
effects are nuanced. In the first six months, a higher number of
upstreams correlates with higher chances of dormancy, as hypoth-
esized,althoughthepresenceofa dormantupstreamreducesthis
risk. Later on, a higher number of upstreams correlates with lower
chances of dormancy, but the presence of a dormant upstream
increasesthis risk.
The interviews with utility library project maintainers offer a
potentialexplanation.Suchprojectsareconsidereddormantperour
definition, while in fact they are feature complete. Reusing feature
completelibrariescanboostdevelopmentofanewproject,hence
thereduceddormancyriskinthefirstsixmonths.Inthelong-term,
however, projects may start to incur higher costs of maintaining
compatibilitywithdormantupstreams,hence the increasedrisk.
At the same time, having more upstreams overall in the long
term enables more reuse, compensating for increased dormancy
risks. Still, interviewees were cautious, stressing that it is better
tolimitupstreamdependenciesinthelong-termtothosethatare
really necessary, as there is a trade-off between development effort
(lower with more reuse) and potential compatibility issues later
on. The mention of łas few as possible within reasonž suggested a
non-lineareffect,whichweaddedtothethirdmodelasa quadratic
term of the number of upstreams ; however, this term did not have a
statisticallysignificant effect.We further illustrate this trade-off.
On the one hand, the positive effect of dependency adoption
comes from saving resources on implementation. A striking ex-
ample comes from an interview with a project maintainer who
wasabletoreuseadomain-specificlibraryfromasimilarproject.
The maintainer claimed that most projects in this domain die in an
attempt to implement this very expensive piece of functionality, so
adoption ofthis dependency wasessentialfor the projectsuccess.
Ontheotherhand,thecompatibilityissuescomefromthePython
package installer(pip) not havinga version resolver. Forexample,
if package A requires B version 1.0 and C version 1.0, and B 1.0
12E.g., the npm CLI team: https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/953402549293350913requires C 2.0, after installing package A a user might end up with
an incompatible setup B 1.0 and C 1.0. The Python community
developed tools tobuild isolated, non-contradicting sets of depen-
dent packages ( e.g., virtualenv and pipenv), but even compatibility
withintheseenvironmentsrequireseffortfrompackagedevelopers.
All intervieweesseemwellaware ofthis trade-offandreported
using different heuristics to find the right balance. Several main-
tainers,especiallyoflargerpackages,indicatedthattheyhaveto
spend substantial effort to stay compatible with a wide range of
environmentsbysupportingoutdatedversionsofupstreampack-
ages.Incaseofsmallerupstreams,itisoftenconsideredalesserevil
toeither reimplementa dependencyor copya compatibleversion

In summary, an indication of compatibility with potential up-
streamsisthebiggestfactorindependencyadoption,butoverall
the evidencefor oragainst H1isinconclusive.
H2.Downstreams.Downstream dependencies wereexpected
to have a positive effect on project sustainability. Our models in-
dicate that indeed they have a positive effect in the long term,
but not in the first six months. Building a community of down-
streamprojectstakestime.Themostlikelyscenarioforaproject

by other projects of the same maintainer. Such projects are usually
limited in scope, do not require further maintenance, and thus will
beconsidereddormant.Inthelaterstage,however,thismetricis
dominatedbyłnaturalždownstreamdependencies,workingasa
positive survivalfactor inthe later-stagesurvivalmodels.
Across allinterviews, downstream dependencies were charac-
terized as a mostly positive factor, with the maintrade-off between
extra maintenanceeffort and resources brought by the dependent
projects.Mainbenefitsbroughtbydownstreamprojectswerede-
scribedascodecontributions(threeparticipants),freetesters(two),
securefunding(twoparticipantsfromacademicprojects).Twopar-
ticipants considered the number of dependent projects a proxy for
user base, and two maintainers of feature-complete projects stated
that itisnot importantat all.
Thenegativesideofdownstreamdependencieswasdescribedas
extraefforttomaintaincompatibilityandtriageissues.Onlyone
participant stated that contributions from downstream projects are
not worth thiseffort. These explanations, together withmodeling
results, mostly support H2.
H3.Structuralproperties.Relativepositioninthedependency
network was only relevant for four projects in the interview pool
having transitive downstream dependencies, and even for those
the dependency network was not directly observable. Due to these
constraints therole of therelative position in the dependencynet-
work was mostlydiscussed from a theoretical perspective rather
thanpersonal experience.
In most cases, transitive downstreams were interpreted in the
same way as direct ones, as a user base. Two participants stated
that projects higher in the dependency chain need to put more
resources into sustainability because of their special position. One
of them motivated this with an example of łextremely painfulž
debuggingofasecond-levelupstreamdependency( i.e.,anupstream
ofanupstream).For twomaintainersoffeature-completeprojects
651Ecosystem-LevelDeterminantsofSustainedActivity in Open-Source... ESEC/FSE’18,November4–9, 2018, Lake Buena Vista,FL,USA
the relative position in the dependency network did not matter.
Limitations of the interview sample prevent us from building a
more robust qualitative interpretationofthis metric.
However, in all three models higher Katz centrality correlates
with increased chances of projects becoming dormant. This ef-
fectcouldbepossiblyexplainedbyahigherreuserateoffeature
complete libraries. It could also be attributed to an increased main-
tenance effort required in projects higher in the dependency chain,
asindicatedbyinterviewees.Overall,basedonthemodelingand
interviewresults, we could not confirm H3.
H4.Backporting.Backporting wasusedasanindicatorofproject
practices aimed at reducing the maintenance cost of dependent
projects [ 5]. It was estimated to substantially reduce chances of
becomingdormantinthefirstsixmonths,wherepracticalimpor-
tanceofbackportingreleases isquestionable.Themodelestimate,
suggestingincreasedlikelihoodofsurvival,couldbeexplainedby
projectsoccasionallymislabelingreleases;however,thefactthat
theseprojectsproducemultiplereleasesinthefirstsixmonthsis
servingas anindicatorof sustainability.Insubsequent later-stage
survival models this feature did not have a significant effect. We
could not confirm H4.
H5. Organizational Support. University involvement has a
special role in the Python community. Many signature Python
projects are related to traditionally academic domains: Data Sci-
ence,MachineLearning,ArtificialIntelligence,NaturalLanguage
Processing, etc. Our expectation was that university projects have
extra risks,such asstudents leavingaftergraduation,end offund-
ing cycles, etc. However, modeling results indicated that university
involvement is not a significant dormancy risk factor in the first
sixmonths,butinlater-stagesurvivalmodelsitreducesthechance
ofbecoming dormantbyapproximately25%.
In our interview sample, fourparticipants were university affil-
iates. Overall, all four indicated that their OSS work is currently
funded through a university through a grant or contract, and their
contributionsarerelatedtotheirpositioninacademia.Twoofthem
started their projects as students, one joined an existing project,
and the last project was created as a practical tool to support exist-
ingresearch. Two intervieweestransitioned into facultypositions
during their projects, and thus had an extended perspective on
the evolution of an academic project. They commented on three
survivalchallengesinthelifecycleofauniversityproject:surviving
thestudentgraduationcycle,survivingtheacademicfundingcycle,
andgrowingoutsideacademia.Twooutoffouruniversityaffiliates
we interviewed assumed that the diversity of institutions involved
might also be used as an indicator of sustainability, where projects
with multiple institutions involved are expected to be truly owned
bytheresearchcommunity,incontrasttolocalresearchprojects.
It was also suggested thatthe university involvement effect might
vary dependingonthe area ofscience.
The explanation above and the modeling results partially sup-
portH5.However,increasedsustainabilityofuniversityprojects
might be specific to the Python ecosystem due to its high share
of łacademicž projects and should be further tested in different
ecosystems byfuture work.
Commercialinvolvement was expected to have a positive ef-
fect on sustainability (lower risk of dormancy), but the modelssuggest otherwise; the feature also elicited somewhat controver-
sial interview explanations. A shared opinion about commercial
involvement among interviewees was that companies bring re-
sourcestotheproject,butthissupportisnotsustainablelongterm.
Common concerns include misalignment of companies’ priories
withtheprojectgoalsandsustainabilityissuescausedbycompanies
withdrawingfrom aproject.
The overall extent of commercial involvement in PyPI seems
small. Contrasting the results of the 2016 Future of Open Source
Survey,whichstatesthatł1in3companieshaveafull-timeresource
dedicated to open-source projectsž and ł67% of companies actively
encouragedeveloperstoengageinandcontributetoopen-source
projectsž,13onlytwo participantsknewaboutcasesofcompanies
payingdeveloperstocontributetoOSSprojectsoftheirchoice.One
participant also indicated that their project benefits from commer-
cial contributions, but ł... those engineers will have a finite time
withus.Sowecan’tputthemonthecriticalpathž.Thisexplanation,
coupledwithmodelingresults, isat odds with H5.
Another aspect to commercial contributions is licensing. One
participant stated that commercial companies are sensitive to li-
censingterms.Inparticular,manyproductcompanieswillnotbe
able to work with GPL products, though service companies might.
Addinglicenserestrictiveness asacontrolvariableinourmod-
els,we findthatpresenceofa license,whetherstrong-,weak-or
non-copy-left, is a positive survival indicator. Although one in-
terview participant indicated that strong copy-left licenses, such
asGPL,restrictprojectadoption,themodelindicatesthatstrong-
and weak copy-left licenses have higher positive impact on project

so this project had to implement new features added by competing

Across many interviews, participants indicated that maturity
of project practices plays an important role in an evaluation of
the project’s sustainability from the end user perspective. Prior
work by Trockman et al.[63] also found that developers rely on
observablesignalswhenmakingdecisionsaboutwhichprojectto
use or contribute to. The factors mentioned during our interviews
were related to software quality, backward compatibility, devel-
oper onboarding, and support for end users. The indicators of such
practices include implemented autotests, CI and test runner config-

Theseresults have several implications.
First, these results may be actionable for OSS researchers and
platformdesigners . The ecosystem-level variables we foundto cor-
relate with a project’s risk of becoming dormant, despite being
aggregations of publicly accessible data, are not readily observable
on platforms like GitHub. One of the defining features of GitHub

opedsignals,suchastheonesourapproachcaninform,couldhave
been used to reduce the information asymmetry. Therefore, it is
not surprising that recently both GitHuband PyPI have started
displaying informationon dependents anddependencies forsome

willbecome available inthe future.
Our results may also be actionable for OSS practitioners . If future
research confirms that there is a causal relationship, not just the
correlation we demonstrated in our work, between the variables
we identified and a project’s risk of becoming inactive, that may
providemeansforsuggestinghowtoextendthelifeofprojectsthat
become inactive withoutbeing feature complete.
Still, we emphasize that the response variable in this study (dor-
mancy, or low development activity) is not always indicative of
projectabandonment,anditthereforerequirescarefulinterpreta-
tionandshouldbeadjustedtoprojectcontext.Whileallabandoned
projects are dormant,not alldormant projects are abandoned. For
example,utilitylibrarieswithawelldefinedscopedonotrequire

bypriorresearchonreasonsforOSSprojectfailure,indicatingthat
11%ofseeminglyabandonedprojectsarejustconsideredfeaturecomplete by their authors [ 10]. This suggests that when interpret-
ingsustainabilityindicators,oneshouldadjustatleasttoproject
classandsize. E.g.,existingdependentprojectsearlyinthelifecycle
might indicate a chipoff from another project, feature complete
frombirth, whichisnotanegativesustainabilityindicator.Likely,
a dormant upstream project might not be an issue if it is feature
complete, but can be a problem if it requires constant maintenance.
In practice, it means that the presented survival model does not
fully apply to feature complete projects and one should consider
qualitative methodsinstead.
Future research should try to further distinguish feature com-
plete projects from abandoned ones. Suggested ways to determine
if a dormant project is complete rather than abandoned may in-
clude looking at: maintainers’ activity outside the project, non-
development activity (mailing lists, issue trackers, and community
forum discussions), and dynamics of the project user base; some
anecdotalevidence alsosuggeststhatprojectsabandoned bytheir

whichcontinue to be adoptedas dependencies innewprojects.
5 CONCLUSIONS
Priorworkrevealedanumberofprojectcharacteristicsrelatedto
thesustainabilityofopen-sourceprojects.Inthismixed-methods
study, we have extended those results to include ecosystem factors.
We theorized about expected effects and used survival analysis on
a large set of PyPI projects hosted on GitHub, modeling risk of
dormancy early in their life cycle and later on. We then triangu-
lated the models through interviews with project maintainers, and
modeledinteraction effectsinformedbythe qualitative analysis.
Ourworkshowstherealimpactecosystemcontexthasinhow
software is developed, and suggests that it brings new risks as well
as clear benefits. As open-source projects are increasingly incorpo-
ratedintosoftwaresupplychains,organizationsneedtoimprove
theirabilitytoevaluatetheriskstheyaretakingonandlearnstrate-
giesformitigatingthem.Itisalsobecomingclear,forexampleinour
results about the effects of corporate participation, that it can have
a destabilizing effect as well as simply providing more resources.
In addition to becoming more informed consumers of open-source
software, commercial firms should carefully consider the impact
that inconsistentparticipationcan have onthe ecosystem.
Due to the size of our dataset, not all new features suggested
by the interviewees were practical to test. Remaining, untested
effects,leftopenforfuturework,include:issueresponsetime,issue
discussions, quality of commit messages, quality of documentation,
automatedtests,anduseofCI.Futureresearchshouldgeneralize
and contrast our results on different ecosystems, better account for
featurecompleteprojects,andtesttheremainingfeaturessuggested
by interviewees. For now, we note all these issues as potential
threatsto validity.
