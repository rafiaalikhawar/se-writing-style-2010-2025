Abstract —Software defect prediction (SDP) utilizes the learn-
ing models to detect the defective modules in project, andtheir performance depends on the quality of training data. The
previous researches mainly focus on the quality problems of class
imbalance and feature redundancy. However, training data oftencontains some instances that belong to different class but have
similar values on features, and this leads to class overlap to
affect the quality of training data. Our goal is to investigatethe impact of class overlap on software defect prediction. At
the same time, we propose an improved K-Means clustering
cleaning approach (IKMCCA) to solve both the class overlap
and class imbalance problems. Speciﬁcally, we check whether K-
Means clustering cleaning approach (KMCCA) or neighborhoodcleaning learning (NCL) or IKMCCA is feasible to improve defect
detection performance for two cases (i) within-project defect
prediction (WPDP) (ii) cross-project defect prediction (CPDP).
To have an objective estimate of class overlap, we carry out
our investigations on 28 open source projects, and compare the
performance of state-of-the-art learning models for the above-mentioned cases by using IKMCCA or KMCCA or NCL VS.
without cleaning data. The experimental results make clear that
learning models obtain signiﬁcantly better performance in termsof balance ,Recall and AUC for both WPDP and CPDP when
the overlapping instances are removed. Moreover, it is better to
consider both class overlap and class imbalance.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Defect prediction technology is one of the research topics
among academic and industrial organizations [1], [2], [3], [4],
[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. With the development of machine
learning methods, more and more classiﬁcation models areapplied to software defect prediction (SDP) to detect as manydefective modules as possible with minimal cost. The qualityof training dataset from software projects seriously affects theprediction capabilities of learning models. Previous studies inthe data quality of SDP mainly focus on class imbalance andfeature redundancy, and have proposed lots of models to dealwith these quality problems.
However, in practical data collection, due to the objective
condition, some instances with different classes may haveFig. 1. The distribution of PC4 dataset in NASA. Figure 1 denotes the PC4 has
high overlapping instances, these overlapping areas are diffcult to classiﬁer.
similar values on some features, which results in overlap in
feature space. These instances are called overlapping instances,triggering the class overlap problem. Class overlap is one
of the bottlenecks in data mining and machine learning, and
SDP is no exception. Many instances from NASA [11], [12],
AEEEM [13], ReLink [14], SOFTLAB[11] and MORPH [15]
are overlapped (As shown in ﬁgure 1, many instances arelocated in overlapping space, where learning models oftenfail to classify), which hinders the prediction performance oflearning models.
In the past few years, many studies have encountered class
overlap problem in practical ﬁelds, such as credit card fraud
detection [16], text classiﬁcation [17]. They found the over-
lapping instances involve the performance of learning models,
which often becomes a thorny problem when combined with
other factors, such as class imbalance. In SDP, researchersmainly focus on data preprocessing including class imbalance
and noise cleaning, few studies have paid attention on classoverlap problem. Chen et al. [18] attempted to apply the neigh-borhood cleaning learning (NCL) rule to remove overlappinginstances for SDP. However, the NCL method only removed
the conﬂicting non-defective instances to eliminate the classoverlap, and the defective instances located in non-defective

In this study, we are committed to identify and process
overlapping instances and propose an improved K-Meansclustering cleaning approach (IKMCCA) to remove the over-lapping instances. Our contribution is to investigate the impactof class overlap on software defect prediction, and excavate
how class overlap inﬂuence the prediction performance for
both WPDP and CPDP. So we have structured our workaccording to the following two research questions:
RQ1: How does class overlap inﬂuence the prediction
performance of within-project defect prediction approaches?
RQ2: How does class overlap inﬂuence the prediction
performance of cross-project defect prediction approaches?
We conduct experiments to investigate the impact of class
overlap for WPDP and CPDP using 28 overlapping data fromNASA, AEEEM, ReLink, SOFTLAB and MORPH. The restof this study is organized as follows: the next section IIprovides a review of related work on SDP. Section III provides
the methodology containing study questions, methods to build
models, data and model evaluation. Section IV lists the resultsof study. The discussions of our work are described in Section
V and the threats to validity of our work are analyzed in
Section VI. We conclude the paper in Section VII.

ELATED WORK
In this section, we mainly discuss the related researches on
the SDP and class overlap.
A. Software Defect Prediction
Software defect prediction technology has been one of
the most concerned research topics in software engineeringsince 1970s [6], [19], [20]. In recent years, with the rapid
development of machine learning, various machine learning
methods have been widely applied to improve the performanceof SDP.
According to whether the training and testing data come
from the same project, the SDP is divided into within-projectdefect prediction (WPDP) and cross-project defect prediction(CPDP). WPDP is to directly apply classiﬁers such as NaiveBayes (NB) [7], [10], Random forests (RF) [21], K-nearestneighbor (KNN) [22], Support vector machine (SVM) [23],
and Logistic regression (LR) [24] to detect the defective
modules.
CPDP is to ﬁnd as many defective modules as possible
in one project based on the learning model trained by otherprojects. The most important problem of CPDP is the different
distribution of training and testing data. Many researchers have
presented a comparative research on CPDP methods [25], [26],[27]. Zhou et al. [27] found that the simple module-size model
method had comparable or better predictive performance thanmost cross-project defect prediction methods. In our work, we
focus our discussions on six empirical studies which could
achieve better performance. Detailed descriptions are shown
as follows.
Turhan et al. [28] chose similar instances as training set
from different projects, and using these similar instances totrain k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classiﬁer. Nam et al. [6]
used Transfer Component Analysis (TCA) method to maptraining and testing data into the common feature space.They conducted experiments on ReLink and AEEEM datasets,and proposed TCA+ method for automatic data selectionstandardization. Chen et al. [29] integrated two levels of
data transfer and proposed double transfer boosting (DTB)approach. First, they reshaped the whole distribution of cross-company (CC) dataset by data gravitation to ﬁt WP data. Then,
they eliminated negative instances in CC dataset by transferboosting with NB based classiﬁer. Turhan et al. [30] foundmixed-project prediction was reasonable in early phases of de-velopment though studying the impact of mixed-project dataseton binary defect prediction. Ryu et al. [31] discussed the classimbalance for the mixed-project defect prediction (MPDP),
and put forward the value-cognitive boosting with support vec-
tor machine (VCB-SVM) approach. Their experimental resultsindicated that VCB-SVM could achieve better results when
training data only contained fewer label instances of testing
project. Xia et al. [32] proposed the HYDRA (HYbrid modelReconstruction Approach) including two phases of genetic and
ensemble learning. The phase of genetic algorithm was tobuild the optimal weight combination of multiple classiﬁers
by genetic algorithm. The phase of ensemble learning was
to produce a classiﬁer with good performance by AdaBoostmethod.
B. Class overlap
Class overlap is that some instances in training data are
close to or even overlap in the distribution space but havedifferent class. These instances often lead to poor class bound-
ary, and hinder to build a good learning model with good
performance [33]. In the ﬁeld of SDP, researchers consideredclass overlap problem as the data quality or noise detection.
Tang et al. [34] proposed a clustering-based noise detection
method to remove noisy instances identiﬁed by the noise fac-tor. They conducted experiments on NASA with C4.5 learner,and the results indicated that removing noisy instances couldimprove the accuracy of classiﬁer. Kim et al. [35] evaluated
the effect of the dataset containing both false positive and false
negative noise, and proposed the closest list noise identiﬁcation(CLNI) method to identify noise instances. Based on CLNI,Chen et al. [18] proposed neighborhood cleaning learning
(NCL) to deal with both class overlap and class imbalance. Theexperimental results indicated that the new learning models
could get best values in terms of G-mean and AUC compared
with state-of-the-art methods.
However, they do not provide a comparison with CPDP
models. In our work, we evaluate the impact of class overlapon both WPDP and CPDP.

evaluation. Figure 2 provides an overview of the steps in our
study.
A. Research questions
Our study is to evaluate the effect of overlapping instances
on SDP. To this end, our work checks the following two
questions.
RQ1: How does class overlap inﬂuence the prediction per-
formance of existing within-project defect prediction models?
RQ2: How does class overlap inﬂuence the prediction per-
formance of existing cross-project defect prediction models?
The aim of RQ1 and RQ2 are to compare the performance
of the existing state-of-the-art learning models by removing
overlapping instances against without removing under twoprediction cases (WPDP and CPDP). For RQ1, we study
NB [7], [10], RF [21], SVM [23], LR [24] and KNN [22]
classiﬁers for WPDP models. For RQ2, we study NN-ﬁlter
[28], TCA+ [6], VCB-SVM [31], DTB [29], MNB [30], and
HYDRA [32] models for CPDP. Noted that all the above
learning models were conducted on Python 3.6 and Scikit-learn (0.19.2). Since our works are to investigate the impactof class overlap on SDP, the parameters of NB, RF, SVM, LR
and KNN classiﬁers are set as default parameters on Scikit-
learn (0.19.2), and the parameters of CPDP learning models
are set as the same as their studies.
If the learning models under removing overlapping instances
are much better than these without removing overlappinginstances, it would be a good option for practitioners to employ
removing overlapping instances before building the models.In addition, if the performance ranking of learning model ischanged, it would be indicated that class overlap problem hasa greater impact on this learning model.
B. Datasets
In order to build and validate the effect of class over-
lap on software defect prediction, we use 28 projects fromNASA, AEEEM, ReLink, SOFTLAB and MORPH groups.
These datasets collected from these 28 projects includes static
code metrics and process metrics, and the defect matchingwas relied on SZZ algorithm. The metrics along with label
information of these datasets are at different level (function orclass or ﬁle granularity).
Projects from NASA systems are NASA aerospace projects
which were gathered as part of the metric data program
(MDP). These projects are all only one version and their metricfor SDP are function granularity. We only apply CM1, MW1,
PC1, PC3 and PC4 projects as they were developed by Clanguage and they have the 37 common metrics.
Projects from SOFTLAB systems are embedded controllers
for household appliances from Turkish software company.
These projects include AR1, AR3, AR4, AR5 and AR6developed by C language. The metrics for these projects arealso function granularity.
Projects from MORPH systems are collected by Jureczko
and Spinellis [15] including 46 releases of 14 open-sourceprojects and 11 student projects. The metrics of these projects
are class granularity and developed by Java language. In our
experiment, we choose one version for multi-version project,which were used in reference [36].
Projects from AEEEM and ReLink are developed by Java
language. AEEEM are collected by D’Ambros et al. [13],and ReLink are collected by Wu et al. [14]. The metrics in
AEEEM are class granularity, and the metrics of ReLink areﬁle granularity.
Table I shows the testing projects used in our experiment.
From this table, we can observe that (i) the test projects are
from different ﬁelds and are developed by different languages(C or Java); (ii) the number of instances in the test projectsvary greatly and the percentage of defective instances are verylow leading to class imbalance. These observations concludethat these test projects could be used to provide a fairevaluation of the impact of class overlap on software defect
prediction.
C. Methods to build the models
In the ﬁeld of SDP, class overlap problem often is consid-
ered as the data quality or noise detection. In our experiment,
we use KMCCA [34], NCL [18] and our proposed IKMCCA
methods to remove the overlapping instances.
CLNI approach was presented by Kim [35] and used by
Chen simultaneously [18]. Chen et al. considered both classimbalance and class overlap in the same time. So in ourexperiment, we used the NCL proposed by Chen. They used

the neighborhood cleaning learn (NCL) rule to remove the
overlapping instances. It is noted that the non-defective in-stances only be removed to stress the class imbalance problem.
This is to say, they searched the nearest neighbors of each
defective instance and removed the nearest neighbors whoseclass were non-defective.
KMCCA approach was presented by Tang [34], and this
was a clustering-based noise detection approach based on K-
means. Firstly, the K-means algorithm was used to cluster the
data into Kclusters. Then, for each cluster, the noise factor
values of each instance are computed. Finally, the top p%o f
instances were removed.
In order to the same as the NCL, we improved the KMCCA
method called IKMCCA that considers the class imbalance at
the same time. In step of the removing overlapping instances,the rule is based on the percentage of defective instances. Ifthe percentage of defective instances in the i
thcluster is below
the p%, the defective instance in this cluster are removed.
On the contrary, the non-defective instances in this clusterare removed. Pseudo-code for IKMCCA
1is presented in
algorithm 1.
Noted that we employ the log-transformation before using
the datasets which was studied by previous researches [37].The pseudo-code for the simulation experiments are providedin algorithm 2 for evaluating the impact of class overlap toanswer RQ1 and RQ2.

In order to investigate the impact of class overlap on
learning models, we use three performance measures including

Balance (bal) is the balance between pdand pf. The bigger
the balvalue is, the better the performance of learning model

Recall is the ratio of the number of correctly predicted
defective instances to the total number of defective instances.The bigger the Recall value is, the better the performance of
learning model is. It is deﬁned as

AUC is the area under a Receiver Operating Characteristic

In these measures, pd(probability of detection) is the ratio
of correctly predicted defective instances to total defective
instances. pfis the fraction of incorrectly predicted defective
instances to total non-defective instances.
In order to make a statistical evaluation of the detailed
prediction results, the non-parametric Friedman test with theNemenyi test is used to compare multiple runs over the 28
projects. The conﬁdence level is 95%. They are widely used in
software defect prediction (SDP) [39], [40]. Firstly, the Fried-man test is used to determine whether there are statistically
signiﬁcant differences among compared methods. If there are
signiﬁcant differences in statistical data, the differences willbe test by post-hoc Nemenyi test.
In addition, to evaluate the degree of difference among the
compared methods in terms of bal,Recall and AUC results,
we apply Cliff’s Delta to measure the effect size, which don’t
need the compared vectors meet normality assumption. This
is calculated as followed [41]:

Wherex1andx2are scores within group 1 (performance
values achieved by one compared method) and group 2 (per-
formance values achieved by another compared method), and
n1andn2are the sizes of the instances groups. The cardinality
symbol # indicates the number.
The effect size of Cliff’s Delta is divided into four levels:
|d|<0.147 (Negligible, N), 0.147≤|d|<0.333 (Small, S),
0.333≤|d|<0.474 (Medium, M) and |d|≥0.474 (Large,
L).
IV . E XPERMENTAL RESULTS
In this section, we report the experimental results for the
comparison of removing overlapping instances with without
removing overlapping instances to answer RQ1 and RQ2.
A. RQ1: How does class overlap inﬂuence the prediction per-
formance of existing within-project defect prediction models?
For answering the question, we replicate the experiments
on the 28 projects by NB, RF, SVM, KNN and LR classiﬁers
using IKMCCA VS. NCL VS. KMCCA VS. without removing
data, respectively. In IKMCCA method, the percentage p%i s
set as the percentage of defective instances in the training
data, and the parameter mis set as 20, that will be discussed
in section V . Parameters of KMCCA and NCL methods are setthe same as the references [34] and [18]. We randomly sample85% instances as training data, and the rest instances are astesting data. Noted that all compared methods are performedon Python3.6 and Scikit-learn (0.19.2) in our study. At thesame time, we repeat these experiments 20 times to avoid
randomness, and report the violin plots of the results for each
learning models in ﬁgures 3, 4 and 5. The violin plot combines
the characteristics of box plot and density plot which could
display the distribution and probability density of results. At

medium value.
From these ﬁgures, we can observe that using removing the
overlapping instances approaches including IKMCCA, NCLand KMCCA can get better medium values of bal,Recall
and AUC than these methods without removing overlapping
instances on NB, RF, SVM, KNN and LR classiﬁers. At the
same time, these WPDP learning models by using IKMCCAcan achieve best bal,Recall and AUC results than these
by using NCL and KMCCA for most projects. That is to
say, (i) compared with KMCCA, it is better to considerclass imbalance when solving class overlap; (ii) comparedwith NCL, it makes more sense to eliminate both defectiveinstances and non-defective instances.

Furthermore, in order to statistically investigate the exper-
imental results, we rank the WPDP learning models by non-
parametric Fredman test with post-hoc Nemenyi test. Figures
6, 7, 8 show the rank results in terms of bal,Recall and
AUC . From these ﬁgures we can ﬁnd that (i) for each WPDP
classiﬁer, IKMCCA is always in the ﬁrst rank, NCL andKMCCA are in same rank, and without removing approach is
in the last rank. (ii) Regardless of the different class overlap
methods, the NB classiﬁer always ranks the ﬁrst, and RF,/g54/g57/g48/g49/g37 /g53/g41 /g47/g53 /g46/g49/g49

KNN and LR rank the same. (iii) For SVM classiﬁer, using
IKMCCA method can achieve the second in these classiﬁers,
that is to say IKMCCA could greatly improve the predictingperformance for SVM.
In addition, in order to make a clearer comparison of
these models, we compare the effectiveness between without
removing method and each of class overlap methods in all 28projects based on Cliff’s Delta, and the results are shown intable IV.
For IKMCCA method, we can ﬁnd the values of effect size
are large for compared WPDP learning models in terms of bal,
Recall and AUC . For NCL methods, the values of effect size
in terms of baland Recall are most small, and the values of
effect size in terms of AUC are most Medium. For KMCCA,
the values of effect size in terms of bal,Recall and AUC are
all small. That is to say, for improving the performance of
learning models, considering both class overlap and class im-
balance is more effective than only considering class overlap.

B. RQ2: How does class overlap inﬂuence the prediction per-

These CPDP learning models are introduced in section II.A.
In IKMCCA method, the percentage pis set as the percentage
of defective instances in the training data, and the parameter m
is set as 20, that will be discussed in section V . Parameters of
KMCCA and NCL methods are set the same as the references
[34] and [18]. Note that the implementation of all comparedmethods is based on Python3.6 and Scikit-learn (0.19.2) in
our experiments. In order to avoid randomness, we repeat the
above experiments 20 times and report the violin plots of the
results for each learning models in ﬁgures 9, 10, 11.
From these ﬁgures, we can observe that the CPDP learning
models using IKMCCA, NCL and KMCCA can obtain the
better median values than these models without removingoverlapping instances in terms of bal,Recall and AUC .A t
the same time, the high density values getting by IKMCCA,NCL and KMCCA are better than that without removingoverlapping instances.
Furthermore, in order to statistically investigate the experi-
mental results, we apply the non-parametric Fredman test withpost-hoc Nemenyi test to rank the CPDP learning models.Figures 12, 13, 14 show the rank results in terms of bal,Recall
and AUC .

C. Answers to research questions
•RQ1: How does class overlap inﬂuence the prediction
performance of existing within-project defect prediction
models?
This work is to investigate whether it is feasible to
removing overlapping instances to improve the defectpredicting performance of the WPDP learning models.From the experimental results, we observe a statistically
signiﬁcant improvement in favor of removing overlapping
instances including IKMCCA, NCL and KMCCA. It isuseful to consider removing the overlapping instances
before building the WPDP defect prediction models, inparticular, using SVM as the classiﬁer. IKMCCA and
NCL can achieve better results than KMCCA for WPDP
classiﬁers. Therefore, it is better to consider class imbal-ance when dealing with class overlap. Also, IKMCCA
can achieve better than NCL, it can not only consider the
overlapping non-defective instances when handling bothclass overlap and class imbalance for WPDP.

V. D ISCUSSION
In previous section, we observe that removing the over-
lapping instances including IKMCCA, NCL and KMCCA
can achieve statistically better than that without removingfor WPDP and CPDP learning models. As IKMCCA could
achieve better results than KMCCA and NCL. Therefore, we
will discuss the performance of IKMCCA in this section.A. Performance with different p of IKMCCA
In this experiment, we investigate the impact of the pa-
rameter pto IKMCCA, we change the value of it in the
range of {
1
2,1
3,···,1
α,1
α+1,1
α+2}, whereαis the ratio of
all instances to defective instances in training data. To
avoid the randomness, we repeat 20 times and report the
average values of bal,Recall and AUC on PC4 project:
{CM1,MW 1,PC1,PC3}=>P C 4. Figures 15, 16 and
17 show the results for compared WPDP and CPDP learning
models on different p. Considering various factors, we can
observe that the parameter pbased on the ﬁxed ratio of the
number of defective instances to all instances can obtain better
performance for most learning models.

B. Effect of the parameter m for IKMCCA
In this experiment, we investigate the impact of the param-
eter mto IKMCCA, we change the value of it in the range
of{5,10,···,35,40}. To avoid the randomness, we repeat 20
times and report the average values of bal,Recall and AUC
on PC4 project: {CM1,MW 1,PC1,PC3}=>PC 4. Noted
that performance pis ﬁxed on the ratio of the number of
defective instances to all instances in this experiments. Figures
18, 19 and 20 show the results for compared WPDP and CPDPlearning models on different m. Considering various factors,

C. Why IKMCCA performs Best
The experimental results in above sections provide substan-
tial empirical support that removing overlapping instances can
improve the prediction performance. For all compared learningmodels, IKMCCA had a superior prediction performance
under WPDP and CPDP cases.
The performance of IKMCCA can be attributed to take
into account class imbalance factor in removing overlapping
instances. In IKMCCA, not only do we remove overlappinginstances in non-defective class, we also remove overlapping
instances in defective class. For example, if one cluster has
more than a certain proportion of non-defective instances,
the defective instances would be removed. To demonstratethis idea, we compare with NCL approach only considering

in section IV). Figures 3-14 show IKMCCA gain superiorperformance than NCL for learning models.
In addition, when IKMCCA removes overlapping instances,
the certain proportion pbased on the class imbalanced ratio
is taken into account. This is different from KMCCA only
removing top %poverlapping instances. Figures 3-14 indicate
considering the class imbalanced ratio could gain more adap-tation training datasets.

HREATS TO V ALIDITY
A. Threats to construct validity
Our study in SDP is a binary classiﬁcation indicating
whether one module is defective. The datasets used in our
experiments are collected from open-source or proprietary
projects, and the defect matching is relied on SZZ algorithm
[40], the discovered defective modules may be incomplete,
which is a potential threat to construct validity. However, theseprojects are often used in SDP studies previously, we alsoassume that the defect matching criteria is the best extentpossible.
B. Threats to Internal validity
The WPDP and CPDP learning models that we select are
not all WPDP and CPDP studies. To minimize this threat, weselect the learning models based on the existing systematicliterature reviews that provided a comparative study to SDP
models. The selected WPDP and CPDP learning models are
the benchmark for SDP, therefore, this would minimize thisthreat in our work.
C. Threats to External validity
The 28 projects used in this study are NASA, ReLink,
SOFTLAB, AEEEM and MORPH which are from either open-source projects (ReLink, MORPH and AEEEM) or proprietaryprojects (NASA and SOFTLAB), and are different in metricset, scales and types. However, they may threaten the gener-alizable results of closed software projects. In future, we willinvestigate more commercial software projects to reduce thisthreat.
VII. C
ONCLUSION
Software defect prediction utilizes the learning models to
detect the defective modules in software project. Also, theperformance of these learning models depend on the quality
of training data. Previous studies in the data quality of SDPmainly focus on class imbalance and feature redundancy. How-ever, in practical data collection, some instances with differentlabel may have similar values on some metrics, which resultsin overlap in feature space. Inspired by this, we propose animproved K-Means clustering cleaning approach (IKMCCA)to remove the overlapping instances, and investigate whetherIKMCCA, KMCCA and NCL are feasible to improve defect
detection performance for WPDP and CPDP.
We conduct the experiments to compare the performance of
state-of-the-art learning models on 28 projects, and the resultsmake clear that using these removing overlapping instances
could obtain signiﬁcantly better performance in terms of bal,
Recall and AUC . That is to say, the overlapping instances affect
the defect detecting performance of WPDP and CPDP learning
models. The effect size of IKMCCA is large, and the effectsize of NCL and KMCCA are small or medium for WPDP and
CPDP models, so considering class imbalance when dealing
with class overlap may achieve better results, meanwhile it cannot only consider the overlapping non-defective instances.
In the further works, we will employ removing overlapping
methods to more software defect prediction models and some
commercial projects to evaluate the performance.
