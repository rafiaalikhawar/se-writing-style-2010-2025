1 INTRODUCTION
Distributedmessagesystems(DMSs),suchasKafka[33],RabbitMQ
[58], ActiveMQ [2], and RocketMQ [61], have been widely adopt-
ed as the underlying communication backbone to support manydifferent real-time stream data processing applications. These ap-plications have vastly diverse characteristics. To support such di-
versities,DMSsprovidealargenumberofparameters forusersto
configure. For example, both Kafka and RocketMQ have 200+ pa-rametersthat an application can configure[33,61].
The configuration of these parameters significantly affects the
applicationperformanceonDMSs[42,84].Forinstance,changing
thebatch.size parameter of Kafka for three different test cases (#3,

mizingaDMStomeettheperformancerequirementofanapplica-tionhasfarsurpassedtheabilitiesoftypicalsystemusers[84].Asaresult,usersoften(haveto)acceptthedefaultsettings[42].Alter-natively, many organizations choose to hire expensive experts toconfigure the DMSs for their applications. Unfortunately, manualconfiguring is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often subop-timal. Therefore, there is a dire need for automatical application
configurationson DMSs.
Becauseconfigurationparametershavehighdimensionality,naive
exhaustive search is infeasible. Recently, learning-based configu-
ration has received much attention. In general, such an approach
constructsaperformance-predictionmodelusingtrainingsamplesofdifferentconfigurations,andthenexploresbetterconfigurationsusingsome searchingalgorithms. Although previousstudies onlearning-based configuration have shown promising results, onecriticalchallengeistoconstructbetterandmorerobustprediction

As discussed inSection4,CBMismorerobustthanPBM,becauseCBMusescom-binationsoftheoriginaltrainingsamples,whichresultsinasignif-

AutoConfig searches for better configurations by integrating the
CBM and E&E process under the time constraint. The key of the
AutoConfig is to train a more robust CBM using combinations of
original samples, and to search for promising area of parameter s-
pace using skewed random sampling strategy (i.e. wLHS). It alsoneeds to balance the effort on the initial sampling and the E&Eprocess.
Insummary,our workmakes the followingcontributions:

2 RELATEDWORK
DMS configuration has received much attention from both indus-try and academia. Previous studies on this problem can be classi-fiedintofourcategories:model-based,measurement-based,search-based, and learning-based configuration approaches, as discussednext. The best practices on DMS configuration are also reviewedatthe end of this section.
2.1 Model-based Configuration
In model-based configuration, an analytical model is constructedon the early-cycle of the development of a software system [80].Balsamoetal.[5]reviewedthemodel-basedsoftwareperformanceprediction methods before 2004. Koziolek et al. [38] surveyed themodel-basedperformanceevaluationmethodsforcomponent-basedsoftware systems. Commonly used models include queueing net-
work[43,44,47],PetriNet[20,35–37],PalladioComponentModel
(PCM)[59],and others [23,27, 48,56].
Model-based configuration has two main limitations. First, it
relies on analytical or design models derived from mathematicaltheories or software architecture abstraction, which are typically

coarse grained and could be imprecise [13]. Second, model-based
configurationcannotadaptasframeworksorhardwareevolve.Oncethearchitectureofaspecificsoftwaresystemchanges,theexistinganalytical models may not work and need to be redesigned. The
sameissuearisesasclustersevolvewithnewprocessors,memory,
andstorage technologies [77].
2.2 Measurement-based Configuration
Measurement-based configuration aims to evaluate software ap-
plication focusing on the performance quality features such as re-
sponsetimeandthroughput.Theseapproachesmainlyrelyonsta-tistical inferencing techniques to derive performance predictionsbasedonbenchmarkedmeasurementdata,suchas[4,9,10,15,17,21, 24, 39, 41, 55, 67, 70, 79, 89]. In this process, many strategies,suchassampling[12,46,68],profiling[13,87],symbolicevaluation[60], and feature interactions [69], are proposed to accelerate per-formance inference. The prevalent DMS benchmarks are SPECjm-s2007 [64], jms2009-PS [63], DDSBench [19], and two benchmark
suitesintroduced in [3, 11].
Measurement-basedapproacheshavetwomaindrawbacks.First,
they collect program profiles to identify performance bottlenecks,
which often fail to capture the overall program performance [13].
Second, most of these approaches lack generality [1], as they are
applicableonlytospecificapplicationscenariosorinfrastructures[15,85].
2.3 Search-based Configuration
Search-basedapproachesregardconfigurationproblemasablack-box optimization problem and uses search algorithms to solve it,such as in [26, 49, 51, 54, 72, 78]. The objective of the search isto evaluate candidate solutions of different parameters to mini-mizeanobjectivefunction.Thesearchstrategiesincluderecursiverandom search (RRS) heuristics [52, 86], evolutionary algorithms
[16, 53, 81], hill-climbing algorithms [83], and recursive bound &
search[90].
Search-based configuration is simpler and more general com-
paredtootherapproaches,becauseittakesthetargetsoftwaresys-temasablack-boxfunctionanddoesnotneeddetailedinformationabouttheinternals.However,theseapproacheshavetoruntheap-plication at each iteration of the search, which is time consuming
(andimpractical)whenoptimizinglarge-scaleproductionsystems.
2.4 Learning-based Configuration
Most relevant to our work is learning-based configuration. Theseapproaches try to construct performance prediction models firstby observing a large collection of running results under differentparameterconfigurations,andthenapplysomesearchalgorithms
tofindtheoptimalconfigurationbasedonthesemodels.Forexam-
ple,Sarkaretal.[65]adaptedprogressiveandprojectivesamplingstrategiestoperformancepredictionofconfigurablesystems.Guoet al. [22] used CART to predict the performance of configurablesystems.Zhangetal.[88]proposedanalgorithmbasedonFourierlearning (FL) for the performance prediction of configurable sys-tems.Sayyadetal.[66]employedacombinationofstaticandevo-lutionary learning of model structure to find sound and optimumconfigurations.Soltanietal.[71]employedanartificialintelligenceplanning technique to automatically select suitable features thatsatisfytheusers’businessconcernsandresourcelimitations.Tang[73]provided an approach to find better configurations using ran-domforestsmodelandgeneticalgorithmbasedsearchingstrategy.
Tantithamthavorn et al. [74] applied Caret method to investigate
the performance of defect prediction models. Nair et al. [50] pro-posed a spectral learning based method to explore the configura-tion space efficiently to find the measurement that reveal key per-formance characteristics. Jamshidi et al. [29] proposed a Gaussianprocesses (GPs)-based method to iteratively capture posterior dis-tributions of the configuration spaces and sequentially drive theexperimentation. Bei et al. [6] integrated the random-forest andgenetic algorithm to automatically configure the Hadoop config-
uration parameters for optimized performance for a given appli-
cation and cluster. Jamshidi et al. [30, 31] conducted an empiricalstudyonfourpopularsoftwaresystemstoidentifythekeyknowl-edge pieces that can be exploited for transfer learning. Chen et al.[14] proposed a transfer learning based approach to facilitate theconfigurationof large-scale computing systems.
Learning-basedapproachesrequireconsiderablenumbersofsam-
plestoconstructausefulperformance-predictionmodelforasoft-
ware system [51]. This requirement is challenging here because
only a limited set of samples can be acquired under a given timeconstraint,sinceitistimeconsumingtosampleonadeployedpro-duction system. To address this issue, we need to derive a robustprediction model by sampling the high-dimension configurationspace wisely, which motivated us to propose a novel comparison-based model and a weighted LHS sampling method.

3 PROBLEM STATEMENT
In this paper, we study the configuration problem for distributedmessage systems (short for CDMSproblem). As illustrated in Fig-
ure 2, a distributed message system (e.g. Kafka, RocketMQ, Rab-bitMQ, etc.) is often deployed on a cloud environment comprised
ofacollectionofinterconnectedvirtualmachines(VMs).Itserves
as a real-time streaming data pipelines that transfer messages formany systems. Once a DMS has been deployed, the user needs to

specify its configurations according to the specific application s-
cenario, and such configurations have a significant impact on theperformance of the DMS [3,42,62, 84].
The goal of CDMSproblem is to find an optimal configuration
thatmaximizesthe(producer-side)throughputofaDMSwithinapredefined time period, given a specific DMS, an application, and
the underlying runtime environment. The reason we choose the
throughput metricisbecauseitcantellhowmuchdataaDMScan
storeinaunitoftime,whichcharacterizesthemostimportantca-pabilityofaDMS.Othermeasurement,suchasend-to-endlatency
(i.e. how long does it take for a message to go though the DMS),
can be also introduced as a target metric, because our approach is
with generality, and is independent to the metric being optimized.
Specially, CDMSproblemhas the followingcomponents.
Application: An application represents a real-time streaming
dataproducingsystem(producers)thatwantstotransfermessagestotransaction systems (consumers).Wemodel it as a 5-tupleA=/angbracketleftl,p,s,r,q /angbracketright, where lrepresents the length of a message; pis
the number of producers; sindicates the message sending mode
(synchronous or asynchronous); rdenotes the message receiving
mode (with or without acknowledgement); and qdesignates the
number of available servers(queues).
Runtime Environment : Runtime environment is the execu-
tionenvironmentprovided to a DMS. Wemodel it as a 5-tuple
E=/angbracketlefto,f,m,d,w /angbracketright, where odenotes the number of CPU cores; f
is the CPU frequency; mrepresents the physical memory size; d
indicates the available disk space; and wreflects the networking
setup.
Configuration and Throughput: Let C=(c
1,c2,···,cn)be
the configuration of a DMS. For example, one can configure as
many as 200+ parameters in a Kafka platform, such as the num-ber of network processing threads, the number of I/O processingthreads, maximum number of requests in a queue, memory buffersize, etc., as shown in Table 1. Given a configuration Cfor an ap-
plication Aand its environment E, the throughput is denoted as
TP(A,E,C).
TimeConstraint :Inpractice,thetimeforconfigurationtuning
isoftenrestricted.Wedefinethisrestrictedtuningtimeas timecon-
straint, denoted as TC. Any solution to the CDMSproblem must
terminatewhen TCis met.

The key idea of our approach is to generate a set of samples thatis used to train a comparison-based model, and search for morepromising configurations using the trained model. Figure 3 illus-tratesthreeimportantstepsonourproposedAutoConfigapproach.

set of different configurations using classic Latin hypercube sam-

4.1 Comparison-based Model
Thekeystepofalearning-basedconfigurationapproachistocon-structaperformance-predictionmodelfortheDMS.Typically,sucha model is evaluated based on its accuracy or error. The error per-centagecan be computed as:
MMRE =|predicted −actual|
actual·100 (3)
In this paper, we propose a novel approach that constructs a
comparison-basedmodel (CBM)whichisdifferentfromtheprediction-
based model (PBM) used by most of the previous learning-basedapproaches as described in Section 2.4. Specially, given the fixedAandE, and two different configurations C
1andC2, our model
(denoted as f:C×C→{0,1}) can compare the throughput
values of the DMS with C1andC2:
f(C1,C2)=/braceleftBigg
1,T P(A,E,C 1)≤TP(A,E,C 2)
0,T P(A,E,C 1)>TP(A,E,C 2)(4)
Thereareanumberofadvantagesofusingacomparison-based
approach:
•Performance comparison is extremely robust since it is only
mildly affected by outliers [51]. In the context of parame-ter configuration, a practitioner is often more interested inknowingtherank(bycomparison)ratherthanthepredictedperformance scores.
•Performance comparison is the ultimate goal of our CDMSproblem.Ausermayjustwanttoidentifythebestconfigura-tions rather than to predict the performance of a given sys-
tem under different configurations. For example, an admin-
istratortryingtooptimizeaKafkaplatformistosearchforasetofconfigurationsthatcanobtainmaximumthroughput,andis not interested in the whole configuration space.
•Performance comparison increases the number of availabletraining samples significantly . Suppose we have a set con-
tainingnsamplesbyrunning ndifferentconfigurations.We
can generate/parenleftbig

any two configurations and their throughput values. We
willdemonstrateintheexperimentsectionthatthecomparison-
basedmodelhasbetterperformancethanconventionalprediction-basedapproaches,sincethenumberoftrainingsamplesavail-abletoconstructacomparison-basedapproachisincreasedconsiderably.
Besides,insteadofusingresidualmeasuresoferrors,asdescribed
inEquation(3),whichdependonresiduals(r =actual−predicte ),
we use a rank-based measure [50]. Once the comparison-based
model is trained, the accuracy of the model is measured by sort-ingthe throughputvalues of ndifferentconfigurations, that is:
TP(A,E,C
1)≤TP(A,E,C 2)≤···≤TP(A,E,C n)(5)Parameter XParameter Y
Figure4: Twosets of LHS samples for a 2D space
Obviously, Equation (5) can be generated by simply using somesortalgorithm (e.g.quick sort) and continuously applying ourcomparison-basedmodeltocomparethethroughputvaluesbetweentwo configurations. After obtaining the predicted rank order, it iscomparedtotheactualrankorder.Therankaccuracy(RA)isthuscalculated using the mean rank difference:

andmeasuresthe averageof magnitude of the ranking difference.
4.2 Weighted Latin Hypercube Sampling
OneimportantcomponentinourAutoConfigalgorithmisthesam-
pling strategy. Because the configuration parameter space is highdimensional, naive sample methods such as random or grid sam-pling can become very expensive, and is hard to provide a goodcoverage in it, especially with a small number of samples [86, 90].
To address this issue, we note that the Latin hypercube sampling(LHS) performs better, compared to random or grid sampling, be-
cause it allows each of the key parameters to be represented in afullystratifiedmanner,nomatterwhichparametersareimportant
[45]. Specifically, LHS divides the range of each parameter into k
intervals and take only one sample from each interval with equal
probabilities[45].Figure4illustratestwosetsofLHSsampleswithfiveintervalsina2Ddimension,onedenotedbydotsandtheotherbytriangles.
TomakeLHSmoreefficient,weobservethattheperformanceof
a DMS is often dominated by a few key configuration parameters
(e.g.seeFigure1),andtheimpactofaninfluentialparameter’sval-
uesontheperformancecanbedemonstratedthroughcomparison-
sofperformances,regardlessotherparameters’values[90].Based
onthisobservation,weproposedweightedLHS(wLHS),whichex-tendsthestandardLHSalgorithmtotakeintoaccountknowledgeabout the correlations between configuration parameters and sys-temperformance.Suchcorrelationscorrespondtoalinearapproxi-mationoftheobjectivefunction,whichcanbeestimatedusingthesampled points.

Among many models, we adopt linear regression, a simple yet
effectivestatisticalmethod,tomeasurethestrengthoftherelation-
shipbetweenoneormoredependentvariables(y)andeachofthe
independent variables (x). These relationships are modeled usingalinearpredictorfunctionwhoseweights(i.e.,coefficients)arees-timated from the data. More specifically, wLHS employs a regu-larized version of least squares, known as Lasso [75], to estimatetheweightforeachconfigurationparameter.Lassocanreducetheeffectofirrelevantvariablesinlinearregressionmodelsbypenaliz-ingmodelswithlargeweights.ThemajoradvantageofLassooverother methods is that it is interpretable, stable, and computation-
ally efficient [75]. There are also many practical and theoretical
studies that have proven its effectiveness as a promising featureselection algorithm [76].
Lasso performs L1 regularization, which adds a penalty equal
to the sum of absolute weights times a constant λto the regres-
sion error. This type of regularization can result in sparse models
withfewnonzerocoefficients.Therefore,Lassoregressionisableto
perform variable selection in the liner model. Variables with non-zeroregressioncoefficientsvariablesaremoststronglyassociated
withtheresponsevariable. λistheturningfactorthatcontrolsthe

regression, and tracks what configurations are added back to the
model at each step. wLHS uses the order in which the configura-tions first appear in the regression to determine how much of animpact they have on the target metric (e.g., the first configurationselected is the most important).
The key ideas in wLHS is that samples should follow the corre-
lation pattern exhibited by the Lasso-based weight calculation. Ifthe past measurements show that smaller values of configurationc
i∈Ctendtomaketheperformancebetter(i.e.,astrongpositive
correlation), then smaller values are more important than largerones. Hence we should sample more on the smaller values for pa-rameterc
i.
To realize the above weighted sampling idea, we use a truncat-
edexponentialdensityfunctionproposedbyXi[83]forgeneratingthe samples. For each component parameter c

(i=1,2,···,n),weassumeatruncatedexponentialdensityfunc-
tionof the form:

knowledge about the correlations between configuration parame-
ters and system performance from past observations. The weight
can be based on other metrics (rather than correlation), also onecan choose other density functions rather than exponential to re-alize a similar concept of assigning different weights on differentsamplingregions[83].

AutoConfig initially samples hconfigurations using standard
LHS(line1)andpicks bconfigurationswiththebestperformance
(line 2-3). With these hinitial samples, we use Lasso method to
calculate weight set Ωfor configuration parameters (line 5). To
explore the configuration space, we apply wLHS with Ωandhin-
tervals, and choose bconfigurations randomly (line 6). After that,
werun these bconfigurations on the DMSand use the resultsto
generatethe explorationset EP (line 7).
Based on already generated samples, we train a comparison-
based prediction model based on random forests (line 9), which
indicatesbetterperformanceamongmanydifferentmachinelearn-ingalgorithms.
Toexploitthepreviously-foundbestconfigurations,weapplya
bound and search (BS) algorithm [90] to find potential better con-
figurations near already known good configurations (line 10-16).
This strategy works well in practice because there is a high possi-bilitythatonecanfindotherconfigurationswithsimilarorbetterperformancesaroundtheconfigurationwiththebestperformanceinthesampleset[90].Morespecifically,foreachconfiguration C

resented in Ciand that is larger than that of Ci. The same bound-
ing mechanism are carried out for every component parameter in
Ci. Figure 6 illustrates this bounding mechanism of BS with 2D s-
pace(fivedots C1–C5).Afterdeterminingtheboundfor Ci,weuse
wLHS again to divide each bound into hintervals and generate h
samplescloseto Ci(line12).Giventhese hconfigurations,weuse
the trained prediction model Mto choose the best configuration
C∗
i(line 13), and then collect the corresponding throughput TP∗
i
by running the DMSwithC∗
i(line 14). After that, the sample
(C∗

i) is added to the exploitation set EI(line 15). We repeat
theseboundandsearchstepsuntileveryconfigurationin Bistest-
ed,andupdate Bwiththebest bconfigurationsfrom B/uniontextEP/uniontextEI
(line 17). We refine MandΩby adding new samples from explo-
rationandexploitationphasestothetrainingset T(line8and18).
Oncethetimebudgetonexplorationandexploitationismet,we
stopsearchingand returnthe best configuration in B(line 20).
To satisfy the overall time constraint, we divide the AutoCon-
figalgorithmintotwophases,i.e.initialsampling,andexplorationand exploitation. Suppose the time constraint is TC, the propor-
tion of time spent in these two phases is denoted as αandβre-
spectively, where α+β=1and0≤α,β≤1. Let the average
timeofrunninganapplicationwithoneconfigurationonthe DMS
equals to t, we have h≈⌊
α∗TC
t⌋and andb≈⌊β∗TC
2*iter∗t⌋, where
iterrepresent the approximate iterations in the exploration and
exploitation phase, and h,bare hyperparameters in AutoConfig
algorithm.

via a high-speed1.5Gbps LAN.
System and configuration setup . We choose Kafka as our experi-
mental system. Kafka is a distributed streaming platform for pub-lishing and subscribing to streams of records, which is similar toa message queue or enterprise messaging system. We choose Kaf-
kabecauseitisawidelyadoptedopen-sourcedistributedmessage
system.
BasedontheKafkamanual[34]andpreviousstudies[18,42,82],
we identify 11 out of 200+ parameters that are considered critical
to the performance of Kakfa platform, as listed in Table 1. Notethat even with only 11 parameters, the search space is still enor-mous, and exhaustive search is infeasible. The reason we choosea small subset of parameters that have great impact on perfor-mance instead of all configurable parameters is because reducing
the number of tuning parameters can reduce the search space ex-
ponentially, and most existing automatic configuration approach-es [18, 42, 82] also adopt this feature selection strategy. It’s worthnoting that because of the linear computing complexity of wLHSonthenumberofparameters,ourapproachisgeneralenoughand
worksfor high-dimensional parameter spaces.
Benchmark. Based on the previous Kafka testing experiences
[25, 40], we design eight testing scenarios with the combination-s of different numbers of producers, message sizes, and message
acknowledgement modes. Table 2 lists these testing setups.
5.2 Baseline Algorithms
To evaluate the performance of AutoConfig, we compare it with
five state-of-the-art algorithms, namely random search [7], Best-Config[90],RFHOC[6],Hyperopt[8],andSMAC[28].Weprovide
abriefdescriptionforeachalgorithmandreportitshyperparame-ters(if necessary)as follows:
Randomsearch(Random) isasearch-basedapproachthatex-
plores each dimension of parameters uniformly at random. It ismore efficient than grid search in high-dimensional configurationspaces,and is a high-performance baseline,as suggested in [7].Table2: Testingscenarios of our experiment

1In Kafka,Ack=1means that the leader will write the recordto its local
logbut will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement fromall
followers.Ack=-1means that the leader will wait for the full set ofin-syncreplicasto acknowledge the record.For moredetails, see in [34].
BestConfig2is a search-based approach that uses divide-and-
divergesamplingandrecursivebound-and-searchalgorithmtofind

RFHOC is a learning-based approach that constructs a predic-
tion model using random forests, and a genetic algorithm to auto-maticallyexploretheconfigurationspace.Weusethehyperparam-
eterssuggested in [6].
Hyperopt

h,andbforeach testing scenario areset to 10 and 5, respectively.
For each run in our experiments, every algorithm is executed
under the same time constraint and stops once the constraint is
met.
5.3 Evaluation Metrics
We consider two performance metrics in our experiments for per-
formance evaluation, namely rank accuracy (RA) and throughput
(TP).RAisametricthatevaluatesthepredictionmodel,andTPis
theultimate performance metric for AutoConfig.
Rank accuracy (RA). As defined in Section 4, RA is used here
toevaluatethequalityofapredictedranking(theprediction)fora
set of configurations by comparing it with the corresponding real
ranking (the truth). Note again that the ranking-ability of a pre-diction model is more important than its prediction accuracy in
AutoConfig, because we need to use a prediction model to choose
the best configurations in each exploitation phase of Algorithm 1
(line 13 in Algorithm 1).
Throughput (TP) . TP is the rate of successful message deliv-
erytoadistributedmessagesystem(i.e.producer-sidethroughput).

5.4 Experiment Results
RA.Thefirstexperimentistoevaluatethequalityofrankingwithdifferent prediction models. We first construct a sample pool by
running Kafka with randomly generated 150 different configura-tions. After that, 50 samples are selected randomly and then re-movedfromthepooltogeneratethe testingset.Last,werandomly
choose10,20, ···,100samplesfromthepooltoconstruct10differ-
enttrainingsets.Tworandomforestsbasedpredictionmodels,one
is a comparison-based model (CBM) and another is a prediction-basedmodel(PBM),aretrainedusingthesetrainingsets.Wethenuse these trained models to find the best 10 configurations fromtesting set, respectively. Table 3 lists the RA values on CBM and
PBM. We find that all these RA values of CBM outperform those
of PBM, and the average improvement is 5.3%. The results also in-dicatethattheCBMcanfind9bestconfigurationsoutof10exper-iments,wherePBM only finds 6 out of 10.
Throughput. Given a fixed time constraint (TC) for each test-
ing scenario, we run six different tuning algorithms plus defaultconfiguration independently. Table 4 lists the throughput (MB/s).
Asexpected,thedefaultconfigurationdoesnotperformwell.Our
algorithm achieves an average of 215.40% improvement over the
default configurations. Furthermore, AutoConfig outperforms al-
lotherfivealgorithms:11.95%-25.22%improvementoverRandom,
7.21%-27.45%improvementoverBestConfig,9.52%-38.44%improve-
ment over RFHOC, 10.41%-49.58% improvement over Hyperopt,and9.66%-64.56% improvementoverSMAC.
Finally, we plot the overall throughput improvement percent-
age of BestConfig, RFHOC, Hyperopt, SMAC and AutoConfig inFigure 7, using the random algorithm as the baseline. In the Fig-ure7,x-axisliststheeighttestingscenariosand y-axisrepresents
the improvement percentage over the random algorithm. We ob-serve that compared with the random algorithm, our approach
achieves11.95%–35.51%improvementamongalltestingscenarios.
AutoConfigachievesanaverageof20.78%improvementoverRan-
dom, 17.71% improvement over BestConfig, 22.03% improvement
over RFHOC, 20.52% improvement over Hyperopt, and 23.68% im-provement over SMAC. We can conclude from Figure 7 that Au-toConfig achieves stable and significant improvements compared
with the other five algorithms. Another interesting observation
fromFigure7isthattherandomsearchachievessurprisinglygoodresults in our experiments. This is consistent with the findings of
Bergstraand Bengio in [7].
5.5 Threatsto Validity
Internal validity : To increase internal validity, we performed a
controlledbenchmarkexperimentbyexecutingeachtestcasefive
times and calculate the average of these five runs. Such methodcan avoid misleading effects of specifically selected test cases andensuresthestabilityofthethroughputresultforeachscenario.Inaddition, we use the same sample set and the same random-forestmodel with identical hyperparameter values to compare the rankaccuracy for the CBM and the PBM in each test case. Such results
are reliable and can be treated as the ground truth. In our experi-
ments, the value of the time proportion αandβ(they control the
time ratio between model training and E&E phases, and in turndecide the hyperparameters handbof AutoConfig) are set to 0.4
and 0.6 respectively, and the value of constant cin Equation (7) is
setto5(assuggestedin[83]).However,thevaluesoftheseparam-eters are domain-specific, and can be set by a domain expert. N-evertheless,incaseswheretheprecisevaluesareunknown,usingthemiddlevalue(for αandβ)andthevaluesuggestedbyprevious
study [83] (for c) seems to be reasonable choices. In addition, we
tried multiple values of these parameters in our experiments andobservedthatthegoodvaluesoftheseparametersthatcanleadtobetter throughputresultsaredifferentfromtest case to test case.
Externalvalidity :Weaimedatincreasingexternalvalidityby
choosingeighttestingscenarioswithvariousapplication-levelpa-rameters on a mainstream open source software Kafka. Further-more, we are aware that because the two key components of Au-toConfig,i.e.comparison-basedmodelandweightedLHS,aregen-
eralenoughandindependenttothesystemundertune(SUT)[90],
theresultsof our evaluationsaretransferable to other DMSs.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose AutoConfig – an automatic configura-tion system to optimize throughput for DMSs. AutoConfig con-structs a novel comparison-based model (CBM) different from theprediction-basedmodel(PBM)usedbypreviouslearning-basedap-proaches. Intensive experiments show that our CBM can obtainbetter results than that of PBM, under the same random forestsbasedmethodandagiventimeconstraint.Furthermore,theAuto-
ConfigalgorithmusesweightedLHSmethodtoselectasetofsam-
ples that can provide a better coverage over the high-dimensionalparameter space, and searches for more promising configurations
