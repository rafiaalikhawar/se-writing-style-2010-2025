Abstract —Developers use many software applications to pro-
cess large amounts of diverse information in their daily work. The
information is usually meaningful beyond the context of an appli-
cation that manages it. However, as different applications function
independently, developers have to manually track, correlate and
re-ﬁnd cross-cutting information across separate applications. We
refer to this difﬁculty as information fragmentation problem.
In this paper, we present ActivitySpace , an interapplication
activity tracking and analysis framework for tackling information
fragmentation problem in software development. ActivitySpace
can monitor the developer’s activity in many applications at a
low enough level to obviate application-speciﬁc support while
accounting for the ways by which low-level activity information
can be effectively aggregated to reﬂect the developer’s activity
at higher-level of abstraction. A system prototype has been
implemented on Microsoft Windows. Our preliminary user study
showed that the ActivitySpace system is promising in supporting
interapplication information needs in developers’ daily work.
I. I NTRODUCTION
Software developers are a typical example of knowledge
workers [1]. Their work produces, consumes and communi-
cates large amounts of diverse information. Integrated Devel-
opment Environments (IDEs) have been designed to maximize
developer productivity by integrating separate software devel-
opment tools, such as editor, build tool, debugger, version
control, and project management. However, today’s software
development involves not only software development tools but
also many other software applications specializing in different
tasks. For example, developers use web browsers to search the
Web, ask or answer questions in Q&A sites, or communicate
with other developers on social media.
The information associated with the work of developers
is usually meaningful beyond the context of an application
that manages it. For example, the developer encounters an
unexpected error in the IDE, and then searches the Web for
solutions. He reads some web pages and ﬁnds a solution on
Stack Overﬂow. This solution contains a code example shared
on jsﬁddle.net. He tests the code example on jsﬁddle and ﬁnds
the code useful for his error. He ﬁnally integrates the code
example in his code. In this example, source code the developer
works on, program error he encounters, search queries he
uses, web pages he visits, and code example on jsﬁddle are
all correlated, but they are managed in various desktop and
web applications, including IDE, web browser, Stack Overﬂow,
jsﬁddle, respectively.
These applications function independently of one another.
This independence creates a problem of information fragmen-tation , forcing the developer to manually correlate and re-
ﬁnd cross-cutting information across separate applications. For
example, during a task, the developer may be interrupted by
another task. Once he is done with the other task, he needs
to resume his working context across several applications
for the previous task, including not only source ﬁles but
also Stack Overﬂow posts and code examples on jsﬁddle. As
another example, two week later, the developer’s colleague
encounters a similar error. The developer believes that one of
the Stack Overﬂow posts he read before would be useful for his
colleague. Web browsing history does not help much because
there are too many browsing activities on Stack Overﬂow that
are irrelevant to that particular error. He recalls the source
ﬁle involved in his previous task. However, the information
fragmentation problem makes it difﬁcult for him to re-ﬁnd the
Stack Overﬂow posts that he visited while he worked on that
source ﬁle two weeks ago.
Today’s software development practice calls for innovation-
s to support interapplication information needs in software de-
velopment, going beyond tool integration (e.g., IBM Jazz [2],
SeaHawk [3]) and information management within separate
applications (e.g., Mylyn [4], Context Web History [5]). In this
work, we aim to develop mechanisms that unobtrusively track
and effectively aggregate cross-cutting activities in developer’s
daily work, to ease the process of re-ﬁnding cross-cutting
information across applications.
The challenge is to monitor the developer’s activity in
many applications at a low enough level to obviate application-
speciﬁc support while accounting for the ways in which
information at this low level fails to accurately reﬂect the
developer’s activity at higher-level of abstraction. To tackle
this challenge, we design ActivitySpace system that supports
interapplication activity tracking, aggregation, search, and ex-
ploration. We have implemented a ActivitySpace prototype on
Microsoft Windows. We conducted a user study of the Activi-
tySpace prototype, in which we collected 417 hours activity
data from 8 participants. Using this data, we analyzed the
information fragmentation problem in software development
and showed that ActivitySpace is promising in supporting
interapplication information needs in developers’ daily work.

instrumentation and computer vision techniques; 2) Activity
Analysis identiﬁes cross-cutting activities and documents likely
to be relevant based on temporal locality [6]; and 3) Activity
Interface provides episodic and semantic User Interfaces (UIs)
to help the developer search and browse cross-cutting activities
and documents from various perspectives.
A. Activity Tracker
The ActivityTracker component monitors the developer’s
actions in the applications being used. It generates a se-
quence of time-ordered action records stored in the action
records database. Action records collect the low-level Human-
Computer Interaction (HCI) data, including window informa-
tion, focused UI information and screenshot.
Three factors must be taken into account when designing
theActivityTracker :generality (i.e., easy to deploy to track
the developer’s actions in a wide range of commonly used
software applications), unobtrusiveness (i.e., do not disturb the
developers’ normal work ﬂow), and efﬁciency (i.e., real-time
activity tracking and data collection). At the same time, the
collected action data should be easy to aggregate to infer the
developer’s activity at higher-level of abstraction.
To satisfy these design requirements, the ActivityTracker
component combines OS level instrumentation and screen
capture technique. As the developer is using a software appli-
cation, OS level instrumentation collects window and focused
UI information that applications expose to operating system,
while screen-capture technique records the screenshots which
can be analyzed using computer vision techniques to infer
the developer’s actions. These two techniques do not require
application-speciﬁc support, and thus can be easily deployed
in many applications and operating systems. Furthermore, they
can provide real-time activity tracking with very little data
collection overhead, and will not disturb the developer’s work.
1) OS Level Instrumentation: ActivityTracker uses a mouse
hook to monitor mouse click actions. The user can specify
which application(s) he wants or does not want ActivityTracker
to monitor. Once a mouse click occurs in a to-be-monitored
t1

application, ActivityTracker uses OS window APIs and accessi-
bility APIs to extract two kinds of information: window infor-
mation and focused UI information. The extracted information
will be time-stamped and stored as an action record in the
action records database.
Using OS window APIs, ActivityTracker extracts the fol-
lowing window information: the WinTitle andBoundary of the
focused application window in which the mouse click occurs,
thePosition of mouse click, the ParentWinTitle of the root
parent window of this application window, and the Process
Name of the application. Using accessibility APIs, Activity-
Tracker extracts the following information of the focused UI
component: UI Name ,UI Type ,UI Value andUI Boundary of
the focused UI component, and the UI Name andUI Type of
the root parent UI component.
Due to privacy reason, the keyboard monitoring is disabled
by default. If keyboard monitoring is enabled, ActivityTracker
uses a keyboard hook to monitor keyboard actions in a same
way as monitoring mouse click actions.
Fig. 2 shows an example of two action records. The ﬁrst
action occurs in Firefox. The developer searches java calendar
on Google. The second action occurs in Eclipse. The developer
works on TimelineExample.java source ﬁle in code editor.
2) Screen Capture: Accessibility API provides a generic
way to track the developer’s actions in different software
applications. However, it requires application developers toinvest additional engineering effort to properly expose the
internal data of the application when developing the software.
As a result, not all applications expose their internal data to
accessibility API, or not all the information is exposed1.
To deal with the variety of accessibility support and to
capture the application context of the developer’s actions,
ActivityTracker uses OS window APIs to record a screenshot of
the application when a mouse click or keyboard action occurs
in the application. This screenshot provides a supplementary
information for accessibility information. The screenshots will
be stored together with the corresponding action records in
the action records database. The screenshots will be used in
two ways. First, it can be aggregated with the mouse position
information to infer application-speciﬁc actions that cannot be
tracked using accessibility API, for example, setting breakpoint
in Eclipse code editor. Second, replaying a time-series of
screenshots can help the developer recall when he did what
by invoking episodic memory [7].
B. Activity Analysis
As a new action record arrives on the server, the Action-
Inference component ﬁrst infers an action transcript (appli-
cation being used, developer action, document involved and
document content) from the action record. Action transcript
is stored in the action transcripts database. Then, the Digest-
Collector component updates application usage and document
usage statistics for the most recent action transcripts in a
ﬁxed-length time window. These usage statistics are referred
asrecent activities digest stored in recent activities digest
database. The ActivityAggregator component runs at a given
time interval to periodically aggregates action transcripts into
history activities stored in the history activities database. An
activity represents all the actions performed on a document
within an application during a period of time. Further infor-
mation such as correlated activities, topics in documents used,
edit history of documents can be extracted from activities.
Note that these activity analyses are time consuming, and
thus cannot be performed by the ActivityTracker . Otherwise,
theActivityTracker cannot satisfy the unobtrusiveness and
efﬁciency requirements.
1) Inferring Developer Actions: TheActionInference com-
ponent ﬁrst tries to infer action transcript from the window and
focused UI information of the action record. Application being
used can be determined from the Process Name attribute of
the window information. Document involved in the action can
be determined from the WinTitle orParentWinTitle attribute
of the window information. For example, in Fig. 2, at time
t1the application being used is ﬁrefox.exe and the document
involved is java calendar - Google Search . At time t2the ap-
plication being used is eclipse.exe and the document involved
is.../TimelineExample.java .
If the focused UI component supports accessibility API,
ActionInference can use the UI Name and/or UI Type attributes
of the focused UI information to infer the developer action
over the UI component. Furthermore, the detailed document
content can usually be extracted from the UI Value attribute.
1Visit http://baolingfeng.weebly.com/accessibility-survey.html for the re-
sults of our investigation of accessibility support in commonly used software
applications on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.For example, at time t1the developer action is Search (UI
Name ) and the document content is java calendar (UI Value ).
At time t2the developer is in an edit component ( UI Type ),
the source ﬁle is TimelineExample.java ((Parent UI Name ), and
the ﬁle content can be extracted from the UI Value attribute.
However, not all UI components expose accessibility in-
formation to accessibility API. This is especially the case for
ﬁne-grained UI components, such as buttons or UI decorators.
For example, the breakpoint
on the editor ruler in Eclipse
edit component cannot be accessed by accessibility API. As
another example, the tab close button
in Firefox tabs cannot
be accessed by accessibility API. In such cases, ActionInfer-
ence will use image template matching techniques to determine
the UI component that the developer interacts with and to infer
the developer’s action.
ActionInference uses two kinds of image template matching
techniques for different situations, as implemented in our video
scraping tool scvRipper [8]. The ﬁrst technique is key point
based template matching [9], [10]. The second technique is
template matching with alpha mask [11], because some small
icons may not have enough key points. To detect the small
icons in the screenshot, the ActivitySpace user needs to provide
some template images of the icons that he wants the system to
recognize and associate the template images with some actions.
Once the icon is detected in the screenshot, ActionInference
will examine the mouse position against the icon position in the
screenshot to determine whether the mouse action is over the
icon. Then, based on the action deﬁnition associated with the
icon, ActionInference can determine what action the developer
performs in the action record. For example, ActionInference
can infer that the developer action is set breakpoint in code
editor by recognizing the breakpoint icon
and linking it to
mouse action. This computer-vision based action recognition
complements the accessibility information.
2) Generating Recent Activity Digest: TheDigestCollector
component maintains a recent activity digest for the most
recent actions in a ﬁxed-length time window. Once a new
action transcript is added in the action transcripts database,
DigestCollector ﬁnds the archived action transcripts within X
minutes ( X= 30 by default) from the latest action transcript.
It then collects the application usage and document usage s-
tatistics in these action transcripts, including applications being
used and the time spent on each application, and document
being used and the time spent on each document. These
application usage and document usage statistics constitute
recent activity digest in the latest activity digest time window,
which will be updated in Recent Activity Digest Viewer .
3) Aggregating History Activities: At a given time interval
Yminutes ( Y= 60 by default), the ActivityAggretator
component will be launched to aggregate the action transcripts
archived in a period of Yminutes into history activities. The
new action transcripts can keep arriving after ActivityAggre-
gator has been launched. These new action transcripts will be
processed in the next execution of ActivityAggregator .
ActivityAggregator assumes that the information used by
the developer across separate applications exhibit temporal
locality , i.e., actions which occur at closer points in time are
more likely to be conceptually related. Temporal locality hasbeen applied with success in numerous settings involving user
activity [12]–[14]. Temporal locality allows ActivityAggregator
to infer a likely relevance among different documents without
knowledge of their contents or the purpose of the actions.
Let<a 1,a2,. . . ,a n>be a sequence of action transcripts
in the latest Yminutes since the last execution of the Activ-
ityAggregator .ActivityAggregator regards as an activity all the
actions on a particular document within an application window
that occur within the time interval threshold Tclose (30 minutes
by default). Given the two actions aiandaj(1i<j n),
aiandajare regarded as part of an activity if the time span
between the two actions |ai.time  aj.time |<T close and
the two actions have the same process name and the same
window title. If an application window is a sub-window of
the main application window, e.g. open a dialog window in
an application window, ActivityAggregator uses the title of the
main application window for comparison. If the time span of
the two activities overlap, ActivityAggregator considers the two
activities as correlated activities, and the documents involved
in the two activities as correlated documents.
C. Activity Interface
ActivitySpace currently supports three semantic UIs ( Re-
cent Activity Digest Viewer ,Correlated Activity Snappit View-
er, and Topic Summary ), and three episodic UIs ( Activity His-
tory Explorer ,Timeline Inspector , and Edit History Inspector .
Semantic UIs enable the developer to ﬁnd information based
on the documents (i.e., what) he has used, while episodic UIs
enable the developer to ﬁnd information based on the time
(i.e., when ) and place (i.e., where ) of his actions. Readers are
referred to our tool website2for detailed description of these
semantic and episodic UIs.
III. E VA L UAT I O N
We have implemented a ActivitySpace prototype2on
Microsoft Windows. We invited 8 volunteer graduate students
in a user study of the ActivitySpace prototype. The partici-
pants installed the ActivitySpace prototype on their working
computer. The system was conﬁgured to track user activity in
web browsers ( Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer ), ofﬁce soft-
ware ( Word, Excel, PowerPoint ), PDF reader ( Adobe Reader,
Foxit Reader ), text editors ( Notepad, Notepad++ ), latex editor
(WinEdt ), and IDEs ( Eclipse, Visual Studio ). Activity in all
other applications are categorized as others. In this section,
we analyze the collected activity data and report the post-study
survey results.
A. Activity Statistics
The 8 participants used the ActivitySpace system for 4 to
22 days. We collected in total 417 hours activity data. The
total time of each participant is computed as the sum of the
interval of adjacent action records, but we discard long idle
time between the two action records whose interval is longer
than 30 minutes. Table I summarizes the collected activity
data in these 417 hours. The participants S1-S5 used the
ActivitySpace system for more than 10 days and produced
sufﬁcient activity data for analysis. They used the tracked
2Visit http://baolingfeng.weebly.com/ase2015-demonstration.html for tool
demonstration and installation information.applications on average more than 4 hours per day and used
large amounts of distinct documents.
Table II shows the document usage and application usage
statistics by the participants S1-S5. We can see that S1-S5
used many software applications in their work. S1-S5 visited
large amounts of distinct web pages. Distinct web pages visited
by S1-S5 account for more than 85% of all the documents
used by S1-S5, while S1-S5 used a small number of dis-
tinct documents in other categories of applications. However,
looking at application usage statistics, S1-S5 spent only about
50% of their working time in web browser. This means that
these participants usually spent very short time on a web page
visited. For example, they often opened some web pages after
search, and then closed the page after a quick look. In contrast,
the participants usually spent much longer time on a document
in other categories of applications.

B. Document Revisits
As shown in Fig. 3a, about 10% of the documents that each
participant used were used in 2 or more days. Fig. 4 shows
the statistics of time intervals (days) of document revisits.
We can see that many documents revisits occur after a long
time interval. For example, S2 revisited the web page “User
GManNickG - Stack Overﬂow” 14 days after the ﬁrst visit.
Fig. 3b shows the percentage of revisited documents of the
participants S1-S5 by different applications. We can see that
although the ﬁve participants visited thousands of distinct web
pages, there were only about 10% of web pages that were
visited in 2 or more days. In contrast, in other categories of
applications (e.g., Latex Editor and IDEs) higher percentage
of documents were revisited in 2 or more days.
As shown in Table III, the participants searched Google
with hundreds of distinct queries during the study. A small
percentage of queries were reused in 2 or more days. We ﬁnd
that the participants sometimes use Google as a “bookmark”
to revisit the relevant web information they visited before.0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%

C. Correlated Activities and Documents
If consecutive action transcripts involved different doc-
uments within an application, we regard it as a within-
application transition. If consecutive action transcripts involve
different categories of applications, we regard it as an across-
application transition. Fig 5 shows a discrete-time Markov
chain for the within- and across-application transitions in
the work of the participant S3. Node size is proportional
to the percentage of distinct documents used in a particular
category of applications (see Table IIb). We can see that
within-applications account for large percentage of transitions
(blue font). Meanwhile, S3 also frequently switches from one
application to another, especially from other applications to
browser (red font). This shows that S3 interleaves coding, web
search and learning in his work.TABLE III: The Statistics of Search Queries on Google

Table IV shows the documents with the most correlated
documents for each category of software application in the
work of S3. We can see that these documents correlate with
many other documents within- and across-applications. For
non-browser applications, most of the correlated documents
are in different applications.

D. Post-Study Survey
The 8 participants did not report difﬁculty in installing
theActivitySpace prototype. The ActivitySpace prototype can
successfully track activity data in the diverse computer settings
of the 8 participants. The participants did not feel the overhead
of activity tracking. They did not report that the ActivitySpace
prototype disturbs their work.

We conducted a post-study using a questionnaire in which
we asked the participants rate the usefulness of the semantic
and episodic UIs in 5-points likert scales (1 being least useful,
5 being most useful). Table V summarizes the participants’
feedbacks. The participants found Correlated Activity Snipper
Viewer useful, because it supports context-sensitive recall of
documents previously used together with the current document(S3). They also found Activity History Explorer useful, because
it not only provides a comprehensive overview of history
activities but also supports effective ways to ﬁlter or search
relevant activities/documents (S1). Some participants found
Recent Activity Digest Viewer useful, because it allows them
to quickly ﬁnd recently used documents. Most participants
did not ﬁnd Topic Summary ,Timeline Inspector , and Edit
History Inspector very useful, except S1 and S4. S4 used Topic
Summary to ﬁnd the web pages he visited. S1 made many code
changes in Eclipse and found Edit History Inspector useful to
recall the intermediate code changes that were not committed
in version control system.
IV. R ELATED WORK
Tracking User Activity . Software applications can be in-
strumented to log the user’s activity within an application, for
example TaskTracker [15], Mylyn [4], and Reverb [16]. Soft-
ware instrumentation usually requires sophisticated reﬂection
APIs provided by applications and GUI toolkits, which are
not always available [17]. Furthermore, instrumenting many
of today’s software systems is considerably complex. Acces-
sibility APIs are standard interfaces built in modern operating
systems. They provide a generic way to access application
information, but what information an application exposes to the
accessibility APIs is determined by the application developers
which vary greatly across applications and operating systems1.
Furthermore, it is usually problematic to derive user interest
and activity from highly ﬁne-grained accessibility data with-
out the information about application context. To overcome
this limitation, our ActivityTracker complements accessibility
information with screenshots of applications.
Activity-Centric Computing . Our ActivitySpace system is
inspired by the activity theory [18] and the recent development
of activity-centric computing tools [19]–[22]. Activity-centric
computing has been proposed as a computing paradigm that
supports the users’ activities rather than the resources and tools
used to perform such activities. Activity-centric computing
goes beyond tool integration and task-centric management in
separate applications. However, existing activity-centric sys-
tems mainly focus on activity construction and activity resump-
tion. In contrast, our ActivitySpace system unobtrusively track
developer activity in different applications and automatically
infer high-level activities and their correlations.
V. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we presented our ActivitySpace system
that supports interapplication activity tracking, aggregation,
search and exploration. ActivitySpace creates interapplication
information scents to ease the process of correlating and
re-ﬁnding cross-cutting activities and documents across ap-
plications in developers’ daily work. A pilot study of 8
participants demonstrated the usefulness of the ActivitySpace
prototype for supporting interapplication information needs
in software development. In the future, we will investigate
activity-centric virtual workspace and community-of-practice
for better supporting integrated knowledge work in today’s
software development practices, which requires higher-level
information integration and management than current focus on
tool integration and within-application task management.ACKNOWLEDGMENT
