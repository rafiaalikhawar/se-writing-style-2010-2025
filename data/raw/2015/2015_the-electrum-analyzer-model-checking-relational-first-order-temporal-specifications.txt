ABSTRACT
This paper presents the Electrum Analyzer, a free-software tool
to validate and perform model checking of Electrum specifica-
tions. Electrum is an extension of Alloythat enriches its relational
logicwith LTLoperators,thussimplifying thespecificationofdy-
namic systems. The Analyzer supports both automatic bounded
modelchecking,withanencodingintoSAT,andunboundedmodel
checking,withanencodingintoSMV.Instance,orcounter-example,

the success of these methods is the proper support for both model

finding, symbolic bounds, and a decomposed solving strategy. The
unbounded engine relies on Electrod,33a stand-alone tool that com-
piles problems into SMV to be solved by symbolic model checkers
(whichcanalsoperformboundedanalysis).Theplug-inarchitec-
ture,inheritedfrom Kodkod,allowsthestraightforwardintegration
of future developments in SAT and SMV solving. Every procedure
reportsbacktothe Analyzer throughthe Pardinus API,resulting
in a uniform representation of instances and counter-examples.
In summary, the main features of Electrum and its Analyzer,
reported in this paper, are: i) a lightweight formal specification
languagewithrichstructuralandbehavioralconstructs(Section 22);
ii) integrated scenario exploration functionalities for visualizing
andnavigatingalternativesolutiontraces(Section 33);andiii)sup-
port for automatic bounded and unbounded model checking of
specifications in first-order LTL with past (Section 4 4).
2ELECTRUM SPECIFICATIONS
Electrum supports both structural and dynamic constructs, re-
stricted by additional logical constraints, over which arbitrary tem-
poralpropertiescanbechecked.Thecompletesyntaxcanbe con-
sulted online,44while its formal semantics can be consulted in [7 7].
Structure is introduced through the declaration of signatures,
thatrepresentsetsofuninterpretedelements,and fieldsofarbitrary

4https://github.com/haslab/Electrum/wiki/Languagehttps://github.com/haslab/Electrum/wiki/Languagearity thatrelate elementsbelonging todifferent signatures. Each
signature and field can be declared as static(by default) or variable
(keyword var): the former have the same valuation throughout the
trace,whilethelattermaychangeovertime.Hierarchybetween
signatures can be introduced through extension orinclusion, and
signaturescanadditionallybedeclaredas abstract.Finally,signa-
turesandfieldsmayberestrictedbysimple multiplicity constraints.
Forvariableelements,theseareappliedlocallyateachstate,e.g.,
two variable signatures extending another one are disjoint in each
state, but may swap elements from one state to another.
Additionalrestrictionscanbeimposedthrough facts,logicalcon-
straintsthatmustholdineveryinstanceofthespecification,which
may rely on reusable predicates andfunctions. Relational expres-
sionsarebuiltbycomposingsignaturesandfields(andsomebuilt-in
constants) with common set-theoretic and relational operators like
join.ortransitiveclosure ^.Expressionscanbe primed,referringto
itsvaluationinthesucceedingstate.Atomicformulasaredefined
as inclusion (or equality) tests of relational expressions, which can
becombinedthroughthecommonBooleanoperators,first-order
quantificationsandfutureandpastLTLoperators.Althoughpast
operators were not initially supported, and despite not actually
improving the logical expressiveness, our experiments have shown
that they often allow simpler and more succinct specifications.
Writing Electrum specifications tends to follow a pattern that
buildsonthedichotomybetweenstaticandvariableelements,as
exemplified by the model in Fig. 22of a leader election algorithm
forringtopologies.55Thefirststepusuallyconsistsofthedefinition
ofthestaticstructure(thenetworktopology,establishedbyfield
succ, that arranges the different Processelements identified by
totally ordered Idelements), as well as facts that restrict what is
considered a valid valuation for these elements (like ring, forcing
the ring topology and unique identifiers). We usually refer to these
asrepresentingthe configurations ofthesystem,allofwhichwillbe
exploredbytheanalysisproceduresbutthatremainfrozenthrough
aparticulartrace.Then,thevariableelementsareintroduced(here,
which processes are effectively considered Elected, represented
by a variable sub-set of Process, and the tokens that are to be sent
between processes, represented by variable field toSend). These
canalsobeboundbytemporalfacts(like defElected ,thatforces
Electedto be initially empty and defines it in each succeeding
instant). To restrict the evolution of the system, state formulas
(formulaswithouttemporaloperatorsorprimedexpressions,like
init)andactionsthatrestrictthesystemevolution(predicatesthat
relatevaluesfromthecurrentstatewiththosefromthesucceeding
one through primed variables, like commandnop) can be defined.
MorecomplexactionsmayusearbitraryLTLoperators.Afact(like
trace)canthenenforcethat,globally,everystateisreachedbythe
application of actions starting at some initial predicate.
3 MODEL VALIDATION
Lightweight formal specifications are often used to validate design
decisionspriorto theemploymentofmore advanced methods.In
Electrum, analyses can be performed by runandcheckcommands:

in this case. The Consistent command will search for instances
with at most 2 elements per signature, but 10 Timesteps. Due to
thenatureofthe Electrum translationintoLTL,allinstancesfound
by the commands encode infinite traces through looping states.
Computer-aidedsupportforscenarioexplorationiscriticaltofa-
cilitatethedetectionofproblematicinstancesorillustrativecounter-
examplesofthedesiredproperties.Toeasethisprocess,thebounded
engine of Electrum allows the user to control the range of trace
lengths that will be considered. By default, the Timescope deter-
minesthemaximumlength nthatwillbeanalyzed,resultingina
(seamless)iterativeprocessthatstartsfromlength1upto n.The
search can however be restricted to consider exactlya length nor
even a range n..m, reducing the effort to find a relevant instance.
TheAnalyzer providesavisualizerthatgraphicallypresentsin-
stances found by run and check commands. This allows for the
logic-agnostic, uniform visualization of traces generated by the
boundedandunboundedengines,makingthemunderstandablefor

TheAlloy Analyzer, through Kodkod, supports basic navigation by
relyingonincrementalSATsolversandapowerfulsymmetrybreak-
ing algorithm, quickly generating unique instances in an arbitrary
order. In Electrum, the SAT engine generates instances ensuring
that the current target trace length will not be increased until that
length is exhausted, providing a certain degree of predictability. At
thatpoint,seamlesslytotheuser,thelengthisincreased(ifitisstill
within the Timescope). The SMV engine also allows iteration, but
limitedto atmostoneinstance perconfiguration.Moreadvanced
scenario exploration techniques are currently being studied.
4 MODEL VERIFICATION
Aftervalidation,thenextnaturalstepistoverifythecorrectnessof
thespecificationbymodelcheckingsafetyorlivenessproperties.
Electrum supports assertions specified as arbitrary LTL properties,
that can be verified, within a certain scope, by check commands.
Such is the case of Safetyin Fig.22, that checks whether at most
one process is elected leader at any given time, and Liveness , that
checks whether a process will eventually be elected, for a universe
withupto3processes.Thelatterwillactuallyproduceacounter-
example unless an additional fact forces progress , again specified
asarbitraryLTLformulas.Oncepropertiesareshowntoholdby
bounded analysis, the (less scalable) unbounded procedures can
provide more confidence regarding the correctness of the model.
This is done by selecting either unbounded NuSMVornuXmv
through the GUI. Scopes on Timewill then be ignored as these
check for traces with arbitrary length, although finite state spaces
are still considered (i.e., still at most 3 processes are considered).
Theseproceduresrelyon Electrod,whichconvertstherelational
layerintoplainfirst-orderlogic,whichisthenexpandedinto(propo-
sitional) LTL, depending on the possible valuations of sets andrelations inferred from the Electrum model and the bounds on
first-orderdomains.Asin Kodkod,lowerboundsandsymmetries

tialconditions.Thedefaultcheckingprocedurein nuXmv[22]relies
onthe k-livenessalgorithm(experiencehasshownthatitisusually
more efficient than NuSMVby at least an order of magnitude).
Several techniques have been studied to improve the scalability
of the analyses. Pardinus implements a decomposed model find-
ing strategy with symbolic bounds, that concurrently tries to find
instances in tighter search spaces [ 99]. This strategy is particularly
relevantforcomplexproblemswhoseresultisexpectedtobesatisfi-
able,sinceoftentheconcurrentsmallerproblemswillfindasolution

5 EVALUATION
Electrum andassociatedtoolsareinactivedevelopmentandpub-
licly available in open-source. Its plug-in architecture allows us to
quickly supportfuture improvements on SATand SMV solvers.A
repositoryofexamplesisavailable,66whichincludestheconversion
of most dynamic Alloymodels from the official distribution. Our
successfulanswer[ 33]totheABZ18callforcasestudycontributions
pushed Electrum toitslimitsandisafinetestimonytothepower
of the language and tools. Electrum is also being used in an indus-
trial collaboration to formally analyze some safety requirements
ofaplatformscreendoorsystemforsubways.Theapproachhas
allowed us to consider various implementationsolutions, actually
used in different countries, encompassed by a single model.
Specification languages as expressive as Electrum are scarce.
Languages with support for first-order logic and dynamic behavior
include TLA+,the Bmethod,andotherdynamicextensionsto Alloy
(atvariedstagesofrobustness).Theseformalmethodsareingeneral
less flexible than Electrum, either failing to support rich structural
constraints, declarative actions, or expressive temporal properties
with future and past operators, resulting in a more cumbersome
and verbose modeling process (see [7 7] for a detailed analysis).
