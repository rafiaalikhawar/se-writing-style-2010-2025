ABSTRACT
SoftwareHeritageisanonprofitinitiativewhoseambitiousgoal
is to collect, preserve and share the source code of all software
ever written, with its full development history, building a uni-
versal source code software knowledge base. Software Heritage
addresses a variety of needs: preserving our scientific and tech-nological knowledge, enabling better software development and
reuseforsocietyandindustry,fosteringbetterscience,andbuilding
an essential infrastructure for large scale, reproducible softwarestudies. We have already collected over 4 billions unique source
files from over 80 millions repositories, and organised them into a
giant Merkle graph,with full deduplication acrossall repositories.
Thisallowsustocopewiththegrowthofcollaborativesoftware
development,andprovidesauniquevantagepointforobserving
its evolution. In this talk, we will highlight the new challenges and
opportunities that Software Heritage brings up.

OVERVIEW
Software powers our industries, fuels innovation, mediates access
to digital information, is a pillar of modern scientific research: in a
word, it is at the heart of our digital society.
The source code of this software is a unique form of knowledge:
it is designed to be read by humans, the developers, and it is at
the same time ready to be translated into an executable form for a

Hence, software source code is precious: it embodies a growing
part of our scientific, technical and organisational knowledge, and
is now a part of our own cultural heritage.
Software Heritage is a non profit initiative whose ambitious goal
is to make sure this precious body of knowledge will not be lost.

universal source code software knowledge base.

embedded in software source code, that is a precious part of our
heritage.
It strives to enable better software development and reuse for
society and industry, by building the largest and open software
knowledge database, enabling the development of a broad range of
value added applications.
It contributes to fostering better science, by assembling the
largest curated archive for software research, and building the
infrastructure for preserving and sharing research software, a nec-

We have started this initiative now, because we are at a turning
