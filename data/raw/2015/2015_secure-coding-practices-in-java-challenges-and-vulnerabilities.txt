The Java platform and third-party libraries (e.g., BouncyCastle [ 9])
provideusefulfeaturestosupportsecurecoding.Misusingthese
libraries and frameworks not only slows down code development,
but also leads to security vulnerabilities in software [ 19,74,80,98].
Priorresearchhasmostlyfocusedonthespecifictopicsofmis-
using cryptography and secure socket layer (SSL) APIs [23, 26, 29,
60,72]. For example, Nadi et al. investigated the obstacles intro-
duced by Java cryptography APIs, developers’ usage of the APIs,
anddesiredtoolsupport[ 68].Lazaretal.manuallyexamined269
publishedcryptographicvulnerabilitiesintheCVEdatabase,and
found that 83% of them were resulted from cryptography API mis-
use[60].Fahletal.[ 26]andGeorgievetal.[ 29]separatelyreported
vulnerable Android applications and software libraries that mis-
use SSL APIs and demonstrated how these vulnerabilities cause
man-in-the-middle attacks. Rahaman and Yao recently introduced
cryptographicprogram analysis(CPA) [ 72],which detectscrypto-
graphic coding errors in C/C++ programs with static taint analysis.
All these studies on improving cryptography and SSL coding secu-
rity are timely and important.
In this work, we conducted an in-depth investigation on Java
securecodingproblems.Ouranalysisisnotlimitedtocryptography
orSSLAPIs.Weinspected503StackOverflow(SO)poststhatare
relatedtoJavasecurity.Themajority(87%)ofthepostsareabout
non-cryptolibraries.Foreachpost,wethoroughlyexaminedthe
entire thread, including the question and all the responses. Wechose StackOverflow [
91] because (1) it is an extremely popular
online platform for developers to share and discuss programming
issuesandsolutions,and(2)SOplaysanimportantroleineducating
developers and shaping their daily coding practices.
Ouranalysiswasconductedatthecodelevel,ascode-levelin-
vestigationhasthepotentialtobringdeeperinsights.Thetechnical
challenge is how to interpret the short and brief posts within the
appropriate programming context in order to understand the security
impact.Tocomprehendeachpost’s programcontext,westudiedthe

inferred developers’ implementation intents from their problem
descriptions and the involved security libraries. We also leveraged
our security expertise to assess whether the accepted solutions
fulfilledtheiroriginal intents.Theseanalysisand reasoningtasks
require expertise in both software engineering and cyber security.
In our analysis of the 503 StackOverflow posts, we investigated
the following three research questions (RQs):
RQ1What are the common concerns in Java secure coding? We
aimed to identify the libraries and functionalities (e.g., [ 3,

32,45,47,69,85]) that were most frequently asked about
by developers. Our scope covers all topics related to Java
security, not limited to cryptography and SSL.
RQ2What are the common programming challenges? Weaimed
to identify the common obstacles that hinder secure cod-
ing. Suchinformation canprovide softwareengineering re-
searchers actionable insights for designing tools and help
close the gap between correct API usage and the practice.
RQ3Whatarethecommonsecurityvulnerabilities? Thehighpopu-
larityofStackOverflowmaycauseinsecurecodetobeshared
and used in real-world implementations. This effort helps
raise the security awareness among software developers.
Our work provides empirical evidences for many significant
securecodingissuesthathavenotbeenpreviouslyreported.The
major findings are summarized as follows.
•Thereweresecurityvulnerabilitiesintherecommendedcode
ofsomeacceptedanswers.Forexample,whenencountering
errors during implementing Spring Security authentication,
developers were suggested a workaround to disable the de-
fault security protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery
(CSRF) attacks. Also for example, some posts advised devel-
operstotrustallincomingSSL/TLScertificatesasafixtocer-
tificate verification errors. Such a setup completely destroys
the security guarantees of SSL/TLS. Although this insecure
practicewasreportedbysecurityresearchersin2012[ 26,29],
someSOusersstillviewthisoptionasacceptable.Inaddi-
tion, MD5 or SHA-1 algorithms was repeatedly suggested,even though these cryptographic hashing algorithms are
weakandshouldnotbeusedforhashingpasswords.Forthe
17 problematic posts (5 on CSRF, 9 on SSL/TLS, and 3 on
password hashing), the total view count is 622,9221.
•Various programming challenges were related to security li-brary usage. For instance, developers became stuck with
using cryptography APIs due to clueless error messages,
complex cross-language data handling (e.g., encryption inPython and decryption in Java), and delicate implicit API
usageconstraints.WhenusingSpringSecurity,developers
struggledwiththetwoalternativewaysofconfiguringsecu-
rity: Java-based or XML-based.
•Since2012,developershaveincreasinglyreliedontheSpring
Securityforsecurecoding. 267ofthe503examinedposts(53%)
are about the Spring Security, specifically on the authentica-
tion and authorization operations in enterprise applications.
However,securityandusabilitystudiesaboutSpringSecu-
rity have not been reported in the literature.
Developershavepragmaticgoals(i.e.,gettingthecodetorun)
andsecuritygoals.Someofthechoicesmadebydevelopersindi-cate that the pragmatic goals can take priority over security, if a
developercannotsatisfybothofthem.Inaddition,cybersecurity
decisionsmaybeinfluencedbythesocialfactors(suchasreputa-
tion scores,votes, andaccept labels) onthe StackOverflowforum.

TheexaminedpostscoverthreetopicsonJavasecurity:Javaplat-
formsecurity,JavaEEsecurity,andthird-partyframeworks.This
sectionintroducesthekeyterminologiesusedthroughoutthepaper.
2.1 Java Platform Security
TheplatformdefinesAPIsspanningmajorsecurityareas,including
cryptography, access control, and secure communication [ 54]. The
Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) contains APIs for crypto-
graphic hashes ,keys and certificates ,digital signatures ,and
encryption [47]. Nine cryptographic engines are defined to pro-
videeithercryptographicoperations(encryption,digitalsignatures,
hashes),generatorsorconverters ofcryptographicmaterial(keys
andalgorithmparameters),orobjects(keystoresorcertificates)that
encapsulate the cryptographic data. The access control architecture
protectstheaccesstosensitiveresources(e.g.,localfiles)orsensi-
tive application code (e.g., methods in a class). All access controldecisions are mediated by a
security manager . By default, the
securitymanagerusesthe AccessController classforaccesscontrol
operations and decisions. Secure communication ensures that the
data traveling across a network is sent to the appropriate party,
withoutbeingmodifiedduringthetransmission.TheJavaplatform
providesAPIsupportforstandardsecurecommunicationprotocols
likeSSL/TLS. HTTPS, or “HTTP secure”, is an application-specific
implementation that is a combination of HTTP and SSL/TLS.
2.2 Java EE Security

Specifically, authentication defineshowcommunicatingenti-

EE applications’ security can be implemented in two ways:
•DeclarativeSecurity expressesanapplicationcomponent’s
security requirements using either deployment descrip-
torsorannotations . A deployment descriptor is an XML
fileexternaltotheapplication.ThisXMLfileexpressesan
application’s security structure, including security roles, ac-
cess control, and authentication requirements. Annotations
are used to specify security information in a class file. They
can be either used or overridden by deployment descriptors.
•ProgrammaticSecurity isembeddedinanapplicationand

alone is not sufficient to express the security model.

SpringSecurity (SS)[82].DifferentfromtheJavaEEsecurityAPIs,
these frameworks are container independent, meaning that they

There can be multiple security filters inside the SS filter. Devel-
opers can choose between XML-based andJava-based security
configurations,orahybridofthetwo.SimilartoJavaEEsecurity,
the XML-based configuration implements security requirements
withdeploymentdescriptorsandsourcecode,whiletheJava-based
approach expresses security with annotations and code.
3 METHODOLOGY
We used the open source python library Scrapy [ 77] to crawl posts
from the StackOverflow (SO) website. Figure 1 presents the format
of a typical SO post. Each post mainly contains two regions: the
question and answers.
1/circlecopyrtQuestionregion containsthequestiondescriptionandsome
metadata.Themetadataincludesa voteforthequestion(e.g.,3),in-
dicatingwhetherthequestioniswell-definedorwell-representative,
and afavorite count (e.g., 1) showing how many people liked the
question.
2/circlecopyrtAnswer region containsallanswer(s)provided.Whenone
or more answersare provided, the asker decides which answerto
accept, and marks it with ().

Figure 1: A highly viewed post (viewed 662 times as of Jan-uary 16, 2018) asking about HTTPS workarounds to bypass
key checking and allow all host names [46]
Weobtained22,195postscontainingkeywords“Java”and“secu-
rity”.Afterextractingthequestion,answers,andrelevantmetadata
for each post, we refined the data in three ways.
1) Filtering less useful posts. We automatically refined posts by
removing duplicated posts, posts without accepted answers, and
postswhosequestionsreceivednegativevotes(usuallybecausethe
questions were ill-formed or confusing).
2)Removingpostswithoutcodesnippets. Tobetterunderstandthe
questions within the program context, we only focused on posts
containingcodesnippets.Sinceourcrawleddatadidnotincludeany
metadata describing the existence of code snippets, we developed
an intuitive filter to search for keywords “public” and “class” in
each post. Based on our observation, a post usually contains these
two keywords when it includes a code snippet.3)Discardingirrelevantposts. Afterapplyingtheabovetwofilters,
we manually examined the remaining posts, and decided whether
theywererelevanttoJavasecurecoding,orsimplycontainedthe
checked keywords accidentally.
With the above three filters, we finally included 503 posts in
ourdatasetaskedbetween2008-2016.Wemanuallycharacterized
relevant posts according to their security concerns, programming
challenges,and securityvulnerabilities.Basedonthischaracteriza-
tion, we classified the posts. We aim to answer the following three
research questions (RQs):
RQ1: What are the common security concerns of develop-
ers?We aimed to investigate: (1) what are the popular security
libraries or functionalities that developers frequently asked about,
and (2) how have developers’ security concerns shifted over the
years? Because we had no prior knowledge of developers’ security
concerns, we adopted an open coding approach to classify posts.
Specifically, Author 4 initially categorized posts based on the soft-
ware libraries and security concepts discussed. Author 1 (an SE
professor)theniterativelyreviewedpoststocreateandadjustthe
identified securityconcerns. Next, Author 2 examinedaround 150
postssuggestedbyAuthor1toidentifysecurityvulnerabilitiesin
theiranswers.Toensurehighqualityofthefindings,thetwoau-
thorscrosscheckedresults,andresolveddisagreementwithAuthor
3 (a cybersecurity professor).
Wealsoclassifiedpostsintothreecategoriesbasedonthenumber
ofpositivevotesand favoritecountsthattheirquestionsreceived:
•Neutral: A question does not have any positive vote or fa-
vorite count.
•Positive:Aquestionreceivesatleastonepositivevotebut
zero favorite count.
•Favorite: A question obtains at least one favorite vote.
Thus,thepostinFigure1isclassifiedas“Favorite”,becauseitsfa-

RQ2: What are the common programming challenges? For

the problem’s root cause, and the accepted solution. We then clus-

4 MAJOR FINDINGS
We present our investigation results for the research questions
separately in Section 4.1-4.3.
4.1 Common Concerns in Security Coding
Figure 2 presents our classification hierarchy among the 503 posts.
At the highest level, we created two categories: implementation
questions vs.comprehensionquestions .Themajority(478posts)
were about implementing security functionalities or resolving pro-
gram errors. Only 25 questions were asked to understand why
specific features were designed in certain ways (e.g., “How does
Java string being immutable increase security?” [ 37]). Because our
focus is on secure coding practices, our further classification ex-
pands on the 478 implementation-relevant posts.
At the second level of the hierarchy, we clustered posts based
on themajor security platforms or frameworks involved in each
post. Corresponding to Section 2, we identified posts relevant to
Javaplatformsecurity ,JavaEEsecurity ,SpringSecurity ,and
otherthird-party security libraries or frameworks.
At the third level, we classified the posts belonging to either
Javaplatformsecurity orSpringSecurity,because bothcategories
contained many posts. Among the Java platform security posts, in
addition to cryptography andsecurecommunication , we iden-
tifiedathirdmajorconcern– access control .AmongtheSpring
Security posts, the majority (225) are related to authentication ,
with the rest on authorization andconfiguration.
Finding 1: 56%, 29%, and 12% of the implementation-
relevant posts are on Spring Security, Java platform security,andJavaEEsecurity,respectively.Thisfindingindicatesthat
developers need more help with Java Spring Security.
Basedonthesecond-andthird-levelclassifications,weidentified
sevenmajorsecuritytopics:cryptography,accesscontrol,secure
communication, Java EE security, authentication, authorization,and configuration. The first three topics correspond to Java plat-form security, while the last three correspond to Spring Security.
To reveal trends in developers’ security concerns over time, we
clustered posts based on the year each question was asked.

(including bothJava EE securityand Spring Security).Specifically,

cating that the questions were more representative, focusing more
on security implementation, instead of environment configuration.
Finding 2: Over time, developers’ major security concern
has shifted from securing Java platform to enterprise ap-
plications, especially the Spring Security framework. Secure

of favorite votes, indicating that these questions are both
important and representative.
4.2 Common Programming Challenges
To understand the common challenges developers faced, we exam-
inedthepostsfromthetopfivemostpopularcategories,namely
authentication(225),cryptography(64),JavaEEsecurity(58),ac-
cess control (43), and secure communication (31). We identified
posts with similar questions and related answers, and further in-
vestigated why developers asked these common questions. This
section presents our key findings for each category.
4.2.1 Authentication. Most posts were related to (1) integrating
Spring security with different application servers(e.g., JBoss) [87]
orframeworks(e.g.,SpringMVC)[ 83](35posts),(2)configuring
security in an XML-based [ 84] or Java-based method [ 42] (145
posts),or(3)convertingXML-basedconfigurationstoJava-based
ones [15] (18 posts). Specifically, we observed three challenges.
Challenge 1: There is much variation in integrating Spring Se-
curity (SS) with different types of applications. Although SS can
be used to secure enterprise applications no matter whether theapplications are Spring-based or not, the usage varies with the
applicationsettings[ 86].What’sworseisthatsomeSS-relevantim-
plementationsmayexhibitdifferentdynamicbehaviorsindifferentapplicationcontexts.AsshowninListing1,byfollowingastandard
tutorial example [ 100], a developer defined two custom authentica-
tion filters— apiAuthenticationFilter andwebAuthenticationFilter —to
secure two sets of URLs of his/her Spring Boot web application.
Listing 1: An example of code working unexpectedly in
Spring Boot applications [18]
1 @EnableWebSecurity
2 public class SecurityConfiguration {
3 @Configuration @ Order(1)
4 public static class ApiConfigurationAdapter
5 extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {6 @Bean // define the 1st authentication filter
7 public GenericFilterBean
8 apiAuthenticationFilter() { ...}
9 @Override
10 protected void confi gure(HttpSec urity http)
11 throws Exception {
12 http.antMatcher("/api/∗∗") // URL pattern match
13 .addFilterAfter(apiAuthenticationFilter ()...)
14 .sessionManagement ( )...; } }
15 @Configuration @Order(2)16 public static class We bSecurityConfiguration
17 extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
18 @Bean // define the 2nd authentication filter
19 public GenericFilterBean20 webAuthenticationFilter() {...}
21 @Override
22 protected void configure(HttpSec urity http)
23 throws Exception {
24 http.antMatcher("/")// URL pattern match
25 .addFilterAfter(webAuthenticationFilter ()...)
2 6 .authorizeRequests()...; } } }
In Listing 1, lines 3-14 correspond to ApiConfigurationAdapter , a se-
curity configuration class that specifies apiAuthenticationFilter to
authenticateURLsmatchingthepattern“ /api/**”.Lines15-26corre-
spondto WebSecurityConfiguration ,whichconfigures webAuthentication-
FiltertoauthenticatetheotherURLs.Ideally,onlyonefilterisin-
vokedgivenoneURL,howeverinreality,bothfilterswereinvoked.
The root cause is that each filter is a bean (annotated with @Bean
on lines 6 and 18). Spring Boot detects the filters and adds them
to a regular filter chain, while SS also adds them to its own filterchain. Consequently, both filters are registered twice and can beinvoked twice. To solve the problem, developers need to enforce
each bean to be registered only once by adding specialized code.
Unfortunately, this issue is not documented in the tutorial.
Challenge2:Thetwosecurityconfigurations(Java-basedandXML-
based) are difficult to implement correctly. Take the Java-based con-
figurationforexample.TherearelotsofannotationsandAPIsof
classes,methods,andfieldsavailabletospecifydifferentconfigu-
ration options. For example, HttpSecurity has 10 methods, each of
whichcanbeinvokedonan HttpSecurity instanceandthenproduces
another HttpSecurity object. If developers are not careful about the
invocation order between these methods, they may get errors [ 40].
As shown in Listing 1, the method antMatcher("/api/**’’) must be
invokedbeforeaddFilterAfter(...) (lines 12-13), so that the filter
is only applied to URLs matching the pattern “ /api/**”. Unfortu-
nately, such implicit constraints and subtle requirements are not
well documented.
Challenge3:ConvertingfromXML-basedtoJava-basedconfigu-
rationsistediousanderror-prone. Thesemanticconflictsbetween

posts are on how to compare keys [ 14], print key information [ 96],
or initialize a cipher for encryption and decryption [ 52]. Specifi-
cally, we observed three common challenges of correctly using the
cryptography APIs.
Challenge1:Theerrormessagesdidnotprovidesufficientuseful
hints about fixes. We found five posts on the same problem: “get In-
validKeyException:Illegalkeysize”,whilethesolutionswerealmost
identical: (1) download the “Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)
Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files”, “local_policy.jar”, and
“US_export_policy.jar”; and (2) place the policy files in proper fold-
ers[2].Developersgotthesameexceptionbecauseofmissingeither
ofthetwosteps.Providingachecklistofthesenecessarystepsin
the error message would help developers quickly resolve the prob-
lem. However, the existing error messages did not provide any
constructive suggestion.
Challenge 2: It is difficult to implement security with multiple
programminglanguages. Threepostswereaboutencryptingdata
withonelanguage(e.g.PHPorPython)anddecryptingdatawith
another language (e.g., Java). Such cross-language data encryption
&decryptionischallenging,becausetheformatofthegenerated

Listing 2 is an example to generate an RSA key pair and encrypt
data in PHP, and to decrypt data in Java [24].

31 byte[] plaintext=cipher.doFinal(cipher);
Inthisexample,whenakeypairisgeneratedinPHP(lines2-11),
the public key is easy to retrieve in PHP (lines 13-16). However,
retrieving the private key in Java is more complicated (lines 18-30).After reading in the private key string (lines 19-20), the Java imple-
mentation first uses Base64Decoder to decode the string into a byte
array (line 21), which corresponds to an OpenSSL PEM encoded
stream(line22-23).BecauseOpenSSLPEMisnotastandarddata
format, the Java code further uses a PEMReader to convert the
streamtoaPrivateKeyinstance(lines24-27)beforeusingthekey
toinitializeacipher(lines28-30).Existingdocumentationseldom
describes how the security data format (e.g., key) defined in one
language corresponds to that of another language. Unless devel-opersareexpertsinbothlanguages,itischallengingforthemto
figure out the security data processing across languages.
Challenge3:ImplicitconstraintsonAPIusagecauseconfusion. Two
posts were about getting “InvalidKeySpecException: algid parse
error,notasequence”,whenobtainingaprivatekeyfromafile[ 44].
TheproblemisthatthekeyshouldbeinPKCS#8formatwhenused
to create a PKCS8EncodedKeySpec instance, as shown below:
Listing3:Consistencybetweenthekeyformatandspec[44]
1 //privKey should be in PKCS#8 format
2 byte[] privKey =...;
3 PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpec=
4 new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(pri vKey);
The tricky part is that a private key retrieved from a file always
has the data type byte[]even if it is not in PKCS#8 format. If devel-
opers invoke the API PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(...) with a non-PKCS#8
formatted key, they would be stuck with the clueless exception.
Three solutions were suggested to get a PKCS#8 format key: (1) to
implementcodetoconvertthebytearray,(2)touseanOpenSSL
commandtoconvertthefileformat,or(3)tousethe PEMReader class
of BouncyCastle to generate a key from the file. Such implicit con-
straints between an API and its input format are delicate.
Finding4: Thecryptographypostsweremostlyaboutkey
generation and usage. Developers asked these questions
mainlyduetocluelesserrormessages,cross-languagedata
handling, and implicit API usage constraints.
4.2.3 Java EE security. 33ofthe58postswereonauthentication
and authorization. The APIs of these two security features were
defined differently on different application servers (e.g., WildFly
and Glassfish). Developers might use these servers in combination
withdiversethird-partylibraries[ 75].Asaresult,thesepostsrarely
shared solutions or code implementation.
One common challenge we identified is the usage of declarative
securityandprogrammaticsecurity.Whendevelopersmisunder-
stoodannotations,theycoulduseincorrectannotationsthatconflict
with other annotations [ 49], deployment descriptors [ 105], code
implementation [ 16], or file paths [ 71]. Nevertheless, existing error
reporting systems only throw exceptions. There is no tool helping
developers identify or resolve conflicting configurations.

4.2.4 Access Control. 43 posts mainly discussed how to restrict
orrelaxtheaccesspermission(s)ofasoftwareapplicationforcertain
resource(s).
Specifically, 21 questions asked about restricting untrusted code
fromaccessingcertainpackages[ 53],classes[ 56],orclassmembers
(i.e., methods and fields) [ 35]. Two alternative solutions were com-
monly suggested for these questions: (1) to override the checkXXX()
methods of SecurityManager to disallow invalid accesses, or (2) to
defineacustompolicyfiletograntlimitedpermissions.Another
nine posts were on how to allow applets to perform privileged
operations [79]. Applets are executed in a security sandbox by de-
fault and can only perform a set of safe operations. One commonly
recommendedsolutionwastodigitallysigntheapplet.Although
it seems that there exist common solutions to the most frequently
askedquestions,theaccesscontrolimplementationisnotalways
intuitive. We identified two common challenges associated with
correctly implementing access control.
Challenge1:Theeffectofaccesscontrolvarieswiththeprogram
context.We identified two issues that were frequently asked about.
First, the RMI tutorial [ 43] suggested that a security manager
is needed onlywhen RMI downloads code from a remote ma-
chine. For the RMI program that does not download any code,
including a SecurityManager instance causes an AccessControlExcep-
tion[51].Second,althoughasignedappletisallowedtoperform
sensitive operations, it loses its privileges when being invoked
fromJavascript[ 36].Asaresult,theinvocationtothesignedapplet
shouldbewrappedwithaninvocationof AccessController.doPrivileged(...) .
Challenge 2: The effect of access control varies with the execu-
tion environment. SecurityManager can disallow illegal accesses via
reflection only when the program is executed in a controlled envi-
ronment(i.e.,onatrustedserver)[ 10].Nevertheless,iftheprogram
isexecutedinanuncontrolledenvironment(e.g.onanuntrusted
clientmachine),wherehackerscancontrolhowtoruntheprogram
or manipulate the jar file, the security mechanisms become voided.
Finding 6: The access control posts were mainly about
SecurityManager ,AccessController , and the policy file. Config-
uringandcustomizingaccesscontrolpoliciesarechallenging.
4.2.5 Secure Communication. Among the 31 examined posts,
22 posts were about SSL/TLS-related issues, discussing how to cre-
ate[88],install[94],find[58],orvalidateanSSLcertificate[ 90],how
to establish a secure connection [ 50], and how to use SSL together
with other libraries, such as JNDI [38] and PowerMock [102].
In particular, six posts focused on the problem of unable to find
a valid server certificate to establish an SSL connection with a
server[58].Insteadofadvisingtoinstalltherequiredcertificates,
two accepted answers suggested a highly insecure workaround to
disabletheSSLverificationprocess,sothat anyincomingcertificate
canpassthevalidation[ 89].Althoughsuchworkaroundseffectively
remove the error, they fail to secure the communications. In Sec-
tion4.3,wefurtherexplainthesecurityvulnerabilityduetosuch
workarounds.Developerslikelyacceptedthevulnerableanswers
because they found it challenging to implement the entire process
of creating, installing, finding, and validating an SSL certificate.Finding 7: Security communication posts mainly discussed
the process of establishing SSL/TLS connections. This process

4.3 Common Security Vulnerabilities
AmongthefivecategorieslistedinSection4.2,weidentifiedsecurity
vulnerabilitiesintheacceptedanswersofthreefrequentlydiscussed
topics: Spring Security’s csrf(), SSL/TLS, and password hashing.
4.3.1 Spring Security’s csrf() .Cross-siterequestforgery(CSRF)
is a serious attack that tricks a web browser into executing priv-
ileged actions (e.g., transferring victim’s money to attacker’s ac-count) in a web application (e.g., a bank website), without the
victim’sawareness[ 107].Therootcauseisthatthebrowserdoes
notattempttodistinguishtheattacker’sforgedrequestsfromlegit-
imateones.Itautomaticallyappendsthevictim’scredential(e.g.,
session ID stored in a cookie) toall these outgoing requests. Thus,
forged requests can pass the authentication.
By default, Spring Security provides the CSRF protection by
definingafunction csrf()andimplicitlyenablingthefunctioninvo-
cation.Correspondingly,developersshouldincludetheCSRFtoken
in all PATCH, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods to leverage the
protection [57]. However, among the 12 examined posts on csrf(),
5 posts discussed program failures, while all the accepted answers
suggestedaninsecuresolution:disablingtheCSRFprotectionby
invoking http.csrf().disable() . In one instance, afteraccepting the
vulnerable solution, an asker commented “Adding csrf().disable()
solved the issue!!! I have no idea why it was enabled by default ”[62].
Unfortunately, the developer happily disabled the security protec-
tion without realizing that such workaround would expose the
resulting software to exploits.
Finding 8: In 5 of the 12 csrf()-relevant posts, developers
took the suggestion to irresponsibly disable the default CSRF
protection.Developerswereunawareofthethreatsassociated
with disabling CSRF tokens.
4.3.2 SSL/TLS. We examined the 10 posts on SSL/TLS, and ob-
served two important security issues.
Problem 1: Many developers opted to trust all SSL certificates and
permit all hostnames with the intent of quickly building a proto-
typeinthedevelopmentenvironment. SSListhestandardsecurity
technology for establishing an encrypted connection between a
web server andbrowser. There are mainlyfour steps involved to
securelyenableSSLconnections[ 76].First,awebservice’sdevelop-
ers request for an SSL certificate for their website by providing the
website’sidentityinformation(e.g.,itspublickeyandhostname)
to a Certification Authority (CA). Second, the CA validates the
website’sinformation,andissuesadigitallysignedSSLcertificate.
Third,whenaclientorbrowserattemptstoconnectthewebsite,the
server sends over its certificate. Fourth, the client conducts several
checks,including (1)whether thecertificateis issuedby aCAthe
browser trusts, (2) whether the requested hostname matches the

The safest practice is to enable SSL after obtaining a signed cer-

certificate. A common workaround without CA-signed certificates
is to create a local self-signed certificate for use in implementing
certificate verification [ 88]. However, 9 of the 10 examined posts
accepted an insecure solution to bypass security checks entirely by
trustingallcertificatesand/orallowing allhostnames,asdemon-
strated by Listing 4.

DisablingtheSSLcertificatevalidationprocesscompletelyde-
stroys the secure communication protocol, leaving clients suscepti-
bletoman-in-the-middle(MITM)attacks [29].IntheMITMat-
tack,bysecretlyrelayingandpossiblyalteringcommunication(e.g.,
throughDNSpoisoning)betweenclientandserver,anattackercan
fool the SSL-client to connect to an attacker-controlled server [ 29].
Although the insecurity of this coding practice was highlighted in
2012[29],threeexaminedpoststhatwerecreatedsincethenstill
discussed this dangerous workaround [ 13,46,89]. This observa-
tionindicatesasignificantgapbetweensecuritytheoryandcoding

by stating “I want my client to accept any certificate (because I’m

lackofunderstandingabouttheman-in-the-middleattack.Another
developer stated “Because I needed a quick solution for debugging

demonstrated by prior research [ 26,29], many of these implemen-
tationsfindtheirwayintoproductionsoftware,andhaveyielded
radically insecure systems as a result.
2That is, in this developer’s application, a client only needs to communicate to one
server.Problem 2: Developers were unaware of the best usage of SSL/TLS.
TLS is SSL’s successor. TLS is so different from SSL that the two
protocols do not interoperate. To maintain the backward compati-bilitywithSSL3.0,mostSSL/TLSimplementationsallowprotocol

3.0 handles block cipher mode padding, which can be exploited by
attackers to decrypt ciphertext. With the POODLE attack, a hacker
can intentionally trigger a TLS connection failure and force to use
SSL 3.0.

in the protection of Federal information [ 33]. None of the 10 posts

in 2016) still discussed about the use of the obsolete SSL.

4.3.3 Password Hashing. We found 6 posts on hashing pass-
words with MD5 or SHA-1 to store user credentials in databases.
However, thesecryptographic hashing functions werefound inse-

secure password hashing, as these algorithms are specially crafted
to slow down hash computation by orders of magnitude [ 8,28,92],
which substantially increases the difficulty of dictionary attacks.
Unfortunately, only 3 of the 6 posts (50%) mentioned the best
practice in their accepted answers. One post asked about usingMD5 hashing in Android [
64]. Although subsequent discussion
betweendevelopersrevealedrecommendationsofavoidingMD5,
the asker kept justifying his/her choice of using MD5. The asker
even shared a completely wrong understanding of secure hashing:
“The security of hash algorithms really is MD5 (strongest) > SHA-1 >
SHA-256 >SHA-512 (weakest) ”,although theopposite istrue,which
is MD5 < SHA-1 < SHA-256 < SHA-512. Among these posts, some
developers misunderstood security APIs and ignored the potential
consequences of their API choices. Such posts conveying incor-

that either discussed or recommended insecure coding practices
relevant to CSRF (5 posts described in Section 4.3.1), SSL/TLS (9posts described in Section 4.3.2), or password hashing (3 posts
described in Section 4.3.3), we observed a few interesting facts.
The total view count of these posts is 622,9223. Such a large
viewcount means that many developers have read these posts. It is
conceivable that some developers may have heeded the erroneous
advice and incorporated the vulnerable code in their projects.
Influentialanswersarenotnecessarilysecure.Inonepost[ 39],
theinsecuresuggestionbyauserwithahigherreputation(55.6K

to the correct fix by a user with a lower reputation (29K reputationscore).Inanotherpost[
78],oneinsecure“quickfix”answerreceived
5votes,probablybecause itindeedeliminatedtheerrormessages.
The positive indicators for insecure solutions (e.g., high reputation
and positive votes on StackOverflow) can mislead developers to
implement insecure practices.
Also for example, a user with zero reputation score pointed
out that trusting all certificates is very dangerous. Another user
with a higher reputation score (6.3K) made condescending and
discouraging remarks, such as “ Once you have sufficient reputation,
you will be able to comment " [103].

5 RELATED WORK
Wedescribethreecategoriesofrelatedworkonanalyzing,detecting,
and preventing security vulnerabilities due to library API misuse.
5.1 Analyzing Security Vulnerabilities
Prior studies showed API misuse caused many security vulnera-
bilities[60,63,98,106].Forinstance,LongidentifiedseveralJava
features (e.g., the reflection API) whose misuse or improper im-
plementationcancompromisesecurity[ 63].Lazaretal.manually
examined269publishedcryptographicvulnerabilitiesintheCVE
database, and observed 83% of them were caused by the misuseof cryptographic libraries [
60]. Veracode reported that 39% of all
applications used broken or risky cryptographic algorithms [98].
Barua et al. automatically extracted latent topics in SO posts [ 5].
These topics are not specific to security. Nadi et al. reported the
obstaclesofusingcryptographyAPIsbyexamining100SOposts
and 48 developers’ survey inputs [ 68]. Acar et al. focused on the
3As of August 2017vulnerabilitiesinAndroidcode [ 1].Thestudies byYang etal.[ 106]
and Rahman [ 73] are the most relevant to our research. They auto-
maticallyextractedsecurity-relevanttopicsfromSOquestions,andidentifiedhigh-frequencykeywordslike“Password”and“Hash”for
post categorization.
Our work belongs to this category of analyzing security vulner-
abilities.Compared withthe priorresearch, ourselection ofposts
covers Java security, not limited to cryptography, SSL,or Android.
This broad coverage enables us to obtain new insights on secure
codingpractices,includingcomplexsecurityconfigurationsinJava
Spring Security and cross-language data handling (e.g., encryption
in Python and decryption in Java).
5.2 Detecting Security Vulnerabilities
Researchershaveproposedtoolstodetectsecurityvulnerabilities
causedbyAPImisuse[ 12,23,26,27,29,34,61,70,72].Forinstance,
Egeleetal.implementedastaticcheckerforsixwell-definedAn-
droidcryptographicAPIusagerules(e.g.,“DonotuseECBmode
for encryption”). They analyzed 11,748 Android applications for
anyruleviolation[ 23].Theyfound88%oftheapplicationsviolated
at least one checked rule. Fischer et al. extracted Android security-
relatedcodesnippetsfromSO,andmanuallylabeledasubsetofthedataas“secure”or“insecure”[
27].Thelabeleddataisusedtotrain
a classifier that determines whether or not a code snippet is secure.
The authors then searched for code clones of the snippets in 1.3
million Android apps, and found many clones of the insecure code.
In 2012, Fahl et al. [ 26] and Georgiev et al. [ 29] separately reported
vulnerable Android applications and software libraries that misuse
SSLAPIsanddemonstratedhowthesevulnerabilitiescauseman-
in-the-middle attacks. We found three posts created after 2012 that
stilldiscussedthehighlyinsecurepracticeoftrustingallcertificates
(inSection4.3.2).Heetal.developedSSLINT,anautomaticstatic
analysis tool, to identify the misuse of SSL/TLS APIs in client-side
applications[ 34].RahamanandYaopresentedastatictaintanalysis
approach to enforce a wide range of cryptographic properties in
C/C++ code [72].
5.3 Preventing Security Vulnerabilities
Researchersproposedapproachestopreventdevelopersfromim-
plementing vulnerable code and misusing APIs [ 20,21,25,65,
66,81]. For example, Mettler et al. designed Joe-E – a security-
oriented subset of Java – to support secure coding by removing
anyencapsulation-breakingfeaturesfromJava(e.g.,reflection),and
by enforcing theleast privilege principle [ 65]. Keyczar is alibrary
designedto simplifythe cryptographyusage, andthus toprevent
API misuse [21]. Below shows how to decrypt data with Keyczar:

Formal verification techniques can analyze the security prop-
erties of cryptographic protocol specifications [ 20,66] and cryp-
tographic API implementations [ 25,81]. For instance, Protocol
Composition Logic (PCL) is a logic for proving security proper-
ties, e.g., on network protocols that use public and symmetric key
cryptography [ 20]. The logic is designed around a process calculus
with actions for possible protocol steps, including generating new
randomnumbersandsendingandreceivingmessages.Theproof
system consists of axioms about individual protocol actions and
inferencerulesthatyieldassertionsaboutprotocolscomposedof
multiple steps.

For Developers .Conduct security testing to check whether the
implemented features work as expected. Do not disable security
checks(e.g.,CSRFcheck)toimplementatemporaryfixinthetesting
or development environment. Be cautious when following SO’s
accepted or reputable answers to implement secure code, because
some of these solutions may be insecure and outdated. For SO

7 THREATS TO VALIDITY
ThisstudyisbasedonourmanualinspectionofJavasecurityposts,
so the observations may be subject to human bias. To alleviate the
problem,thefirstauthorofthepaperconductedmultiplerounds
of careful inspection of all the posts relevant to implementationquestions, and the second author examined the posts related to
security vulnerabilities (mentioned in Section 4.3) multiple times.
To remove the posts without any code snippets, we defined a
filter to search for keywords “public” and “class”. If a post does
notcontainbothwords,thefilterautomaticallyremovesthepost
from our dataset. This filter may incorrectly remove some relevant
posts that contain code. One may improve the crawling technique
to keep the <code> tags around code snippets in the raw data, andthen use these tags to filter posts. One can also leverage Cerulo et
al.’s approach [11] to automatically extract source code from text.
We chose to report the posts whose accepted answers willcause
security vulnerabilities. There exist other posts whose accepted an-
swerscouldpotentiallybeinsecureandmightleadtovulnerabilities.However,duetothelimitedprogramandenvironmentinformation
in these posts, it is difficult for us to confirm the vulnerabilities.
Therefore, we decided not to report them.

frustrationindevelopers,whosometimesendupchoosing
insecure-but-easy fixes. Examples of such easy fixes include
i)disabling CSRF protection, ii)trusting all certificates to
enable SSL/TLS, iii)using obsolete cryptographic hash func-
tions, oriv)using obsolete communication protocols. These
insecure coding practices, if used in production code, will
seriously compromise the security of software products.
•We provided empirical evidence showing that (1) Spring Se-
curity usage is overly complicated and poorly documented;
(2)theerrorreportingsystemsofJavaplatformsecurityAPIs
causeconfusion;and(3)themulti-languagesupportforse-
curing data is rather weak. These issues seriously hinder
developers’ productivity, resulting in frustration and confu-
sion.
•Interestingly, we found that the social dynamics among
askers and responders may impact people’s security choices.
Highly viewed posts may wrongly promote vulnerable code.
Metadatalikeacceptedanswers,responders’reputationscores,and answers’ positive vote counts can further mislead devel-
opers to take insecure advices. We also found an instance
where cyberbullying comments were directed at a person
who pointed out the danger of trusting all certificates.
•Developers’ security concerns have shifted from cryptogra-
phyAPIstoSpringSecurityovertime.However,researchers
have not provided solutions to resolve the programming
challenges in this new framework.
Wedescribedseveralpossiblesolutionstoimprovesecurecoding
practices in the paper. Efforts (e.g., workforce retraining) to correct
these alarming security issues may take a while to take effect. Our
future work is on building automatic or semi-automatic security
bug detection and repair tools.
