ABSTRACT
App reviews play an essential role for users to convey their feed-
back about using the app. The critical information contained in
app reviews can assist app developers for maintaining and updat-
ing mobile apps. However, the noisy nature and large-quantity of
daily generated app reviews make it difficult to understand essen-
tial information carried in app reviews. Several prior studies have
proposed methods that can automatically classify or cluster user
reviews into a few app topics ( e.g., security). These methods usu-
ally act on a static collection of user reviews. However, due to the
dynamic nature of user feedback ( i.e., reviews keep coming as new
users register or new app versions being released) and multiple
analysis dimensions ( e.g., review quantity and user rating), devel-
opers still need to spend substantial effort in extracting contrastive
information that can only be teased out by comparing data from
multiple time periods or analysis dimensions. This is needed to
answer questions such as: what kind of issues users are experienc-
ing most? is there an unexpected rise in a particular kind of issue?
etc. To address this need, in this paper, we introduce INFAR , a
tool that automatically extracts INsights FromAppReviews across
time periods and analysis dimensions, and presents them in natural
language supported by an interactive chart. The insights INFAR
extracts include several perspectives: (1) salient topics ( i.e., issue
topics with significantly lower ratings), (2) abnormal topics ( i.e.,
issue topics that experience a rapid rise in volume during a time
period), (3) correlations between two topics, and (4) causal factors
to rating or review quantity changes. To evaluate our tool, we con-
duct an empirical evaluation by involving six popular apps and
12 industrial practitioners, and 92% (11/12) of them approve the
practical usefulness of the insights summarized by INFAR.

1 INTRODUCTION
User reviews play an important role in mobile software develop-
ment. They serve as an essential channel between app developers
and users, and deliver users’ recent experience with the apps. By
analyzing app reviews, developers can gain valuable information
for app updates, including the features to improve, new functional-
ities sought-after by users, and also functional and non-functional
issues to be rectified. Thus, app review analysis is one step that can
be highly beneficial in agile mobile app development.
Despite its benefits, analyzing app reviews often poses a chal-
lenge to developers. The number of such reviews is often volu-
minous – which is true especially for popular apps. To deal with
this challenge, several studies have proposed methods to help de-
velopers better manage app reviews. These include studies that
categorize app reviews into several topics [3], prioritize reviews of
different topics [5, 2, 6], or allow developers to search for reviews of
interest given some keywords [9]. Although the current techniques
assist in review analysis, they are mostly focusing on analyzing a
static review collection and provide little support for contrasting
reviews across multiple time periods and dimensions. Developers
need to put non-trivial amount of effort to produce contrastive
insights from results of existing tools.
As an example, consider Developer A who is responsible for
analyzing user reviews and reporting critical user feedback to other
developers. Let’s consider her employing SURF [3], a popular review

classification tool, to classify the collected reviews into topics1. With
the categorization of reviews, she is able to identify reviews for a
given topic. However, a non-trivial amount of manual work is still
needed to answer questions such as: what are the abnormal topics
in the current version? which topic impacts a significant decrease
in current review rating? etc. These questions are important for
developers to take corrective actions to improve the satisfaction
of app users, and they cannot be derived easily using SURF, which
does not support analysis comparing reviews from multiple time
periods.
In the paper, we aim to fill the gap of existing research by dis-
tilling insights that are not produced by existing tools. Specifically,
we build a tool to extract four types of contrastive insights from
different time periods and two analysis dimensions ( i.e., review
quantity and user rating). The insights include: (1) salient topics
(i.e., issue topics with significantly lower ratings), (2) abnormal
topics ( i.e.,issue topics that experience a rapid rise in volume during
a time period), (3) correlations between two topics, and (4) causal
factors to rating or review quantity changes. We name our tool
INFAR , for automatic INsight extraction FromAppReviews. To
evaluate our tool, we conduct an empirical evaluation by involving
six popular apps and 12 industrial practitioners, and 92% (11/12) of
them approve the practical usefulness of the insights summarized
by INFAR.
2 METHODOLOGY
Figure 1 depicts the workflow of INFAR, which consists of two
major steps. With raw reviews as input, INFAR first preprocesses
the raw reviews and classifies the reviews according to predefined
topics. Given the classification results, INFAR captures four types
of insights and explains the insights with chart visualization. The
insight types are salient topics ( S), abnormal topics ( A), causal
factors (Y), and correlated topics ( E), among which the latter three
are extracted by a trend analysis engine. After these insights are
extracted, INFAR presents them in natural language using a set of
text templates. In this paper, we employ SURF [3] as the classifier to
group reviews into intention types and topic clusters. For simplicity,
we refer to these as topics in this paper.
1SURP defines 12 review topics and four types. The 12 topics are App, GUI, Contents,
Pricing, Feature or Functionality, Improvement, Updates/Versions, Resources, Security,
Download, Model, and Company. The types include Bug, Request, Question, and Info.2.1 Insight Extraction
We define insight scores to measure each insight’s significance to
developers, denoted as SigT(whereTis the insight type). We use
X={x1,x2, ...,xm}to be the set of numeric values in the input,
where xcan be the review quantity nor user rating (5.0−r). We
use(5.0−r)as the formula to represent user rating since developers
are typically more interested with topics with lower ratings. The
following paragraphs describe how we extract the various insights.
Three of the insights (salient topics, abnormal topics, and correlated
topics) are extracted following a recently proposed data mining
method in [8].
Salient Topics: Salient topics are the topics that occupy signifi-
cantly large proportions or significantly low user ratings in current
versions. We hypothesize that the values in Xfollow a power-law
distribution with Gaussian noises. After sorting Xin the descending
order and removing the maximum value {xmax}, we fit the remain-
ing values, i.e.,X\{xmax}, to a power-law distribution (shown in
Figure 2 (a)) and use the prediction errors of xi∈X\{xmax}to ap-
proximate the Gaussian distribution N(µ,σ2). With the power-law
distribution, we obtain the predicted error of the maximum xmax
byεmax =ˆxmax−xmax. Then based on the Gaussian distribution
(shown in Figure 2 (b)), we calculate the probability to achieve the
predicted error εmax byp=Pr(ε>εmax|N(µ,σ2)). Finally, we
compute the significance of the maximum xmax asSigS= 1−p.

Abnormal Topics: Abnormal topics are the topics that exhibit
significant increases in review numbers or significant drops in
user ratings when compared with previous versions. Let wbe the
window size, which is the number of previous versions to analyze.
For example, w= 5means that whether the topics are anomalies in
current versions are determined by the previous five versions. Given
the observed values in a windows size Xw= (xv−w, ...,xv−1,xv),
wherevdenotes the current version, we first fit Xwto a line by
linear regression and compute its slope slope and the goodness-
of-fit [8] value r2. Similarly, we obtain the slope of each topic in
versionv. We then use Gaussian distribution N(µ,σ2)to model the
distributions of slopes, based on which we compute the probability
of the slope value sequal to or larger than the observed slope by
p=Pr(s>|slope||N(µ,σ2)). Finally, we define the significance of
each slope as SigA=r2·(1−p).
Causal Factors: Causal factors are extracted when the overall
ratings or total review numbers for the current app version are sig-
nificantly different than the previous version. The aim of capturing
such insights is to dig out the factors that dominate the changes.
LetX= (x1,x2, ...,xt)be the time series of measured values ( e.g.,
overall ratings or total review numbers) of an app. We first use the
convolution-based moving average method [1] to detect the sig-
nificant values in the time sequence, as shown in Figure 3 (a). The
moving average is predicted based on discrete linear convolution,

i.e.,avдn=Pt
i=1xi∗дn−i, whereд∈Rt,д= (1 /w,1/w, ...,1/w),
andwis the predefined window size. Then we calculate the stan-
dard deviation σof residuals between the moving averages and
observations, i.e.,(x−avд)∼N(0,σ2). Finally, version vis consid-
ered to have significant change if ||xv−avдv||>σ, as illustrated
in Figure 3 (b). The causal factor Yis determined as the topic with
the largest increase rate in review quantity (or the largest decrease
rate in user rating).
Correlated Topics: Correlated topics are the topics that exhibit
strong correlations with respect to their review quantity or user
ratings. Extracting such topics can help developers discover the
topics that may impact certain app issues. We use X1andX2to de-
note the measured values of two topics in consecutive versions. We
first compute the Pearson correlation between these two sequences
ρ(X1,X2)and obtain the p-value. Then we hypothesize that the
correlation coefficient follows the Normal distribution N(µ,σ2)[8],
whereµ= 0,σ= 0.5. Thus, the significance SigEof the correlation
of two topics can be calculated by Pr(ρ(X1,X2)|N(µ,σ2)).
2.2 Text Template Definition
The descriptions of insight summary should not only cover the
insight types, but also explain the importance to developers in
a comprehensible manner. Therefore, the insights generated by
INFAR is designed to contain both the important topics and the
corresponding reasons. In this work, we define a few text templates
specific to each insight type. For example, we have “ Version ...has
abnormal topic ...in review number ,which shows the review num-
ber increases ...compared with the last version. ” for describing the
abnormal topics.
2.3 User Review Prioritization
When retrieving user reviews relevant to specific topic or word,
INFAR will display the reviews ranked by their importance. We use
the similar prioritization method in [4], which involves two aspects,
i.e., review length hand user rating r. The importance score of one
review is defined as exp(−r/log(h)), which means that reviews with
longer lengths and lower ratings will be ranked higher.
3 HOW TO USE INFAR
INFAR is web-based application that analyzes raw user reviews and
generates an insight summary of the reviews. INFAR takes the out-
put of SURF as its input, SURF [3] will parse the input data, predict
the topics of each review The raw reviews in the input file is saved
as “[rating]******[review text]******[post date]******[version] ” per
line, using “******” to space these review attributes. One example
review from YouTube of iOS is “ 1.0******unable to restart, delete or
download again. what’s up?******Mar 20, 2016******11.07 ”. We de-
fine such input format due to its simplicity. After uploading the raw

reviews through the entry page, the server side of INFAR will parse
the input data, predict the topics of each review using SURF [3],
prioritize the reviews with the method described in Section 2.3, and
save the processed reviews into app version SQLite database. INFAR
automatically identifies the app version of these reviews correspond
to and provides the interface for parameter selection, depicted in
Fig. 4. The parameters include window size w, significance thresh-
old for salient topic, significance threshold for abnormal topic, and
threshold for causal factor σ. With all parameters set, INFAR can
then generate insight summary based on the techniques described
in Section 2.
The insight summary includes two large parts, one for word
distributions in user reviews and another for extracted insights2.
Fig. 5 illustrates the word distributions using word cloud, where
the font size indicates the word importance ( i.e., tf-idf value3) and
the font color denotes which type of reviews the word generally
appears in. Users can click specific words to see the related priori-
tized reviews. The review lists also support basic retrieval, such as
filtering reviews of specified types and topics. The salient topic is
explained with pie chart for review quantity or bar chart for user
rating. By clicking one topic, users can also observe corresponding
prioritized reviews. All the other topics are described with line
charts for users to observe the trends of these topics along versions.
4 CASE STUDY
To evaluate the usefulness of the insight summary generated by IN-
FAR, we have conducted empirical evaluation involving six popular
apps publicly available and 12 staff in several large IT companies.
The six subject apps have been utilized in our previous work [4].
They are distributed in two different app stores (i.e., Google Play and
App Store) and span across the app stores’ six different categories.
These app received a total of 164,026 reviews that we collected from
August 2016 to April 2017. For the 12 participants, 50% of them have
over four years of engineering experience, and only two of them
have fewer than one year of engineering experience. They are one
product manager, two testing engineers, four development engi-
neers, two researchers, and one intern. For evaluating INFAR, we (i)
prepared the input for each subject app; (ii) randomly assigned the
input file of an app to each participant for practicing INFAR; and
(iii) invited participants to answer questions of one short survey.
The demo tool website depicts the questions of the survey, with
aggregated data regarding the answers provided by participants.

Figure 5: Word cloud provided by INFAR, where the font size
indicates the word frequency and the color denotes which
type of reviews the word usually appear. By clicking some
word, users will see the prioritized relevant reviews below.
The majority of participants 92% (11/12) agreed that whole pro-
vided insights useful, with 42% (5/12) of them judging these insights
to be highly useful. Also, the majority of them 58.3% (7/12) totally
approved that the insight summaries are comprehensible, while
the rest of them partially agreed with that. All the participants said
that analyzing user reviews is very hard or hard without INFAR.
Moreover, 6/12 of subjects declared that INFAR summaries allow
them to save at least 50% of the time as compared to manually ana-
lyzing user reviews. Regarding the quality of the extracted insights,
4/12 of them said that the insights do not contain any unnecessary
information, while the rest of them stated that they contain par-
tially unnecessary information. By looking deeply at the usefulness
of each insight type, 11/12, 11/12, 10/12, 8/12, and 10/12 agreed
with the usefulness of word cloud, salient topics, abnormal topics,
causal factors, and correlated topics, respectively. Also, over 50% of
participants approved that all these displayed insights are highly
useful for them except for causal factors with 4/12 approval. Overall,
INFAR is affirmed to be useful for app development and save the
total time for analyzing user reviews.
5 RELATED WORK
INFAR is mainly related to tools for assisting user review analy-
sis. We briefly describe the tools below. MARK [9] is one tool that
supports keyword-based search. MARK retrieves keywords similar
to the query keyword and lists the most relevant reviews. AR-
Miner [2] and PAID [5] are techniques for prioritizing app reviews.
The closest tool to INFAR, SURF [3, 7], is a popular tool for app
review classification built by Di Sorbo et al. Given a set of reviews,
SURF can visualize the number of reviews that fall under different
topics as interactive bar charts. Although their tool can assist de-
velopers in identifying topics of interest ( e.g., the ones involving
more reviews), the tool cannot produce issue topic comparison from
multiple time periods.
Different from INFAR, the above-mentioned studies are unable
to produce contrastive summaries capturing the four insight types
considered in this work. The closest work to INFAR are MARK [9]
and SURF [3, 7]. Different from INFAR, MARK cannot captureTable 1: Example Insight of YouTube.

with review number 233, which accounts for significant pro-
portion 49.8% in that version.
Abnormal TopicVersion 3.16 has Abnormal topics ( GUI,Contents, Fea-
ture/Functionality ) in review number, which shows the review

Causal FactorVersion 11.15 experiences significant increase in the review

which show an increase of 31.6% compared with the last ver-
sion.

tion values at 0.97.
review topics and produce contrastive summaries in terms of these
topics. Also, different from INFAR, SURF cannot compare topics
across multiple time periods. SURF also does not produce natural
language summaries.
6 CONCLUSION
In this work, we create one tool for extracting four kinds of im-
portant insights that capture contrastive information summarized
from app reviews for developers. Our empirical evaluation shows
that INFAR is promising in helping developers efficiently compare
user reviews across time periods and analysis dimensions. In future,
we are interested in extending INFAR to capture more insight types
and in evaluating INFAR through a more comprehensive user study
involving more industrial participants.
