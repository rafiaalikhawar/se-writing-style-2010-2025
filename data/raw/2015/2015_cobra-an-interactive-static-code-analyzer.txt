Abstract —Sadly we know that virtually all software of any
signiﬁcance has residual errors. Some of those errors can be
traced back to requirements ﬂaws or faulty design assumptions;
others are just plain coding mistakes.
Static analyzers have become quite good at spotting these types
of errors, but they don’t scale very well. If, for instance, you need
to check a code base of a few million lines you better be prepared
to wait for the result; sometimes hours.
Eyeballing a large code base to ﬁnd ﬂaws is clearly not an
option, so what is missing is a static analysis capability that can
be used to answer common types of queries interactively, even
for large code bases. I will describe the design and use of such
a tool in this talk.
BIOGRAPHY
Gerard Holzmann got his PhD from Delft University of
Technology in The Netherlands in the deep dark days before
there were PCs, iphones, or even an internet. He joined Bell
Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, to help ﬁx some of these
things, but others beat him to it. At Bell Labs he did develop
one of the ﬁrst digital darkroom programs, and early versions
of software analysis tools like Spin. After twenty-some years
at Bell Labs he joined NASA/JPL to start a lab for reliable
software (LaRS). For unclear reasons he was later made a
JPL fellow, an ACM fellow, and was elected to the National
Academy of Engineering. He left JPL in January 2017 to
start a new research and consulting company called Nimble
Research.
