ABSTRACT
Large software systems often undergo performance tests to ensure
their capability to handle expected loads. These performance tests
often consume large amounts of computing resources and time
sinceheavyloadsneedtobegenerated.Makingitworse,theever
evolving field requires frequent updates to the performance test-
ing environment. In practice, virtual machines (VMs) are widely
exploitedtoprovideflexibleandlesscostlyenvironmentsforperfor-
mance tests. However, the use of VMs may introduce confounding
overhead (e.g., a higher than expected memory utilization withunstable I/O traffic) to the testing environment and lead to unre-
alisticperformancetestingresults.Yet,littleresearchhasstudied
the impact on test results of using VMs in performance testing
activities.
To evaluate the discrepancy between the performance testing
results from virtual and physical environments, we perform a case
study on two open source systems – namely Dell DVD Store (DS2)
and CloudStore. We conduct the same performance tests in both
virtualandphysicalenvironmentsandcomparetheperformance
testingresultsbasedonthethreeaspectsthataretypicallyexam-
ined for performance testing results: 1) single performance metric
(e.g. CPU Time from virtual environment vs. CPU Time from phys-
ical environment), 2) the relationship among performance metrics
(e.g. correlation between CPU and I/O) and 3) performance models
that are built to predict system performance. Our results show that

follow the same distribution, hence practitioners cannot simplyuse a scaling factor to compare the performance between envi-
ronments, 2) correlations among performance metrics in virtual
environments are different from those in physical environments 3)
