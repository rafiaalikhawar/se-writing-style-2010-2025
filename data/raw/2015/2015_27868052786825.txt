ABSTRACT
Automated program repair has shown promise for reducing the sig-
niﬁcant manual effort debugging requires. This paper addresses a
deﬁcit of earlier evaluations of automated repair techniques caused
by repairing programs and evaluating generated patches’ correctness
using the same set of tests. Since tests are an imperfect metric of
program correctness, evaluations of this type do not discriminate be-
tween correct patches and patches that overﬁt the available tests and
break untested but desired functionality. This paper evaluates two
well-studied repair tools, GenProg and TrpAutoRepair, on a pub-
licly available benchmark of 998 bugs, each with a human-written
patch. By evaluating patches using tests independent from those
used during repair, we ﬁnd that the tools are unlikely to improve
the proportion of independent tests passed, and that the quality of
the patches is proportional to the coverage of the test suite used
during repair. For programs that pass most tests, the tools are as
likely to break tests as to ﬁx them . However, novice developers also
overﬁt, and automated repair performs no worse than these develop-
ers. In addition to overﬁtting, we measure the effects of test suite
coverage, test suite provenance, and starting program quality, as
well as the difference in quality between novice-developer-written
and tool-generated patches when quality is assessed with a test suite
independent from the one used for patch generation.

1. INTRODUCTION
Automated program repair [4,13,17,18,26,28,29,32,36,37,39,39,
43,46,47,50,55,58,60,61] holds great potential to reduce debugging
costs and improve software quality. For example, GenProg quickly
and cheaply generated patches for 55 out of 105 C bugs [32], while
PARshowed comparable results on 119 Java bugs [29]. While some
techniques validate patch correctness with respect to user-provided
or inferred contracts [26, 46, 60], a larger proportion use test cases.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2786805.2786825.The most common prior evaluations of automatic repair provide
evidence of techniques’ feasibility with respect to this test-case-
based deﬁnition of patch correctness (e.g., [17, 35, 46, 60]). How-
ever, in practice, test suites are rarely exhaustive [51], and repair
techniques must avoid breaking undertested functionality. When
evaluations of repair techniques use the same test cases to both
construct patches and validate their correctness, they fail to measure
if, or to what degree, those repair techniques break undertested func-
tionality. In our review of the literature, most of the prior evaluations
of automated repair techniques that relied on test cases or workloads
to validate candidate patches failed to evaluate those patches inde-
pendently of patch construction. More recent work (e.g., [50, 64])
has begun to consider independent quality measures, though less
extensively than we do here. And while some evaluations have
used humans to independently measure repair acceptability [19, 29]
and maintainability [21], unlike our work, they neither directly nor
objectively evaluate functional patch correctness. Meanwhile, our
recent evaluation of SearchRepair uses the same methodology as
the evaluation we propose here [28].
This paper focuses on repair techniques that use test cases or
workloads to validate patch construction, or generate and validate
(G&V ) techniques. As Section 2 describes, G&V techniques are
worth our investigation because they have broad applicability to
mature, deployed, legacy software. (Our evaluation does not use
mature legacy software, but is motivated by the techniques’ appli-
cability to such software.) Investigating other approaches, such as
synthesis-based repair [26, 46, 60] techniques, is also of great value,
but is outside the scope of this paper.
Our contribution is a controlled investigation of GenProg [35, 62]
and TrpAutoRepair [49], both test-case-guided, search-based auto-
matic program repair tools with freely available implementations
that scale to large programs. The evaluation identiﬁes the circum-
stances under which these techniques succeed, as well as those
under which they break undertested functionality despite producing
patches that pass all test cases used for patch construction. The eval-
uation uses two test suites per program: one suite to construct the
patch and another to evaluate it. To borrow from machine learning
vocabulary, one test suite is training data used to construct a patch,
and the other is evaluation orheld-out data used to evaluate the
quality of the patch. Patches that are overly speciﬁc to the training
tests and fail to generalize to the held-out tests overﬁt to the training
tests. Techniques that produce overﬁtting patches tend to ﬁx certain
program behavior while breaking other behavior.
The goals of our study are to (1) evaluate the quality of auto-
matically-generated patches independently of their construction,
and (2) measure the effects of properties of the input program and
test suite on patch quality. This requires a large corpus of bugs in
programs that each has at least two independent, exhaustive with

respect to some speciﬁcation representation test suites. We produce
theINTRO CLASS dataset [34] for our evaluation by collecting 998
student-written programs with defects, submitted as homework in
a freshman programming class, and all with student-written, bug-
ﬁxing patches. Each program is accompanied by two independent
test suites: a black-box test suite written by the course instructor
to the natural-language speciﬁcation, and a white-box test suite
constructed using the symbolic execution engine Klee [12] on a
reference solution. This dataset is publicly available: http://
repairbenchmarks.cs.umass.edu . Our study admittedly uses
small programs written by novice programmers, which threatens the
generalizability of our results. We make this tradeoff because we
need many programs with multiple exhaustive test suites to evaluate
the repair properties we are interested in. Understanding repair
techniques at this scale increases understanding of repair techniques
in general. Our study increases the understanding of how, why, and
under what circumstances search-based repair succeeds and fails.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic effort to
evaluate the correctness of automated repair with respect to objec-
tive independent measures. We measure overﬁtting and character-
ize repair quality along several previously unexplored dimensions,
including test suite coverage, quality, and provenance. We also
explicitly compare automatically generated and novice-developer-
written patches with respect to functionality, as opposed to human
judgments. We ﬁnd that:
GenProg and TrpAutoRepair are less likely to repair programs
that fail more training tests.
Patches overﬁt to the training test suite, often breaking under-
tested functionality. Patch minimization does not reduce this
effect.
Higher coverage test suites lead to higher quality patches. Patches
generated with lower coverage test suites overﬁt more.
TrpAutoRepair is more likely to break undertested functionality
when patching programs that pass more tests to start with, such
that the “patched” program is often worse than the un-patched
program. GenProg patches overﬁt less for programs that pass
more tests, but do not substantially improve test suite perfor-
mance on the held-out set.
Using human-generated, requirements-based test suites to guide
automated repair leads to higher quality patches than using auto-
matically generated test suites.
Novice developers also overﬁt to provided test suites when ﬁxing
their own programs. However, neither tool overﬁts signiﬁcantly
less than novice developers.
GenProg and TrpAutoRepair can often generate multiple patches
for the same bug. Combining multiple patches can slightly de-
crease overﬁtting, but the practical effect is quite small.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summa-
rizes automated repair. Section 3 describes our dataset. Section 4
discusses the results of a series of experiments measuring how the
quality of inputs to automatic program repair affects the output
patches. Section 5 presents a case study demonstrating overﬁtting.
Finally, Section 6 acknowledges threats to the validity of our results,
Section 7 places our work in the context of related research, and
Section 8 summarizes our contributions.
2. AUTOMATED PROGRAM REPAIR
Automatic repair techniques can be classiﬁed broadly into two
classes: (1) Generate-and-validate (G&V ) techniques create can-
didate patches (often via search-based software engineering [25])and then validate them, typically through testing (e.g., [4, 13, 14,
17, 18, 28, 29, 37, 39, 43, 47, 50, 55, 58, 61, 62]. (2) Synthesis-based
techniques use constraints to build correct-by-construction patches
via formal veriﬁcation or inferred or programmer-provided contracts
or speciﬁcations (e.g., [26, 46, 60]. This paper focuses on G&V
techniques for two reasons:
First, such a focus is necessary because while both synthesis-
based and G&V techniques share high-level goals, they work best in
different settings, and have different limitations and challenges. For
example, the performance of synthesis-based repair relates strongly
to the power of the underlying proof system, which is typically
irrelevant to G&V repair.
Second, G&V is particularly promising for deployed, legacy
software, because it typically does not require that the program
be written in a novel language or include special annotations or
speciﬁcations. As examples, Clearview [47], GenProg, Par, and
Debroy and Wong [18] have successfully ﬁxed bugs in legacy soft-
ware. Although new projects appear to be increasingly adopting
contracts [20], their penetration into existing systems and languages
remains limited. Few maintained contract implementations exist
for widely-used languages such as C. As an example, as of March
2014, in the Debian main repository, only 43 packages depended
onZope.Interfaces (by far the most popular Python, contract-
speciﬁc library in Debian) out of a total of 4,685 Python-related
packages. For Ubuntu, 144 out of 5,594 Python-related packages
depended on Zope.Interfaces . Synthesis-based techniques show
great promise for new or safety-critical systems written in suitable
languages, and adequately enriched with speciﬁcations. However,
the signiﬁcance of defects in existing software demands that research
attention be paid at least in part to techniques that address software
quality in existing systems written in legacy languages. Since legacy
codebases often are often idiosyncratic to the point of not adher-
ing to the speciﬁcations of their host language [9], it might not be
possible even to add contracts to such projects.
G&V repair works by generating multiple candidate patches that
might address a particular bug and then validating the candidates to
determine if they constitute a repair. In practice, the most common
form of validation is testing. A G&V approach’s input is therefore
a program and a set of test cases. The passing tests validate the
correct, required behavior, and the failing tests identify the buggy
behavior to be repaired. G&V approaches differ in how they choose
which locations to modify, which modiﬁcations are permitted, and
how the candidates are evaluated.
Of existing G&V techniques, to the best of our knowledge, Gen-
Prog [32,62], TrpAutoRepair [49], and AE [61] are the only publicly
available repair tools that both repair programs written in C and tar-
get general-purpose bugs (as opposed to focusing on one domain
of bugs, such as concurrency or integer overﬂow). Therefore, in
this paper, we use GenProg and TrpAutoRepair as exemplars of
G&V program repair. Unlike GenProg and TrpAutoRepair, AE is
deterministic, and so much of our experimental methodology does
not apply. However, we do ﬁnd that AE similarly overﬁts to input
tests (Section 4.2).
GenProg [32, 62] uses a genetic programming heuristic [31] to
search the space of candidate repairs. Given a buggy program and
a set of tests, GenProg generates a population of random patches
by using statistical fault localization to identify which program el-
ements to change (those that execute only on failing test cases or
on both failing and passing text cases), and selecting elements from
elsewhere in the program to use as candidate patch code. The ﬁtness
of each patch is computed by applying it to the input program and
running the result on the input test cases; a weighted sum of the
count of passed tests informs a random selection of a subset of the
533population to propagate into the next iteration. These patch can-
didates are recombined and mutated to form new candidates until
either a candidate causes the input program to pass all tests, or a pre-
set time or resource limit is reached. Because genetic programming
is a random search technique, GenProg is typically run multiple
times on different random seeds to repair a bug.
TrpAutoRepair [49] uses random search instead of genetic pro-
gramming to traverse the search space of candidate solutions. In-
stead of running an entire test suite for every patch, TrpAutoRepair
uses heuristics to select the most informative test cases ﬁrst, and
stops running the suite once a test fails. TrpAutoRepair limits its
patches to a single edit. It is more efﬁcient than GenProg in terms
of time and test case evaluations [49]. (TrpAutoRepair was also
published under the name RSRepair in “The strength of random
search on automated program repair” by Yuhua Qi, Xiaoguang Mao,
Yan Lei, Ziying Dai, and Chengsong Wang in the 2014 International
Conference on Software Engineering; we refer to the original name
in this paper.)
There are three key hurdles that G&V must overcome to ﬁnd
patches [61]. First, there are many places in the buggy program
that may be changed. The set of program locations that may be
changed and the probability than any one of them is changed at a
given time describes the fault space of a particular program repair
problem. GenProg and TrpAutoRepair tackle this challenge by
using existing fault localization techniques to identify good repair
candidates. Second, there are many ways to change potentially
faulty code in an attempt to ﬁx it. This describes the ﬁx space of
a particular program repair problem. GenProg and TrpAutoRepair
tackle this challenge using the observation that programs are often
repetitive [7, 22] and logic implemented with a bug in one place is
likely to be implemented correctly elsewhere in the same program.
GenProg and TrpAutoRepair therefore limit the code changes to
deleting constructs and copying constructs from elsewhere in the
same program. Finally, as a challenge that applies to GenProg
in particular, genetic programming is known to lead to bloat, in
which solutions contain more code than necessary to maximize
ﬁtness [24]. GenProg minimizes code bloat post facto; prior work
has claimed that minimization reduces patches overﬁtting to the
training tests [35]. TrpAutoRepair only attempts single-edit patches,
and thus does not further minimize successful patches.
GenProg and TrpAutoRepair share sufﬁcient common features
to allow consistent empirical and theoretical comparisons. For
example, our experiments use the same fault localization strategy
and ﬁx space weighting schemes for both. This allows us to focus
on particular experimental concerns and mitigates the threat that
unrelated differences between the algorithms confound the results.
However, the algorithms vary both in the way they traverse the
search space and in the way they evaluate candidate patches, and
thus we expect our ﬁndings to generalize to other G&V techniques,
especially in light of recent successes in modeling and characterizing
the similarities in G&V approaches [61].
3. THE DATASET
This section describes the INTRO CLASS dataset [34] of 998 bugs
in versions of six small C programs, together with two types of tests
and human-written bug ﬁxes. This dataset is available at:
http://repairbenchmarks.cs.umass.edu .
3.1 The Subject Programs
Our dataset is drawn from an introductory C programming class
at UC Davis with an enrollment of about 200 students. The use of
this anonymized dataset for research was approved by the UC Davis
IRB. To prevent identity recovery, students’ names in the datasetprogram LoCtests buggy versionscomputationbb wb bb wb

subject programs vary in size from 13 to 24 LOC. The black-

The white-box (wb) tests are automatically generated for com-
plete coverage of a reference implementation. The programs’
revision histories contain 778 versions that pass at least one and
fail at least one bb test, and 845 versions that pass at least one
and fail at least one wb test, with a total of 998 unique buggy
versions.
were securely hashed, and all code comments were removed.
The dataset includes six programming assignments (Figure 1).
Each assignment requires students to individually write a program
that satisﬁes a provided set of requirements. The requirements were
of relatively high quality, and a good deal of effort was spent to
make them as clear as possible, given their role in a beginning
programming class. Further, the students were taught to ﬁrst under-
stand the requirements, then design, then code, and ﬁnally test their
submissions.
Students working on their assignments submit their code by push-
ing to a personal git repository. The students may submit as many
times as they desire without penalty until the deadline. On every
submission, a system called GradeBot runs the student program
against a set of black-box test cases (described next), comparing
the output against an instructor-written reference implementation.
The students learn how many tests run and how many pass, but
no other information. The grade is proportional to the number of
tests the latest submission (before the deadline) passes. Students do
notknow the test cases used by the GradeBot, so when a submis-
sion fails a test, the student has to carefully reconsider the program
requirements.
TheG&V techniques evaluated in this paper rely on a pool of
candidate source code elsewhere in the program. We were initially
concerned that the programs’ small size will impede patch construc-
tion. However, as Section 4.1 shows, automated repair was often
able to produce patches. Further, we found that increasing the pool
of candidate source code lines showed neither an increase in repair
rate nor a decrease in overﬁtting behavior.
3.2 Test Suites and Measure of Patch Quality
Each program has two test suites: a black-box test suite and a
white-box test suite. The instructor-written black-box test suite is
based solely on the program speciﬁcation. The instructor separated
the input space into equivalence partitions and selected an input
from each partition. While the instructor paid special attention to
writing high-quality test suites, the instructor is human and not infal-
lible. The white-box test suite achieves edge coverage (also called
534branch and structural coverage) on the instructor-written reference
implementation. We created the white-box test suite using KLEE,
a symbolic execution tool that automatically generates tests that
achieve high coverage [12]. When KLEE failed to ﬁnd a covering
test suite, we manually added tests to achieve full edge coverage.
The black-box and white-box test suites were developed inde-
pendently and independently describe desired program behavior.
Because students can query how well their submissions do on the
black-box tests (without learning the tests themselves), they can use
the results of these tests to guide their development. A repair tool
can analogously use the black-box tests to guide automated repair.
We use the two test suites to measure functional patch quality.
When a human or a tool uses black-box tests to construct a patch,
we evaluate how well the patch performs on the held-out white-box
test suite. If the patch passes all black-box tests provided as input to
the repair tool but fails some white-box tests, then the patch overﬁts
to the black-box tests, and fails to generalize to the held-out tests.
We can similarly measure overﬁtting to white-box tests. Several
experiments described in Section 4 use this method for measuring
patch quality in terms of overﬁtting and generalizability (the inverse
of overﬁtting).
3.3 Buggy Program Versions
Because the homework is submitted to a git repository, student
submissions to GradeBot provide a detailed history of student efforts
to solve each problem. Inevitably, some submissions contain bugs,
in that they do not satisfy all of the requirements for the assignment.
We can approximate if a submission is buggy by evaluating its
performance on the two test suites. Many, though not all, of the ﬁnal
submitted versions are correct. To identify a speciﬁc buggy version
of a program, pick a test suite (e.g., black-box) and ﬁnd all versions
that pass at least one and fail at least one test in that suite. Overall,
we identiﬁed 778 buggy versions using the black-box suites, and
845 buggy versions using the white-box suites (Figure 1); the union
of these sets constitutes 998 unique buggy programs.
For each of the 998 versions, we ran each test and observed the
version’s behavior on that test. We observed 8,884 failures. The
overwhelming majority of errors were caused by incorrect output;
this accounted for 8,469 cases. Segmentation faults accounted for
76 test failures; other errors detected by program exit status codes
accounted for 254 errors. The remaining 85 errors were due to
timeouts, likely caused by inﬁnite loops.
4. EMPIRICAL EV ALUATION
We evaluate G&V repair via a series of controlled experiments
using the dataset from Section 3. Section 4.1 outlines our experimen-
tal procedure and reports baseline results for successful patching.
Section 4.2 examines overﬁtting in G&V repair and measures how
various factors affect overﬁtting. Section 4.3 compares G&V repair
to novice developers in terms of overﬁtting. Finally, Section 4.4
tests previously proposed approaches to combat overﬁtting.
4.1 Evaluation Methodology
This section outlines the methodology we use to evaluate GenProg
and TrpAutoRepair and presents baseline results. We use each
tool to attempt to repair each of the 778 program versions that
fail at least one speciﬁcation-based black-box test, providing the
black-box test suite as the training suite to both tools. For each
buggy version, we compute the black-box tests it passes and fails,
and then sample randomly those tests to produce 25%, 50%, 75%,
and 100% subsets of the training suite of the same pass-fail ratio
(rounding up to the nearest test). These test suite subsets represent
test suites of varying levels of coverage. We use the term scenariotool runs scenarios buggy programs

to refer to the pair consisting of the buggy program version and
a coverage measure. Thus for black-box tests, there are 778
4=3;112scenarios. We attempt to repair each scenario 20 times,
providing a new randomly generated seed each time, for a total
of3;11220=62;240attempted repairs; 20 repair attempts is
sufﬁcient to achieve statistically signiﬁcant results. As is standard
for GenProg and TrpAutoRepair, when repairing a buggy version,
the tool uses the code in that version to construct potential patches.
When a tool exits successfully after generating a patch that passes
100% of the training suite, we run the (KLEE-generated white-box)
held-out evaluation suite over the patch to measure its quality.
Figure 2(a) summarizes the fraction of the time each run, each
scenario, and each buggy version was ﬁxed by each of the two tools.
While fewer GenProg runs ﬁnd patches (25.9% vs. 31.1%), GenProg
is able to patch more scenarios (45.9% vs. 41.7%) and more distinct
buggy program versions (59.9% vs. 57.1%) than TrpAutoRepair.
Figure 2(b) shows the relationship between the number of black-
box tests the un-patched buggy program fails and patch success.
GenProg is slightly more likely to patch buggy versions that fail
fewer tests: A linear regression conﬁrms a slight positive trend (with
signiﬁcance, p<0:01). The similar trend detected for TrpAutoRe-
pair also statistically signiﬁcant ( p<0:05).
Based on these results, we conclude that GenProg and TrpAuto-
Repair generate patches sufﬁciently often to enable further empirical
experiments.
All relationships reported in the following sections are evaluated
via linear regression, unless otherwise speciﬁed. While we give
signiﬁcance when appropriate, none of the detected relationships
had large effects measured by R2, and we do not conclude that any
of the relationships are strongly linear.

4.2 Overﬁtting
Research Question 1: How often do the patches produced
byG&V techniques overﬁt to the training suite, and fail to
generalize to the held out evaluation suite, and thus ultimately
to the program speciﬁcation?
Having shown that the repair techniques often ﬁnd patches that
cause a program to pass all of the training test suite, we next eval-
uate the quality of those patches. Speciﬁcally, we are interested
in learning if G&V techniques produce patches that overﬁt to the
training test suite.
We ﬁnd that the median GenProg patch (which passes 100%
of the speciﬁcation-based black-box training suite, by deﬁnition)
passes only 75.0% of the KLEE-generated white-box evaluation
suite (mean 68.7%). The median TrpAutoRepair patch passes 75.0%
of the evaluation suite (mean 72.1%).1
We conclude that tool-generated patches often overﬁt to the train-
ing suite used in constructing the patch. For programs that pass
most tests before repair, both GenProg and TrpAutoRepair are more
likely to decrease the correctness of the program (as measured by the
number of independent tests it passes) under repair than to increase
it.
Research Question 2: How does training suite coverage affect
patch overﬁtting?
In practice, test suites are typically incomplete. To measure how
G&V techniques perform when given incomplete test suites, we
use subsets of the speciﬁcation-based black-box test suites as the
training suites, and measure the relationship between the coverage
of the training suite and the patch’s overﬁtting.
For each buggy program, we use the test suite sampling procedure
from Section 4.1 to produce 25%-, 50%-, 75%-, and 100%-sized
1For completeness, we also evaluated if AE [61], another publicly
available G&V tool, overﬁts. AE produces patches for 35.7% of
buggy programs, and the median patch passes 50.0% of the eval-
uation suite (mean 64.2%). Because AE is deterministic and only
produces one patch per buggy program version, our other experi-
ments that rely on using multiple random seeds do not apply.

before−repair training passing ratechange in evaluation test passing rate●GenProg TrpAutoRepairFigure 4: Top: The fraction of evaluation tests the patched pro-
gram passes is signiﬁcantly positively correlated with the frac-
tion of training tests the un-patched version passes (p <0:001
for both tools). Bottom: However, for un-patched programs
that pass more of the training tests to start with, both tools
are more likely to break functionality than ﬁx it. The corre-
lation between before-repair training suite pass rate and the
evaluation tests ﬁxed is signiﬁcantly negative for TrpAutoRe-
pair. GenProg exhibits a positive trend, but breaks more tests
than ﬁxes for buggy programs that pass less than 75% of the
training suite (p <0:001 for both trends).
test suites that keep consistent the pass-fail ratio of every buggy
version, but vary the test suite coverage. As before, for each tool,
we repeat this process 20 times, each time resampling the test suites
and using a different random seed.
Figure 3 shows the relationship between training suite cover-
age and overﬁtting (the fraction of the held-out white-box tests the
patched program passes). For both GenProg and TrpAutoRepair,
higher-coverage training suites improve the quality (reduce the over-
ﬁtting) of a patch: the patch passes more white-box tests, on average.
A linear regression conﬁrms both positive trends (with signiﬁcance,
p<0:001).
We conclude that GenProg and TrpAutoRepair beneﬁt from high-
coverage test suites in repairing bugs. Using low-coverage test
suites, which are unfortunately common in practice, poses a risk of
automated patches that overﬁt to that test suite.
Research Question 3: How does the number of tests that a
buggy program fails affect the degree to which the generated
patches overﬁt?
536Section 4.1 showed that the number of training tests the buggy
version fails is related to a technique’s ability to produce a patch.
Now, we explore if it is also related to overﬁtting.
Figure 4 relates the quality of the generated patch as measured by
its performance on the held-out KLEE-generated white-box tests to
the number of training black-box tests the original program passes.
The top of Figure 4 shows that programs that pass more training
tests before repair are more likely to pass the evaluation tests post-
repair. Linear regression conﬁrms the positive trend for both tools
(with signiﬁcance, p<0:001). However, the bottom of Figure 4
shows that both GenProg and TrpAutoRepair are also more likely to
break the held-out test cases than ﬁx them when repairing programs
that initially pass most of the black-box tests. A linear regression
conﬁrms a negative trend for TrpAutoRepair (with signiﬁcance, p<
0:001). GenProg exhibits a slight positive trend (with signiﬁcance,
p<0:001), but still tends to break tests rather than ﬁx them for
most programs. The trendline intercepts with zero at x=75%, and
advances very little above this point.
We conclude that G&V repair presents a danger when ﬁxing high-
quality programs that pass most of their test suites. The patches are
likely to overﬁt to the tests, breaking other, previously correct func-
tionality. For low-quality programs that fail many tests, GenProg
and TrpAutoRepair repair more functionality than they break, on
average.
Research Question 4: How does the training test suite’s prove-
nance (automatically generated vs. human-written) inﬂuence
the patches’ overﬁtting?
We have shown that using low-coverage test suites to ﬁx bugs
can lead to lower-quality patches. This suggests that automatic
test generation might be used to improve test suite coverage prior
to a repair attempt; such an approach would require an oracle to
generate expected test outputs, although perhaps in some situations,
the expected behavior could be deﬁned by the un-patched program
behavior. Here, we evaluate if automatically generated tests (gener-
ated with KLEE [12] as described in Section 3.2) are as effective for
use by G&V repair as human-written tests. We refer to the method
by which the tests are created as test provenance .
Figures 5(a) and 5(c) summarize the relationship between test
suite provenance and GenProg patch overﬁtting. When GenProg
repaired buggy programs using (all of) the black-box tests as the
training suite (Figure 5(a)), its patches did relatively well on the
white-box evaluation tests. However, the same was not true when
GenProg constructed patches using white-box tests as the training
suite, with the black-box tests as the held-out suite (Figure 5(c)).
In the latter case, GenProg overﬁt signiﬁcantly to the white-box
tests. Figure 5(e) directly compares the two provenance methods. A
two-sample test supports our conclusion that the black-box patches
pass more of the white-box tests than the white-box patches do the
black-box tests (with signiﬁcance, p<0:001). Cliff’s Delta test
reports a large magnitude effect (magnitude >0:5).
Similarly, Figures 5(b) and 5(d) summarize the effect of test suite
provenance on TrpAutoRepair patch quality, and Figure 5(f) di-
rectly compares the two provenance methods. The effect is nearly
identical to GenProg, although TrpAutoRepair has slightly worse
performance, even with black-box tests. The two-sample test simi-
larly supports this conclusion ( p<0:001), and a Cliff’s Delta test
reports a similar large magnitude effect.
We conclude that test suite provenance plays an important role in
GenProg-generated patch quality. Some methods for generating test
suites may be better suited for automated repair than others.GenProg TrpAutoRepair

The direct comparisons show that patches generated using the

patches generated using the white-box suite. (The line shows
the median, and the dot the mean.) For both tools, Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests detected a signiﬁcant difference, p <0:001

4.3 Do Tools Outperform Novice Developers?
One of the advantages of our dataset is that every buggy program
has an associated human ﬁx corresponding to that program’s student
author’s ﬁnal submission. The students who produced the programs
in our dataset are faced with a challenge similar to that presented

Figure 6: (a): Novice-developer-written patches also overﬁt to
the black-box tests used during development. (b) The median

than those generated by GenProg and TrpAutoRepair, but the
mean (shown as the dot) GenProg-generated patches overﬁt
slightly less than the others, in part because the student-written

However, this is not statistically signiﬁcant.
to our repair tools: They write and submit code, gain information
about how many tests their code passes and fails, make changes,
and resubmit. Those who have taught introductory programming
courses know that students follow a number of search strategies
while constructing repairs, ranging from structured reasoning to
random search. This section compares the patches produced by
the automated repair tools to the results of novice developers’ re-
pair attempts. As before, repair tools (and now, humans) have the
speciﬁcation-based black-box test suite available during repair to
serve as a training suite, and the KLEE-generated white-box tests
are held out and can be used to evaluate the quality of the repair.
Research Question 5: Do tool-generated patches overﬁt more
than novice-developer-written patches?
Figure 6(a) shows that student solutions do, in fact, overﬁt to the
provided test suites and often fail to generalize to held-out tests.
Figure 6 compares the quality of GenProg, novice developer, and
TrpAutoRepair patches.
Both GenProg and TrpAutoRepair patches have both a lower
mean and median passing rate for held-out tests than the student-
written patches. While there is a visual difference in Figure 6(b)
between student-written and tool-generated patches, the Wilcoxon
signed rank test reports no signiﬁcant difference between the sam-
ples. Patches generated by either tool demonstrate signiﬁcantly less
variability in quality than student-written patches.
Comparing automatically generated patches to novice-developer-
written patches might seem unfair, since repair tools can only access
tests that represent a partial speciﬁcation, while humans can reason
abstractly about the program speciﬁcation. However, while humans
can reason about program faults abstractly above the level of a repair
tool, they are also subject to a large array of cognitive biases [2, 38]
that can hamper their debugging effort. Repair tools have no such
biases, and will mechanically explore the solution space as guided
by an objective function, without becoming irrationally ﬁxated on
particular solutions.4.4 Mitigating Overﬁtting
Research Question 6: Does GenProg’s patch minimization
reduce overﬁtting?
GenProg uses patch minimization, via delta debugging [63], to
reduce code bloat. TrpAutoRepair does not perform minimization,
because the produced patch is only ever a single edit. Intuitively, a
small change to a program is less likely to encode special behavior
that handles just the training tests in a separate way [62]. Thus far,
all results we have described for GenProg have used GenProg’s built-
in patch minimization procedure. We now investigate if disabling
this feature increases overﬁtting.
We compared unminimized patches produced by GenProg to their
minimized versions in terms of the number of black-box and white-
box tests the patched versions passed. In all experiments, regardless
of the tests used, paired Wilcoxon tests show that the test-passing
rates of the minimized and unminimized patches were drawn from
the same distribution, and fail to reject the null hypothesis ( p>0:1
in all cases, after Benjamini-Hochberg correction for false discovery
rates). This indicates that minimization does not reduce the degree
to which GenProg overﬁts.
Research Question 7: Can overﬁtting be averaged out by
exploiting randomness in the repair process? Do different
random seeds overﬁt in different ways?
Some repair tools, including GenProg and TrpAutoRepair, can
generate multiple patches for the same defect (such as when run on
multiple different random seeds). This affords a unique opportunity:
Even if patches do overﬁt to their test suites, it is possible that a
group of patches better represents the desired program behavior
than an individual patch. Speciﬁcally, even if each patch overﬁts on
some subset of desired behavior, if each patch in a group encodes
most of that behavior, a group vote on the behavior may outperform
each individual patch. N-version patches may therefore provide an
avenue to mitigate overﬁtting. Human-written code typically lacks
sufﬁcient diversity [30] to enable true n-version programming [15],
but randomized G&V repair may not.
We created the n-version program Pnin the following way: For
each buggy version-test suite subset pair Pb, run GenProg on Pb
20 times. If fewer than three of the runs result in a patch, we
exclude this pair from this experiment. We call these ( n3) patched
versions P1p:::Pnp. Next, we create a new program, Pn, that on input
i, runs each of P1p:::Pnponi, and returns the output most frequently
returned by output by those program. If two or more return values
tie,Pnreturns one of those values at random.
Figure 7 shows that n-version patches constructed from GenProg’s
output do not perform statistically signiﬁcantly better than either
individual GenProg-generated patches or novice-developer-written
patches. The only case in which n-version programs outperformed
individual patches was when TrpAutoRepair constructed patches
using KLEE-generated white-box suites for training (not shown in
Figure 7). Recall that training on white-box suites produced poor-
quality patches (Research Question 4). While n-version TrpAuto-
Repair patches are statistically signiﬁcantly better than individual
TrpAutoRepair patches ( p<0:05), the Cliff’s Delta is negligible,
and n-version TrpAutoRepair patches do not signiﬁcantly outper-
form those written by novice developers.
We conclude that when tools can produce quality patches (using
high-quality test suites), there is insufﬁcient diversity in the patches

to further improve quality. However, when repair tools produce
poor quality patches, diversity sometimes provides a modest beneﬁt.
N-version programming may indeed provide an avenue to mitigate
the worst cases of overﬁtting.
5. CASE STUDY
Section 4.2 showed that test suite provenance has the largest effect
on the quality of automatically generated patches. This section de-
scribes a case study of a buggy student program and two patches that
GenProg produced for it using the white-box test suite to highlight
the ways that some test suites can lead to increased overﬁtting.
Themedian homework assignment asks students to produce a C
function that takes as input three integers and outputs their median.
Figure 8 shows the black- and white-box test suites for the median
program.
One of the student’s buggy (non-ﬁnal) submissions to the home-
work was:
1int med(int n1, int n2, int n3) {
2 if ((n1==n2) || (n1==n3) ||
3 (n2<n1 && n1<n3) || (n3<n1 && n1<n2))
4 return n1;
5 if ((n2==n3) || (n1<n2 && n2<n3) ||
6 (n3<n2 && n2<n1))
7 return n2;
8 if (n1<n3 && n3<n2)
9 return n3;
10 }
This submission is close to correct. Despite its incorrect logic
(e.g., the equality checks on lines 2 and 5), it passes ﬁve of the six
white-box and six of the seven the black-box tests. The execution
fails to reach a return statement for the ﬁfth black-box and for the
second white-box tests, for which n3is the median and n1 > n2 .
Given this program and the white-box suite, GenProg generated
several patches of varying quality. One such low-quality, GenProg-
patched program is:
1int med(int n1, int n2, int n3) {
2 if ((n1==n2) || (n1==n3) || ((n3<n1) && (n1<n2)))
3 return n1;black-box tests white-box tests
med(2, 6, 8) = 6 med(0, 0, 0) = 0
med(2, 8, 6) = 6 med(2, 0, 1) = 1
med(6, 2, 8) = 6 med(0, 0, 1) = 0
med(6, 8, 2) = 6 med(0, 1, 0) = 0
med(8, 2, 6) = 6 med(0, 2, 1) = 1
med(8, 6, 2) = 6 med(0, 2, 3) = 2
med(9, 9, 9) = 9
Figure 8: White- and black-box suites for median .
4 if (n2<n1)
5 return n3;
6 if ((n2==n3) || ((n1<n2) && (n2<n3)) ||
7 ((n3<n2) && (n2<n1)))
8 return n2;
9 if ((n1 < n3) && (n3 < n2))
10 return n3;
11 }
One of the conditions in the check on line 2 has been removed,
and this program returns n1as the median if it is coincidentally
equal to either n2orn3, or if it is actually the median and n3 < n2 .
Ifn1is not the median, but n2 < n1 (the check moved to line 5),
this code will (possibly, but not necessarily incorrectly) return n3.
The rest of the logic is unaffected.
This patch addresses the original problem in the student’s code, at
least with respect to the white-box suite. This code is correct when
n1is the median and n3 < n2 ,n2is the median and n2 > n1 , or
n3is the median and n2n1. Although this code passes all of the
white-box tests (improving on the original student submission), it
passes fewer black-box tests than the original, failing tests 3 and 6
in Figure 8.
This patch is an excellent example of overﬁtting the ﬁtness func-
tion, and highlights weaknesses in the white-box test suite: Many
of the inputs have repeated elements. As a result, the student’s
otherwise logically incorrect equality checks on lines 2 and 5 of
the original submission mask the larger problems in the low-quality
patch.
Running GenProg with the same white-box test suite but a dif-
ferent random seeds can lead to different patches for the same bug.
For example, for this buggy program, GenProg also produced the
following patched program:
1int med(int n1, int n2, int n3) {
2 if ((n1==n2) || (n1==n3) || ((n2<n1) && (n1<n3)) ||
((n3<n1) && (n1<n2)))
3 return n1;
4 if ((n2==n3) || ((n1<n2) && (n2<n3)) ||
5 ((n3<n2) && (n2<n1)))
6 return n2;
7 if ((n1 < n3) && (n3 < n2))
8 return n3;
9 else
10 return n3;
11 }
The incorrect equality checks on lines 2 and 4 remain. This patch
inserted return n3 into the else block of the last set of conditions
that seek to determine if n3is the median. Ignoring the equality
checks, this is actually a reasonable solution, because by that point,
the only remaining option should be that n3is the median.
For this buggy program, the student rewrote the logic consider-
ably, eliminating the equality checks on lines 2 and 4 and properly
handling the last set of conditionals:
5391int med(int n1, int n2, int n3) {
2 if ((n2<=n1 && n1<=n3) || (n3<=n1 && n1<=n2))
3 return n1;
4 if ((n1<n2 && n2<=n3) || (n3<=n2 && n2<n1))
5 return n2;
6 if ((n1<n3 && n3<n2) || (n2<n3 && n3<n1))
7 return n3;
8}
In this example, GenProg solutions overﬁt to the test suite, while
the student-written patch is more general. This example highlights
weaknesses in the white-box test suite, which fails to encode key
behavior. This raises interesting questions about the potential of
automatic test case generation to augment the input given to G&V
repair techniques; more work is required to improve the quality of
the output of such techniques before the two approaches can be
usefully integrated.
6. THREATS TO V ALIDITY
Our experiments may not generalize. We only experiment with
GenProg and TrpAutoRepair, two of several G&V repair techniques,
and our results may not extend to other automatic program repair
mechanisms. However, recent work has started to unify the the-
ory underlying G&V repair [61], suggesting that results from two
different techniques may extend to others. Our subjects are small
student-written programs, with fairly small test suites. Therefore,
our results may not generalize to large, real-world programs. How-
ever, this is a necessary tradeoff, as the goals of our study require
programs that can be tested exhaustively with respect to multiple
speciﬁcation representations. Understanding repair techniques at
the scale of our experiments increases understanding of the repair
techniques in general. Additionally, while our subjects’ size allows
for a very large dataset for conducting controlled trials, it may also
affect the ability to ﬁnd diverse patches. We ran 20 seeds per repair
effort, a relatively small number by the standards of metaheuristic
search algorithms, but comparable to previous program repair evalu-
ations. More attempts may have revealed more solutions. Finally,
we used the recommended GenProg parameters deﬁned in previ-
ous work [33]; a full parameter sweep is outside the scope of this
investigation.
Our INTRO CLASS dataset — http://repairbenchmarks.cs.
umass.edu — includes all the buggy versions, student-written so-
lutions, and test suites. This makes our experiments repeatable.
However, parts of the creation of the dataset were manual. While
the white-box suites were generated automatically to the extent pos-
sible, and black-box suites were generated by a rigorous manual
analysis of the requirements, at least the latter is subject to human
interpretation. Thus, a replication of our experiments on differ-
ent programs or with different test suites on our programs may be
affected by human subjectivity and may produce different results.
GenProg, TrpAutoRepair, and many other related repair tech-
niques rely on randomized algorithms. Evaluating systems that
involve randomized algorithms is particularly difﬁcult and requires
paying special attention to the sample sizes, statistical tests, cross-
validation, and uses of bootstrapping. Our work is consistent with
the guidelines for evaluating randomized algorithms [5] to enhance
the credibility of our ﬁndings. Speciﬁcally, we used a large sample
of 998 buggy student programs, controlled for a variety of potential
inﬂuencers in our experiments, and used ﬁxed-effects regression
models and two sample tests along with false-discovery rate correc-
tion to lend statistical support to our ﬁndings.7. RELATED WORK
Most prior evaluations of G&V repair techniques demonstrate by
construction that the technique is feasible and reasonably efﬁcient in
practice [17,28,35,37,39,43,46,47,58,60,62]. Some show that the
resulting patches withstand red team attacks [47], some illustrate
with a small number of examples that G&V -generated patches for se-
curity vulnerabilities protect against exploits and fuzzed variants of
those exploits on typical user workloads [35], and some consider the
fraction of a set of bugs their technique can repair [19,28,29,32,43].
These evaluations have demonstrated that G&V techniques can re-
pair a moderate number of bugs in medium-sized programs, as well
as evaluated the monetary and time costs of automatic repair [32],
the relationship between operator choices and test execution parame-
ters and success [33,61], and human-rated patch acceptability [1,29]
and maintainability [21]. However, these evaluations have generally
not used an objective metric of correctness independent of patch
construction. Our evaluation measures patch correctness indepen-
dently of patch construction. We empirically examine how test
suite coverage and provenance, number of test failures, and patch
minimization affect repair effectiveness, deﬁned by both success
and functional correctness. We perform these experiments using a
much larger number of bugs than ever before, designed to permit
controlled evaluations that isolate particular features of the inputs,
such that we can examine their effects on automatic repair in a
statistically signiﬁcant way.
Concurrent research is starting to evaluate repair techniques in
terms of overﬁtting [50, 58]. Evaluating the degree to which reli-
ﬁxand GenProg introduce regression errors [58] is a step toward
the independent correctness evaluation we advocate here, where
we use independent test suites to measure patch quality. By con-
trast, those experiments use the subset of the original test suite that
does not execute any of the lines associated with the bug under
repair, ignoring speciﬁcally regressions a patch is most likely to
introduce. Poor-quality test suites result in patches that overﬁt to
those suites [50]. Our evaluation goes further, demonstrating that
high-quality, high-coverage test suites still lead to overﬁtting, and
identifying other relationships between test suite properties and
patch quality. Finally, prior and concurrent human evaluations of au-
tomatically generated patches have measured acceptability [19, 29]
and maintainability [21]. While the human judgment is a criterion
not used by the repair tools for patch construction, it is fundamen-
tally different from the correctness criterion we use in our evaluation,
as it is often difﬁcult for humans to spot bugs even when told exactly
where to look for them [45]. Meanwhile, our recent evaluation
of SearchRepair uses the same methodology as the evaluation we
present here [28].
Our work evaluates automated repair so that it can be improved.
Empirical studies of ﬁxes of real bugs in open-source projects can
also improve repair by helping designers select change operators
and search strategies [27, 64]. Understanding how automated repair
handles particular classes of errors, such as security vulnerabili-
ties [35, 47] can guide tool design. For this reason, some auto-
mated repair techniques focus on a particular defect class, such
as buffer overruns [54, 57], unsafe integer use in C programs [17],
single-variable atomicity violations [26], deadlock and livelock de-
fects [36], concurrency errors [37], and data input errors [4]. Other
techniques tackle generic bugs. For example, the ARMOR tool
replaces buggy library calls with different calls that achieve the
same behavior [13], and reliﬁx uses a set of templates mined from
regression ﬁxes to automatically patch generic regression bugs. Our
evaluation has focused on tools that ﬁx generic bugs, but our method-
ology can be applied to focused repair as well.
540User-provided code contracts, or other forms of invariants, can
help to synthesize correct-by-construction patches, e.g., via AutoFix-
E [46, 60] (for Eiffel code) and SemFix [43] (for C). DirectFix [39]
aims to synthesize minimal patches to be less prone to overﬁtting,
but only works for programs using a subset of C language features,
and has only been tested on small programs. Synthesis techniques
provide the beneﬁt of provable correctness for patches, but require
contracts, so they are unsuitable for legacy systems. Synthesis
techniques can also construct new features from examples [16, 23],
rather than address existing bugs. Our work has focused on G&V ap-
proaches, and investigating overﬁtting and patch quality in synthesis-
based techniques is a complementary and worthwhile pursuit.
The techniques evaluated in this paper, GenProg and TrpAuto-
Repair, are representative of G&V approaches. Our work does not
create a new bug-ﬁxing technique, but rather evaluates existing tech-
niques in a new way to expose previously hidden limitations to G&V
program repair. Our ﬁndings may extend to other search-based or
test suite-guided repair techniques (e.g., [6,18,29,39,43,44,47,61]).
Monperrus [42] has recently discussed the challenges of experimen-
tally comparing program repair techniques. For example, the selec-
tion of test subjects (defects) can introduce evaluation bias [10, 48].
Our evaluation focuses precisely on the limits and potential of repair
techniques on a large dataset of defects, and controls for a variety of
potential inﬂuencers, addressing some of Monperrus’ concerns [42].
Genetic programming tends to produce extraneous code that does
not contribute to the ﬁtness of the solution [24, 56]. GenProg at-
tempts to mitigate this through solution minimization, which may
reduce the chances of breaking undertested functionality. Overﬁt-
ting is also a well-studied problem in machine learning [41]. Our
experiments suggest that minimization and overﬁtting are unrelated,
which is consistent with prior results in machine learning [52]. To
the best of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst consideration of this
relationship in the program repair domain.
G&V approaches fall in the space of search-based software en-
gineering [25], which adapts search methods, such as genetic pro-
gramming, to software engineering tasks. Search-based software
engineering has been used for developing test suites [40,59], ﬁnding
safety violations [3], refactoring [53], and project management and
effort estimation [8]. Good ﬁtness functions are critical to search-
based software engineering. Our ﬁndings indicate that using test
cases alone as the ﬁtness function leads to patches that may not
generalize to the program requirements, and more sophisticated
ﬁtness functions may be required for search-based program repair.
N-version programming [15] combines multiple different pro-
grams trying to solve the same problem in the interest of achieving
resiliency and correctness through redundancy. N-version program-
ming works poorly with human-written systems because the errors
humans make do not appear to be independent [30]. Our evaluations
have shown that n-versions of automatically generated patches has
a minor positive effect but failed to fully generalize to the desired
behavior.
8. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
G&V automated repair shows promise for reducing the manual
bug-ﬁxing burden and improving software quality. However, if these
techniques are to gain practical traction, we must augment feasibility
demonstrations with qualitative evaluations that address the quality
and applicability. In this paper, we systematically evaluated the fac-
tors affecting the output quality of GenProg and TrpAutoRepair, two
representative G&V techniques, through a controlled evaluation on
a large set of programs written by novice developers with naturally
occurring bugs and human-written patches. Based on our ﬁndings,
the open research challenges include:Repair techniques must go beyond testing on the training data
to characterize functional correctness. GenProg and TrpAutoRe-
pair produced patches for more than half of the bugs in our dataset
(59.9% and 57.1%, respectively). The ability to produce a patch
was correlated with input program quality as measured by the test
suites. However, those patches tended to overﬁt to the test suite used
to generate the patch. When using requirements-based (black-box)
tests, GenProg and TrpAutoRepair overﬁt signiﬁcantly less than
when using generated (white-box) tests. Interestingly, the novice
programmers (students) also overﬁt to the provided test cases. These
results highlight both the signiﬁcant promise of automatic repair and
the fact that more work is needed to improve repair output quality.
We advocate that future evaluations of G&V repair tools withhold
some portion of tests from the repair tool, at least some of which
share code-under-test with the tests exposing the buggy behavior.
This is similar to the machine learning evaluational technique of
cross-validation , and provides a higher level of conﬁdence that a
repair technique is able to repair isolated defects without introducing
regressions.
Automatic repair should be used in appropriate contexts. Both
test suite coverage and input program quality appear related to the
quality of the automatically generated patches. Higher-coverage test
suites were more likely to lead to more general patches. Patches pro-
duced for higher-quality programs were, at best, unlikely to improve
functionality, and at worst, likely to break existing functionality.
This suggests that automatic repair techniques might be best applied
early in the development lifecycle, though unfortunately, this is the
time when the program quality itself is likely low (reducing the
likelihood of repair success), and the test suite is least likely to be
comprehensive. Different repair techniques are likely to be useful at
different times, and more study is needed to explore this space.
The quality of repair test suites should be measured and im-
proved appropriately. The provenance of the test suites — auto-
matically-generated or human-written — had a striking relationship
with the resulting patch quality. Automatic test-input generation
techniques should ﬁt naturally into a toolchain for automatic re-
pair, particularly when user-provided test cases fail to fully cover
the program functionality, or when critical functionality should be
independently tested post-repair, to ensure that overﬁtting has not
occurred. Our results suggest that more work is needed to fully un-
derstand and characterize test suite quality beyond coverage metrics
alone.
Patch diversity might improve repair quality. Low-quality patches,
especially those generated using automatically generated tests, demon-
strated sufﬁcient functional diversity to improve on the patched pro-
grams via plurality voting. Plurality voting may thus mitigate the
risks of low-quality test suites in the appropriate settings.
While G&V techniques have not yet become a silver bullet of
program repair, in some cases and settings, they already outperform
beginner developers. Our results suggest that if several shortcom-
ings are addressed, there is signiﬁcant promise that automated repair
techniques can be impactful and helpful parts of the software devel-
opment process.
