Debugging software failures is still a painful, time consuming, and
expensive process. For instance, recent studies showed that de-
bugging activities often account for about 50% of the overall de-
velopment cost of software products [ 3]. There are many factors
contributing to the cost of debugging, but the most impacting one
istheextensivemanualeffortthatisstillrequiredtoidentifyand
remove faults. So far, the automation of debugging activities es-sentially resulted in the development of techniques that provideuseful insights about the possible locations of faults, the inputsand states of the application responsible for the failures, as wellas the anomalous operations executed during failures. However,developers must still put a relevant effort on the analysis of thefailedexecutionstoexactlyidentifythefaultsthatmustbefixed.
Inaddition,thesetechniquesdonothelpthedeveloperswiththe
synthesis of an appropriate fix.
Recently, researchers focused on a new class of approaches,
namelyprogramrepairtechniques[ 1,4],whosekeyideaistotry
toautomaticallyrepairsoftwaresystemsbyproducinganactualfix
thatcan bevalidatedbythe testersbeforeit isfinallyaccepted,or
that can be adapted to properly fit the system. The benefit of using
these techniques is that the fix both explains the reason of the fail-
ureandprovidesapossiblesolutiontotheproblem,thusalleviating
theeffortnecessarytoidentifyandcorrectfaults.Sinceprogramrepair techniques have the potential to dramatically reduce thedebuggingeffort,theyattractedtheinterestofmanyresearchers
who produced several approaches for repairing different classes
of faults under different conditions and hypotheses. The proposed
algorithms, techniques, and heuristics have been integrated, exper-
imented,andstudied,producingaheterogeneousandarticulated

Interest in program repair techniques greatly increased in the
last few years, as shown in Figure 1, our TSE paper [ 2] contributes
to the research on such techniques by surveying a body of 108
papers about automatic software repair techniques, illustrating the
algorithms and the approaches, comparing them on representative
examples,criticallyanalyzingtheircapabilitiesinrepairingfaulty
programs,surveyingtheresultsachievedsofarandsummarizing
them into a set of key facts that show the trade-offs and factors
influencing the effectiveness of these approaches, and identifying
the key open challenges that we believe are the most important
and that can influence the future research in the area.
