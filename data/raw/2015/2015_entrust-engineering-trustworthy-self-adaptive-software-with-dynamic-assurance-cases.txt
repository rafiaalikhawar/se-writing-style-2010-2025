Softwaresystemsareincreasinglyexpectedtocopewithvariable
workloads,componentfailuresandotheruncertaintiesthroughself-
adaptation. As such, self-adaptive software has been the subject of
intense research over the past decade [3, 4, 9, 10].
Our work, initially presented in [ 2], focuses on the use of self-
adaptive software in applications with strict functional and non-
functionalrequirements.Theseapplicationsneedcompellingassur-
ances that the software continues to meet its requirements while it
reconfiguresitsarchitectureandparametersatruntime.Toaddress
this need, we propose an end-to-end methodology for the ENgi-
neering of TRUstworthy Self-adaptive sofTware (ENTRUST) [2].
Unlike previous research, which is limited to the provision of
assurance evidence that individual aspects of the self-adaptive soft-
ware (e.g. the reconfiguration decisions or their execution) are
correct,ENTRUSTintegratesdesign-timeandruntimemodelling
andverificationofalltheseaspectswithindustry-adoptedassur-
ance processes. Accordingly, ENTRUST supports the development
of bothtrustworthy self-adaptive software andassurance cases1that
confirmthe suitabilityof thesoftware forits intendedapplication.
ENTRUST comprises a combination of design-time and runtime
methodsforengineeringall softwareandassuranceelementsofa

1An assurance case is “ a collection of auditable claims, arguments, and evidence cre-
ated to support the contention that a defined system/service will satisfy the particular
requirements.” [8]

ods support the enactment of the self-adaptive software and its
controller, and the generation of a partial assurance case. The run-
timereconfigurationofthesoftwarerequiresfurthermodellingand
verification,andthesynthesisofadditionalassuranceevidenceto
complete the dynamic(i.e. continually evolving) assurance case [5].
These activities are performed by the runtime ENTRUST methods.
ENTRUST is flexible about the modelling, verification and as-
surance-evidence synthesis methods used in its design-time and
runtime activities. In particular, ENTRUST assurance cases can be
based on assurance evidence produced by a combination of testing,simulationandformalverification,atbothdesigntimeandruntime.

supported instance of ENTRUST [ 2] that leverages the established
model checkers UPPAAL [ 1] and PRISM [ 7] for the synthesis of
