ABSTRACT
Testingisanintegralpartofthesoftwaredevelopmentlifecycle,ap-
proachedwithvaryingdegreesofrigorbydifferentprocessmodels.
Agile process models recommend Test Driven Development (TDD)
asakeypracticeforreducingcostsandimprovingcodequality.The
objectiveofthisworkistoperformacost-benefitanalysisofthis
practice. Previous work by Fucci et al. [ 2,3] engaged in laboratory
studies ofdevelopers actively engagedin test-driven development
practices. Fucci et al. found little difference between test-first be-
haviour of TDD and test-later behaviour. To that end, we opted to
conductastudyaboutTDDbehavioursinthe“wild”ratherthanin
the laboratory. Thus we have conducted a comparative analysis of
GitHubrepositoriesthatadoptsTDDtoalesserorgreaterextent,
in order to determine how TDD affects software development pro-
ductivityandsoftwarequality.WeclassifiedGitHubrepositories
archived in 2015in terms of how rigorously they practiced TDD,
thuscreatingaTDDspectrum.Wethenmatchedandcomparedvari-
oussubsetsoftheserepositoriesonthisTDDspectrumwithcontrol
setsofequalsize.ThecontrolsetsweresamplesfromallGitHub
repositoriesthatmatchedcertaincharacteristics,andthatcontained
at least one test file. We compared how the TDD sets differed from
the control sets on the following characteristics: number of test
files,averagecommitvelocity,numberofbug-referencingcommits,
numberofissuesrecorded,usageofcontinuousintegration,num-
ber of pull requests, and distribution of commits per author. We
foundthatJavaTDDprojectswererelativelyrare.Inaddition,there
were very few significant differences in any of the metrics we used
to compare TDD-like and non-TDD projects; therefore, our results
do not reveal any observable benefits from using TDD.

Test-driven development within the Java GitHub ecosystem is
quite rare.
Projects that engaged in test-driven development did not show
any significant differences in terms of quality over those projects
that simply engaged in testing.
