ABSTRACT
Most crowdsourced software development platforms adopt contest
paradigm to solicit contributions from the community. To attain
competitiveness in complex tasks, crowdsourced software devel-
opersoftenchoosetoworkwithotherscollaboratively.However,
existingcrowdsourcingplatformsgenerallyassumeindependent
contributionsfromdevelopersanddonotprovideeffectivesupport
for team formation. Prior studies on team recommendation aim at
optimizingtaskoutcomesbyrecommendingthemostsuitableteam
for a task instead of finding appropriate collaborators for a specific
person. In this work, we are concerned with teammate recommen-
dationfor crowdsourcingdevelopers. First,wepresent theresults
of an empirical study of Kaggle, which shows that developers’ per-
sonal teammate preferences are mainly affected by three factors.Second, we give a collaboration willingness model to character-
ize developers’ teammate preferences and formulate the teammate
recommendation problem as an optimization problem. Then we
design an approximation algorithm to find suitable teammates for
adeveloper.Finally,wehaveconductedasetofexperimentsona
Kaggle dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.

1 INTRODUCTION
Asaprevalentdistributedproblem-solvingmodel,crowdsourcing
has been widely applied to software development [ 1]. In recent
years, a number of crowdsourced software development(CSD) plat-
forms(e.g.Kaggle[ 2]andTopcoder[ 3])havebeenbuilttosolicit
solutions to software development tasks. In CSD platforms, task
requestors publish tasks with detailed descriptions and a certain
amount of monetary rewards. Then developers canchoose to par-
ticipateindividuallyorcollaborativelyandonlyafewtopranked
developers can obtain rewards according to the pre-set rules.
Differentfrommicro-tasksincrowdsourcing,e.g.datalabeling,
software development tasks are usually too complex for an indi-
vidual, thus developers prefer to join a team so as to ensure the
productivityandqualityofsoftwaredevelopment[ 4].Ourempirical
studyonKagglerevealsthebenefitsofteamcollaboration.However,
today’s CSD platforms like Kaggle provide no effective support for
team formation. As far as we know, few efforts have been made to
recommend teammates for crowdsourcing developers.
Team recommendation problem has been extensively studied in
various fields. In collaboration learning, a large number of studies
concentrateon assigningstudentsinto thesuitableteams andget
their skills promoted based on expertise-dissimilarity objective
andexpertise-gainobjective[ 5][6].Inprojectdevelopment,some

to assign employees to various projects with goals for employee

Therearealsosomestudiesdedicatedinminingpeople’steammate

that individual characteristics and research fields are the strongest
predictorsofcollaboration[ 12].However,fewstudieshaveinvolved
developers’ teammate preferences.
Inourwork,weaimatstudyingapersonalizedteammaterecom-
mendation approach forcrowdsourcing developers. First of all,to
verifytheimportanceofteammaterecommendation,weconduct
anempiricalstudyonKaggle.Ourresultsshowthatdeveloperscan
benefit from teamwork and they have great demand for teammate
recommendationsupportinCSDplatforms.Ouranalysisalsoshows
that developers’ teammate preferences is largely affected by three
factors including the closeness with teammates, expertise difference
with teammates, expertise gain through collaboration. Second, we
define the collaboration willingness of a developer as the weighted
sum of the above three factors, where the weights define the de-
veloper’s personal teammate preferences. Then the personalized
teammate recommendation problem is formulated as a problem
of optimizing the collaboration willingness of a team. Third, we
further provide methods to quantify the three factors, then present
a linear programming based method to compute developers’ team-
mate preferences with their collaboration history. Finally, based on
developers’ personal teammate preferences, we design a teammate
recommendation approach with an approximation algorithm to
maximize the collaboration willingness of candidate team.
The major contributions of this work are as follows:
•We identify the personalized teammate recommendation
problem for crowdsourced software development by empiri-
calstudyofKaggle.Asfarasweknow,feweffortshavebeen
made to study this issue in CSD.
•We propose a metric called collaboration willingness of a
teamtomeasurethepossibilityofsuccessfulteamformation
by considering developers’ personal teammate preferences,
and provide methods to obtain the preferences and compute
the collaboration willingness.
•We further give an approach to personalized teammate rec-
ommendationfor crowdsourcingdevelopers basedon their
personal teammate preferences, and conduct a set of ex-perimentstoevaluatetheperformanceofourapproachin
comparison with other methods.
2 AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF KAGGLE
To verify the significance of our study, we conducted an empirical
study on Kaggle. We aim to answer the following three research
questions (RQs):
•RQ1:DoesteamcollaborationmatterfordevelopersinCSD?
•RQ2:Is it common to see developers’ fail in teammate-
seeking without teammate recommendation?
•RQ3:Which factors affect developers’ willingness of collab-
oration? And do developers show personal preferences in
choosing teammates in terms of those factors?Details are available in Google Docs∗:
2.1 Data Preparation
Beyondthebasicsupportsforcompetitions,Kaggleprovidesonline
communities including Discussion Community andKernel Commu-
nity, where developers can discuss issues of various topics and
share ideas.

2.2 Benefits of Team Collaboration
Weperformedastatisticalanalysisofdevelopers’competitionrank-

competitions. The numbers of developers selected are 988 and 327
whenKissettobe10and20.Accordingtodevelopers’workmode,
we divided their development history into individual-mode and
teamwork-mode. We calculated the proportion of each developer’s
completed tasks ranking their own Top-K development history
under specified work mode, denoted as Prop. Results are shown in
Figure1. The x-axis demonstrates Prop while the y-axis represents
the accumulated ratio of developers. Figure 1exposes that devel-
opers can obtain better rankings through teamwork. For instance,
the left two points in curves of k=10 indicate that, for about
60% of 988 developers, the competitions they participated in under
teamwork-mode all rank top 10 in their own development history,
whiletheproportionisonly14.88%whencompetitionsarefinished

promoted faster through collaboration compared to working in-
dividually. We use Kaggle’s score system to quantify developers’expertise gain through each competition. 617 developers whosetimes of participation via teamwork-mode and individual-modeare both larger than 2 are chosen to analyze. We calculated the
average expertise gain of each developer under teamwork-mode
and individual-mode, denoted as G1 and G2 respectively. Then, we

From the analysis given above, developers benefit a lot from
team collaboration.
2.3 Phenomenon of Failing to Find Teammates
Wecrawledthroughthediscussiontableinourdatasettoselectdis-
cussions with term team(case insensitive) in their titles. 500 discus-
sions considered to be posted for teammate-seeking purpose were
selected.Fromdiscussionpostersandcommenters,weidentified
1987 developers who have intention to team up. Surprisingly, only
825developersparticipateinthecompetitionsintheend,among
them merely 415 developers work in teams. We can infer that only
20.9% of developers team up successfully, and 58.5% of developers
give up participating which may be due to lack of teammates.
Itiscommontoseedevelopers’failinteammate-seeking,thusit
is critical to provide teammate recommendation for developers.
2.4 Affecting Factors and Personal Teammate
Preferences
We expended a further analysis into those 500 discussions. It turns
out that 45% of the posters clearly state that they hope to gain
expertise improvement through team collaboration and 77% of
them call for teammates whose skill proficiency is similar to theirs.
We can draw the conclusion that expertise gain from collaboration
and expertise difference between teammates can affect developers’
collaboration willingness.
We sorted the 275 competitions in the dataset according to start
date. The first 245 competitions, about 90% of the dataset, are used
as history data. We selected 585 developers who have collaborated
both in history data and the remaining 30 competitions to analyze
theircollaborationrelationsandfoundthat75%ofthesedevelopers
collaboratewiththeirformerteammates.Theclosenessbetween
developerscanbereflectedbycollaborationrelations,soitisalso
an important factor affecting developers’ collaboration willingness.
From above, it can also be seen that developers put forward dif-
ferentrequirementsforteammates.Somediscussionposterscallfor
someonewithsimilarskillproficiencytoteamup,somewanttoget
their expertise promoted through teamwork, when some else want
to collaborate with their former teammates. Therefore, developers
have their personal teammate preferences, which our teammate
recommendation approach should take into consideration.3 PROBLEM FORMULATION
Inspiredbytheaboveempiricalstudy,weproposetoprovideper-
sonalizedteammaterecommendationfordevelopers.Inthissection,
we first introduce several important concepts and then provide the
formulation of our problem.
In CSD platforms, developers usually have expertise at differ-
ent proficiency levels. Developers with more experiences will bemore proficient. Let
U={u1,u2,...,un}be the set of developers,
andthewholeskillsrequiredintaskscanberepresentedasaset
S={s1,s2,...,sm}. We introduce the concept of Skill Proficiency to
denote developers’ skill-level.Definition 1

veloperui∈Uknowsisrepresentedasaset Su(ui)⊂S.Foreach
skillskthatuimasters(i.e., sk∈Su(ui)),wedefinethecorrespond-
ing skill proficiency as Prof(ui,sk)=εk
i∈[0,1], to present how
proficiently uimastersk.
Task requestors usually pre-specify the required skills for tasks.
Thus we elicit the concept of Task’s Required Skill Set.

skill tasks according to the amount of required skills. Specially, our

AsSection 2.4shows,closenesswithteammates,expertisedif-
ference and expertise gain through collaboration affect developers’
collaboration willingness and developers have their personal team-
mate preferences on these three factors. Personality, geography,
language, etc.also influencedevelopers’ collaboration willingness,
butthispaperdoesnottakethemintoconsideration.Givenadevel-
oper team T={u1,u2,...,ul}which is formed for sk-required task
v,foranydeveloper ui∈T,letC(ui,T)∈[0,1]denotethe ui’sclose-
nesswithmembersin T,ED(ui,T,sk)∈[0,1]denoteui’sexpertise
difference in skwith members, and EG(ui,T,sk)∈[0,1]represent
ui’s expertise gain in skthrough teamwork in team T. Developers’
collaboration willingness goes up with the increase of C(ui,T)and
EG(ui,T,sk), declines with the increase of ED(ui,T,sk).PreC=
{(αi,βi,γi)|i∈[1,n]}isusedtorepresenttheteammatepreferences
of developers in U. The formula of ui’s collaboration willingness in
teamTcan be formalized as:
W(ui,T)=αi∗C(ui,T)+βi∗(1−ED(ui,T,sk))+
γi∗EG(ui,T,sk),
s.t.ui∈T,αi+βi+γi=1,and
αi,βi,γi,C(ui,T),ED(ui,T,sk),EG(ui,T,sk)∈[0,1],
whereαi,βi,γiindicate the influence degree of corresponding fac-
torsondevelopers’collaborationwillingness.Themethodtoobtain
the value of PreCand representations of C(ui,T),ED(ui,T,sk),

Basedonthedefinitionsintroducedabove,wedefinetheperson-
alized teammate recommendation problem as follows:Definition3

Definition 4 (Collaboration Willingness of A Team) Whether the

and will be introduced in Section 4.2. Meanwhile, we need to maxi-
mizetheaveragevalueofallmembers’collaborationwillingness,
which is defined as the collaboration willingness of team T:
W(T)=/summationtext.1

|T|.
Formally, the personalized teammate recommendation for devel-

4 PROPOSED METHOD
We give our recommendation framework in Figure 3. In order to
quantify the collaboration willingness of team, we model the three
factorswhichdominatedevelopers’collaborationwillingness,then
characterize developers’ personal teammate preferences and get
their minimum collaboration willingness by analyzing their col-
laborationhistory.Finally,basedon collaborationwillingness,we
propose anapproximation algorithm to provideteammate recom-
mendation for developers.

Figure 3: Recommendation Framework4.1 Factor Modeling
In this part, we introduce concrete representations of the three
factors which dominate developers’ collaboration willingness.
Factor 1 (Closeness with Teammates C(ui,T)) In CSD platforms,
developers usually have collaboration relations and social interac-
tionswitheachother,basedonwhichwecanmeasurethe integrated
closeness between developers.
Definition 5 (Collaboration-Relation based Closeness C1(ui,uj))
Developersusuallycollaboratefortasks,andfrequentcollaborationmakesdeveloperscloser.Weintroduce Collaboration-Relationbased
Closeness,i.e., C1(ui,uj)∈[0,1],torepresenthowclose uiistouj
under collaboration relations. It’s worth knowing that C1(ui,uj)/nequal
C1(uj,ui). Let weighted undirected graph Ga=(U,Ra)denote
collaborationrelationsbetweendevelopers,inwhich Uisthesetof
developersand Rarepresentscollaborationrelationsbetweenthem.
∀(ui,uj)a∈Ra, the weight of this edge, w((ui,uj)a), represents
the collaboration times between uianduj. How close uiis touj
depends on the proportion of collaboration relations between ui
andujinui’s total collaboration relations:
C1(ui,uj)=w((ui,uj)a)/summationtext.1
uk∈Uw((ui,uk)a)
Definition 6 (Social-Relation based Closeness C2(ui,uj)) Many
CSD platforms provide online communities where developers can
discussandshareideas.Themorefrequentthesocialinteractions
are,themorecloserdevelopersare.Social-RelationbasedCloseness,
C2(ui,uj)∈[0,1],isusedtorepresenthowclose uiistoujunder

Letweightedundirectedgraph Gb=(U,Rb)denotesocialrelations

resents social relations between them. ∀(ui,uj)b∈Rb, the weight
of this edge, w((ui,uj)b), represents the social relation times be-
tweenuianduj.Howclose uiistoujdependsontheproportion
of socialrelations between uiandujinui’s totalsocial relations,
and can be represented as follows:
C2(ui,uj)=w((ui,uj)b)
/summationtext.1
uk∈Uw((ui,uk)b)
We denote the integrated closeness between uiandujas:
C(ui,uj)=ω∗C1(ui,uj)+(1−ω)∗C2(ui,uj),
whereω∈[0,1]represents the weight of term C1(ui,uj).I ti s

Factor 3 (Expertise Gain Through Collaboration EG(ui,T,sk))
Many developers want to promote their expertise through team-
work. Inspired by Jiawei Zhang et al.[ 11], we define a gain func-
tion to measure the improvements ofdevelopers’ skill proficiency.
First,weintroducetheskillproficiencyofteam T,representedas
Prof(T,sk),and thengive representationofdevelopers’ expertise
gain from team.
Definition 7 (ProficiencyofTeam( Prof(T,sk)))Givenateamof
developers T={u1,u2,...,ul}with proficiencylevels {εk
i}ui∈Tof
taskv’srequiredskill sk.Team’sproficiencyof skcanbedefined
as follows:
Prof(T,sk)=1−/productdisplay.1
ui∈T(1−εk
i).
The overall team proficiency is an important characteristic of
teams, which denotes both the team’s competitiveness and thespace for members’expertise gain. Formally, when collaborating
with team T, the expertise gain for uiinskcan be represented as
EG(ui,T,sk)=Prof(T,sk)−Prof(ui,sk).
4.2 Parameter Estimation
According to Section 3, we need to obtain the minimum collabora-
tionwillingness threshold anddevelopers’teammatepreferences
PreC={ (αi,βi,γi)|i∈[1,n]}.
Supposing in developers’ collaboration history, each team mem-
ber has a high willingness to collaborate because they team upon a voluntary basis. Let
Ri={T1,T2,...,Tk}represent ui’s col-
laborationhistory,and sTjrepresenttheskillrequiredbythe Tj’s
corresponding single-skill task, where Tj∈Ri. We learn threshold
andPreCat the same time as Algorithm 1describes. As threshold
andPreCarecorrelative,thelearningprocessisiterative.Witha
giventhreshold , triple(αi,βi,γi) is obtained by maximizing the
sumofui’scollaborationwillingnessofallhiscollaborationhistory
andguaranteeingthat ui’scollaborationwillingnessineachteamis
no less than threshold , as Equation (2) demonstrates. With a given
threshold , Equation (2) is a typical linear programming problem,
we canget (αi,βi,γi)bytypical methodsof linearprogramming
problem. We initialize threshold to 0 and increase threshold by a
specified step size until ∃ui∈U, there is no valid solution for
(αi,βi,γi), and then we can obtain an approximate solution for
threshold , based on which we obtain the value of PreC.
(αi,βi,γi)=arg max

T∈RiW(ui,T)
s.t.∀T∈Ri,W(ui,T)≥threshold ,and
αi+βi+γi=1,αi,βi,γi∈[0,1](2)
4.3 Objective Function and Algorithm
Aftergetting PreC,developers’teammatepreferencesarecharacter-
ized. Combined with Factor 1-3, for any given team T,∀ui∈T,w e
can calculate ui’s collaboration willingness W(ui,T). Then, we can
gettheconcreterepresentationofourobjectivefunctiondenoted
as Equation (1). To recommend the most suitable teammates fordeveloper, a straightforward solution is traversing all candidatesand find the required
Nteammates, which is not feasible as theAlgorithm 1 Obtaining Teammate Preferences & threshold

where ∄ul∈U\{ui,uj},W({ui,uj,ul})>W({ui,uj,uk}); The
process continues until the number of recommended teammates

6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we identify the personalized teammate recommen-
dation problem for crowdsourced software development by an em-
pirical study of Kaggle. Then, we propose an approach to solve the
problem by maximizing the collaboration willingness of a team
based on developers’ personal teammate preferences. Experiments
conducted on Kaggle dataset verifies the effectiveness of our ap-
proach.
Inthefuture,wewillstudyteammaterecommendationinvolving
multiple development skills and try to solve the cold start problem
when providing recommendation for novices.
