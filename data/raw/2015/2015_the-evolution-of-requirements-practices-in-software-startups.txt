Entrepreneurship and innovation is a hot topic, reflected in the
hugenumberofsoftwarestartupsaroundtheworld. Manysuccess-
ful products and services developed by startups, such as Uber or
AirBnB,areusedbymillions. Startupstakeadvantageofmodern
software technologies that allow them to quickly build and release
software. They typically follow agile practices [ 18,29], lean de-
velopment [ 9,44], continuous integration [ 17] and DevOps [ 16],
as part of a largely unstructured approach to software engineer-
ing [20]. These startup companies are attempting to successfully
identifyasetofuserrequirementsanddevelopeffectivebusiness
modelsaroundinnovativeproductsandservices. Theyareunder
significant time pressure to bring their products to market with
limited resources and to find a business model that allows them to
survive and grow. Many startups fail to achieve these goals and
shut down within in their first two years [ 42]. We are interested in
seeing how requirements practices affect their longer term success.
Companiesthatmakeitthroughtheearlyphasesareinteresting
from a software engineering perspective, and are the focus of this
work. Very little is known about how these “emerging companies”
discover, prioritise and manage information about requirementsovertime. Whiletheinitialrequirementsmayhavebeencreated
informally – from a largely unknown market or a niche market of
users willing to take risks on a new product [ 37] – the informal
approachoftendoesnotscalewellasthecompanygrows[ 20]. A
startup’s ecosystem is highly dynamic, leading to challenges inadapting to the pressures given by the clients’ requests, market
pressure, developer insights or changes in platform requirements.
Whileapreviousstudydocumentedrequirementspracticesin
small companies [ 1], we are not aware of empirical evidence about
how requirements practices evolve as these companies mature,leading to several open questions: How do requirements practices
evolve over time in startups? What are the frictions and drivers for
changes in how they manage their product and user requirements?
We present a theory of requirements practice evolution in such
emergingcompanies. UsingaStraussianGroundedTheory(GT)ap-proach[
48],westudiedthejourneyof16startupswithaparticular
focus on how they managed their product requirements from com-pany inception. Our theory explains the turning points that caused
changes in their practice along 6 dimensions of requirements prac-
tice,suchasthe requirementsartefacts producedandmaintained,

in the discovery and prioritisation of requirements, the planning of
requirements implementation and prioritisation, the technical debt
as related to handling new requirements and the product quality as
driven by implementation of user-driven requirements. Our the-
ory also identifies propositions as relationships among dimensions.
Our empirical data suggests clear trends towards more structured,
plan-basedand documentation-oriented practices. Thesechanges
arereactive, rather than planned, suggesting an ongoing pragmatic
lightness, or flexibility, in the startups’ evolution towards an “en-
gineering” of requirements. Our research extends the empirical
evidenceaboutsoftwareengineeringpracticesinearlystartups[ 20],
with an emphasis on the details of evolving requirements practices.
Our theory provides both a conceptual framework to organise the
knowledge pertinent to the evolution of requirements in maturing
startups and a practical path for such startups to improve their
practices in face of specific challenges in their own journeys.
2 RELATED WORK
Therehasbeenrelativelylittleexplorationofthewaysthatstartups

mentsareusuallymarket-drivenandtendtobevolatile,particularlyininnovativeareas. Up-frontapproachesarenotwellsuitedtocope
with rapid changes of requirements and technology, as require-
mentscollectedattheearlystagesoftenbecomeobsolete,before
project delivery [ 10]. Melegati et al. [ 35] proposed a RE process
modelforstartups. Basedonaninterviewstudyofthestate-of-the-
practice in 9 Brazilian companies, the model highlights contextual
elementsrelevanttotherequirementspractice: thefounders,the
software development manager, the market, the business model,
andtheentrepreneurshipecosystem. However,thismodelprovides
no information on how these practices evolved in these companies.
Agile practices, particularly flexible and reactive methods de-
signedtostimulatecustomerfeedback,suchasleanagileapproaches[
43],areperceivedasadequateforfastchangingrequirements[ 19].
However,theytypicallysufferfrominadequatetreatmentof domain
knowledge and differences in opinions in customer input [15], as
wellasof non-functionalrequirements (NFRs)[27]. Intheabsenceof
actual customers, alternative strategies for requirements elicitation
includeminingrequirementsfromonlinesources(e.g.,socialnet-
works,discussionforums)[ 24],oruseof personas[12]. Userstories
[5] are often adopted in startups [ 42]. However the information
they provide to developers has been found to be insufficient [34].
Inastudyof13startupswithlessthan3yearsofoperation,Gia-
rdino et al. [ 20] developed the Greenfield Startup Model describing
theactivities thatcharacterise earlyphase startups. Theyrelateto
findingtheproduct/marketfitwithinuncertainconditionsandwith
severe lack of resources. The model, however, does not apply to
companiesthathavematuredbeyondtheearlyphasenordiscusses
the evolution of their requirements practices. Similar to Hoda and
Noble’sstudyofagileapproachesadoptionin31organisations[ 26],
Giardinoetal.’sstudyusedaGTapproach[ 22]showingitsvalue
for studying software development processes.
With respect to startups’ stages of development, previous work
documentsaprogressionfrom: (i)productconceptionandinitial
requirements,andfirstsale,to(ii)astabilisationstagewherenew
requirements may become unmanageable, to (iii) a growth stage
whereskillsshortageandplatformcreepdelaydevelopment[ 14],suggesting the startups’ need to adapt their requirements practices
as they mature. For instance, knowledge management becomesincreasingly important as a risk prevention and mitigation strat-egy [
7,36,45]. Similarly, Nguyen-Duc et al.’s two-cycle model
[37] indicates early stage startups emphasis on a huntingcycle
when generating ideas, eliciting requirements and customer de-
velopment predominate, followed by a gathering cycle when the
product-market fit becomes better understood and activities ofrequirements description, prototype implementation, automatedtesting and system integration dominate while the huntingcon-
tinues, bringing innovation to the product. This model does not,
however,specificallyindicatethechangesstartupsgothrough,why
they occur, and their impact on RE practices and artefacts.

the discussion on threats to validity according to interpretivists’
criteria[33]: Ourtheory andits underlyingelements andrelation-

only the ones studied in this work. This threat is mitigated as a
resultof thetheoretical saturationconcept, andbyselecting com-
panies from different countries and at different phases on their
evolutionjourney. Nonetheless,wecouldhavepotentiallyobtained

4 THEORY OF REQUIREMENTS PRACTICE
EVOLUTION IN SOFTWARE STARTUPS
Fundamental to understanding startups’ evolving requirements
practice is understanding how they decide and prioritise the fea-tures to be included in successive versions of their product(s).Largely unique to startups is the speed at which the y make de-
cisions on product features. While the initial product vision is
driven by the founders, the discovery and prioritisation of features
areongoing,adaptiveprocessesthattakeplaceinacomplexand
rapidlychangingenvironment. Oncetheproductisinthemarket,
futurereleaseplanningmustconsiderclients’requests,marketand
competitive analysis, bug fixing, and unplanned events, such as
new platform releases, e.g., a new version of iOS [ 49]. These forces
willdrivetheprioritisationofproductrequirementsandsometimes
result in a pivot [ 4] towards a complete new product or a redefi-
nition of the user base and its associated requirements. Startups
make these changes at a much faster pace than established firms.
But how do companies that survive longer in the market evolve
to successfully respond to such pressures in their environment and
how does their requirements practice evolve? Our study led usto define 6 dimensions relevant to the evolution of requirements
practice: 1requirementsartefacts, 2knowledgemanagement, 3
requirements-related roles, 4planning, 5technical debt and6
product quality. Each dimension is characterised by 3 phases of evo-
lution,eachwithcorresponding turningpoints. Aturningpointcan
beeitheradiscreteeventorthe“tippingpoint”foranongoingtrend.In either case, it precipitates changes in one or more dimensions of
acompany’srequirementspractice. Wehaveidentified8 turning
points,whichreflectchangesin: 1numberofclients, 2inputfrom
clients,3negative feedback, 4clients retention rate, 5revenue,
6number of employees, 7number of remote workers orflexible
work hours, and 8number of features or products . Each turning
pointdirectlyaffectsatleastonedimension. Sincedimensionshave
inter-relationships(discussed inSection4.7), aturningpoint may
indirectly affect several other dimensions. Each dimension and
phases of evolution, together with its relevant turning points (TPs)
aredescribedinthefollowingsubsections. Theapplicationofour
theory to the studied startups is described in Section 5.
While we limit the discussion of external funding, we note that
funding plays a central role in the life of a startup and the speed at
whichitevolves. Raisingmoneyfromfriends,family,crowdfunding,
angelinvestors,and/orventurecapitalfirmscansignificantlyaffect
thelong-termsuccessofastartup,givingitthenecessarycapital
to hire people, and to make prospective customers aware of the
company’sproductsandservices. Inshort,sufficientfundingmakes
it possible to evolve requirements practices through the various
dimensionsandturningpointsdescribedbelow,whileinadequate
funding slows a company’s growth and often leads to its demise.8VHURULHQWHG,PSOHPHQWDWLRQ

4.1 Requirements artefacts
Intheearlystageofastartup,thereislittledocumentation. Productrequirementsmaybewrittendownon post-itnotes visibletoevery-
onephysicallypresent,asreportedbyP12, “Therequirements? Itwas
trackedusingstickynotesonawhiteboard(…) Whenwehadanidea,whenwehadathingthatweneededtodo,wegotthatonstickynote”.
Whilestartupsoftenusea moderncollaborationplatform,suchas
GitHub[28]orBitbucket[ 6]fromthestart,alongwitha projectman-
agementtool ,suchasAsana[ 2],JIRA[3]orKanbanize[ 30],these
tools are rarely used to manage product requirements. From an
understanding of requirements, implementation-oriented high-
level tasks artefacts are often recorded without much rationale.
Quoting P03, “It pretty much just came to very high level details and
veryhighprogress(…) no[timeoreffort]estimates,nologicbehind,
nothing, just a simple task”. NFRs are not explicitly addressed [ 20].
Inthisearlyphase,the co-founders’background andtheinitial

morecodeitwasprobablyaproblem”. Ifateammemberisknowl-
edgeable onUser eXperience (UX), user needsare more likely to
arise early. Lack of documentation becomes an issue when new
employees join the company (TP), and struggle to learn the exist-
ingtacitknowledge. AsP03noted, “Istartedrealisingonboarding
problems (…) I thought well, that’s probably because of the lack of
documentation. Andourconversationalwayshadthis,‘itwasnice[if]thiswasdocumented’. (…) Iseethevalueofthatforonboardingnow”.
Theproblem ismagnifiedifpeople work remotely (TP).When the
product is first released to users, the company gains its first clients
(TP),makingitessentialtoviewtheproductfromtheirperspective.
The company then enters the second phase, and the require-
mentsartefactsbecome useroriented .Personasemergeand user
storiesareusedtodescribeexistinganddesiredfeatures[ 21,36,51].
QuotingP02, “Nowtheusersmatter,theymattermore,hencetheuser
stories”. The post-it notes and whiteboards can still be used, butthe information that is available in the project management tools
starts to become more complete in order to help new hires andremote workers, as reported by P12, “In our perspective, the best
way to support remote work is that everything must be written down,
noexceptions. SowehaveConfluenceandJIRAandeverything,everytask,iswelldetailed.”. Atthispoint,andifitwasnotthecasebefore,
companiesmaybegincreating UIdesignsandUXmodels andtesting
them with users. In fact, the overall UX is important and drives
some of the decisions concerning the product (see Section 4.4).
The growing number of clients increases input from clients (TP),
suchasfeaturerequestsandbugreports. That,inturn,increasesthe
need for product support, leading to both internal documentation
forsupportstaffandtoexternaldocumentation,suchasFAQs,to
helpuserswithcommonissues. Asthenumberofemployeesgrows,
the company has the resources to move beyond the initial product
to introduce new features (TP) or additional product(s), both of
whichdrivetheneedforgreateruseof projectmanagementtools.
Developers mayuse burndowncharts toidentify thefeatures that
arebeingaddedinthecurrentiteration,whileothersmayusemore
general task-tracking and project management tools. Tracking
feature requests becomes important. As P03 noted, “We had things
that weren’t actually getting recorded, that information is now lost”.
When a company enters the third phase, requirements artefacts
evolveinto richer,traceabledescriptions . Totacklethegrowing
numberoffeaturesorproducts,theuseofthe projectmanagement
toolis often improved and systematised: each high-level task is
decomposed into small actionable tasks, associated with effort and
time estimates, as confirmed by P08, “We started assigning an ef-

building this feature, what clients it might land us, priority levels

Tasksareorganisedintoprojectsorreleases,prioritisedandthen
assigned. In the most advanced startups, a feature request may
include its rationale, the source of the request, an evaluation of its
importancerelativetothecompanygoals,itsacceptancecriteria,
taskdependenciesandotherassociatedinformation. Ascompanies
refine their product management process, some requests are dis-
carded or given low priority as they do not fit company or product
goals. Some companies create a new feature or product proposal
documenting all the needed information. Quoting P07, “We’ll take
an idea and build a product proposal. Requirements gathering andresearch is done in order to build that proposal, which states that this
new feature or this existing feature will take care of this customer,sales will be affected in this way, customer success will be affectedin this way, here is what we expect the outcome of the product, [it]explains what we are doing and why”. Traceability links support
managingartefacts evolution. P06said, “(…) wehave traceability
for issues and bugs that track back to Asana that map to a Google
Docfortheproposal. SoI’veactuallybeentryingtoimplementthings
that help the team, using the technology that we are familiar with”.
4.2 Knowledge management
Companiesaccumulateknowledgeastheygrow. Atfirst,theknowl-
edge isinformal and unstructured , with the team using tacit
knowledge and informal anytime, anywhere discussions. Founders
ofthestartupteam,typically2-4people,normallyknowandrely
upon one another, as confirmed by P16, “I can rely on him to re-
member certain things and do things in a certain way and be veryprecise and specific and so forth. And, I assume, he can rely on mein a similar way”. Moreover, the initial product only has a smallsetoffeatures,whicharefairlyeasytomanage,asstatedbyP18,
“Our product was so simple (…) it was really easy to keep track of
everything without having a process or anything else but code”.
Theaccumulatedtacitknowledgeaboutfeatures,productsand
clients becomes harder to manage as the number of employees (TP)
andremote workers (TP) increases and as early hires depart [ 31].
Thisdifficultydrivesacompanytoenterthesecondphase,where
knowledgemanagementbecomes informalandsemi-structured .
Someknowledgeisvaluabletoeveryoneandcanbehandledthrough
regularteamorcompanymeetings. Otherknowledgeisonlyrele-
vant to a subset of employees, e.g., developers, and can be handled
in meetings connected to their agile software development activity.
The informal discussions and ad hocverbal communication still
exist, but the meetings facilitate shared knowledge about the prod-
uct and the features, and are a more structured way to pass that
information, as declared by P08, “(…) regular meetings, to formalise
alittlebitmoreourcommunicationprocessandhavejusttheright
amount of structure. It helped us a ton, keeping everyone in the loop”.
Inthisphase, onlinecommunicationtools replace,tosomeextent,
thead hocverbal communication. Tools like Slack [ 47] help in
keeping the remote workers up to date and are also seen as a way
to document decisions. Quoting P10, “Slack is nicebecauseit has a
history. OnethingthatwearelearningisthatifIhaveaconversation
withsomeoneandIdon’twriteeverythingdown,it’sreallyhardto
remembereverysinglepieceofinformation. Slackhelpswiththat. (…)Wedo dailyscrums butwe dothem over Slack(…) because lotsof the
people are out of the office”. Although all content inside these tools
issearchable,includingfilesandpeople,itisstillnotastructured
waytodocumentknowledgeandsometimesitishardtoseparate
useful information from off-topic conversations and noise.
As companies grow, they not only add staff, but divide into sep-
aratedepartments,suchassales,marketing,financeanddevelop-
ment, each with its own need to manage and preserve information.
Departmentandcompanymeetingsareinadequate,especiallyas
thecompanyadds newproducts andnewfeatures (TP)toexisting
products. As confirmed by P03, “You have too much information
about your product in your mind. And changes can happen everyday,
thisisacrazyenvironment. Rememberingeverylittlechangeisnot

possible, even if you have a great mind”. At the same time, the prod-
uct is in the market and the company receives input from clients
(TP), which can be conveyed through sales people, bug reports
or even requests for new features. That information needs to be
filtered and transmitted to the relevant employees in an efficient
and timelymanner. Quoting P24, “There wasno information about
howto document information, how to informthe restof thecompany,
which is not minor, because every time you release a new feature, the
wholecompanyneedstoknow. Thecustomersuccessteamneedsto
inform the customers, marketing needs to promote that new feature”.

the knowledge management becomes more structured . There is a

Theknowledgeisthendocumentedinamorestructuredway,as
discussedinSection4.1. Thisimprovementinthedocumentation
helps in the knowledge distribution, as pointed out by P06, “I think
right now we are pretty good at documentation for knowledge. So
there are parts of our product that I don’t understand because I don’t
have the technical understanding. But the team that is responsible
for that part, they build documentation that allows me to understand
how it works and the value it provides”. Of course, using such tools

here’. Theno-brainersaretheoneslikeSlack,GitHub,everythingthatAtlassianhastooffer. Anythingthatisbetweencodeandkindofsome
formalised structure, project management related”.
4.3 Requirements-related roles
In a company’s first phase, team roles may be general and multi-
ple, with“everyonedoing everything”asneeded. Assuch, every-
oneisresponsibleforunderstandingthemarket,talkingtopotential
customers, identifying key features, and more. As P07 observed,
“Twoco-founders, doing everything. Customer support, development,
sales,marketing,thewholeshebang”. Theyareconstantlyswitching
contexts, shifting from one role to the next several times duringthe day. As summarised by P24, “At the very beginning, when we
are 4 or 5, we are seated all together, we are talking 24/7, we are fully
committedto thecompany andto whatwe aredoing, wedon’t have
manyresources,wearelikeanoctopus,wedoeverything”. Inmost
cases, one person becomes the CEO, with overall responsibility for
the business, while another takes the lead in building the product.
Afirstsignificanttriggerforchangeiswhenthefirstproducthas
been released and has paying customers (TP). These customers may
requestnewfeatures,findbugs,and/oraskforsupportandtraining,allofwhichplacegrowingdemandsontheexistingteam(TP).These
demands may affect the quality and predictability of the overall
work. P02reported, “Iwasdoingsomanythingsatthesametime.
(…) What I was doing wasn’t scalable and the quality of the product
wasstartingtogodown” . Additionally,thedevelopmentisslower
thanitcouldbe,becausedevelopersareperformingotheractivities
not related with code, as declared by P08, “We had everyone on thedevelopmentteamdoingcustomersupportandthatconsumedalotof
engineering time, because engineers were on chat all day, live chat”.
The company enters the second phase when the roles become
semi-specific and multiple but also with a clear emphasis on
requirements-relatedactivities. Newhiresaffordedbythehigher
revenueorexternalfundinghavemorespecificroles,oftenwitha
customer-facingrolein marketing, sales,orsupport. P01observed
that,“Developmentandproducttogethershouldberoughlyaround
40%ofthecompany. It’sverytempting,especiallyintechnicallyled
companies,tomakeit60,70,80%ofthecompany,butthetruthisif
wearenotmarketing,[then]wearenotselling,wearenotsupporting,
then what do we do?”. In the majority of the studied companies,
whenthe numberofclients increased,theyfounditnecessarytohire
or to move an employee to a success/support position, as confirmed
by P07,“We hired success and support [staff]. We were having more
customers, and they were e-mailing us more often”.
People in these roles not only help clients with the initial in-
stallation or use of the product, but also identify necessary newfeatures based on their interactions with these customers. Salespeople often bring new feature requests, especially when the ab-sence of a particular feature in the product might be blocking a
sale. The marketing team (perhaps a single person at first) usually
assumes responsibility for maintaining the product roadmap (prod-
uct management), as well as identifying the target market, crafting
the marketing message, and training the sales team (product mar-
keting). Taken together, the increase in customers and the growth
of customer-facing staff brings added focus to the user experience.
While each employee wears fewer different hats than before,
they still have more than one responsibility. Quoting P10, “We
startedhiringmorepeopleforspecificroles. Wehaddevelopers,we
neededtohavemoreofthose(…) wehiredaclientsuccessmanager
to stay on track of all of our clients. But we still need to be more
specialised, no one is responsible for only one thing”.
If everything goes well and the company is successful, the num-
beroffeaturesorproducts willincrease(TP),addingtotheimpor-
tance and complexity of product management. Also, the number
of employees will continue to grow (TP), leading to the third phase
wheretherequirement-relatedrolesare specific and single .Th e
company may split out quality assurance activities from devel-
opment,andhireQualityAssurance(QA)specialistswhoensure
thatthe productmeets therequired qualitystandards. Similarly, a
product manager or aproduct owner is responsible for creating and
prioritisingtheproductbacklog. Companieswithmultipleproducts
will eventually have a director of products to oversee the various
product managers and determine product priorities. In addition to
thepreviouslynotedproductmarketingtasks,thecompanymay
addacommunitymanager,whowillhaveakeyroleingathering
product“wishes”fromtheusercommunity,oftenthroughacom-
pany forum and social media [ 25]. As this specialisation proceeds,
many day-to-day tasks are well covered, giving the CEO and other
senior executives more time to focus on strategic issues, including
the long-term vision for the company, as discussed in Section 4.4.
4.4 Planning
Intheearlieststageofastartup,thereisverylittleroomforplan-
ning, which is non-existent or minimal . Startups are still trying
to assess market needs and to find users for their initial product.

Productfeaturesmaychange“onthefly”,basedonthewishesof
a potential customer as much as on the founders’ concept. In that
situation, the company is highly reactive, leaving little room for
long-term planning. The team’s energy is primarily directed at
buildinganddemonstratingtheinitialversionoftheproductinthe
hope of attracting customers (and possible investors).
Positive reactions to the emerging product will often be accom-
panied by feature requests from early adopters, and drive the next
steps of product development. Negative reactions may cause thecompany to revise its thinking and pivotto a different idea. As
a consequence, the feature set in the product is very fluid, often
responding to requests from potential early customers (TP) rather
than focusing on the founding team’s initial vision. Rather than
creating a single product, they would create custom developments
oraddfeaturesasrequestedbyspecificcustomerstomakeasale.
As P08 observed, “We were much more hungry for clients before,
so we bent over backwards a lot more, doing basically what they
wantedustodo. Sowewouldhaveabunchofone-offthings”. That
approachisincompatiblewithcreatingaproduct-focusedcompany,
especially as the number of clients grows (TP). At that point, the
teamshiftstoa“standard”product,oftenwithnumerousfeatures
forcustomisation. Earlycustomersthenhavethechoicebetween
moving to the product or staying with their “one-off” version.
With this experience of customer wishes, the company then
entersthesecondphase,whereplanningbecomes monthly and
quarterly-oriented . The growing backlog of customer requests
andotherneededproductchanges[ 51]makesbetterplanningneces-
sary. Schedules,though,maystillbeloose,unlesstherearespecific
eventsthatcreatedeadlines. P02said, “We’vealwaysbeenkindof
aversetodeadlines(…) Deadlinesdon’tmakeresultsbetter,andit’s
not an enjoyable place to work (…) you feel like you were working
atafactory”. Inthesecases,thereleasesarenotplanned: whena
feature is completed, it can be released immediately. In a similar
manner,areleasecanincludeonlyasmallbugfix,andthecompany

expandtestingtheuserexperiencewithitscustomers. P24noted,
“User experience is really important. We work really closely with our
customers, we try to interview them, and have case studies and UI
tests (…) They influence our feature prioritisation in a way”.
Competition is also an important factor in feature prioritisation.
In some companies, mining competitors’ forums and social media is
anessentialactivity,givingthecompanytheopportunitytogain
anadvantagebyimplementingkeyfeaturesfirst. Takentogether,
these varioussources lead to anincrease in the number offeatures
(TP) or a pivot away from the product towards a different idea.
Overall, planning become easier as the number of employees grows
(TP),revenueincreasesandgrowthstabilises(TP).Peoplehavewell-
definedrolesandresponsibilities,andthecompanygainsabetter
senseofthemostpromisingproductdirectionandtargetmarket(s).
The third stage is characterized by the introduction of long-
termplanning,encompassing multiplereleases. Planningbecomes
strategic and aligned with vision . Feature requests, whether
internally or externally generated, are systematically evaluated;thoseperceivedasvaluableadditionstotheproductareassigned
to a specific future release. However, high-priority needs, suchas security holes, may alter the plans and lead to a previously
unplannedrelease. Planningisalsoinfluencedbythecompany’s
feelings about addressing a broader or narrower market. If there is

are no longer aligned with the product vision. At this stage of
planning, the company has a good sense of their customers and
theirneeds,aswellasthemarketplace,makingiteasierforthemto
decideonadditionandremovalofproductfeatures. P08commented,
“Nowthere’salotmorethoughtintobringingnewthingsonandwhat
we will do for a customer. (…) We have to decide what actually we
think is going to be better for our clients. If they want something that
is very particular to them, for their business, we can’t do it”.
4.5 Technical debt
“Technicaldebt”referstotheaccumulatedbacklogofsoftwarede-
velopment neededbecause developers favour a “quick and dirty”
over a more complete solution, usually to reduce the overall imple-
mentation time. Such shortcuts and workarounds are often made
bystartups[ 50]intheirefforttobringtheirproducttomarketas
quicklyaspossible,andtovalidatetheirassumptionsabouttheir
targetmarketandtheproblemtheyaretryingtosolve[ 20]. Quickly
findingtherightproductfeaturestofitaparticularmarketisthe
highest priority, as reported by P06, “Basically everything was built
with popsicle sticks and duct tape, because it was fast, as fast as you
can get something out”. Even though the company knows and
acceptsthe existenceof technical debt, it isgenerally not tracked.
Albeit it would not be hard to include such information in their
productmanagementtool,thedevelopersrarelydocumentwhich
features are affected by the shortcut or workaround, nor the way it
might affect future featur es. Speed is paramount.
As thenumber of features increases (TP) and the product be-
comes more complex, problems may appear. Earlier shortcuts and
workarounds may affect long-term development, performance and
maintainability of the product. Implementing a workaround in
onefeaturemightbreakanotherone. Ontheotherhand,fixinga
workaroundononefeaturemightbreakanotherfeature,dependent
onthepreviousimplementationofthefirstone. Withmoredevelop-
ers (TP), it becomes possible (and often necessary) to address these
problems. Generally, the person who created the debt is in the bestpositiontoreduceit,sinceanewhirewillnotbeasknowledgeable.
Becomingawareoftechnicaldebt[ 32]andthen tracking and
recording it, marks advancement to the second stage for the com-
pany. At this point, startups not only know that technical debt
exists, but also which features are affected by it and how. Nonethe-
less, this does not mean that the company will start paying this
debt immediately, since first the startup needs to make a conscious
decision to tackle it. However, with more people the company has
the resources to do so, as confirmed by P02, “It probably was when
wehiredmoredevelopers. Icouldstartfocusingonsomeofthedebt.
Notcompletelypayforit(…) butatleastknowingwhereitis” .Th e

debt will continue to exist and even grow if it is not causing the
producttofailanddoesnotsubstantiallyaffecttheclients. Quoting
P18,“It’s a hard decision, but if the debt is not causing the product to
crash, we’ll not prioritise the payment [of the technical debt]”.
When the technical debt affects the product quality, perhaps
causing it to malfunction or perform poorly, companies begin to
havenegativefeedback fromclients(TP).Withmodernpublicprod-
uctreviewmechanisms,thisnegativefeedbackmaybewidelyseen.
In most ofthe studied companies, the businessmodel followed
asubscription plan, which means that the startup would have a
payingclientfortheentireperiodofthesubscription,regardless
of their satisfaction with the product. This provides some financial
stabilityduringthatperiodoftime,asdeclaredbyP19, “(…) itgives
ussometimeandfinancialstabilitytocontinueworkingandtotackle
some of the problems that might exist”. On the other hand, if the
client is not content with the product, they will not renew their
subscription,andthe clientretentionrate willdecrease(TP),causing
alossinfuturerevenue. Thatriskusuallycausesthecompanyto
prioritise the most serious technical debt-related problems in their
product development plans to improve client satisfaction.
Addressingtechnicaldebtsystematicallyiscentraltothethird
phase, where it is managed and controlled , with the develop-
ment team addressing accumulated technical debt. This involves
rewritingandrefactoringportionsofthecode. Mostimportantly,
this engineering work is integrated into the overall product release
planning, making it visible to the product manager, and customers.
At this stage, requirements practice is no longer focused exclu-
sivelyonproductfeatures,butalsoencompassesNFRsthatmustbe
addressed by the development team to assure high product quality.
Retirement of technical debt is just one piece of a maturing
development organisation, where code reviews, automated tests,
and coding standards become standard practice. These changes do
notoccuratthesametime,andnormallyaremotivatedbyanew
feature being dependent on some part of the code that was already
written. Alogicof“twobirdsonestone”isfollowed,ascommented
byP03,“it’susually onlystrategic,the needarisesbecauseof anew
feature(…) ifthereisabigfeaturethatiscomingalong,thenIcan
look at it, fix our technical debt there”. In spite of this fact, some
technical debt will always persist, as reported by P05, “If you get to
zero, you are probably doing something wrong. You are never done”.
4.6 Product quality
Intheearlystagesofastartup,speedofreleasetakesprecedence
overquality,thelatterbeing notaconcern . NFRshavelowpriority
compared to validating the product idea and the market. Testing is
minimal, since small problems can be quickly corrected in the next
release (whichcan bedeployed inthe sameday, sincethey follow
practicesofcontinousdeployment[ 41]),diminishingtheneedto
be concerned with every aspect of product quality. Quoting P12,
“Ourdevelopmentspeedissomethingthatwereallydon’twanttogive
up, sojustgetitoutand testit, becausewecan alwaysgoback, we
can always change it or fix it quickly”.
The initial clients are normally aware of this reality, and have a
constructiveattitudetowardssuchbugs. However,thisgenerous
viewstartstochangeovertime,sincetheclientsexpectanincrease
intheproductqualitylevel,especiallyiftheyaredependingonit
for a critical business function. If the product continues to performbelowexpectations,thiswillresultinanincreased negativefeedback
(TP). As seen in Section 4.5, in the long-term this will cause the
company to lose clients and, therefore, revenue. Quoting P13, “(…)
westartedcaringaboutqualitybecausewewerelosingclients. [The
product] was great for marketing, but we had problems delivering”.
Productqualitybecomes somewhatimportant inthesecond
phase. The company wants to avoid negative feedback, and they
now haveemployees whocan address issuesof quality, including
the NFRs of security and usability, factors that mainly affect the
clients. P24commented, “WehaveasmallQAteamandtheyarenot
comingfromatechside,theyareworriedabouttheuserexperience
and try to test the product the way a user would do it and try to find
flaws. Userexperienceisoneofthemostimportantqualityaspects”.
Scalability also gains importance, because the company is hoping
for rapid growth in the number of users, and must be prepared.
As the company grows, additional NFRs, such as availability
and efficiency, gain importance as a way to maximise the client
retentionrate (TP).P06said, “Productqualitywasnotthatimportant,
but now it is (…) It is our number one concern. When your clients
areunsatisfied,it’sagamebreakeranditisalmostinsomecasesa
contractbreaker. Eventobringnewclientsin,theyexpectacertain
number of features and a certain amount of uptime”.
Inthethirdphasetheproductqualityisa toppriority forthe
company. ThesetofNFRstakenintoconsiderationexpandsfrom
usability and scabability, to cover efficiency, fault-tolerance, main-
tainability, and availability, among others. While some startups
are slow toaddress overall issues of productquality, others attach
greatimportancetoproductqualityfromtheoutset,asobserved
by P10, “[Compromising quality:] that’s something that we really
really don’t like to do (…) quality is one of the most important things,
the clients would not tolerate any other way”. In these cases, poor
qualityinthefirstreleasemightunderminethestartup’schances
ofsurvival. Additionally,quality(orthelackofit)cansometimes
beperceivedasawaytogain(orlose)reputation,ascommentedbyP11,“Qualityissomethingthatisreallyimportant,becauseitreflects
on us”. Startups at this third phase devote significant resourcesto the various aspects of product quality, knowing that productdeficiencies will cause them to lose market share to competitors
through defecting clients and inability to gain new customers.
4.7 Relationships among dimensions
Followingthe principlesof generatingSE theories[46], thisstudy
does not just present a set of descriptive elements but also defines
the key relationships among them. Our empirical data suggest that
an action of the company to advance along one of the dimensions
bringsalongadvancesinotherdimensions. Culturehasemerged
as another strong determining factor affecting the evolution along
all the dimensions in our theory, so it deserves to be highlightedhere. In Fig. 2 we include the 6 previously identified dimensionsalongside Cultureand the 9 propositions about the relationships
among them. We summarise them briefly next.
P1:As requirements artefacts become more complete and struc-
tured, the communication ofchanges becomes more effective and
vice versa.
P2:Specialisation in requirements-related roles enables the use
of more sophisticated knowledge management practices and tools.

of Requirements Practice Evolution
P3:Hiringmorepeopleinrequirements-relatedrolesallowsthe
company to devote more resources to product planning.
P4:Improved planning allows the creation of more complete
and structured requirements artefacts.
P5:Richer requirements artefacts allow for enhanced under-
standing and treatment of product quality (NFR).
P6:Creating and hiring people into more specific requirements-
related roles allows the company to better handle product features
and to address NFRs.
P7:Improved ability to handle technical debt results in a higher
ability to prioritise requirements with greatest customer impact.
P8:Handling technical debt is enhanced by and increases the
company’s ability to prioritise product quality.
P9:All changes are influenced by a combination of company
culture and the co-founders’ backgrounds.
While details of these relationships might be apparent from the
richer descriptions of the theory dimensions in Section 4, we illus-
trate some of them here. Consider propositions P2, P3, and P6. The
evolution of requirements related roles, i.e., adding more peopleand giving them specialised roles (P2), means that the companyis better able to plan its product development and release sched-
ule (P3), as well as to assure the quality of the evolving product
(P6). A product manager is given responsibility for creating and
prioritisingtheproductbacklog,planningthereleasesanddeciding
what features the startup needs to build next. At the same time,
theincreaseincompanyheadcountforcesthecompanytoimprove
its knowledge management practices. Everyone, from the CEO on
down, has the responsibility to collect and manage the knowledge
about the company’s vision, products, and markets. That makes it
easierforthecompanytomakebothstrategicandtacticaldecisions,
as well as to quickly bring new hires up tospeed.
Finally, in all the studied companies, the cultureand the expe-
rience of the co-founders determined how the startup operated
during its early days, as also found in [ 11]. Experienced leaders
may know which practices are most effective, and have a better
senseofwhentobringinpeoplewithspecificskills,makingadjust-mentsbasedontheskillsandthelocationofemployees. Hiringthe

weight processes to the fast-paced world of a startup. In short, the

As animplication for practice, a startup canuse ourtheoryto

insight about how to address an identified turning point. However,
the influence of people and company culture is an important factor

5.2 Towards Requirements Engineering for
startups
We concluded that startups do not practice an “engineering” ap-
proachtorequirementsdevelopment. Ourevidencesuggeststhat

waste of time and a hindrance to releasing their product as soon
as possible. Exhaustive documentationor long-term planningare
discarded in order to let the company move faster, achieve rapid
time-to-marketandvalidatepreviousassumptionsregardingthe
clientsandtheproduct-marketfit. Innovationintheirproductsand
their positioning in the market – key to the companies’ survival or
success–takesplaceinafast-paced,volatilecontext,andisonly
possible through processes that are reactive and evolutionary. Our
search for a “final product” that is carefully designed and planned
did not take us far. Instead, a startup’s product is continuously
being iterated and updated based on customer feedback, employer
insights, competitive issues, market demands and ongoing changes
in the frameworks and platforms used within the product’s market
ecosystem. Fastadaptationinhowproductfeaturesaregenerated
andprioritisediscrucialtotheoverallsuccessofthecompany. If
the startup is not able to react in a timely manner, it will perish.
However, a deeper look at our findings reveals an evolution
towards more structured, planned and documentation-orientedrequirements practices. Over time, the companies become more
customer-oriented(intheinformationelicitedaswellasdocumenta-tion used), to better understand their clients and their needs. These
changes are reactive, rather than planned, and only if they bring
benefitswithoutcompromisingtheagilityandspeedofthecom-
pany. They suggest an overall pragmatic lightness, i.e., flexibility, in
the startups’ evolution towards an “engineering” of requirements.
5.3 Is evolution along the six dimensions
fundamental to the success of a startup?
Whiledifferentintervieweeshadvaryingideasaboutwhatitmeans
tobeasuccessful startup,twokeyaspectsare survivalandlongevity.
Long-term success is not easily predictable, and is affected by both
internal and external factors, including the type of product and
itsmarket,humanresources,companyculture,availablefunding,
processes and practices, and even luck or serendipity. While some
of these factors cannot be controlled, one that can be managed
isthechoiceofprocessesandpracticesusedtooperateandsteer
the startup on a daily basis, and the conscious decision to make
changes and evolve along the dimensions identified in this paper.
One question that arises from our work is whether “maturity”
intermsoftheevolvingrequirementspracticeisnecessarytothe
success of a startup. Although we would have liked to answer
positively,theshortansweris“no”. Thelongansweris,however,
farmorecomplexandinteresting,asshownbytwocompaniesfrom
our study – shown as C06 and C03 on our map in Fig. 3.
CompanyC06(seenastheorangelinewithtrianglesinFig. 3)
isalmost10-years-old,hasasolidnumberofclientsandrevenue,
andagrowingnumberofemployees. Itsproductsarecontinually
enhanced, with clients from all around the world. This startup is
considered successful despite their longstanding unstructured soft-
waredevelopmentprocesses. Theexistingrequirementsartefacts
are fairly basic and maintained in tool such as JIRA, used here for
managing high-level tasks and bug tickets. The knowledge is man-
agedinformally,throughweeklymeetingsbutmainlyrelyingon
adhocundocumentedverbalcommunication. Employeesarestill
playingmorethanonerole,withnolong-termplanning. Technical
debt is not well addressed and product quality is not a top priority.Nonetheless, C06 shows that a company can be successful without
having a well-defined requirements process. However, useful infor-mationisfrequentlylostbecauseitisnotrecorded,theworkhours
are long, and the environment is stressful, which should not be the
case for a 10-year-old company.
CompanyC03(representedbyalinewithsquaresinFig. 3),being
4-years-old and having a smaller number of employees, presents a
contrastingprofile. Whilethereisstillroomforevolution,C03is
inthemostadvancedphasealongmostdimensions. Theyhavea
well-definedprocessfordefiningtasksandproductfeatures,with
traceability between every requirements artefact, making full use
of their project management tools. Everyone can see the answer to
theFiveWs(what,who,where,whenandwhy)fornewfeatures.
The planning is aligned with the company vision, and there is a
deepunderstandingabouttheproduct,theclientsandthemarket.
Inshort,companyC03hasevolvedfromaninformalapproachto
requirements to more of an engineering process. C03 can be more
confidentabout theirproductdevelopmentand schedules,aswell
as about growing their company product roadmap to meet their
customers and market needs. This approach allows them to build a
higher quality product and avoid technical debt.
6 CONCLUSIONS
Thisstudyhascharacterisedtheevolutionofrequirementspractices
in software startups along six interrelated dimensions. Progressalong these dimensions reflects improved ability by a company
toreliablydeliverhighqualityproductstocustomers,tomanage
requirements more effectively, and to add staff to do so. Becausethese dimensions are tied to one another (as shown in Section
4.7), an advance in one dimension often facilitates advances in
others. Evolutionalongthesixdimensionsisnotfundamentalto
