ABSTRACT
Recentstudiessuggestthatwell-knownOSSprojectsstruggleto
findtheneededworkforcetocontinueevolving—inpartbecause
externaldevelopersfailtoovercometheirfirstcontributionbarriers.
Inthispaper,weinvestigatehowandwhy quasi-contributors (exter-
naldeveloperswhodidnotsucceedingettingtheircontributions
accepted to an OSS project) fail. To achieve our goal, we collected
data from 21 popular, non-trivial GitHub projects, identified quasi-
contributors, and analyzed their pull-requests. In addition, we con-
ductedsurveyswithquasi-contributors,andprojects’integrators,to
understandtheirperceptionsaboutnonacceptance.Wefound10,099
quasi-contributors—about70%ofthetotalactualcontributors—
thatsubmitted12,367nonacceptedpull-requests.Infiveprojects,
we found more quasi-contributors than actual contributors. About
one-third of the developers who took our survey disagreed withthe nonacceptance, and around 30% declared the nonacceptance
demotivated or prevented them from placing another pull-request.
Themainreasonsforpull-requestnonacceptancefromthequasi-
contributors’perspectivewere“superseded/duplicatedpull-request”
and “mismatch between developer’s and team’s vision/opinion.” A
manual analysis of a representative sample of 263 pull-requestscorroborated with this finding. We also found reasons related to
the relationship with the community and lack of experience or
commitmentfromthequasi-contributors.Thisempiricalstudyis
particularly relevant to those interested in fostering developers’
participation and retention in OSS communities.

1 INTRODUCTION
Manydevelopers,newcomerstoaproject,sendcontributionswhich
are not incorporated into the source code and give up trying.
Such“gettingcontributionsaccepted”barrierisfrequentlyreported
as a major reason raised by newcomers that dropped out of the
projects [ 29,30]. Sustaining work skills and knowledge in large,
complex projects is a formidable undertaking yet crucial for the
maintenance of long-lived OSS projects [ 6]. However, the number
of developers willing to compromise to this often non-paid activity
isnotlarge.Asaresult,64%ofwell-known,nontrivial,andpopu-
larOSS projectsrely on1–2 contributorstomanage mostof their
tasks[1].Dropofffromcontributorsisoneofthemainproblems
that OSS projects face [3, 15].
Littleisknownaboutthesequasi-contributors,i.e.,developers

The literature focus on factors that affect the likelihood to ac-
cept a contribution [ 10,14,16,21,25,33,34] or how long it may
take[36],analyzingindistinctlynon-acceptedcontributionsfrom
actual1and quasi-contributors. In this study, we focus only on the
quasi-contributors side.
1We use the term “actual” to refer to contributors that have at least one accepted
pull-request in the project.

We analyze projects that follow the pull-request model, since
it is believed to offer a low barrier to entry for potential contrib-utors [
39,40] and has been defined as the default model in well-
known social coding websites, such as GitHub and GitLab [ 11].
AccordingtoMcDonaldandGoggins[ 18],thepull-requestmodel
leads to greater participation and more opportunities for review
andfeedback fromthe community,as wellas greatervisibilityfor
potential contributors.
Weinvestigate how common arequasi-contributors (and quasi-
contributions) in OSS projects that adopt the pull-request model
(RQ1), what are the reasons for nonacceptance ( RQ2), and how
quasi-contributors perceive the nonacceptance ( RQ3). To achieve
thesegoals,wecollectedandanalyzeddatafrom21active,nontriv-
ial, and popular OSS projects, and we conducted two surveys: one
with355quasi-contributors;andanotherwith21projectintegrators
(i.e.,developers who are in charge of accepting contributions [ 12]).
By analyzing this data, we make the following contributions: (i)
we bring the attention to one relevant yet neglected OSS devel-
oper, the quasi-contributor; (ii) we provide evidence that quasi-
contributorsarerathercommoninpopularOSSprojects—theyare
about70%ofthenumberofactual-contributors;(iii)weelucidate
19reasonsregardingnonacceptancethroughasurveywithquasi-
contributors; (iv) we corroborate these findings by cross-validating
the results with an additional survey with 21 projects’ integrators,
and with a manual inspection of a representative sample of 263
quasi-contributions; and (v) we show that nonacceptance might
incurindemotivation,potentiallypreventingfurthercontributions.
2 RELATED WORK
Pull-based development is an emerging paradigm for distributed
software development that has been attracting open and closedsource projects, which are migrating their code to this environ-
ment[4,10].AccordingtoGousios etal.[10]inpull-baseddevelop-
ment,theworkisdistributedbetweenateam,whichsubmits,oftenoccasionally[
22],changestobeconsideredformerging,andacore
team, which oversees the merging process, provides feedback, con-
ducts tests, requests changes, and finally accepts the contributions.
Previous studies on onboardingto OSS (e.g., [ 5,7,35,41]) have
a survivability bias, focusing on who succeed or were retained.
Quasi-contributors show interest in participating and, with proper
support, could become casual or regular contributors. Indeed, OSS
communities are strongly interested in casual contributors: “ casual
contributorscreaterealvaluefortheMozilla ”(MozillaCommunity
Wiki[19]);“mostofthecodeiswrittenbycasualcontributors ”(Article
about Node.js [ 13]). Looking only from the perspective of who
survived the onboarding process may not necessarily cover the
specificbarriersandperceptionsofthesealmostforgottenpotential
contributors. Our results can orient OSS communities on where to
focus, newcomers on what to expect, and researchers on where to
conduct subsequent studies.
Previous research has studied pull-based development; for ex-
ample,Gousios etal.[10]foundthatthedecisiontomergeapull-
request is related to recently modified the code. They also found
that 53% of non-merged pull-requests are unmerged for reasonsrelated to the distributed nature of pull-based development, and
only13%ofthepull-requestsareunmergedfortechnicalreasons.They report that the decision to merge a pull-request is mainly
influenced by whether the pull-request includes recently modified
codeandthatthetimetomergeisinfluencedbythedeveloper’spre-
vious track record, the size of the project and its test coverage, and
the project’s openness to external contributions. Padhye et al.[21]
complement this list, reporting that bug fixes are more likely to be
mergedinto themain projectsthan featureenhancements. While
these studies analyzed the reasons behind contribution nonaccep-
tance,inthispaper,wecomplementthisliteraturebyfocusingon
contributors whose pull-requests were not accepted.
Tsayet al.[34] focused on understanding the relationship be-
tweensocio-technicalaspectsandthelikelihoodforpull-request

Gousiosetal.alsosurveyeddeveloperswhomergepull-requests,
the so-called integrators [ 12], and developers who were trying
to submit a pull-request [ 9], called contributors. From the inte-
grator’s perspective, the authors reported social challenges that
needed to be addressed, for example, how to motivate contributors
to keep working on the project and how to explain the reasons for
nonacceptance without discouraging them. From the contributor’s
perspective,theyfoundthatitisimportanttoreduceresponsetime,maintainawareness,andimprovecommunication.Theyalsofound
that integrators decide to accept a contribution after analyzingsource code quality, code style, documentation, granularity, and
adherence to project conventions. Hellendoorn et al.[14] also con-
firm that code style is an important aspect. A second signal that
the integrators examine is whether the proposed pull-request is in
line with the project’s goals and target [ 12], which may be difficult
for a newcomer to ascertain. On the other hand, integrators report
that there is no difference in treatment of pull-requests from the
coreteamversusthosefromthecommunityandthattheypostpone
the decision to merge in the case of technical factors. Rigby and
Storey [25] also observed this postponing effect.

including pull-request size, project age, team size, and delay to the

contributors, and why they fail. Our study is particularly relevant
because newcomers face many challenges when they attempt to
make their first contribution [ 31], and understanding the problems
related to “quasi-contributors” can help researchers and practi-
tionersthinkaboutnewguidelinesandtoolstoretaindevelopers
attempting to contribute to software projects.
3 METHOD
The overreaching goal of this study is to gain an in-depth under-
standing of quasi-contributors. We designed the following three
research questions to guide our research:
RQ1.How common are quasi-contributors and quasi-
contributions?
This research question investigates how common quasi-
contributors (and quasi-contributions) are in our set of selected
projects. This is an important direction that deserves investigation
because,ifseveralquasi-contributionshaveattemptedmultiplecon-tributionsandencounterednonacceptanceeachtime,thismightin-dicatethattheOSSprojectisunfriendlytoexternalcontributors[
4]
orthatitscodingstandardistoohardtomeet.Toanswerthisques-
tion, after identifying our target projects, we semi-automaticallystudied their commit logs and pull-requests. To complement our
overview of quasi-contributions, for each analyzed project, we sta-
tistically studied the differences between unmerged and merged
pull-requests, by analyzing the number of comments made on the
pull-request,reviewcomments(madeonthecommits),commits,
changed files, and line of codes added and deleted.
RQ2.Why were the quasi-contributions not accepted?
Toanswerthisquestionandthenext,weconductedtwosurveys
(details in Section 3.3) aimed at understanding the reasons for and
perceptions about nonacceptance. We received, respectively, 335
and 21 answers to our surveys, which were quantitatively and
qualitativelyanalyzed.Wealso studiedarepresentativesampleof
263quasi-contributions,tocross-validatethesurveyresultswith
the results from the repositories.
RQ3.How do quasi-contributors perceive nonacceptance?
Since open source software is mainly driven by a community of
volunteers,motivationiscrucialtokeepdeveloperscontributing.
In our final research question, we analyzed our survey to under-
stand (1) whether quasi-contributors agree with the decision to
notmergetheircontributions;(2)whethernonacceptanceincursin
demotivationtofurthercontribute;and(3)whetherthefeedback
received from the community was constructive.
3.1 Selecting Open Source Projects
We selected 21 of the most popular (in terms of stars) OSS projects
hostedonGitHub(excludingnon-softwareprojects,suchastext-
books or bookmarks). However, when analyzing the most popular
projects,wefoundthatmostofthemwerewritteninJavaScript.Tofosterdiversityinourdataset[

projects are relevant because, at the time of data collection (March,
2017), they were:
ActiveAlong their life-cycle, they received more than 20K pull-
requests submitted by more than 14K contributors. On average,

andbootstrap ), data science frameworks ( e.g.,tensorflow and
scikit-learn ), content management systems ( e.g.,joomla!),
databases ( e.g.,mongoandredis), among others.

3.2 Identifying Quasi-Contributors
After curating our selection of OSS projects, we aimed to iden-
tifythequasi-contributors.Weconsiderquasi-contributorsthose
newcomers to a project who submitted pull-request(s), but had no
“accepted contribution” to that specific project. We consider an ac-
cepted contribution any changes that passed the pull-request cycle
and, therefore, were merged to the project code base.
Pull-requests can either be open or closed, and merged or un-
merged. In a first step, we selected pull-requests that were both
closedandunmerged,sincethisindicatesthatthecodereviewcycle
was complete (pull-request closed) and the contribution was not
accepted (pull-request unmerged). Then, for each one of the closed
and unmerged pull-requests, we analyzed whether the contribu-
tor that proposed the pull-request under investigation had already
providedanyotherpull-requests.Whenconductingthisanalysis,
we observed that some contributors provided a significant num-
berofoldpull-requests( e.g.,before2012)thatwerenotclassified
as merged. Digging into these old pull-requests revealed that, al-
thoughtheyappearedasnotmerged,someofthecommitsunder
thepull-requestswereindeedmerged—butthroughtheCommand
LineInterface(CLI). ThishappenedbecauseGitHubstartedoffer-
ing merging facilities through its web interface later 20112. Before
that,integratorshadtomergepull-requeststhrough gitfacilities.
Therefore,to excludethesefalse-positiveunmergedpull-requests,
werestrictedoursearchforpull-requestscreatedafterJuly1st,2011.
We download our pull-request dataset on February 20th, 2017.
Moreover,weinvestigatedwhetherthecontributorcommitshad
been directly merged to the main code base ( i.e., without using
the merge button on GitHub). To do so, we locally performed a
git logusingSecureHashAlgorithms(SHA)identifierforevery
committhatwaspartofthepreviouslyidentifiedpull-requests.The
git log facility searches for any commit mapped to the given
SHAcode.IfwefoundacommitusingthatSHA,weremovedthe
developer, aswell ashis/her pull-requests,from our list.However,
afterconductingthisprocess,somesurveyrespondentsstillmen-
tionedthattheirpull-requests(thatourprocedurecategorizedas
unmerged) were indeed merged. As they reported, projects such
asangular.js anddjangohave specific merging procedures and,
therefore,do notleverageGitHubmerge facilities.Asonerespon-
dentmentioned:“ Mypull-requestwasn’tmergedbecausemycommit
wasrebasedandfast-forwardmergedintotheproject’smasterbranch.
Somerepositoriesonlymergechangesinthisway,inordertoavoid

a commit under the name of another committer with a different
SHA.Thisprocessalsodiscardscommitsthatwereperformedto
the main codebase without pull-requests.
Attheendofthisprocess,weidentifiedatotalof10,099quasi-
contributors who attempted to contribute a total of 12,367 pull-
requests scattered across 78,381 commits. For the manual analysis,
wesampled263pull-requests,whichprovidesusaconfidencelevel
of 95% with a ±6% confidence interval.

Weconductedtwosurveystobetterunderstandquasi-contributors’
motivations,benefits,andtheproblemstheyface.Inourfirstsurvey,ourtargetpopulationcomprised5,138quasi-contributorswhomade
a valid e-mail address publicly available. Our second survey was
delivered to 282 integrators with valid email addresses.
The surveys were based on the recommendations of Kitchen-
hamet al.[17]. We also employed principles for increasing sur-
vey participation [ 27], such as sending personalized invitations,
allowingparticipantstoremaincompletelyanonymous,andask-
ing closed and direct questions. Participation was voluntary and
the estimated time to complete each survey was 5-10 minutes. We
obtained 335 responses (6.5% response rate) in our first survey and
21 (7.44% response rate) in our second survey. Our first survey had
ten questions:
Q1.How often do you contribute to Free/Open Source Software
projects? Choices: {Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.}
Q2.Are you used to make contributions to different OSS
projects? Choices: {Yes, No}
Q3.Havewecorrectlyidentifiedyouassomeonewhoattempted

not, why?
Q7.Didtheunmergedpull-requestpreventordemotivateyou

Q6.Areyouawareofanypull-requestthatwasnotaccepteddue
to personal or social reasons? If so, why.
Inthissecondsurvey,52.3%oftheintegratorsthoughtthattheir
projectsaccept 70%+of thesubmitted pull-requests(33.3% hadno
idea). Still, 100% of the integrators said that they are willing to
receivechangesfromexternalcontributors,andtheydosoby(1)
being as kind as possible, (2) introducing how-to contribute guide,
and (3) welcoming pull-requests from external members (which
is not always the case of OSS projects [ 4]). Only one integrator
mentioned that PRs are not accepted “ if conduct violations. ”
3.4 Analyzing Data
We conducted different formsof data analysis. First, we examined
the distributions of the quasi-contributions and quasi-contributors
to answer our first research question ( RQ1). For statistics, we used
the non-parametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test[ 37]t o
test whether there were differences among metrics ( e.g., number
of comments, commits, lines added and deleted, changed files, and
review comments) collected from pull-requests merged and un-
merged. We also used Cliff’s Delta statistic, a nonparametric effect
sizemeasurethatquantifiestheamountofdifferencebetweenthese
groupsofobservationsbeyondp-valueinterpretation.According
to Romano et al.[26], the magnitude of delta dis assessed using
the following thresholds: d<0.147 “negligible,” d<0.33 “small,” d
<0.474 “medium,” otherwise “large.”
Inthesecondanalysis,wefollowedopencodingandaxialcoding
procedures[ 32]toqualitativelyanalyzeopen-endedquestionsfrom
oursurveysandpull-requestsdiscussions( RQ2).Threeresearchers
analyzed together all the qualitative data. We, firstly, analyzed
the answers from quasi-contributors. Afterwards, we analyzed the
answers from integrators and pull-requests discussions to cross-
validate and enrich the results.
The analysis of the open-ended questions of our quasi-
contributors survey was conducted in three steps. In the first step,
three researchers analyzed two sets of 20 answers, with the goal of
better defining and discussing the codes applied. Each cycle was
followed by a discussion, to reach consensus for the categoriza-
tion of each item. In the second step, each researcher analyzed
the rest of the answers independently, followed once again by a
discussion, until reaching consensus for the categorization of each
item. In the third step, the researchers analyzed the categories aim-
ing to refine the classification and group related codes in more
significant,higherlevelcategories.Inaddition,wequantitatively
analyzed closed-ended questions ( RQ3) to understand developers’
perceptions about nonacceptance.
To complement RQ2, we analyzed the discussions of pull-
requestsfromoursampleandintegrators’answerstothesurvey.We
madeuse ofthe previouslyidentified categoriesto checkwhether
the quasi-contributors perceptions would be confirmed. These two
setsofdatahadalsobeenanalyzedbythreeresearchersindepen-
dently, followed by consensus discussions. In the results section,
wehighlight themain themesthatemerged alongwith quotesex-
tracted from the pull-requests and open questions from our survey.
We chose quotes and cases based on their representativeness.4 RESULTS
In this section, we report the results of our study grouped by each
research question.
4.1 RQ1. How common are quasi-contributors
and quasi-contributions?
We found a total of 10,099 unique quasi-contributors who have
performedatotalof12,367unmergedpull-requests.Bycomparison,
the projects in our sample have a total of 14,623 actual contrib-
utors, who performed a total of 126,913 pull-requests. Figure 1

(it has 1,962 quasi-contributors and 844 contributors). Project d3
has235quasi-contributorsand119actualcontributors—2.0 ×more
quasi-contributors than actual ones. On average, there are 480.9
quasi-contributors per project (3rd quartile: 593.0, standard de-

cepted contributions.
4.2 RQ2. Why were the quasi-contributions not
accepted?
Tounderstandthereasonswhythepull-requestswerenotaccepted,
we qualitatively analyzed the answers to an open question (Q5)
from our first survey. After analyzing and discussing the results,
we found 19 different reasons mentioned by the quasi-contributors.
Theresultingreasons,withthenumberofmentionsforeach,are
presentedinTable3.Toanalyzehowtheperceivedreasonaffects
the developers’ degreeof agreement, we also show thenumber of
mentions for a given reason for those who disagreed with the pull-
request’s nonacceptance(in the thirdcolumn). In thelast column,
wepresentthepercentageofmentionsofeachcategorygivenby
developers who disagreed.
From the table, it is possible to notice that the most common
reason for nonacceptance from the quasi-contributors perspective
was that their pull-requests were superseded/duplicated . In gen-
eral,therespondentsansweredthattherewasalreadysomethinginplace(“Otherpull-requestsfixedthesameissuesasmypull-requests” ),
or that someone else made a similar pull-request, which was ac-
cepted. An example was brought by a respondent who said “The
fix I submitted remained unmerged until someone else submitted the
exact same fix ...the integrators accepted their (identical) fix and
closed mine.” Although 52 respondents mentioned this reason, only
7 of them (13.4%) disagreed with the nonacceptance.
Themismatch between developer’s and team’s vision/opin-
ionwas the second most mentioned reason for nonacceptance (45
mentions). In this case, a high number of quasi-contributors (27
of them, or 60%) disagreed with the decision. This reason includes
the cases in which quasi-contributors thought something wouldbe good, useful, or needed to be changed, while the integrators
disagreed.Therewerecasesinwhichtheauthorofthepull-request
agreed with the project members’ positions, as reported by one
respondent “whenyouaddanewfeaturetotheproject,yourvision
can be out of tune with the vision of the project’s team, and this is
natural.” However, in 27 cases, this tag was associated with an an-
swerfromdeveloperswhodisagreedwiththenonacceptance,for
example, one of them mentioned that “The project decided that was
notabugtheywantedtoprovideafixfor,” andanother,alittlemore
nonconformist, answered that ”Because one person was skeptical.”
We could also observe that lack of interest from integrators
was presented as the reason for nonacceptance in 25 cases. In 18
(72%) cases, the developers did not agree with the way the decision
about the pull-request was made. Many of them (13) had been
simplyignored,anddidnotreceiveanswersorreviews(e.g. “Itwas
ignoredmaybebecauseitwasaveryminorfix,” and“Ididnotreceive
answers”), and some of them became upset, like the respondentwho stated: “That specific maintainer often ignores people’s pull-
requests and closes them without justification.” In other cases, quasi-
contributors perceived that the community was not supportive
enough to help them get their pull-request accepted, as reported
byarespondent: “Themaintainerwasunabletoreproducethebug
...agreater effort to reproduce the issue could have been made.”
It was interesting to find bureaucracy as a perceived reason
fornonacceptance(withahighdisagreementwiththenonaccep-
tance:83.3%).Regardingbureaucracy,onerespondentmentioned,
“The process is too onerous, and bureaucratic.” Quasi-contributors
mentionedthatsomerequiredstepsintheprocesshinderedtheir
pull-requestacceptance,forexample,specialtypesofsign-off,as
mentioned by two developers: “Introducing new features is prob-
lematicbecausethewholeteamneedstoacceptit.” Inthiscase,the
developermentionedthatthepull-requestsmatchedprojectrequire-
ments, passed tests, and still were not merged, because of these
sign-off specificities. Another interesting finding relates to license
issues. Six quasi-contributors mentioned signing an agreement or
the impossibility of providing the proprietary code to reproduce
the bug as the reason to nonacceptance.
Quasi-contributorsalsomentionedsomebetter-receivedreasons,
just as “superseded/duplicated pull-request.” Work in progress
as a reason was mentioned by seven developers, and none of
themdisagreedwith thenonacceptance.Inthesecases, thequasi-
contributorsreportedthatsomethingwaspartofabiggerchangeal-
readyunderdevelopment,asexplainedbyarespondent: “Therewas
majorworkinprogressthatconflictedwiththepull-requestandwouldfinallyalso solvethe problem.” Anotherreason witha relatively low
disagreement with the nonacceptance was PR not needed/not
relevant .Quasi-contributorsthatreportedthisreasonappearedto
beconvincedthattheproposedchange “wasn’timportantenough
to warrant merging” or“was an unnecessary change.”
Wealsofoundquasi-contributorsofferinga meaculpa astherea-
son for nonacceptance; 20 respondents mentionedthat the reason
wasquasi-contributor’slackofexperience/commitment ,like
inthiscase: “Becauseitwasincomplete,andIneverfollowedthrough
on the feedback to complete it.” Not an optimalsolution was also
a reason that (24) quasi-contributors assumed the pull-request was
not good enough. One of them reported that the “[my] fix was iffy,”
and other just answered: “I made a mistake.”
An interesting observation is that 13 people (3.9%) mentioned
that they did not know the exact reason ( e.g., “I do not know, it’s
beenaverylongtimesincethispull-request.” ).Moreinterestingis
observing that9 ofthem did notagree withthe nonacceptance. A
possibleexplanationforthosewhodonotknowisthatthey,infact,
could not understand or did not accept the decision.
Wealsoaskedintegratorstheirperceptionaboutnonacceptance.
According to them, the most common reason for nonacceptance
isPR not needed/not relevant (10 occurrences), for instance,
“[such contribution] solves the immediate/local problem but does not
addressthedeepersystemicissue .”Thesecondmostcommonreason
isguidelines not followed (9 occurrences). According to one
integrator,suchguidelinescanrangefrom“ codingstyle,lackoftests,
ormessyversioninghistory .”Interestingly,noneoftheintegrators
assumedthe meaculpa ,i.e.,thelackofinterestfromintegrators
aforementioned, although one integrator raised the fact that there
are very few integrators available for reviewing code: “ people love

Ultimately, we manually investigated a representative sample
of 263 pull-requests to cross-validate the results from our surveys
about whythe contributionswere notaccepted. Weemployed the
same codes used in the surveys to analyze the quasi-contributions.
In this analysis, we found that the most common reason for nonac-
ceptanceis Superseded/Duplicated solution3(32occurrences),
followed by Quasi-contributors’ lack of experience/commit-
ment4(25 occurrences) and PR not needed/not relevant5(22
occurrences). This finding is in sharp agreement with our surveys.

respondentsdidnotagreewiththepull-requestnonacceptance,and
62.6%ofthem(62)answeredthatthisfactdemotivatedorprevented
them from placing another pull-request. This can indicate that not
accepting a pull-request can be a driving force in demotivating
newcomers, confirming what was stated by Karl Fogel: “if a project
doesn’t make a good first impression, newcomers may wait a long
timebeforegivingitasecondchance” [8].Thisfindingmightalso
explain why most of the quasi-contributors placed just a single
quasi-contribution. Interestingly, some integrators are aware of
such side effect. Four respondents mentioned that dealing with
personalities and opinions is one of the main challenges that they
face,asoneofthemhighlighted: “Wewanttoencouragecontributions
and refusing one, even for very good reasons, can be discouraging to
new contributors.”

5 DISCUSSION
In this section, we provide additional discussion on the data pre-
sented in the previous section.
Quasi-contributorsshouldstandfortheircontributions. We
foundcasesinwhichthequasi-contributordisappearedshortlyafter
proposing the pull-request. Even if a proposed pull-request had
arobustimplementation,integratorswereunabletoacceptsince
the proposed changeswere not addressed duringthe code review
process. We observed this by manually analyzing pull-requests,
and it was confirmed by the quasi-contributors who reported they
didnotmaketherequestedchange(category quasi-contributor’s
lack of experience/commitment in Table 5).
Theeagernesstocontributeisnotalwayshelpful. Wenoticed
that some contributions were not accepted because the quasi-
contributor failed to understand the contribution process adopted
by the project ( e.g.,contributions style) or internal implementation
details (e.g.,do not know the difference between two variables6). If
quasi-contributorsplacedadditionalcareinunderstandingsuchde-
tails, their contributions might have higher chances of acceptance.
The fast development cycle hinders external contributions.
Externalcontributorsfaceanadditionalchallenge sincecontribu-
tionsproposedtoanoutdatedcodearelikelynotaccepted(category
Code/PR was obsolete ). Further complicating this matter is that
outdating can happen in a matter of days, as we noticed in one
review: “Thx for the PR, but this change is not valid. In the latest
tutorialversion(updatedafewdaysago),theappisservedfrom/app,
which means that you don’t need /app in the URL .”
Typosaresometimeshardtofix. Wefoundcasesinwhichquasi-
contributionsproposedsimpletypofixesthatwerenotacceptedby
integrators. As one extreme example, one quasi-contributor added
one single comma to the documentation7, but integrators found
that it was better to keep the current wording than to accept ad-
ditionalcontributions (category Mismatchbetweendeveloper’s
and team’s vision/opinion ). Yet, in our survey, two integrators
mentioned that such small contributions are noisy.
Some PRs were not accepted but were implemented. We found
cases where the proposed pull-request was not accepted by the
integrators, although integrators got inspired and implementedthe proposed solution themselves
8. This was also mentioned by
13 quasi-contributors who answered our survey. It is important to
highlight that 10 out of these 13 disagreed with nonacceptance.
No tests, no fun. In some projects ( e.g.,bootstrap ), if the pro-
posed contribution does not come with tests, the pull-request is
immediately closed – no questions asked (category Lackof tests ).
Althoughnewcomersareencouragedtofileadditionalpull-requests
containing tests, we observed that few of them do so.
Integrators are not always kind. Although integrators men-
tionedinoursurveythat “wetrytobeaskindaspossible,” wefound
examples of impolite tone while dealing with quasi-contributors
(e.g.,“Notcrazyaboutaddinganoptionforthis.” ).Thecategory Lack
of interest from integrators was also recurrent in our survey

7https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/9168
8https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/1900withquasi-contributorsandwhenanalyzingtherepositories.Im-
polite tone and lack of interest may demotivate quasi-contributors.
TruckFactordoesnotconsiderthenumberofdeveloperswill-ingtocontribute.
TheTruckFactor(TF)calculates“ thenumberof
peopleonyourteamthathavetobehitbyatruck(orquit)beforetheprojectisinserioustrouble ”[
38].Whenempiricallyevaluated,some
authors observed that some highly popular projects have indeed
a really small truck factor, which places a strong dependency on
specific contributors [ 1]. For instance, the project d3has TF of 1,
which means that a single contributor is responsible for managing
most of the tasks related to the project. Notwithstanding, d3has
235 quasi-contributors. That is, this low TF is not related to the
numberofexternalcontributorswillingtocontributetotheproject.
“Scratching itches” plays a role. In our first survey, we asked
quasi-contributorswhatmotivatedthemtocontributetotheOSS
project. The four most common motivations are: (i) Fixing a bug
(102occurrences),(ii)Scratchingownitch(71occurrences),(iii)Im-
provingtheproject(52occurrences),and(iv)Altruism/Givingback
(51 occurrences). This result shows that a great part of the respon-
dents was attempting to fix a bug andscratch their own itch .
We observed that the results align with those presented by Pinto et
al.[22], who analyzed the motivation behind casual contributions.
6 IMPLICATIONS
This research has implications for different stakeholders.
OSS integrators: Since both integrators and quasi-contributors
agree that pull-requests that do not follow the guidelines are more
likelytoberejected( e.g.,“Ourprojecthasstrictrulesforcontributions
andPRsthatdonotfollowtherulesarenotmerged ”),integratorscan
clearlystatewhataretheirprojectnormsupfront.Wealsofound
thatnonacceptancemightdemotivatequasi-contributors,incurring
infewercontributions( RQ3).Topreventsuchbehavior,OSSproject
membersshould(1)stateandfollowacodeofconductand(2)be
kind and respectful. Finally, a clear roadmap describing the future
plans of the project might avoid PR not needed/relevant .
Newcomers to OSS project: Our surveys and our manual anal-
ysis showed evidence regarding a lack of commitment of quasi-
contributors( RQ1–RQ2 ).Therefore,itisimportantfornewcomers
toworkcloselywithintegrators,and,whennecessary,standandar-gue for their contributions. Newcomers should also take a moment
toinvestigatewhetherthereareexistingpull-requestsproposing
thesamecontribution,and,thus,avoidduplication.Newcomersnot
onlyshouldbackuptheircontributionswithtestsbutalsomake
sure that their contributions do not introduce side effects .
CS educators: Some OSS projects do not even review contribu-
tionsthatdonotcomewithtests(Section5).Still,sometestsarehard to implement, as one integrator stated: “ Typical case is con-
tributor figure out a way to implement the change but not how to
implement the tests. ” Educators can discuss these scenarios of real-
worldtestsalongwithstudents.Additionally,softwareengineering
educators can bring non-accepted pull-requests, those considered
“not an optimal solution” ( RQ2), to the classroom to engage stu-
dentstodiscussand,eventually,proposebettersolutions.Finally,
since integrators and quasi-contributors reported a lack of experi-
encewith gitandGitHubtools,itisimportantfortheeducators
to introduce such tools in introductory programming courses.

7 THREATS TO VALIDITY
In an empirical study, there are always limitations. First, our re-
sults only apply to developers who attempted to contribute to OSS
projects hosted on GitHub. They do not cover software developers
inothersourcecodehostingwebsites.Ourresultsarelimitedbyour
selectionofOSSprojects,whichonemightargueissmallornon-
representative. However, we argue that the selected projects are
diverseintermsof domain,popularity ,andactivity(Section3.1pro-
vide greaterdetails). Moreover, quasi-contributorsare particularly
relevant to OSS projects; in proprietary projects, although develop-
ers may have similar challenges to contribute, they are required to
contribute.Thisdistinctionmadeproprietaryprojectsunsuitable
for this study. Moreover, we likely did not discover all possible
characteristics of quasi-contributions. With our methodology and
infrastructure9, we expect similar analysis to be conducted in the
futurewhensuchcharacteristicsbecomerelevant.Wealsoexpectto
understandthe integrators’and communities’perspectives about
the quasi-contributions. Still, comparing the quasi-contributors’
unmerged pull-requests to the actual-contributors’ unmerged pull-
requests can shed additional light to the phenomenon.
Whenquantitativelyanalyzingdatafromtheselectedproject,we
usedstatisticalmethodstomitigatethethreatsofgeneralizingdata
based on our personal hypothesis. Moreover, since we leveraged
qualitativeresearchmethodstocategorizetheopen-endedanswers
to our surveys, as well as unmerged pull-requests, we may have
introduced categorization bias. To mitigate this bias, we conducted
this process in pairs and carefully discussed categorization among

ofrandomizingthequestions,wetriedtoorderthequestionsbased
on the natural sequence of actions to help respondents understand
thequestions’context.Moreover,wemadeoursurveyasshortas
possible,noneofthequestionsweremandatory,theresponseswere
anonymous, and participation was voluntary. We also employed
well-known survey principles [17, 27].
By conducting this study, it was possible to observe that git
andGitHubdata canbemismatching,whichcan leadtomisinter-
pretation.Wenoticedthat,evenwiththefacilitiesintroducedby
the pull-based model, some projects still do not use this approach,
preferring to merge the contributions via git Command Line Inter-
face (CLI). Even using the CLI, this can be done in several ways,
whichcanleadtolosingtrace ofacontribution,asreportedbya
survey respondent: “eventually they copy the related code and inject
9https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1154906itintotheprojectbytheirowndevelopers.” Inourstudy,weidenti-
fied false-positives in two ways. First, we compared whether the
commitshashthatappearsatthepull-requestexistinthegitrepos-
itory. Also, we queried GitHub users’API to double-check whether
thequasi-contributorauthoredanycommitinagivenrepository.
ThisAPIlistscommitsthatwereauthoredbyacontributorunder
differentSHAidentifiers.Weremovedanyduplication.Second,our
survey asked whether we correctly identified the developer as aquasi-contributor. Some respondents (13%) said that we did not.
We asked the respondents to help us by telling why they believe
this happened, and a summary of their answers is presented in Ta-
ble 5. We removed these cases from the analysis and implemented
heuristics to catch similar cases when possible.

ForOSSprojectsremainsustainableandevolve,itisimportantthat
new contributors onboard the project fixing bugs and proposing
newfeatures.However,thepathtobecominganOSScontributorisnotalwaysflowery.Inthispaper,weinvestigatequasi-contributors,
that is, OSScontributors that triedto contribute, but did notsuc-
ceed. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis from software
repositories and two surveys with quasi-contributors and integra-
tors,wefoundthatquasi-contributorsarerathercommon,although
the majority of them only tried once. The most common reason
for nonacceptance was “mismatch between developer’s and team’s
vision/opinion,”followed byreasons relatedto arelationship with
the community, while others attributed fault to the developers (ei-
ther quasi-contributors or integrators). Still, about one-third ofthe developers disagreed with their nonacceptance and declaredthe nonacceptance demotivated or prevented them from placinganother pull-request. Our results can be relevant for developersinterested in contributing to OSS projects, by bringing common
issues that can lead to pull-request nonacceptance. In addition,
theoutcomescanbenefitthoseinterestedinbuildingsustainable
communities and fostering contributions, since our results include
reasons that can potentially scare external members away.
For future work, we plan to propose and evaluate a virtual as-
sistant which will be in charge of helping newcomers to join a
community.Suchvirtualassistant,whileofferingguidancefornew-
comers to overcome their first barriers, would lower the effort
required on the integrators side.
