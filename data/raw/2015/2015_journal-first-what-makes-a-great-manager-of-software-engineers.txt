ABSTRACT
Having great managers is as critical to success as having a good
team or organization. A great manager is seen as fuelling the team
they manage, enabling it to use its full potential. Though software
engineering research studies factors that may affect the perfor-
manceandproductivityofsoftwareengineersandteams(liketools
and skill), it has overlooked the software engineering manager. On
theonehand,expertsarequestioninghowtheabundantworkin

practitioners are looking to researchers for evidence-based guid-
ance on how to manage software teams. We conducted a mixed
methods empirical study to investigate what manager attributes
developers and engineering managers perceive important and why.

and managers relate in their views, and how software engineering
differs from other knowledge work groups.

managers are essential to organize the effort of creating good soft-
ware and manage the people that carry it out. Though software
engineering research studies factors that may affect the perfor-
manceandproductivityofsoftwareengineersandteams(liketools

The paper [1] contributes a conceptual framework of fifteen
attributes that characterize great engineering managers, as well as

demographic differences exist, and how the findings from software
engineering compare to other knowledge work domains.
