ABSTRACT
Abnormal working hours can reduce work health, general well-
being, and productivity, independent from a profession. To inform
future approaches for automatic stress and overload detection, this
paperestablishesempiricallycollectedmeasuresoftheworkpat-
terns of software engineers. To this aim, we perform the first large-
scale study of software engineers’ working hours by investigating
thetimestampsofcommitactivitiesof86largeopensourcesoft-
ware projects, both containing hired and volunteer developers. We
find that two thirds of software engineers mainly follow typical
office hours, empirically established to be from 10h to 18h, and do
not usually work during nights and weekends. Large variations
betweenprojectsandindividualsexist.Surprisingly,wefoundno
support that project maturation would decrease abnormal working
hours. In the Firefox case study, we found that hired developers
workmoreduringofficehourswhileseniority,eitherintermsof
number of commits or job status, did not impact working hours.
We conclude that the use of working hours or timestamps of work
products for stress detection requires establishing baselines at the
level of individuals.

Healthproblemsofpoorworkingpatternsareperhapscausedby
violationofournatural24-hour(circadian)rhythm,whichhasseen
a surge of research interest in medicine. Most notably, the research
establishingthegeneticoriginsofcircadianrhythmwasawarded
the 2017 Nobel prize in medicine [ 5]. Recent findings suggest that
disturbancesincircadianrhythmarethecause(nottheeffect)of
depressionandanxiety[ 6],andthatartificiallightatnightincreases
the risk of obesity and cancer [7].
Fortunately,weekendrecoveryhasbeenshowntoimproveweekly
job performance, personal initiative, organizational citizenship be-
havior, and to lead to a lower perceived effort [ 8]. Psychological
detachment during off-work time reduces emotional exhaustion
causedbyhighjobdemandsandhelpstomaintainworkengage-
ment[9].Althoughworkerautonomyseemstoreducethenegative
health and well-being effects of atypical working hours, it does not
completely balance them [ 10]. Other studies of flexible working
hours show that they provide affective and work-life benefits [ 11],
whichiscompatible withthewidelyacceptedresultsthatworker
autonomy increases worker well-being stemming (cf. Karasek’s
jobdemandscontrol model)[ 12].Finally,extensiveuseofflexible
working time is linked with reduced worker productivity [11].
Inthesoftwareengineeringdomain,ithasbeenobservedthat
the bugginess of commits, i.e., negative effects on overall devel-
oper productivity, is related to the hour of the day (the so-called
“circadian work pattern”) and to day of the week those commits
have been made [ 13]. However, the results between projects seem
tovary.Eyolfsonetal.[ 14,15]propose,basedonthreewellknown
open source projects (Linux kernel, PostgreSQL, and Xorg), that
commitsmadebetween00:00and04:00containmorebugs,while
commits made between 07:00 and 12:00 (noon) contain the least.Prechelt and Pepper [
16] demonstrate, using data from a closed
source industry project, that the most defect-prone hour was 20:00.
A hypothesis that unifies these two findings could be that all of
those buggy hours might in fact demonstrate the end of a working
stintwhereadeveloperjustwantstobedonewiththetask,leading
to prematurely committing the code. Finally, industrial software
developers have also developed an interest to night work:
•Quora question with over 100 answers and over 500,000
views on why developers love night work [17]
•entire book with 2,500 paid readers on the topic, written by
an industrial programmer [18]
•Stackoverflowanalysiswith3,800Facebooksharesand91

Asabnormalworkinghourscanaffectoccupationalhealth,well-

this paper aims to investigate the work patterns of software de-

hired resources (Mozilla) and those without (Apache Foundation),
aswellasina(local)FinnishITcompany.Weareparticularlyin-
terestedinthedegreetowhichworkisperformedoutsideofthe
commonlyexpected workinghours,since, basedonthe literature
discussed above, such irregular working hours may act as a proxy
for job-related stress and time pressure conditions and suggest
non-sufficient detachment from work.
TheMozillaFoundationisknownforFirefox,whichmakesan
interesting case study as the core software engineers are paid to
developit.Inaddition,Mozillaalsohostsprojectsthathavebeen
gradually abandonedand left tothe community, suchas Thunder-
bird and SeaMonkey. The Apache Foundation is an organization
supporting open source projects and their communities of devel-opers, but does not pay its developers. Some of its projects arebusiness-critical to companies, who pay developers to work on
them,whileothersconsistofhobbyistdevelopers.Finally,thelo-

First, we investigate the following research questions for all
considered projects:
RQ1 What are the circadian and weekly work patterns of
software developers?
RQ2 Howdoestheusualworkpatternvaryacrossdifferent
projects?
RQ3 Are office hour commits different in terms of size?
RQ4 Is there a difference in the developers’ work patterns
over time?
Then,becauseresultsofRQ5canconsiderablyvaryduetodiffer-
ences in terminology between projects, we focus solely on Mozilla
Firefox. Moreover, the identification of developers background
needed for RQ6 involves a lot of manual work and is too laborious
to be performed for all projects. Furthermore, Firefox is the largest
project of our data set as it contains 228,697 commits, which repre-
sentsroughlyonethirdofallofthecommitsofourdataset.Finally,
Firefox includes both paid work and voluntary contributions.
RQ5 Areofficehourcommitsdifferentintermsofcontent?
RQ6 Can demographics explain office hour activity?
This paper is structured as follows. We discuss related work
in Section 2. In Section 3, we give details on our data extraction
process,thenweaddressourresearchquestionsinSection4and

For Mozilla, we needed to do extra processing in order to find
out which commit belongs to which project. First, we used the Gri-
moireLab tools3to extract issue comments from Mozilla’s Bugzilla
repository4(i.e.,thedatabasecontainingreportedissues,suchas
bug reports or feature requests). Second, we linked commit mes-
sages to the corresponding issue report by looking for an issue

4 EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF THE WORK
PATTERNS OF ALL PROJECTS
RQ1. What are the circadian and weekly work
patterns of software developers?
Motivation. Given the well-being and health risks related to ab-
normal working hours, we wish to establish empirical baselines
that later may be turned into normative guidelines to ensure the
well-being and health of software developers.
Commits follow a weekly rhythm. Fig. 1a, 1c and 1e show
thenumberofcommitsmadeoneachdayoftheweekwithinthe
Mozilla(319,139consideredcommits),Apache(574,563commits)
and the local company projects (22,193 commits), respectively. We
can clearly see that fewer commits are being posted during the
weekend, while there is a slight variation in activity during theweek, with Monday and Friday being the least active days in all
cases.TuesdayisthemostactivedayfortheMozillaandApache
projects, while in the local company it is Thursday.
Commits follow a circadian (24-hour) rhythm. The circa-
dianrhythmispresentinApache,Mozillaandinthelocalcompany
projects,seeFig.1b,1dand1f.Thelowestactivityforallprojects
happens during the night, with the number of commits starting to
increaseinthemorninguntiladipinactivityhappensduringlunch
hour. In the Mozilla and Apache projects, lunch mostly happens
at12o’clock,whileinthelocalcompanyithappensat11o’clock

4http://bugzilla.mozilla.com(somethingwhichweconfirmedthroughface-to-facediscussions
with the company).
After lunch hour, the number of commits increases again until a
decreasing trend in commits starts setting in from 4pm in all three
datasets.Forthelocalcompany,wecanalsoseeanunexpecteddip

phenomenontous.Thedecreasingtrendinthenumberofcommits

localcompany,wecanseethatworkduringtheeveningsisvery
limited compared with the Mozilla and Apache projects.
Workinghoursofsoftwaredevelopersaretypicallyfrom
10-18.If we consider a 40 hour work week, which is still the norm
for most professions, each week day should correspond to about8 working hours. Hence, in order to determine the working pe-riod for each of our projects, we searched the week days for the
eight-hourstintthatcoversthelargestshareofcommitsinaday.
First, for a given project, we computed all the (HH,mm )tuples
representing a timestamp (in 24 hours format) for which at least
onecommitwasmadeduringaweekday.Foreach (HH,mm )tuple,
wecomputedthenumberofcommitsmadeduringthe8-hourinter-
val [ (HH,mm ),(HH+8,mm )[. We then selected the interval with
thehighestnumberofcommitsasthe8-hourofficeperiodofthe
considered project.
TheresultsofthissearchareshowninTable1.For34%(30/87)of
the projects, this search results in working hours starting between
09:00 and 09:59, and for 45% (39/87) of the projects, the working
hoursstartbetween10:00and10:59.Themedianstarttimeofwork
across all projects is at 10:03.
66% of developers follow office hours. We were interested
inseeingif wecanfind different workpatternsacrossthe weekly
cycle and the daily circadian rhythm of different developers within
ourdatasetof87softwareprojects,andhowthosepatternslook
like. While past work has considered the core contributors to bethe top 20% of the committers [
31], in our data set it only takes
22 commits total to be in the top , which we think is not enough
forestablishingweeklyworkingpatterns.Thusweonlyconsider
the top 10% of developers, leaving us with 1,108 developers (out of
11,059), each with 95 or more commits. This top 10% of developers
has made 88% out of all commits of our data set.
For clustering purposes, we computed the relative share of com-
mitsmadebyeachhouroftheweekbyeachdeveloper.Thus,for
each developer, we end up with a feature vector of 168 elements,
one for each hour of the week. Similar to previous work on weekly
patterns of mobile phone usage behavior [ 32], we then used k-
means clustering on the vectors. We tested values of k (i.e., thenumber of clusters) from 2 to 7. We observed that going beyond
three clusters did not bring new information, instead clusters with
very few individuals and high noise started to appear. Fig. 2 shows
the weekly work patterns (the feature vectors of centroids) of each
of the three clusters.

These two clusters contain 66% of all developers, and they roughly
correspond to the projects starting at 9am vs. 10am in Table 1.
However, Fig. 2 also shows a third cluster (blue) that does not

two clusters is that this group works more during evenings and
weekends than the other two clusters.
Discussion: Up until now, we have established that a weekly
and circadian rhythm is followed in the projects of Apache andMozilla foundation, as well in the local company product that was
usedasacomparison.Wehavealsoestablishedawaytodetermine
the eight-hour work day start and end times for each project, then
presented measurements of how much work gets done during the
typical working hours. Establishing the normal working hoursis important (especially in a distributed context) if we wish todetermine whether the developers of a particular project are, for
example, under time pressure and forced to work overtime.
Committing 70% of work during typical working hours might
be a stress signal for a project that has previously had a share of

90%, but not for another project that constantly commits 70% work
during typical working hours. We also found that two thirds of
thedevelopersareclusteredtogroupsthatfollowofficehours.In
the two office hour groups, we saw a phase shift of a bit more
than one hour. We think that this phase shift is due to both project
culture and individual preferences, as some individuals are known
as morning persons while others are not [ 33]. This suggests that
clusteringofindividualdevelopersmayallowpersonalizedstress
or overtime detection, for at least two thirds of the developers that
follow regular rhythm.
RQ2. How does the usual work pattern vary
across different projects?
Motivation: Here, we investigate variations inworking hours be-
tween projects. After all, work patterns are shaped by both individ-
ual preferences and project culture and norms.
90% of the projects have similar typical working hours.
This can be observed from Table 1, which shows how 78 out of
87projectsworkfrom10-18plus/minusonehour. Variationsin
work patterns between projects are still considerable as the
amountofcommitsdoneineight-hourworkdaysis60%onaverage
with a standard deviation of 12.0% (min-max 31-91%). Moreover,
theextendedtypicalhours(8hoursplus/minusonehour)hasan
average of 68% with a standard deviation of 12.6% (mix-max: 36-
96%).On average, only 60% of work gets done during typical
working hours. The violin plot in Fig. 3 shows the distribution
across projects of the percentage of commits performed during
working hours.G

Figure 5: Two extreme clusters with respect to working
hours with five (Black) and six (Blue) projects respectively.
Figure 4 shows the weekly variation within the most active
projects.Thedifferencesbetweenprojectsintermsofrelativeactiv-
ity happening during 8-hour work days can partially be explained
by the presence of paid developers. In particular, the three projects
withthemostactivity outsideofficehours(SeaMonkey,Thunder-
bird and Groovy) are projects that are now community projects.
The amount of activity outside office hours during the
week and during the weekend are correlated. The percentage
ofactivityinaprojectoutsideofficehoursduringweekdays,and
the activity during weekends yield a correlation coefficient of 0.77
(pearson), with a p-value of <0.001. When considering develop-
ers (with at least 100 commits) instead of projects, we obtain acorrelation coefficient of 0.62. This means that both projects anddevelopers that work a lot outside office hours are also likely to
work a lot during the weekend.
Clusteringallowstheseparationofprojectsbasedonwork
patterns. We again used k-means clustering (with k=7) by
the hour of the week. The difference is that here we cluster by
project (n=87) while previously we clustered the top 10% individu-
als (n=1,108). Fig. 5 shows the two most extreme clusters: the blackonefollowsofficehoursrigorously,whiletheblueonehasacommit

technical [ 30]. In this paper, we approximate the dichotomy of
office hours versus non-office hours using our dynamic office hour
detectionapproach,whichensuresthat,foreachproject, onlythe
most active weekday hours are taken into account as office time.

For lines of code removed, we found a significant differ-

individually shows that for 26% (23/87) the office hour removalsare larger (8% (7/87) significant), for 44% (38/87) they are smaller
(21% (18/87) significant), and for 30% (26/87) of the projects there is
no difference in the median number of lines removed. The effect
sizes were again negligible ranging from 0.08 to -0.10.
Discussion: In terms of commit size, we conclude that there is
no difference in practice between office hours and outside office
hours.
RQ4. Is there a difference in the developers’
work patterns over time?
Motivation: Whilea software projectcould startoff onschedule,
withmostoftheworkhappeningduringofficehours,deadlinesand
delays are notorious for introducing outside office work or evendeath marches. On the other hand, we could hypothesize that aG

of these conflicting ideas, i.e., 1) starting on time with eventualdelays ending up in death march versus 2) starting with a start-up culture and maturing as time passes, is more prevalent in our
projects.
For18projects,theactivityoutsideofficehoursincreased
by at least 5%, while for 27 projects it decreased by at least5%.
For each project, we split the activity history in two equal
parts (in terms of number of commits) in order to find whether the
work pattern changed over time or not. Fig. 6 shows that for 46
projects the activity outside office hours activity neither increased
or decreased by more than 5%.
Examples of Apache projects where activity outside office hours
increasedthemostareAllura,from26.5%to34.7%,Groovyfrom
48.8 to 58.2%, and Wicket from 29.8 to 50.1%. Apache projects that

increased activity outside office hours, from 56.2% to 64.6% and
Thunderbird from 58.2% to 62%. For Mozilla, only Firefox experi-
enced a significant decrease from 47.4% to 42.7%.
In Fig. 6, we identified separate office hours for each half of
the projects’ history, since the eight-hour office hour time interval
can change over time. As shown in Fig. 7, most projects do not

more than one hour.

example, Mozilla Thunderbird experienced a shift from 08:45 to
14:30. However, in both of these cases the amount of work done
outside these 8-hour periods didn’t change a lot and is relativelyhigh (from 0.58 to 0.62 for Thunderbird and from 0.69 to 0.68 for
Log4j).
Overall,wedidnotfindanycorrelationbetweentheamount
of office hour work and shift of office hours period. Most of
the projects that experience large shifts have a rather high amount
of activity outside the identified office hour period. One possible
explanation is that commit activity is more spread throughout the
day for these projects, making the identification of an 8-hour stint
more sensitive to small variations. For example, as seen in Fig. 8,
Thunderbird has a high level of activity from 8 am to 1 am with
activity peaks around 10 am, 3 pm and 8 pm.
Discussion: In summary, most projects do not experience large
changes over time in their work pattern. Important changes in the
identified8-hourofficehourperiodareoftenfoundinprojectswith
commits being more spread throughout the day.Table 2: Commit message differences (in %) during vs. out-

5 DEEPER ANALYSIS OF THE WORK
PATTERNS OF MOZILLA FIREFOX
RQ5. Are office hour commits different in terms
of content?
Motivation: This question is similar to RQ3, which looked for
differencesbetweenthesizeofcommitswithinandoutside office
hours, however here we investigate the content of the commits, by
comparing word clouds. Figure 9 shows a comparison word cloud
ofcommitmessagesforMozillaFirefox,whichhasroughly230,000
commits. As the visualization of a comparison cloud tends to make
the differences appear larger than they actually are, Table 2 also
shows percentage differences for the selected terms.
Developers back out more code themselves outside office
hours.During office hours, there are more commit messages con-
taining the “Backed out changeset” statement, which is part ofthe official terminology of the version control system used to in-dicate that a commit (change set) has been reverted (after being
merged).Furthermore,“Backedoutchangeset<changesetid>”is
often followed by the explanation such as “because of a possible
Talos regression”5. For outside office hours there are more commit
messages with “Back out” (instead of “Backed out changeset”), this
5Talos is the performance testing framework used by Mozilla.

informally seems to indicate that, after office hours, a developer is
backing out changes herself rather than being backed out by some
authority.

ingaddingsomethingismorecommonduringofficehourswhile
removals and fixes are more common outside office hours.
Discussion: Wefoundsmalldifferencesbetweenofficehourand
outside-office hour commit messages. The most notable difference
was that during office hours there are more formal reverts made to
version control. Outside office hours, informal reverts made by the
developer herself are more common.
RQ6. Can demographics explain office hour
activity?
Motivation: First,wehypothesizethatmoreseniordeveloperswill
likely work more during office hours, as they are more likely to
be paid for their efforts. For this purpose, we investigated whether
there was a correlation between the number of commits made by a
developer and the amount of abnormal work. We only considered
individualswith10ormorecommits,whichreducesthenumber
ofanalyzedindividualsinFirefoxsignificantlyfrom2,755to857,
but still retains 98% of the commits.
Second,oneexplanationforworkoutside-officehoursinopen
source projects is the amount of paid and non-paid contributors. If
developersarehiredbyacompanytoworkonaproject,theyare
morelikelytoworkduringregularofficehours.Onthecontrary,
if they are not paid, they are more likely to work during their free
time. Hence, we ran a manual background check for the top 10% of
developerstodeterminewhethertheyarepaidornon-paid,leavinguswith278developers(outof2,755),eachwith147ormorecommits.
This top 10% of developers has made 87% out of all the Firefox
commits. Our background check considered information available
online on websites such as LinkedIn or the developers’ personal
websites(e.g.,publiclyavailableCVs).Inadditiontotheirjobstatus,
we also gathered information about their location, experience in
the software industry and position at Mozilla.
We did not find a statistically significant correlation be-
tween developer seniority and amount of office hour work.
Fig. 10 divides the contributors into buckets based on their number
ofcommits.Theviolinplotsshowthattheamountofofficehour
workvariesbetweengroups.Wecanseeanincreaseintheamount
of commits during office hours as the number of commits increase
in the first three groups. However, this increase plateaus at the 4th
cluster of developers (between 250-499 commits). Then, for the top
contributor group with 1,500 or more commits, the share of abnor-
mal commits increases again. Overall, it seems that the number of
commits is not a very good predictor of office hours work.

clustering. Since we are interested in the differences between of-
fice hour commits and outside-office hour commits within a single
project,weusedourdynamicofficehoursettingdataforMozilla
Firefox and divided each week into 12 time units. From Mondaythrough Friday, a commit can happen either during office hours
(normal) or outside-office hours (abnormal), yielding 10 time units.

For the three clusters in Fig. 11, we ran the dynamic office hour

office hours from 10:00-18:00. During those hours they perform 72
and 53% of their weekly commits, respectively. The third clustercommits 34% during their office hours, which are from 15:15 to23:15, indicating a very irregular and abnormal working pattern.

Office hours for the entire Firefox project were 10:00-18:00, and
during that time the entire project completed 55% of their commits.
Thus, the middle group represents the project average while the
other two groups show extreme variations.
Outside office hour work is mostly performed by unpaid
developers. We compared the clusters identified in Fig. 11 with
our manually extracted information about Mozilla paid developers.
Table 3 shows the absolute number and relative percentage of paid
developersineachcluster(firsttwonumbersineachcell).While
90% of the developers in the cluster with the largest amount of
officehourcommits(lastcolumn),and88%ofthedevelopersinthe
average cluster (second-to-last column) were paid, only 50% of the
clusterwithmostoutside officehours(secondcolumn) werepaid
byMozilla.Thiscorrespondstoonly10.1%ofallpaiddevelopers.
Inotherwords,paid developersworklessoutsideofficehours than
unpaid ones. Yet most paid Firefox developers still work signifi-cantly more outside office hours than developers from the local
company
There are no major differences in office hour work be-
tween developer profiles. Table 4 shows that the developers
based in Europe work less during office hours. It seems that career
moves on the technical ladder, i.e., having a title with the word
“senior”or“principle”,decreasesthemedianofficehourworkby1.9%. However, career moves on the managerial ladder, i.e., having
a title with the word “manager”, decrease the outside office hour
commitsby4.5%.Wesuspectthatmanagementpositionsrequire
less technical work and more communication and coordination,
which might explain this difference. In other words, for managers,
using commits as working hour indicators could be misleading.However, when running a Mann–Whitney U test, only the dif-ference between Europe-based and America-based developers is
statistically significant with a p-value <0.01.
Discussion: We did not find any differences between the se-
niority of developers when measured in terms of commits. On the
other hand, developers following office hours more closely
areusuallydeveloperspaidbyMozilla ,eventhoughmostpaid
developers still work a lot outside regular office hours. We did not
observe any strong characteristics of paid developers that couldexplain these differences. The only statistically significant differ-
enceisobservedbetweenEuropeanandAmericandevelopers,with
theformerfollowingofficehourslessthanthelatter.Apotential
explanation is the difference in time zone and the fact that Mozilla
isbasedinNorthAmerica.Finally,theofficehourworkseemstobe
impacted by job title, but again the differences are not statistically
significant.
6 THREATS TO VALIDITY
Regardingconstruct validity,commit authoringtimesusedinver-
sion control systems might not be representative of the actual time
period when the code change was written: a timestamp cannot
provideinformationaboutthetimeactuallyspentworkingforthat
commit. However, as we investigate weekly and daily rhythms,
which are accumulated over months and years, this should not
significantlyaffecttheresults.Forexample,ifadeveloperworks
at a regular rhythm from nine to five, then, over time, all commits
wouldoccurbetweentheseregularworkinghours,withperhaps
a small lag from the start of working until the first commit. Fur-
thermore, the fact that in most figures we observed dips in commit
count during typical lunch hours strengthens the idea that commit
time stampsare reliable whenused fordaily and weeklyworking
hour discovery.
However, for the local company, we investigated the developers’
chatlogactivityandcommitactivity.Wefoundthatnotonlyare
these strongly correlated (r=0.74), but the “start of the day lag”
between the 8-hour office period based on the chat log timestamps
and the one based on the commit timestamps is only 15 minutes.
This offersfurther support thatcommit time stampscan be used to
studywhatarethetypicalworkinghoursindailyandweeklylevel.
Anotherthreattoconstructvalididtyisthatouranalysisdepends
ondataextractedfromrepositoriesavailablefromonlinesources.
AlthoughwefoundsomemissingtimezoneinformationforApache

these data sources may impact the result of our analysis. In partic-
ular,wereliedontimezoneinformationavailablefromMozilla’s
MercurialsourcecoderepositoryandApachesourcecodereposi-
tories. The time zone from this repository might not be accurate
enough to pinpoint the developer’s actual position.
In order to identify developers hired by Mozilla, we manually
looked for information about them online. Although this allows us

Regardingthreatstoexternalvalidity,ourstudyonlyincludes
open source projects from Mozilla and Apache, and one project
from a local company. The results obtained are specific to those or-
ganizations’cultureandtothehabitsoftheirdevelopers.Although
the results reveal important differences between the projects, as
illustratedinFigure5,wecannotguaranteethatourdatasetwould
be representative of the entire industry in particular, as we would
need more closed source projects.
7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Inthispaper,wehaveperformedafirstlarge-scalestudyofsoftware
developers’ work patterns by investigating over 700,000 version
controlcommitscomingfrom87softwareprojects,eachhavinga
minimumof2,000commits.Weweremotivatedtoinvestigatework
patterns as according to medical and occupation well-being litera-
turetheymightbepossibleindicatorsofoverload,timepressure,
and unhealthy working patterns.
We found that developers follow a typical circadian rhythm
where most of the work is performed during day time and lessworkisperformedduring eveningsandatnight.Dipsinactivity
during typical lunch hours can also be seen. The weekly rhythmshows that during weekends there is radically less activity. Wethen established a search method that finds, for each project or
individual,theperiod,ofagivenlength,withthehighestnumber
ofcommits.Inthispaper,wefixedthelengthoftimeseriestoeighthourstomakecomparisonsbetweenprojects.Ourmethodcanalso
be used in reverse to find a continuous time series that results in a
certain percentage of commits.
Weusedoursearchmethodtofindthatthemedian8-hourwork-
ing day for software engineering projects in our data runs from
10:00to18:00insteadofthetypical09:00-17:00(nine-to-five).Thus,
the oftenquoted idea of programmersas nightowls thathas even
made it to a book titled “Why programmers work at night” [ 18]
holdsonlypartially.Perhapstheplusonehourshiftcomparedto
regular nine-to-five professions gives the impression of a highlyelevated night activity. Another possibility for the birth of that
mythcouldbeinextremeprojectsastheonesshowninFigure5,
with a blue line showing that a peak hour of commits occurs daily
very close to midnight.
In fact, a previous comparison of the work rhythms of software
engineers and scientists [ 21] shows that scientists seem to work
more during the night than software engineers. The activity of US
and German scientists at night (measured by paper downloads)is roughly 42% and 25% of their day time peak activity. On theother hand, for software developers in the Mozilla and Apacheprojects,thecorrespondingpercentages(basedoncommitcount)
are roughly 29% and 25% (see Fig. 1d and Fig. 1b).
Ofcourse,individualshavedifferentworkingpatternsand,in-
deed,clusteringofdevelopersrevealedthatonethirdofsoftware
developersdonotseemtofollowatypicalofficehourrhythmatall
astheyperformalotofactivitiesduringeveningsandweekends
(see Figure 2). On the other hand, two thirds of individuals mostly
follow office hours. This information is important if one wishes to
builda stressdetector thatwoulduse amongother things commit
hours, since such a detector would only work for the two thirds of
software engineers who have regular working rhythms.
A manual background check of the top 10% (over 250 individ-
uals) of Mozilla Firefox developers revealed that only half of thedevelopers that did not follow office hours were paid by Mozilla
(black line in Figure 11) as opposed to roughly 90% for the two
groups that did follow office hours. This suggests that existenceof hobby developers can partially explain the outside office hour
activity.Still,forthemiddlegroup(bluecurveinFigure11),only
55%ofcommitsareperformedduringofficehours,although90%
of theindividuals arepaid employees,which couldbe amarker of
overload for that group.
With respect to seniority we found no differences in working
hours by using two different measures the number of commits
and job title. This is rather surprising but perhaps developers that
make very few commits are hobbyist and commit outside office
hours while for the most senior developers the outside office hour
commits would be explained by overwork.
Acomparisonofcommitmessagesbetweenofficeandoutside
officehoursrevealedthatinourlargestproject,Firefox,formalcode
review reverts are made more often during office hours. Moreover,
informaldeveloper-initiatedrevertsaremoreoftenmadeoutside
officehours.Furthermore,officehourtimeseemstofocusespecially
on adding new code while clean-ups are more frequent outside
officehours.Wefoundnodifferenceincommitsize,andwedidnot
find support to the idea that as projects mature they move away
from night and weekend work to more typical office hour rhythm.
Infuturework,wewillperformadetailedqualitativeanalysis
of both individual histories and individual developer histories tobetter explain the differences in working patterns, involving in-terviews and daily surveys to monitor project members. We willuse additional data sources, such as chat logs, in order to make
oursetoftimestampactivitymorecomplete.Measuringthelevel
ofdetachmentfromwork,whichiscriticaltorecovery,shouldbe
studied and, similarly, normative recommendation from empiri-cal data should be drawn. We also intend to study the impact of
policiesandguidelinesputinplacebyprojectmanagers,suchas
afastreleasecycle,ondevelopers’activityandhealth.Finally,we
also want to investigate further the causes of outside office hour
workbyfocusingonperiodswithunusuallyhighactivityduring
the night or weekends.
