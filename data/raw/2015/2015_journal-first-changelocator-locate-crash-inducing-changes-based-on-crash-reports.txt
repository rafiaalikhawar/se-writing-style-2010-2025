ABSTRACT
Softwarecrashesareseveremanifestationsofsoftwarebugs.Debug-
ging crashing bugs is tedious and time-consuming. Understanding
software changes that induce a crashing bug can provide useful
contextualinformationforbugfixingandishighlydemandedby
developers. Locating the bug inducing changes is also useful for
automatic program repair, since it narrows down the root causes
andreducesthesearchspaceofbugfixlocation.However,currentlytherearenosystematicstudiesonlocatingthesoftwarechangesto
a source code repository that induce a crashing bug reflected by a
bucket of crash reports. To tackle this problem, we first conducted
an empirical study on characterizing the bug inducing changes for
crashingbugs(denotedas crash-inducing changes ).Wealsopropose
ChangeLocator,amethodtoautomaticallylocatecrash-inducing
changes for a given bucket of crash reports. We base our approach
onalearningmodelthatusesfeaturesoriginatedfromourempir-
ical study and train the model using the data from the historicalfixed crashes. We evaluated ChangeLocator with six release ver-
sionsofNetbeansproject.Theresultsshowthatitcanlocatethe
crash-inducing changes for 44 .7%, 68 .5%, and 74 .5% of the bugs by
examiningonlytop1,5and10changesintherecommendedlist,re-
spectively. It significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art
approach.
