ABSTRACT
With millions of smartphones sold every year, the development of
mobile apps has grown substantially. The battery power limitation
of mobile devices has push developers and researchers to search
formethodstoimprovetheenergyefficiencyofmobileapps.We
propose a multiobjective refactoring approach to automatically im-
prove the architecture of mobile apps, while controlling for energy
efficiency.Inthisextendedabstractwebrieflysummarizeourwork.

1 INTRODUCTION
Mobile apps play a central role in our daily living. Like other types
of applications, the design quality of mobile apps is affected by
poordesignchoices(a.k.a,anti-patterns),whichimpactssoftware
evolutionandhindermaintainability.Onecriticalconcernofmobile
appsistheefficientuseofenergy.Recently,researchershavefound
evidence that refactoring could improve the energy efficiency of
mobile apps [ 3]. In [2] we propose an approach (EARMO) to detect
andcorrectanti-patternsinmobileapps,whileimprovingenergy
consumption.

Thetwomainresearchobjectivesofthispaperare( O1)toquantify

anapproachforremoving mobileanti-patterns,whilecontrolling
forenergyefficiency.Toaddress O1,weperformanempiricalstudy
on 200 open-source Android apps, from which we selected 20, and
8 type of anti-patterns to measure the energy consumption of apps
with/without anti-patterns using a physical measurement setup.To
address O2, we formulate EARMO as multiobjective search-based

sidering 5 dimensions: (1) percentage of anti-patterns corrected
(2) precision of the refactorings suggested; (3) design quality im-
provementaccordingtoanexternalqualitymodel(QMOOD[ 1]);
(4) energy efficiency improvement measured in Battery life; and (5)
usefulness of the refactorings proposed according to developers.

EARMO improved the extendibility of the studied apps by 41%.Concerning energy efficiency, it extended the battery life by up

4 CONCLUSION
In [2], we studied the impact of anti-patterns on the energy ef-
ficiency on mobile apps. We found that anti-patterns affect not
onlydesign quality,butalso thebattery lifeofmobile devices.We
proposed a multiobjective refactoring approach named EARMO to
improve thedesign qualityof apps, whilecontrolling fortheir en-
ergyefficiency.WevalidatedEARMOonatestbedof20open-source
apps and found that EARMO could correct 84% of anti-patterns
detected, and extend the battery life of mobile devices by up to
29 minutes. To validate the usefulness of the solutions found by
EARMO,wesubmittedthemtotheauthorsofthestudiedappsand
they found 68% of them to be very relevant. Finally, we providea methodology to correctly measure energy consumption of mo-bile apps, and guidelines for toolsmiths interested in developing
automated tools for improving mobile apps.
