ABSTRACT
Code smells were defined as symptoms of poor design choices ap-
pliedbyprogrammersduringthedevelopmentofasoftwareproject
[2]. They might hinder the comprehensibility and maintainability
ofsoftwaresystems[ 5].Similarlytosomepreviouswork[ 3,4,6,7]
in this paper we investigate the relationship between the presence
ofcodesmellsandthesoftwarechange-andfault-proneness.Specif-
ically,whilepreviousworkshowsasignificantcorrelationbetween
smells and code change/fault-proneness, the empirical evidence
provided so far is still limited because of:
Limited size of previous studies: ThestudybyKhomh etal.[4]
was conducted on four open source systems, while the study by
D’Ambros et al.[1] was performed on seven systems. Further-
more,thestudiesbyLiandShatnawi[ 6],Olbrich etal.[7],and
Gatrell and Counsell [ 3] were conducted considering the change
history of only one software project.
Detected smells vs.manually validated smells: Previouswork

imprecisions might have affected the results.

Lack of analysis of the magnitude of the effect: Previouswork
indicated that classes affected by code smells have more chances
to exhibit defects (or to undergo changes) than other classes.
However, no study has observed the magnitude of such changes
and defects, i.e., no study addressed the question: How many
defects would exhibit on average a class affected by a code smell as
comparedtoanotherclassaffectedbyadifferentkindofsmell,or
not affected by any smell at all?
Lack of within-artifact analysis: A class might be intrinsically

there may be classes that become smelly during their lifetimebecause of maintenance activities. Or else, classes where thesmell was removed, possibly because of refactoring activities.For such classes, it is of paramount importance to analyze the
change- and fault-proneness of the class during its evolution,in order to better relate the cause (presence of smell) with the
possible effect (change- or fault-proneness).
Lack of a temporal relation analysis: Whilepreviousworkcor-
related the presence of code smells with high fault- and change-
proneness, one may wonder whether the artifact was smelly
whenthefaultwasintroduced,orwhetherthefaultwasintro-
duced before the class became smelly.
To cope with the aforementioned issues, this paper aims at cor-
roboratingpreviousempiricalresearchontheimpactofcodesmells
by analyzing their diffuseness and effect on change- and fault-
proneness on a total of 395 releases of 30 open source systems,
considering 13 different code smell types manually identified. Our
resultsshowedthatclassesaffectedbycodesmellstendtobesig-nificantlymorechange-andfault-pronethanclassesnotaffected
by design problems, however their removal might be not always
beneficial for improving source code maintainability.
