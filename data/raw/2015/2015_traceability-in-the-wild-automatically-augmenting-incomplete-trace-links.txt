Its importance has long been recognized in safety-critical domains,
where it is often a prescribed part of the development process
[9,42,51,52,55]. While traceability is relevant to all software
development environments [ 41–43,48,53,61], the effort needed
to manually establish and maintain trace links in non-regulated
domains has often been perceived as prohibitively high.
However,withtheubiquitousadoptionofversioncontrolsys-
tems such as Git[20] andGitHub, and issue tracking systems such
asBugzillaorJira[30],ithasbecomecommonpracticefordevel-
operstotagcommitswithissueIDs.Inlargeprojects,suchasthe
onesfromtheApacheFoundation,thisprocedureisreflectedinthe
guidelines which state that “You need to make sure that the commit
message contains at least [...] a reference to the Bugzilla or JIRA
issue [...]” [18]. Creating such tags establishes explicit links be-
tweencommitsandissues,suchasfeaturerequestsandbugreports.
However,theprocessisnotperfect,asdevelopersmayforget,or
otherwise fail, to create tags when they make a commit [ 4,56].
Whilethepracticeoftaggingcommitshasbecomepopularinopen
source projects,it is conceptually applicablein any projectwhere
version control systems and issue trackers are used.
In this paper we propose a solution for identifying tags that are
missing between commits and issues and augmenting the trace-
ability data with these previously missing links. As shown later in
the paper, our observations across six OSS showed that an average
of only about 60% of commits were linked to specific issues. The
majority of papers addressing traceability in OSS have focused on
directly establishing a complete set of links between issues and
source code. In contrast, we focus on generating the missing links
atthecommitlevel.Thishastheprimaryadvantageofproviding
traceabilitysupportwithinthenaturalcontextinwhichdevelopers
are creating trace links. Our approach leverages existing tags, as
well as information related to the commit process itself and also
textualsimilaritiesbetweencommitmessages,issuedescriptions,
and code changes. We use these attributes to train a classifier to
identify tags that are missing from commit messages. Furthermore,
we set a critical constraint on our work that the classifier must be
populated,trained,andthenutilizedwithasimple“buttonpress”
in order to make it practical in an industrial setting.
Lowlevellinksbetweencommitsandissuesprovidethebuild-
ing blocks for inferring project-wide traceability between improve-
ments, bug reports, sourcecode, test cases, and commits, andalso
allow associationsto be established between theissues and devel-
opers [58]. Augmenting the set of trace links between commits
and issues, therefore results in a more complete set of project-wide
trace links. This enables more accurate support for tasks such as

defect prevention [ 53], change impact analysis, coverage analysis,
and even provides enhanced support for building recommendation
systems to identify appropriate developers for fixing bugs [2].
We train and evaluate our approach on six open-source projects
in order to address three key research questions:
RQ1:Is the link classifier able to accurately reconstruct issue tags
during the commit process?
RQ2:Isthelinkclassifierabletopreciselyaugmentanexistingset
of incomplete commit to issue links in a fully automated way?
RQ3:Is the link classifier able to recommend additional tags?
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2
introduces the artifacts, case projects, process model, and stake-
holder model, that form the fundamentals of our approach. Section
3 describes the elements of our classifier. Section 4 describes thesixprojectsinourstudy.Sections5and6describescenariosand
experiments associated with recommending tags for commits, aug-
mentingexistingsetsoftracelinks,andconstructingtracelinksfor
commits with no tags. Finally sections 7 to 9 discuss related work,
threats to validity, and conclusions.
2 FUNDAMENTALS
We first introduce a motivating example and describe the artifacts,
projectenvironments,andtheprocessandstakeholdermodelsthat
form the fundamentals of our approach.
2.1 Motivating Example

consists of a unique issue ID, a short summary, a longer textual de-

Figure 3: Example for a commit in Git
The common way to establish a trace link between a commit
and an issue is by placing the unique issue id, i.e., GROOVY-5082
inthisexample,intothebeginningofthecommitmessage.How-
ever,acloseexaminationofthecommitmessageinthisexample
shows that the committer made a subtle mistake and misspelled
theissuekeyforthebugthatwasbeingfixed(omittingan O).Asa
result, traditional trace link construction techniques that rely upon
matching the key to an issue will fail to create a trace link.
However, even without a valid issue key, there are numerous
clues to suggest that the commit should be associated with the
reportedbug.First,thebugdescriptionexhibitstextualsimilarity
to the commit message as well as to the text in the changed file
AsmClassGenerator.java . Second, the commit was submitted on
thesamedatethattheissuewasresolved,andfinally,theperson
(obfuscated for privacy reasons) who submitted the commit was
also responsible (i.e. the assignee) for resolving the issue. Taken
together,these observationsprovide somedegree ofevidence that
thecommitandbugshouldbelinked.Thisexampleilluminatesthe
thinkingbehindourproposedsolution.Webuildaclassifierthat
leverages all of this information, plus additional attributes, to learn
which issues should be tagged to each specific commit.
2.2 Software Artifacts and their Relations
Whileversioncontrolsystemsandissuetrackershaveseveraltypes
of artifacts, our approach leverages three of them to construct
missingcommitlinks.Theseare issues,commits(i.e.,changesets),
andsource code files.
Issues:OurmodelusesissuescollectedfromtheJiraissuetrack-
ing system. While there are several types of issues, we focus on
improvements andbugswhicharethemostcommonlyoccurring
ones.Animprovementrepresentsanenhancementtoanexisting
feature in the software, while a bug describes a problem, which
impairsorpreventsitscorrectfunctionality.Intheremainderofthe
paper,theterm issueisusedinreferenceto bothimprovementsand
bugs.Independentoftheiractualtype,allissuessharethefollowing
properties: a unique issue ID,asummary providing a brief one-line
synopsisoftheissue,andamoreextensiveexplanationprovided
in thedescription. Further, every issue has a temporal life cycle –
it iscreatedat a given point in time and later resolved, and may be
assigned to an author, responsible for its resolution.

2.3 Studied Projects
Forourstudy,weselectedsixprojectsfromdiversedomains,that
utilizedbothGitandJira.Theyincluded:buildautomation(Maven

(Gr), Pig (Pi)), and a rule engine (Drools (Do)), primarily selected

practice of tagging commits with issue IDs. We analyzed each of
the projects to gain an understanding of the numbers of links that
existedbetweencommitmessagesandissues.Further,weanalyzed
the number of issues that were linked to exactly one commit (1:1),
two or more disjoint commits (1:N), or had no links. Results are
reported in Table 1. For example, of the 2,638 bug-related issues in
the Derby project, 1,093 were linked to only one commit, 273 were
linkedtomultiplecommits,and1,272hadnoassociatedcommits.Table1:Existingbugandimprovementtocommitlinkchar-

Across all of the projects approximately 43.3% of improvements
and 42.4% of bugs have no commits associated with them.
Table 2 depicts a similar analysis from the perspective of the
commits. It reports the number of commits with links to issues
for the selected projects. Again, we analyzed the distribution of
1:1links,1:Nlinksandnonlinkedcommits.IntheDerbyproject,
of the 3,735 commits, 1,657 linked to only one bug, 1,350 to onlyone improvement, 175 linked to multiple bugs or improvements,
and553 commitshad nolinks. However, acrossallof theprojects
approximately 48% of the commits were not linked to any issue.
Furthermore, there was significant variance across the six projects
withonly15%ofcommitsinDerbyhavingnolinkscomparedtoap-
proximately 76% of unlinked commits in Maven. Clearly, different
practices exist across different projects, leading to huge disparities
in the extent to which issue tags are added to commit messages.
Oneoftheprimarygoalsofourwork,istoestablishatleastone
linkforeachcommit.Asthemajorityofcommitslinktoasingle
issue, we only attempt to generate links for currently unlinkedcommits. For commits without links there are two viable cases –first that an appropriate issue exists and a link can be generated,
and second that no appropriate issue exists for the commit.
2.4 Process Model
As previously explained, our approach leverages clues from the de-
velopmentprocesstoaidinthegenerationoflinks.Firstweobserve
thatthesoftwaredevelopmentprocessistimedependent:bugsandimprovementsareconstantlycreatedandresolved,andcommitsare

Figure 5: Temporal and structural relations between issue (I ), commit ( C), and source code file ( F) artifacts.
C9are linked, e.g. is_linked(C1,I1)=1. The figure also shows the
relationbetweenissuesandcommitsaccordingtothetimeline.We
definethefunctions created:I→Nandresolved :I→N,I∈I,
which returns the point in time when the issue was created and
respectivelyresolved.Duringthistime,theissueisconsideredto
be unfinished and source code modifications are required in order
to implement the improvement or fix the bug. In our study we
focusonissuesthatareresolved(e.g.,inFigure5, created(I1)=0
andresolved(I3)=10). The function committed :C→N,C∈C
returns the time stamp at which a commit was submitted to the
version control system. e.g. committed (C6)=8 in the example.
Temporal relations Consideringanonlinkedcommit C∈C,
the temporal structure imposes several constraints on the possible
link candidates I∈I. The following three cases exist.
(1)committed (C)<created(I):Duetocausality,thecommit Cis
not considered to be a link candidate for I(e.g., in Figure 5, C2
is not a link candidate for I2).
(2)created(I)≤committed (C)≤resolved(I): This situation de-
picts the usual development work flow. After issue creation,
the developers modify the source code and submit commits in
ordertoresolvetheissue.Thesecommitsaretracedtotheissue.
Eventually,theissueisresolved,andinthisexample,nofurther
commits are made to the issue (e.g., in Figure 5, the non linked
commitC6is a link candidate for I3).
(3)resolved(I)<committed (C):Intuitively,inthissituationatrace
link from CtoIis not considered, since Iwas already resolved
before the commit occurred. However, this situation is notuncommon as Table 3 shows. The obvious reasons might be,
thatadeveloperforgottosubmitthecommitbeforeresolving
theissue.Anothermightsimplybeclockdifferencesbetween
the unconnected, decentralized systems used by Jira and Git
which prevents strict time comparisons.
In project Derby, there is sometimes a large discrepancy be-
tweenthetimeatwhichanissueisresolvedandthelastcommit
thattraces toit. Forexample, theimprovement DERBY-65164
was resolved as fixed on 20/Mar/14; yet, on 4/Apr/14 a com-
mit ( 78227e45) was submitted and linked to this improvement.
Howeverthisscenarioisquiterare,affectingonly136commits.
Interestingly, in both the Groovy and Maven projects, the me-
dian time difference for late commits is much lower (only 5
hours), but affectsa huge numberof commits. For example,in

These temporal constraints limit the potential pairs of candidate

Structuralrelations Table2reveals(inrow1:n)thatoftenmul-

However,oftenonlyonecommitinthisseriesisexplicitlylinked

All commits in the series may share commonalities. In addition
to their succession in time, the commits may modify a similarset of source code files since they are related to the same issue.
We define a function
overlap(Ca,Cb)=mod(Ca)∩mod(Cb)
max(|mod(Ca)|,|mod(Cb)|)
withCa,Cb∈C. For example, in Figure 5 the overlap of C1 and
C2i soverlap(C1,C2)=1

The assignee of an issue also might be the person who contributes
commits in solving the issue. In the studied scenario, there is no
technicalconnectionbetweentheissuetrackerJiraandtheversion
controlsystemGit.Thuswecannotrelyonanavailablestakeholder
model. Therefore we applied the following approach to identify
individual developers in both systems. In each system, a developer
isrepresentedbyanameandalogin(nicknameoremail).Inthefirst

andbuilttwogroups.Inthisstep,wemergednamesiftheyusedthe

assigned to every developer. The function userid:u→Nwith
u∈C∪Ireturns this user id for a given commit or issue.
3 THE LINK CLASSIFIER
Our goal was to create a classifier that could identify issues associ-
ated with a commit. The classifier was therefore trained to predict
whether any issue-commit pair should be linked or not.
3.1 Attributes of the Commit-Issue Relation
Based on the artifact model introduced in the previous section,
weidentified18attributesperinstance.Theseattributesfallinto
twocategories,process-relatedinformationandtextualsimilarity
between artifacts using information retrieval techniques.
Process-Related Attributes
Weconsider thefollowing16process-relatedfactorsto modelthe
relationship between commits, source code files, and issues. These
factorscapturestakeholder-related,temporal,andstructuralchar-
acteristics of the candidate pair (C,I)withC∈C,I∈I:
Stakeholder-relatedinformation, a1...3:Wecapturetheiden-
tities of the committer as a1=userid(C)and the assignee of the is-
suesasa2=userid(I).Additionally,wemarkedasabinaryattribute
whether the two are identical as a3=1(ifuserid(C)=userid(I),0
otherwise).
Temporalrelationsbetweenissueandcommit, a4...7:Based
on temporal properties of issue and commit, we calculated a4=
committed (C)−created(I)anda5=resolved(I)−committed (C).
Additionally,wecaptureas a6whethercreated(I)≤committed (C)
10https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-3252≤resolved(I), i.e. whether Cwas committed during the active de-
velopment time of I. Furthermore, we capture close commits in
relation to issue resolution as a7=|a5|<ϵ.W es e tϵ=2.5 days,
derived from observing that late commits occur on average within
5 and 150 hours of the issue resolution for the studied projects (see
Table 3). For example in Figure 5, the pair (C6,I3)yieldsa4=1,
a5=2 anda6=1.
Closest previous linked commit, a8...10:Wecapturetheset
of previous commits linked to IasCprev={Cx|is_linked(Cx,I)∧
committed (Cx)<committed (C)}.Ifnon-empty,thecommit Cp∈
Cprevwith the largest commit time stamp is taken and used to
calculatea8=committed (C)−committed (Cp),a9=overlap(Cp,C),
anda10=userid(Cp). For example in Figure 5, the pair (C2,I1)
yieldsCprev={C1}and thusCp=C1,a8≈1, anda9=1
2.
Closest subsequent linked commit, a11...13:Analogous to
theclosestpreviouslinkedcommit,wecapturesubsequentcommits
Cnext.Wecapture Cnext={Cx|is_linked(Cx,I)∧committed (C)<
committed (Cx)}and selected Cnwith the minimal commit time to
calculatea11=committed (Cn)−committed (C),a12=overlap(Cn,C),
anda13=userid(Cn). For example in Figure 5, the pair (C7,B1)
yieldsCnext={C9},Cn=C9,a11≈2, anda12=2
3.
Number of issues and existing links, a14...16:We calculate
the set of existing issues at time committed (C),
Iexist={Ix|created(Ix)≤committed (C)≤resolved( Ix)∧Ix∈I}
and capture its cardinality as a14=|Iexist|. TakingIexist, we de-

Textual Similarity Attributes
We leveraged information retrieval methods to compute textual
and semantic associations betweencommit messages, source code
files, and issues. We explored three primary techniques for com-
putingtextualsimilarity sim.TheseweretheVectorSpaceModel
(VSM),VSMwithN-Gramenhancements(VSM-nGram),andLatent
Semantic Indexing (LSI) [1, 12, 14].
IntheVSMmodel,eachdocument,i.e.,commitmessage,issue
description, and source code file, is treated as an unstructured bag
of terms. Following common information retrieval techniques, doc-
uments are pre-processed to remove stop words, to stem wordsto their morphological roots, and to split camel-case and snake-
casewords(e.g.,optionsParservs.options_parser)intotheircon-
stituent parts. Each document dis then represented as a vector
/vecd=(w1,d,w2,d,...,wn,d), wherewi,drepresents the term weight
associated with term ifor document d. Each term tis assigned a
weightusingastandardweightingschemeknownas tf−idf[29].

computing textual similarity scores. This was because we observed
thatVSM-nGramoutperformedVSMonourdatasets,andranmuch
fasterthanLSI.Infact,thecomputationtimeofLSIonourdatasets
was prohibitively slow with runtimes of up to 40 hours in some
cases, and so we rejected it as impractical. Furthermore, several
previous studies have shown that VSM tends to either outperform
LSIonsoftwareengineeringdatasetsorperforminequivalentways
[25,29,38]. A detailed comparison of trace retrieval techniques
withinourclassifierisoutsidethescopeofthisresearch.Therefore,
basedonourinitialanalysis,wechoseVSM-nGramtocomputethe
following similarity attributes:
Textual similarity of a commitand an issue, a17:Thesimi-

3.2 Studied Attribute Sets
We studied the impact of the presented attributes in four subsets.
•Process– This set solely contains the process-related attributes,
i.e.AStructure ={a1...a16}.Itstudiestheimpactofallprocess-
related attributes without considering textual similarity.
•Similarity – This set consists of the attributes
ASim={a6,a17,a18}. It solely considers textual similarity be-
tweencommitandissuegiventheconstraintthattheissueexisted
at the time of the commit.
•All–Thisset, Aall={a1...a18},containsallprocess,similarity
and stakeholder related attributes.
•Auto– This set, Aauto⊆Aall, addresses potentialcorrelations
and dependencies among attributes. It contains an automatically
selectedsubsetderived byconsideringtheindividual predictive
ability of each attribute along with the degree of redundancy
betweenthem.Weimplementedtheredundantattributeremoval
process based on Weka’s inbuilt auto-selection feature [28].
3.3 Dataset Profiles and Splits
Weaimtoclassifylinksbetweencommitsandimprovementsand
between commits and bugs. We therefore construct two distinct
profilesforeachproject,constructedfromprocessandsimilarityattributes per commit-issue pair.
Profilep=(Sp,train,Sp,test)p∈{Buд,Imp}
Each profile consists of a distinct training and a testing set. We
appliedthefollowingprocedure perprojecttocreateinstancesof
candidatecommit–issuepairsforthetrainingset Sp,trainaswell
as the testing set Sp,test.
Sp,t={(C,I)|is_candidate (C,I)}C∈Cp,t,I∈Ip,t
p∈{Buд,Imp} t∈{train,test}
with the function is_candidate defined as
is_candidate (C,I)=created(I)≤committed (C)
∧committed (C)≤resolved(I)+ϵ
The function limits the number of candidate commit/issue pairs
accordingtocausality.Alinkcandidateisneverconsideredbetweenacommitiftheissuehasnotbeencreatedatthetimeofthecommit.Secondly,
ϵassuresthatacommitisnotunboundedlyconsideredas
a candidate for issues resolved in the past. Based on an analysis of
commitsontoclosedissues(seeTable3),wefoundthatthemedian
commit time after the issue has marked resolved was between 5
and 150 hours for the studied projects and we decided to choose ϵ
as 30 hours. The candidate sets Cp,tandIp,twere then created as
Cp,train={C|committed (C)≤tsplit}C∈C
Ip,train={I|resolved(I)≤tsplit} I∈Ip
Cp,test={C|committed (C)>tsplit}p∈{Buд,Imp}
Ip,test={I|created(I)>tsplit}.
The parameter tsplitdefines the point in time, which splits
the training and test set. We choose a 80% – 20% split and cal-culated
tsplitas follows. First, we ordered the improvements in
the respective project according to their creation date in ascend-ing order. We selected the improvement
Isplit∈IImp, which di-
videsthissequenceinto80%and20%ofallimprovementswhere
tsplit=resolved(Isplit), i.e. the resolution time of 80% of all im-
provements.

were Näive Bayes, J48 Decision Tree, and Random Forrest. We
includedNäiveBayesbecauseeventhoughtheassumptionofin-

tion problems [ 11,16,26,32]. We utilized Weka’s J48 decision tree
with default pruning settings because of its previously reported
effectivenessinothersoftwareengineeringstudies[ 26].Finally,we

to be highly accurate and robust against noise [ 5], although it can
be expensive to run on large data sets.
The profiles we created were severely unbalanced containing
many more instances of non-links thanlinks. Training against such
unbalanced sets makes it likely that the classifier will favor placing
instances into the majority class (i.e. in this case classifying all
pairs asnon-links). We performed all experiments using Weka [ 27]
andusedtheinbuiltsub-samplingfeaturetocreatebalanceddata
sets. Given a fixed number of explicit links, Weka randomly selects
the same number of non-links. We trained each classifier in turn
usingthebalancedsets SBuд ,train,andSImp ,trainforeachproject

also a score which we used to rank recommended links in order of

4 DATA COLLECTION
Topreparethedatafortrainingandtestingtheclassifier,weper-
formedatwostepdatacollectionprocessforeachofthesixprojects.
Step 1: Analyzing project management and issue tracker
system.We implementeda collectorto retrieveartifacts (i.e.,im-
provements and bugs). All six projects use the Jira project man-
agement tool offering a web-service interface. Our collector down-
loadedandparsedallartifacts.Usingtheartifacttype,wefiltered
theartifactstoretrieve onlybugsandimprov ements.Thereforewe
appliedthefollowingmappingfromJiratypestoourmodel:bug
→bug, and improvement, enhancement →improvement. In both
cases, the artifacts represented finished work, i.e. their status was
"Resolved" or "Closed" and the resolution "Fixed" or "Done".
Step2:AnalyzingSourceControlManagement(SCM)sys-
tem.Asecondcollectorwasimplementedtodownloadallsource
codechangesandcommitmessagesfromeachSCMrepository(i.e.,
GIT). We parsed the commit messages and applied the heuristic
described in [ 4] to retrieve existing trace links from commits to
bugreportsandimprovementsbasedonsearchingandmatching
the issue keys in commit messages. Given the goals of our trace-ability experiment we excluded non-source code files related to
documentation, and build automation based on their file name ex-
tensions. Additionally we analyzed file paths in order to exclude
sourcecodefilesimplementingtestcases.InthestandardMaven
directorylayout11,usedbyallsixofourprojectsprojects,source
files are placed in sub-directories of src/main and tests as sub-
directories of src/test/java.
The results of these two steps were stored in an archive per
project,whichispubliclyavailable[ 50].Datawerecollectedfrom
each project until May 31th2017.

Weperformedatwo-phaseevaluation.Inthefirstphaseweaddress
RQ1 and RQ2 by exploring two different usage scenarios. The first
uses the classifier as a recommender system, to suggest a list of the
most likely issues at the time a commit is submitted. Ideally this
functionality would be integrated into the version control system
and activated when the user presses the commit button. In thisscenario, high recall is imperative, so that the relevant issue (if
itexists)isincludedinthedisplayedlist.Thesecondexperiment
evaluatesthecase,inwhichtheclassifierisusedto automatically
augment an existing set of trace links for a project. In this scenario,
high precision is essential because links that are automatically

or create a known link if the committer had forgotten to create its
tag manually. We trained the three classifiers on the four attribute
sets as described in Section 3.2 and Section 3.4.
Results were evaluated using commonly adopted traceability
metrics.Recallmeasures the fraction of relevant links that are
retrieved while precision measures the fraction of retrieved links
that are relevant. Finally, F-measure measures the harmonic mean
of recall and precision [ 1,29,36,59]. We utilize two variants of the
F-Measure – namely F2which is weighted to favor recall, and F0.5
which is weighted to favor precision.

The attribute set Allachieves an average recall of 96% and average

44] shows that the Allapproach significantly ( p<0.05)
outperforms the other attribute sets in terms of F2score. The other
twoclassifiersalsoperformedbestwhenusingthe Allfeaturessets.
However, their achieved F2scores were significantly lower than
that of Random Forest ( F2=0.48 for J48, and F2=0.6 for Näive
Bayes).Generally,thevaluesshowthattheRandomForestclassifier

The feature set Processperforms considerably well. This is notable,
because it does not require resource intensive IR techniques to
extractthenecessaryfeatures a17anda18.However,addingthese
features to the model results in overall better performance (see
theAllattribute set). An exception within the results is the Derby
project,whichunderperformsonallattributesets.Thelowrecall

the ranked list for one out of two commits.

6 CONSTRUCTING UNKNOWN LINKS
The previous experiment was designed to reconstruct known links.
However,therealvalueofourclassifierisinrecommendingtags

notperfect,confidencethattheexplicitlylinkedpairsofcommits
andissuesarecorrectlylabeled;howeverthenon-linksconstituteacombination of true negative links (i.e. correctly labeled non-links)
andfalsenegativelinks(i.e.incorrectlylabelednon-links).Ofthese,
thefalsenegativesrepresentthe missinglinks thatwenowtarget.
Thesemissinglinksresultfromcasesinwhichadeveloperfailed
to associate a commit with an issue or created an incomplete set
of tags. Previous studies have reported the difficulty of correctly
classifying entities not represented in the original training set [ 47]
and we therefore need to evaluate the ability of the classifier to
detect previously missing links.
Since no answer set for the non-linked commits is available, we
neededtoperformamanualinspectionoftheproposedlinks.As
a sanitycheck wefirst evaluatedwhether itwould beplausible to
classifylinksontheseunknownparts.Inallsixprojectscommits
with links are typically related to only one issue or to a very small
number of them (see Table 2). Therefore, we count the average
numberofissuesclassifiedaslinksforeachofthecommitswithout
any explicit link (see Table 6). The classifier trained using attribute
setAllidentifiesanaverageof1 .54issuespercommitasacandidate

the studied projects. Based on these values, we expect a value of
≈1.2linkspercommit.ForexampleinprojectInfinispan,there
were 2,223 commits linked to bugs and 1714 +254=1968 bugs

[17]. A kappa value of 1 means that all raters are in agreement,

tors discussed results for 20 commit-issue pairs with the aim
of achieving consensusin classifying the pair ashaving a link

Dueto thelaborintensive natureof thisanalysis,we evaluated

respectively when the classifier was used to generate links for
commits with no previously known issue tags. Similar trends were
observedforDrools.However,precisiondroppedconsiderablyfor
Maven returning 0.11 for bugs, but only 0.04 for improvements. A
potential explanation for the poor precision result in the Mavenproject is the fact that a majority of the commits represent code
refactoring and in many cases were not associated with any issues
at all - resulting in several false positive links. This was also thecase in other projects where several commits were not directlyassociated with any particular issue but addressed a more trivialtask such as correcting a typo or adding a comment in java docs.
These types of commit negatively impact overall precision.

7 RELATED WORK
The most closely related work falls under the two areas of feature
location and tracing bug reports to code.
Feature location attempts to identify sections of source code re-
latedtoaspecificrequirementorissue.Severalauthorshavelooked
at static approaches based on information retrieval techniques. For
example, Antoniol et al. [ 1] used a probabilistic approach to re-
trieve trace links between code and documentation. Hayes et al.
used the Vector Space Model (VSM) algorithm in conjunction with
athesaurustoestablishtracelinks[ 29].OtherstudiesappliedLa-
tent Semantic Indexing [ 12,54], Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
[3,13], or recurrent neural networks [ 23] to integrate semantics or
contextinwhichvarioustermsareused.Otherresearchershave
combinedresultsofindividualalgorithms[ 13,19,37],appliedAI
swarm techniques [ 62] and combined heuristic rules with trace
retrievaltechniques[ 10,24,60].Ourapproachleveragesinforma-
tionretrievaltocomputesimilaritybetweenvarioustypesofissues,
commit messages, and code. We investigated the use of LSI but
rejected it for a pragmatic reason that it had a long execution time,
andfurther,thatpriorstudieshavenotshownittooutperformVSM.
Ultimately we adopted a VSM-based approach, that outperformed
basic VSM and integrated natural language concepts.
Researchers have also integrated structural analysis of the code
tosupportfeaturelocation[ 45,46,49].Wedidnotincludethisin
our current classifier; however,we will consider itin future work.
Structural analysis may be especially helpful for finding additional
classesthatarerelatedtoanissueorbug.Inlesscloselyrelatedwork,
researchers investigated the use of dynamic analysis for feature
location[ 33–35].Furthermore,Eisenbarthetal.,[ 15]presenteda
technique combining dynamic and static analyses to rapidly focus
on the system’s parts that relate to a specific set of features.
Our work focuses not only on feature requests (i.e. improve-
ments), but also tracing bugs to code. Canfora et al. used infor-
mation retrieval techniques to identify files that were created or
changed,inresponsetoaBugzillaticket[ 6].Theyidentifiedfiles
changedin responseto similarbug reportsin thepast, usingstan-
dardinformationretrievaltechniques.Kimetal.predictedwhich
sourcecode fileswouldchangeas aresultof bug-fixrequests[31]
using Mozilla FireFox and Core code repositories as their corpusin tandem with the public Bugzilla database. They first trained a
classifier to recognize ‘usable’ versus ‘non-usable’ bug reports, and
then using the bugs classified as usable, trained a second classifier
to identify impacted classes. Our approach differs from their work
inthatourgoalistogeneratelinksdirectlyfromcommitstoissuessothatwecanmakedirectrecommendationstousersiftheyforget
to taga commit. Ourgoal is thereforeto create trace links as the
commitsaremade sothatdeveloperscan acceptorrejectthemin
order to create a set of trusted links. In [ 57], the authors proposed
two heuristics, Loners and Phantoms, to infer trace links between
commits and issues. We incorporate their concepts as one attribute
in our classifier.
8 THREATS TO VALIDITY
There are several potential threats to the validity of our study.
Internal Validity Wesplittheavailabledatasetforeachproject
into 80–20% of the issues retaining the temporal ordering of theproject.Choosinganothersplitpointmayproducedifferenteval-uationresults.Weconsideredexplicitlyonly“resolved”bugsand
improvements, assuming that all required source code modifica-
tionshadalreadytakenplace.Itmaybepossiblethattheprocessof
resolving anissue does notmanifest incommits. We triedto miti-
gate this, by focusing on commits marked as “Fixed” or “Resolved”;
however,somecommitsmightintentionallynotaddressanissue
due to their triviality. This was evidenced in our final experiment,
whereourclassifierrecommendedlinkseventhoughnolinksex-
isted. Furthermore, our study focused on improvements and bugs,
asthesewerethepredominanttypesofinstancesinourprojects;
however, we observed comparable commit link patterns for other
issues types, suggesting that our approach would generalize.ExternalValidity
Ourstudyfocusedsolelyonopen-sourceprojects.
A potential threat to external validity arises when we want to gen-
eralize our findings to a wider set of project, including commercial
development.Wehaveobservedevidenceofsimilartaggingprac-
tices in our own industrial collaborations, and therefore expectsimilar results. However internal company regularities might in-
fluencecommitpractices,andthustheoverallapplicabilityofour
approach is anopen question. Another threat that mightlimit the
generalizabilityofourresultsistheuseofonlyonecombinationofissue tracking system (Jira) and version control system (Git). Other
tools and platforms might encourage and/or provide different link-
ing behavior.
9 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we studied the interlinking of commits and issues in
opensourcedevelopmentprojects.Ananalysisofsixlargeprojectsshowedthatonaverageonly60%ofthecommitsarelinkedtoissues.
This incomplete linkage fundamentally limits the establishment of
project-wide traceability. To overcome this problem, we propose
an approach that trains a classifier to recommend links at the time
commits are made and also augments an existing set of commits
and issues with automatically identified links. We identified struc-
tural,temporal,stakeholder-relatedandtextualsimilarityfactors
as relevant information for automating this task and derived 18
attributestoquantifytherelationbetweencommit–issuepairs.ARandomForestclassifierperformedbestonthetrainedattributes.
We evaluated this trained model through conducting four different
experiments.Twoexperimentsstudied classificationperformance
for recommending links upon a new commit as well as for auto-matically augmenting missing links. We found that the classifier
yielded on average 96% recall in a short list of three recommenda-
tions and could on average automatically augment every secondlink correctly with an average error of 4%. Finally, we manually
constructedasmallanswersetoflinksfromthesetofpreviously
unlinked commits and showed that the classifier returned high
recall results averaging 91.6% and precision of 17.3%.
