Cantheexecutionofsoftwarebeperturbedwithoutbreakingthe
correctness of the output? In this paper, we devise a protocol to
answer this question from a novel perspective. In an experimental
study,weobservethatmanyperturbationsdonotbreakthecorrect-
nessintensubjectprograms.Wecallthisphenomenon“correctness
attraction”. The uniqueness of this protocol is that it considers a
systematic exploration of the perturbation space as well as perfect
oraclestodeterminethecorrectnessoftheoutput.Tothisextent,
our findings on the stability of software under execution perturba-
tionshavealevelofvalidity thathasneverbeenreportedbeforein
thescarcerelatedwork.Aqualitativemanualanalysisenablesus
to set up the first taxonomy ever of the reasons behind correctness

Our contributions are:

of the perturbation space for a given set of inputs.
•A large scale set of perturbability experiments over ten pro-
grams, and two perturbation models, resulting in 2917701
perturbed executions. We observe that 67.76% of perturbed
executions yield a fully correct output. This means that cor-
