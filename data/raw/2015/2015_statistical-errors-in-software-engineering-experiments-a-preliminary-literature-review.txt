where experiments are confined to the validation section. The ori-
ginoftheerrorscanbetracedbackto:a)researchersnothaving

that SE research suffers from the same statistical problems as other
experimentaldisciplines.However,theSEcommunityappearsto

1 INTRODUCTION
Experimentationmakesextensiveuseofstatistics.Severalstudies
warn about the existence of scientific articles using inappropri-
atestatisticalprocedures[ 5,32,62].Thishappenseveninmature
disciplines, such as the health sciences [6].
In turn, there are very few papers studying statistical errors
insoftwareengineering(SE)articles.Therearepapersdiscussing
statistical power [ 23], heterogeneity in meta-analysis [ 52], and the
relative strengths and weaknesses of cross-over designs [ 41,81]
in SE. This stands in contrast to other disciplines where papers
warningaboutproblemsinsimplestatisticalconceptssuchashy-
pothesis statement [ 16,58], interpretation of p-values [ 62], sample
size calculation [ 2,25], significance levels [ 58], etc., are quite com-
mon.
We aim to assess the prevalence of these problems in the SE
literature. We have compiled the most common statistical errors in
experimental disciplines and surveyed empirical papers published
in ICSE between 2006 and 2015, to check whether or not these
papers are subject to the compiled errors. Our results suggest that
SE experiments have the same weaknesses as in other sciences. SE
researchersdonotuserelativelysimpleconceptslikehypothesis
statement, sample size estimation, inference, and post-hoc testing
correctly. These problems seem to be related to poor statistical
training, and the use of exploratory research.
Our contributions confirm the shortcomings in experimental
SEresearchandidentifytheirorigin.Inouropinion,theSEcom-
munity should improve researchers’ statistical training and, more
importantly,establishmechanisms(e.g.,qualityassessmenttools,
reporting guidelines) to identify and correct statistical problems in
SE experiments before they are published.
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 provides
background on the topic of statistical errors in science and SE.
Section 3 presents a short literature review identifying severalstatistical errors. We screen articles reporting experiments for a
subset of the above errors in Section 4. The origin of the identified

errors is evaluated in Section 5. Section 6 offers a critical appraisal
of this. Finally, the conclusions are reported in Section 7.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Statistical Errors in Experimental
Disciplines
Scientificandengineeringresearchersapplystatisticaltechniques
to analyze and interpret many of their research results. Hence, sta-
tisticaltechniqueshaveexperiencedanincreaseinuse,particularly
inmedicine[ 2,63,83],psychology[ 5],education[ 21],andsocial
science [25, 58].
There is a relatively large collection of publications that provide
information about the existence of statistical problems in virtually
alldisciplines. Notall publicationsare recent;theyhave beenavail-
ablesincethewidespreadadoptionofexperimentalresearchintheir
respectiveareas.Thereportedproblemshaveabroadscope[ 51],
including: the definition of statistical hypotheses [ 16,58], interpre-
tation of p-values [ 62], sample size calculation [ 2,25], significance
levels [58], and confidence intervals [16], and so on.
Papersaboutstatisticalshortcomingsinother disciplineshave
derivedtheirresultsfromsometypeofliteraturereviewofprimary
studiesfromoneormorespecializedjournals.Theirconclusions
are surprising and worrying since they report high error rates:
•Welch[83]studied145articlesfromoneofthemostrenowned
medical journals, the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gy-
necology,andfoundthat52.6%ofthearticlescontainedin-
adequate or incomplete statistical descriptions.
•Bakker [5] evaluated 218 articles from high and low impact
psychologyjournals.Theauthorreportedthatlowimpact
journalsexhibitstatisticalinconsistenciesmorefrequently
than high impact journals. Bakker determined that about
15%ofallthepapersfrombothhighandlowimpactjournals
have at least one incorrect statistical conclusion.
•Ercanetal.[ 25]evaluated164and145articulesinpsychiatry
andobstetrics,respectively.Ofthepsychiatricandobstetrics
publications, 40% and 19%, respectively, contained mistakes
regarding: sampling, sample sizecalculation, and contradic-
tory interpretations of inferential tests.
•Kilkenny et al. [ 39] assessed the experimental design of 271
papers published in MedlineandEMBASE from 2003 to 2005.
More than 60% of the papers are subject to biases during
theassemblyofthestudycohort,weakstatisticalanalysis,
missing information, etc.
The origin ofthe statistical errors can betraced back to several
causes:
•AccordingtoCastroetal.[ 75],theanalysisandinterpreta-
tionofempiricalresultsinanyscientificdisciplinedepend
primarily on how well researchers understand inferential
statistics. Theauthors suggestedthat researchersin theed-
ucation community, especially PhD students, are prone to
misconceptions,particularlywhentheyareusingabstract
statisticalconcepts,suchasconfidenceintervals,sampling
distributionswithsmallnumbers,samplingvariability,dif-
ferent types of distributions, and hypothesis tests.•Cohen et al. [ 19] conducted an empirical study with degree
students.Theyfoundthatstudentslackstatisticalknowledge,
whichleadstothemisinterpretationofstatisticalconcepts
and biased judgements.
•Brewer[12]evaluated18statisticalhandbooksbyrenowned
publishers, e.g., Academic Press, Addison-Wesley, McGraw-
Hill, Prentice-Hall, John Wiley , etc. These books contained
inaccurate statements in topics such as sampling distribu-
tions, hypothesis testing, and confidence levels.
2.2 Statistical Errors in SE
The SE community apparently has limited awareness of the ex-
istence and impact of statistical shortcomings in its publications.
WhenwesearchedforSEpapersrelatedtostatisticalproblems,the
only results were: Dybå et al.’s paper regarding statistical power
[23],Miller’spaperonmeta-analysis[ 52],andtwopapersbyKitchen-
ham [41] and Vegas et al. [ 81] that focused on within-subject de-
signs.
Several other papers discuss specific statistical issues. For in-
stance, Kitchenham introduced robust statistical methods [ 42],
while Arcuri and Briand discussed statistical tests for the assess-
ment of randomized algorithms [ 4]. These papers do not assess
theweaknessesincurrentresearch.Theysuggestopportunitiesfor
improvement in the toolset that SE researchers currently use.
There is a manifest difference between SE and other experimen-
tal disciplines regarding statistical errors. In medicine and other
sciences,statisticalproblemsareroutinelyidentifiedinpublications;
this issue is almost completely overlooked in SE.
Otherdisciplineshavenotaddressedstatisticaldefectsandmethod-
ological problems until relatively late on. For instance, while thefirst formal randomized clinical trial in medicine was conductedin the 1940s [
8], the first publication about statistical defects in
this field that we are aware of was published in the 1970s [ 30].
Given thatSE isonly justadopting experimental methodsand the
associated statistical techniques, its failure to pay attention to the
assessment of statistical issues should come as no surprise.
Thispaperreportsanexploratorystudyaimingtoanswerthe
following research questions:
RQ1: What are the most common problems associ-
ated with the use of experimental procedures in exper-imental disciplines?
RQ2: What is the rate of statistical errors in SE re-
search?
3 STATISTICAL ERRORS IN EXPERIMENTAL
DISCIPLINES
3.1 Review Strategy
ToanswerRQ1,wereviewedseveralspecializedbookspublished
onthetopic,suchasGoodetal.[ 29],Vickers[ 82],andHuck[ 34].
Thesebooksprovideagoodstartingpointforourexploratorystudy
because they are not related to any specific discipline (althoughthere is some bias toward the health sciences) and they focus on
serious errors often inspired by real research.

3.2 Collected Data
Tworesearchers(O.DiesteandR.P.Reyes)reviewedtheabovethree
books.Theyfound93textsectionsclearlypointingtosometypeof
error that canbe frequently found inthe literature. Discrepancies
were solved by consensus. The complete listing of paragraphs is
available at https://goo.gl/8zb9LU, including links to the reference
books and related literature.
3.3 Analysis Method
We applied thematic synthesis to classify the statistical errors. We
applied the guidelines by Creswell [ 21] and Cruzes et al. [ 22]t o
avoidbiasandachievemethodologicalrigorinthesynthesisand
interpretation of results [ 11]. The analysis consisted of two stages:
coding and theme definition. It was conducted by the same two
researchers than collected the data.
During the coding stage, both researchers independently as-
signed low-level codes to each text section, which were later re-
viewed and harmonized. We created 93 different codes. During the
themedefinitionstage,codesweregroupedtogetherbymeansof
higher-level codes. This procedure was aligned with our purposes
since the high-level themesrepresenterror-prone areas. Bothre-
searchersworkedcollaboratively.Theyorganizedthelow-levelcon-
cepts into high-level themes according to a directed graph, shown
inFig.1.Themesandconnectionsbetweenthemesandconcepts
are available at https://goo.gl/8zb9LU.
Nodes represent categories of statistical errors. Categories be-
comeprogressivelymoreabstractasthetreeistraversedfromright
to left. For instance, the node study design (Fig. 1, bottom left) is
connected to the nodes assignment andsampling. This means that
thehigh-levelcategory studydesign containstwotypesoferrors:
assignment andsampling errors. Likewise, assignment splits into
furtherlower-levelerrortypes,suchas matching, randomization,
etc. Notice that Fig. 1 shows only one subset of the error types that
we have identified to keep the graph within page limits. The full
graph is available at https://goo.gl/qovXQw.
Theremaybemultipleconnectionsbetweencodesandhigh-level
themes and between one high-level theme and another because
theyarementionedinseveralbooks,ormorethanonceinthesame
book in different contexts. For instance, randomization is discussed
twice in terms of the representativeness of the random samples:
(item#40) Misconception:Ifatrulyrandomprocessis
used to select a sample from a population, the resulting
sample willturn outto bejust likethe population, but
smaller.[34, pp. 123]
(item#41) Misconception:Asampleofindividualsdrawn
fromalarger,finitegroupofpeopledeservestobecalled
arandomsamplesolongas(1)everyoneinthelarger
group has an equal chance of receiving an invitation to
participateinthestudyand(2)randomreplacements
arefoundforanyoftheinitialinviteeswhodeclineto
be involved. [34, pp. 127]
andonceagainwithregardtotheequivalenceofexperimental
groups formed by random assignment:
(item#90) Theideabehindrandomizationistomake
thegroupsassimilaraspossible[...].Baselinedifferencesat the beginning of the trial, such as in age o gender,
are due to chance. [...] giving a p-value for baseline
differencebetween groupscreated byrandomizationis
testinganullhypothesisthatweknowtobetrue. [82,
pp. 100]
These repeated associations are an indication of relevance, and
thus the arcs connecting the corresponding nodes have been made
proportionally wider. The number next to the arc indicates the
numberoftimesthattheconnectionappearsintherawdata.Dotted
lines represent connections that appear just once.
3.4 Review Results
Statistical errors can be classified in to three groups: a) experimen-
tation,b)meta-analysis,andc)prediction.Mosterrorsarerelatedto
experimentation.Nevertheless,itisnoticeablethatmeta-analysis
appears three times in connection with subgroup analysis and the
combinationofstudieswithdifferentdesigns.Predictionappears
just once, with respect to with linear modeling. In what follows,
we focus on problems associated exclusively with experiments.
Analysisistheexperimentationfacetmostoftenmentionedin
connection with statistical errors. In the three reviewed books,analysis errors appear 63 times. There are two main sources ofproblems with analysis: the application of inferential techniques
and the interpretation of results:
•The inferential techniques most often used during experi-
mentaldataanalysisareclassicaltests,suchast-tests,and
theirrelatedconcepts,suchasp-valuesandtails.Researchers
often make wrong assumptions about the tests (e.g., robust-
nessoft-test),andtheyselecttestsincircumstancesinwhichthey cannot be applied (e.g., ordered alternative hypotheses)
or are sub-optimal (e.g., low power tests). All common tests,
includingt-tests,correlations,andANOVA,arementioned
in this context.
•Anotherfrequentlymentionedinferentialtechniqueislin-
earmodeling;multiplelinearregressionisthebestknown
exampleoflinearmodeling.Themostfrequentlymentioned
problemistherationalebehindthedefinitionofthelinear
model. Other issues, such as the violation of assumptions
and usage beyond limits (e.g., outside the linear phase), are
also reported.
•Manysupposedlybasicconcepts,suchasconfidenceinter-
vals, statistical significance, or p-valuesare frequently mis-
interpreted.
Studydesignissecondtoanalysis.Thisconceptincludesmethod-
ologicalissuesconnectedtothemanagementofexperimentalunits,
such as sampling and assignment. In both cases, the sources of the
problemsareinappropriateormissingrandomizationandsample

Reporting is another troublesome issue, which is mentioned the
samenumberoftimes(ten)asstudydesign.Therearemanysources
of reporting defects (e.g., overlooking experimental incidents or
multipletesting),althoughtheabsenceofdescriptivestatistics(e.g.,
means) is emphasized (tree times) in the reviewed books.
The last prominent issue is goal definition. Researchers often
do notstate statisticalhypotheses. Failureto explicitlydefine null
hypotheses appears three different times in Fig. 1.

4 STATISTICAL ERRORS IN ICSE
EXPERIMENTS
The aim of RQ2 is to find out the rate of statistical errors in SE
research. To answer RQ2, we evaluated the experiments published
in ICSE over 10 years (2006-2015). ICSE is SE’s flagship conference.
Ourevaluationshouldidentifytherateofcommonstatisticalerrors
inthebestSEresearch;thesituationoflowerqualitySEresearch
is likely to be worse.
4.1 Evaluation Instrument
Thecomplete listof statisticalerrors thatwe have compiled con-
tains almost 100 items. Since statistical errors are ubiquitous in the
generalresearchliterature,itishighlylikelythatseveralofthe ∼
100 problem typeswould appear in virtually any SEpaper as well.
Therefore,anexhaustivereviewofSEexperimentswoulddrawa
too pessimistic picture of our field.
Wehavefocusedonrecurrenttypesoferrors(denotedbywidear-
rowsinFig.1.Forinstance,nullhypothesis-relatedproblemsareref-
erenced multiple times in Fig. 1, as well as test assumptions or cen-
tralmeasures.Wehaveselectedthemosterror-pronestatisticalcon-
cepts,developedappropriatequestions,andcreatedthe10-questionchecklist shown in Table 1. All these questions can be easily traced
back to Fig. 1 (or the online version at https://goo.gl/qovXQw).
Further clarification is required at this point:
•Q1.1 and Q1.2 may look outdated due to the increasingcriticisms of the null-hypothesis and significance testing
(NHST), and the recommendations to adopt other statistical
approaches such as confidence intervals and effect size in-dices [
10,71,77]. However, SE research has not yet taken
up these recommendations. For instance, only four out of
21experimentspublishedinICSEfrom2006to2015report
anymeasureofeffectsize,andtwooutof21refertoconfi-
dence intervals. Nowadays, NHST is still the main statistical
approach used in SE.
•Q4 (Have subjects been randomly assigned to treatments? )
may not be applicable to some types of experiments, e.g.,
when two defect prediction algorithms are applied to the
same code, that is, matched pairs or similar designs. In such
cases, the question is answered as N/A. A similar strategy is
appliedforanyquestionthatdoesnotmakesenseforagivenexperiment,e.g.,Q5(Havethetestassumptions(i.e.,normality
andheteroskedasticity)beencheckedor,atleast,discussed? )
when an experiment does not use statistical tests.
•Testassumptionsvaryfromtesttotest.Inmanycases,ref-
erence books state incomplete or even questionable assump-
tions.Thus, inQ5 (Havethe testassumptions (i.e.,normality
andheteroskedasticity)beencheckedor,atleast,discussed? ),
wewillpayattentiononlytothemostusualconditions(nor-
mality and heteroskedasticity) that have to be examined
before applying virtually any parametric test.
•Q7(Havetheanalysisresultsbeeninterpretedwithreferenceto
applicable statistical concepts, such as p-values, confidence in-
tervals,andpower? )wouldappeartobearathercrucialques-
tion.Fig.1showsthatthenode interpretation isconnected
bywidearcswithnodesrepresentingrelativelysimplesta-
tisticalconcepts,suchaspower,confidenceinterval,p-value,and so on. However, we doubt that we can answer this ques-tionobjectively.Whileauthorstypicallydiscusstheirresults
atlength, theymaysimplify oromit somestatisticalissues
required to clearly transmit their message to readers. Thus,
we face the risk of making mistakes, e.g., evaluating Q7 neg-
atively due to incomplete reporting. We decided to skip this
question (and there is a line through it in Table 1).
•MultipletestingdoesnotappeartobeakeyissueinFig.1.
However, it was cited three times as a source of problems
duringbothanalysisandreporting;notethattherearethreeincomingarcsforthisnodeinFig.1.ThisjustifiesQ9(Ismul-tipletesting,e.g.Bonferronicorrection,reportedandaccounted
for?).
•Q10(Aredescriptivestatistics,suchasmeansandcounts,re-
ported?) is important for both analysis and reporting. We
considerthisissueinthecontextofreportingonly,soasnot
to inflate the number of defects found.

2006to2015.However,thedecisionsoonprovedtobequestionable.
We conducted a pilot study on ICSE 2012 edition to check the
feasibilityofourstudy.Weimmediatelyrealizedthatthenumber
of fully-fledged experiments was quite low: we found only four

identified 16 experiments as evaluations (18.4% of the total number
of papers in ICSE 2012).
The question was whether the survey should be extended to
experimentsasevaluations,orrestrictedtostandaloneexperiments.
Experiments as evaluations often apply an experimental methodol-
ogy,butaretypicallyonlyonetothreepageslong.Thecompressed
reporting format may lead to writing practices that may be mis-conceived as statistical errors by reviewers. On the other hand,

We decided to evaluate both types of studies separately. In a
firststage,wesearchedforallstandaloneexperimentspublished
in ICSE from 2006 to 2015. We found 21 a total of papers. We then
collected a similar number1of experiments as evaluations to avoid
over-representation.
4.3 Study selection
Two researchers (O. Dieste, E. R. Fonseca, and R. P. Reyes) worked
separately to screen the tables of contents of the ICSE 2006-2015
Technical Tracks. They reviewed the title and abstract for any
indication that the paper reported an experiment. If in doubt, they
examined the full text in search of further evidence of at least two
treatmentsbeing compared,thatis,the minimumconditionto be
met by any experiment.
The total number of papers and the papers pre-selected after
screeningareshowninTable2.Thepre-selectionagreementwas
calculatedusingFleiss’ κ,asrecommendedbyK.L.Gwet[ 31,pp .
52].κ=0.45, typically considered as moderate [27]. This implies
that we may have failed to identify some experiments. Note that it
isnotstraightforwardtoidentifyexperimentsusingmetadata,such
as titles and abstracts, due to missing methodological descriptors.
Three researchers (O. Dieste, E. R. Fonseca, and R. P. Reyes)
individually reviewedthe pre-selectedpapers andclassified them
into theexperiment andnon-experiment categories. Disagreement
was resolved by consensus. A total of21 papers were classified as
standaloneexperiments.Thisrepresents2.7%ofthetotalnumber
of papers published in ICSE. Previous research has already pointed

papers in the sample that are affected by the error indicated by
the corresponding question, i.e., the prevalence of the statistical
error rate. Q1 was split into two parts to differentiate the problems
related to the null (Q1.1) and the alternative (Q1.2) hypotheses.

responses is much higher. There appear to be reasons for this:

design.Random assignment(Q4)istypically notapplicable
in this case, e.g., two different bug prediction algorithms are
applied to the same code [78, 85].
(2)Alargenumberofstudies,e.g.,[ 46,90],conducttheanalysis
using descriptive statistics only. Descriptive statistics do not
have assumptions to check (Q5). When inferential statistics
are not used, Q6-9 (linear modelling, power, and post-hoc
testing) are not applicable either.
We ran a CHAID tree2classification to confirm the above ob-
servations.AN/AvalueinQ4generatesasubsetcontaining80%
of all the experiments as evaluations studies ( χ2=29.7,df=
2,p−value<0.001). The classification tree confirms that non-
random assignment due to matching is a differential characteristic
of the experiments as evaluations.
Focusingontheerrorrate,wefoundthatbothstandaloneexper-
iments and experiments as evaluations yield similar values3when
examinedusing Question×StudyType contingencytables,withthe
exceptionofQ1.1( χ2=15.4,df=1,p−value<0.001)andQ1.2
(χ2=20.7,df=1,p−value<0.001). In both cases, standalone
experiments define null hypotheses (Q1.1) often and alternative
hypotheses(Q1.2)five(66.7%vs.13.3%)andeighttimes(57.1%vs.
6.7%), respectively, more often than experiments as evaluations.
Both types of studies do not show statistically significant dif-
ferences for theremaining questions, although some may befalse
negatives. There are a large number of N/As for several questions,
which reduces the amount of usable data, thus lowering the power
of the tests. However, the low p-values for both the χ2and the
Fisher’sexact testsuggest thatQ3,Q4, Q5,Q10could achievesta-
tistical significance with larger samples. In all cases, standalone
experimentsperform randomselection(Q34,random assignment
(Q4), assumption checking (Q5) and reporting of descriptive statis-
tics (Q10) more frequently than experiments as evaluations. Albeit
not as large as in the case of Q1.1 and Q1.2, differences are still
substantial, e.g., 61.9% vs. 13.3% for Q5.
We also find from Table 4 that:
•The required sample size (Q2) has been calculated in just
one study. The definition of the linear model (Q6) has been
considered in just two cases.
•Multiple testing(Q9) is a pervasive problem in SEresearch.
Most studies fail to report or correct for multiple testing
using adequate, e.g., Bonferroni or False Discovery Rate,
methods.

asevaluations)andthepredictorswerethequestionsQ1-10.WeusedtheSPSSdefault
CHAID parameters, with the exception of the parent and child nodes, which were set
to 10 and 5 cases, respectively, due to the small number of cases.

Yes/Novaluesof9.5%and71.4%forstandaloneexperiments,andof3.3%and26.7%for

are rather similar.
4Notice that Q3 yields κ=0.09andκ=0.39for standalone experiments and
experiments as evaluations, respectively. Random sampling is a controversial issue in
SE. Results for Q3 should be viewed with caution.•There isa high rate ofrandom selection (Q3).Nevertheless,
thisproblemisnoteasytosolveinhumanexperimentsbe-
cause it is troublesome to assemble cohorts. In turn, randomselectioncouldbeeffectivelyappliedinnon-humanresearch,
e.g., when data is extracted from code repositories.
This survey shows that common statistical errors that occur in
other sciences happen in SE as well. We have been able to survey a
very limited number of experimental papers in one SE conference.
However, both the type and number of problems found suggest
that SE is facing the same challenges as in other sciences.
5 DISCUSSION
The most likely explanation for the occurrence of the statistical
errorsassociatedwithQ1-10istherecentadoptionofexperimental
methods in SE. Many researchers have not taken formal courses
onexperimentalmethodologyandinferentialstatisticsaspartof
theirpostgraduatetraining.Self-educationtendstoleadtomajor
differences among individuals. If these assumptions were true, two
scenarios would be logical consequences:
(1)The studies conducted by skilled researchers would be ofhigher quality (where quality means error freeness, e.g.,
Yes answers
All answers) than experiments conducted by less skilled re-
searchers. We could thus expect the quality values spread torange0%to100%.Aserrorsareindependent,qualityfollows
a normal distribution5.
(2)Any statistical concepts closely related to practice, e.g., ran-
dom assignment (Q4), assumption checking (Q5), and re-porting (Q10), would have a lower error probability than
theoretical notions, e.g., hypotheses definition (Q1), sample
sizecalculation(Q2),randomselection(Q3),linearmodeling
(Q6), post-hocpower calculation (Q8), andpost-hoc testing
(Q9).
In order to check Scenario 1 above, Fig. 2 shows the histograms
for both types of studies. In the case of standalone experiments
(Fig. 2a), the histogram matches the assumption: the quality scores
rangeacrossthe0%to100%interval,andthedistributionisnormal
(Shapiro−Wilk =.947,df=21,p−value =.300).Experimentsas
evaluations(Fig.2b)paintaratherdifferentpicture.Thedistributionisskewedtotheleft(
skewness =1.02),indicatingthatpaperquality
isconcentratedaroundthelowscores.Thisisaclearlynon-normal
distribution ( Shapiro−Wilk =.863,df=30,p−value =.001).
Theaboveanalysissuggeststhatthecausesbehindthestatistical
errorsdifferdependingonthestudytype.Inthecaseofstandalone
experiments, poor statistical training may explain the observed
errors.
In the case of experiments as evaluations, training alone cannot
explain the data. In our opinion, the low scores point to the sec-ondary role of statistics and experimental methodology in these
papers.Notonlydoexperimentsasevaluationstakeuparelatively

5Statistical errors are probably dependent. When a researcher learns a statistical topic,
e.g., sample size calculation, this knowledge is likely to lead to the avoidance of other
errors, e.g., post-hoc power calculation. Ho wever, the errors underlying Q1-10 are too
wide-ranging to appear strongly clustered in papers.

in providing a convincing case for their proposals).
To check the Scenario 2 above, Table 5 contains the odds of

the theoretical concepts, odds are smaller than for experiments
as evaluations, with the only exception of Q9. This is consistent
withthehighererrorrateoftheexperimentsasevaluationsstud-
ies. However, Q1.1 and Q1.2 odds are much smaller (0.5 and 0.8,
respectively) and comparable to the odds that appear in the group
of practical concepts.
Theaboveanalysisconfirmsthatpoortrainingisthemostlikely
explanation for the presence of statistical errors in experiments. In
thecaseofexperimentsasevaluationsstudies,amorecasualusage
of statistics increases the error rate, but the final outcome is the
same.
One anomaly in Table 5 is the large odd that Q9 exhibits for
standalone experiments. It has the same value as in experimentsas evaluations. This value is even less plausible given the small
odds for Q1.1 and Q1.2: any researcher with a good knowledge
of statistical hypotheses should be aware of the impact of multi-

totestingthestatisticalhypotheses,standaloneexperimentsalso

of uncorrectedpost-hoc tests). Exploratoryresearch is acommon
feature of many SE experiments, e.g., [7, 86].
Post-hoc testing is associated to p-hacking, that is, the accep-
tance of outcomes that fit expectations [ 55]. p-hacking leads to
publication bias. Jørgensen et al. [ 38] evaluated the existence of
publication bias in SE publications following Ioannidis’ critical per-
spectiveformedicine[ 35].Bothpaperscametoasimilarconclusion:

authors may perform correctly simply by not conducting a power analysis. Their
inclusion would not have challenged our conclusions.the likelihood of publication bias is rather high. More importantly
forourpurposes,bothpapersreportthattheunderlyingreasons
for publication bias are statistical, for example, multiple inference
testsandapreferenceforstatisticallysignificancetesting.Ourdata

6 THREATS TO VALIDITY
Thisstudy appliedtworesearch protocols:aliterature reviewand
apapersurvey.Thetwoprotocolsareverysimilar.Theyhaveto
meet a number of criteria concerning the relevance of the primary
studies with respect to the research questions and the consistency
across studies. Table 6 shows an assessment according to the ap-
praisalcriteriasuggestedbyThompsonetal.[ 80]7.Onthewhole,
the results of the evaluation were positive. We can be relatively
confidentthattheliteraturereviewandthesurveyresultsaretrust-
worthy.However,theyare incompleteduetothelimitednumberof

inthestudy.Theexternalvalidityofthisresearchisthuslimited.

levelthemes.Alldecisionsweremadebyatleasttworesearchers.
These precautions increased the validity of the literature review.
With regard to the paper survey, we have taken reasonable pre-
cautionstoavoidbiases.Threeresearchersparticipatedinthepaper
selection and evaluation. All decisions were recorded and made
publicforreview.Agreementlevels(usingFleiss’ κ)werecalculated
and disclosed.
However,theprecautionstakendidnotmeanthatweperformed
a correct assessment in all cases. The selection process yielded a
low Fleiss κvalue, which suggests that we may have skipped some
experimentsand,thus,potentiallybiasedtheresults.Evenso,there
isnoquestionabouttherebeingstatisticalerrorsinSE,although
their occurrence rates or percentages may vary.
We do not claim that the reported rates are representative of
alltypesofSEresearch.Actually,theratesreportedinthispaper
probablyrepresentthebestpracticeinSEresearch,withthepossible
exceptionsoftheESEMandEASEconferences,andmaybesome

is likely to increase.
Finally, we should point out that the results addressed in the

7 CONCLUSIONS
The results of this preliminary review suggest that SE is subject to
thesametypeofstatisticalerrorsasarefoundinotherscientificdis-
ciplines.Theseproblemsarenotcomplicatedorsophisticated.They
are surprisingly simple and include undefined hypotheses, miss-
ingsamplesizecalculations,randomization,andmultipletesting,
amongothers.Itisrathersurprisingthatthereisnoinformation
abouttheexistenceofsuchproblemsinSE.TheSEmethodological
literature has not widely addressed this topic; only some papers
[23,41,52,81] have scratched the surface. Researchers may not be
awareoftheexistenceofstatisticalerrors,andmuchlesssooftheir
prevalence and potential impact.
There are two reasons that appear to explain the presence of
statistical errors in SE research: a) the recent widespread adoption
ofexperimentationinSE,andb)thefrequentuseofexploratoryre-search.Inouropinion,therapidadoptionofexperimentalmethods
in SE research has forced researchers into statistical self-education.
Additionally, it is rather unlikely that SE research teams include
or have access to statistical consultants. As a result, errors tend
slip into designs and ultimately published papers. This situation
matchesothersciencesthathavealongexperimentaltradition,such
as medicine and ecology, which have only recently paid attention
to statistical errors.As empirical research in SE approaches a mature stage, there
will be a greater awareness about statistical errors and the need to
avoid them. However, it would be unwise for the SE community
sit back and wait for the day to come. Besides setting up formal
training courses at universities and professional societies (which is
nowafoot),theSEcommunityshallenforcegoodpractices,such
as reporting guidelines and quality standards, that have proved
tobe usefulin othersciences, e.g.,medicine[ 72],psychology [ 74]
andeducation[ 28].Furthermore,thesegoodpracticescanbeeasily
enforcedbyjournaleditorsandconferencePCchairsatrelatively
little cost and effort.
Exploratory research is another source of problems. From the
viewpoint of this research, exploratory research takes the form
of missing statistical hypotheses and the execution of multiple
uncorrectedtests.However,theseerrorsleadtopublicationbias,asalreadydetectedinSE[
38].Experimentpre-registrationisprobably
thebestwaytofightagainstpublicationbias[ 15],butitisnoteasy
tosetupandenforce.Tothebestofourknowledge,pre-registration

find out effective ways to combat publication bias in SE. In themeantime, the establishment of reporting guidelines and quality
standards may improve the situation.
